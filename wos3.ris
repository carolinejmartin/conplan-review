AB  - Prey depletion is a major threat to the conservation of large carnivore species globally. However, at the policy-relevant scale of protected areas, we know little about how the spatial distribution of prey depletion affects carnivore space use and population persistence. We developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model to investigate the effects of different human-induced prey depletion experiments on the globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris) in isolated protected areas-a situation that prevails throughout the tiger's range. Specifically, we generated 120 experiments that varied the spatial extent and intensity of prey depletion across a stylized (circle) landscape (1,000 km(2)) and Nepal's Chitwan National Park (1,239 km(2)). Experiments that created more spatially homogenous prey distributions (i.e., less prey removed per cell but over larger areas) resulted in larger tiger territories and smaller population sizes over time. Counterintuitively, we found that depleting prey along the edge of Chitwan National Park, while decreasing tiger numbers overall, also decreased female competition for those areas, leading to lower rates of female starvation. Overall our results suggest that subtle differences in the spatial distributions of prey densities created by various human activities, such as natural resource-use patterns, urban growth and infrastructure development, or conservation spatial zoning might have unintended, detrimental effects on carnivore populations. Our model is a useful planning tool as it incorporates information on animal behavioral ecology, resource spatial distribution, and the drivers of change to those resources, such as human activities.

AB  - The conservation field is experiencing a rapid increase in the amount, variety, and quality of spatial data that can help us understand species movement and landscape connectivity patterns. As interest grows in more dynamic representations of movement potential, modelers are often limited by the capacity of their analytic tools to handle these datasets. Technology developments in software and high-performance computing are rapidly emerging in many fields, but uptake within conservation may lag, as our tools or our choice of computing language can constrain our ability to keep pace. We recently updated Circuitscape, a widely used connectivity analysis tool developed by Brad McRae and Viral Shah, by implementing it in Julia, a high-performance computing language. In this initial re-code (Circuitscape 5.0) and later updates, we improved computational efficiency and parallelism, achieving major speed improvements, and enabling assessments across larger extents or with higher resolution data. Here, we reflect on the benefits to conservation of strengthening collaborations with computer scientists, and extract examples from a collection of 572 Circuitscape applications to illustrate how through a decade of repeated investment in the software, applications have been many, varied, and increasingly dynamic. Beyond empowering continued innovations in dynamic connectivity, we expect that faster run times will play an important role in facilitating coproduction of connectivity assessments with stakeholders, increasing the likelihood that connectivity science will be incorporated in land use decisions.

AB  - Of the 285 species of Carnivora 71 are threatened, while many of these species fulfill important ecological roles in their ecosystems as top or meso-predators. Population transition matrices make it possible to study how age-specific survival and fecundity affect population growth, extinction risks, and responses to management strategies. Here we review 38 matrix models from 35 studies on 27 Carnivora taxa, covering 11% of the threatened Carnivora species. We show that the elasticity patterns (i.e. distribution over fecundity, juvenile survival and adult survival) in Carnivora cover the same range in triangular elasticity plots as those of other mammal species, despite the specific place of Carnivora in the food chain. Furthermore, reproductive loop elasticity analysis shows that the studied species spread out evenly over a slow-fast continuum, but also quantifies the large variation in the duration of important life cycles and their contributions to population growth rate. These general elasticity patterns among species, and their correlation with simple life history characteristics like body mass, age of first reproduction and life span, enables the extrapolation of population dynamical properties to unstudied species. With several examples we discuss how this slow-fast continuum, and related patterns of variation in reproductive loop elasticity, can be used in the formulation of tentative management plans for threatened species that cannot wait for the results of thorough demographic studies. We argue, however, that such management programs should explicitly include a plan for learning about the key demographic rates and how these are affected by environmental drivers and threats.

AB  - Medicinal plants contribute substantially to the well-being of people in large parts of the world, providing traditional medicine and supporting livelihoods from trading plant parts, which is especially significant for women in low-income communities. However, the availability of wild medicinal plants is increasingly threatened; for example, the Natal Lily (Clivia miniata), which is one of the most widely traded plants in informal medicine markets in South Africa, lost over 40% of individuals over the last 90 years. Understanding the species' response to individual and multiple pressures is essential for prioritizing and planning conservation actions. To gain this understanding, we simulated the future range and abundance of C. miniata by coupling Species Distribution Models with a metapopulation model (RAMAS-GIS). We contrasted scenarios of climate change (RCP2.6 vs. RCP8.5), land cover change (intensification vs. expansion), and harvesting (only juveniles vs. all life-stages). All our scenarios pointed to continuing declines in suitable habitat and abundance by the 2050s. When acting independently, climate change, land cover change, and harvesting each reduced the projected abundance substantially, with land cover change causing the most pronounced declines. Harvesting individuals from all life stages affected the projected metapopulation size more negatively than extracting only juveniles. When the three pressures acted together, declines of suitable habitat and abundance accelerated but uncertainties were too large to identify whether pressures acted synergistically, additively, or antagonistically. Our results suggest that conservation should prioritize the protection of suitable habitat and ensure sustainable harvesting to support a viable metapopulation under realistic levels of climate change. Inadequate management of C. miniata populations in the wild will likely have negative consequences for the well-being of people relying on this ecosystem service, and we expect there may be comparable consequences relating to other medicinal plants in different parts of the world.

AB  - The causes of the current distribution of a warm temperate tree Myrsine seguinii population were studied from topographic, geographical, and historical perspectives, and future land management to conserve this species. The study site is the Tokyo University forest located in Chiba Prefecture, at the northern distribution limit of this species. Presence and absence of individuals was surveyed in 10 x 10 m plots along the census line, making a total of 9,697 plots. The current distribution was modeled by multivariate logistic regression using environmental variables determined based on 10-m mesh digital elevation model (elevation, slope, solar radiation, topographic wetness index, surface curvature), 1-km mesh climatic information, and current (2005) and historic (1900) land-use maps. It was clarified that the current distribution area coincides with a Pinus densiflora forest present by the end of the 19th-century Meiji era, where 88.6% of individuals of M. seguinii were found. Inland suitable areas show small patches distributed among the ridges and mountainsides facing south, decreasing as the average monthly minimum winter temperature decreases. Simulated scenarios showed that in the future the potential distribution area of the studied species would decrease in the case of a complete coverage of Cryptomeria or Chamaecyparis plantation, and the case of evergreen broadleaf forest coverage would be better than these plantations. The strong effect of past land use suggests vulnerability and difficulty in the rapid recovery of M. seguinii population from human disturbance.

AB  - Aim: Ecosystems face numerous well-documented threats from climate change. The well-being of people also is threatened by climate change, most prominently by reduced food security. Human adaptation to food scarcity, including shifting agricultural zones, will create new threats for natural ecosystems. We investigated how shifts in crop suitability because of climate change may overlap currently protected areas (PAs) and priority sites for PA expansion in South Africa. Predicting the locations of suitable climate conditions for crop growth will assist conservationists and decision-makers in planning for climate change.
   Location: South Africa.
   Methods: We modelled climatic suitability in 2055 for maize and wheat cultivation, two extensively planted, staple crops, and overlaid projected changes with PAs and PA expansion priorities.
   Results: Changes in winter climate could make an additional 2 million ha of land suitable for wheat cultivation, while changes in summer climate could expand maize suitability by up to 3.5 million ha. Conversely, 3 million ha of lands currently suitable for wheat production are predicted to become climatically unsuitable, along with 13 million ha for maize. At least 328 of 834 (39%) PAs are projected to be affected by altered wheat or maize suitability in their buffer zones.
   Main conclusions: Reduced crop suitability and food scarcity in subsistence areas may lead to the exploitation of PAs for food and fuel. However, if reduced crop suitability leads to agricultural abandonment, this may afford opportunities for ecological restoration. Expanded crop suitability in PA buffer zones could lead to additional isolation of PAs if portions of newly suitable land are converted to agriculture. These results suggest that altered crop suitability will be widespread throughout South Africa, including within and around lands identified as conservation priorities. Assessing how climate change will affect crop suitability near PAs is a first step towards proactively identifying potential conflicts between human adaptation and conservation planning.

AB  - The development and implementation of a population supplementation and restoration plan for any endangered species should involve an understanding of the species' habitat requirements prior to the release of any captive bred individuals. The freshwater pearl mussel, Margaritifera margaritifera, has undergone dramatic declines over the last century and is now globally endangered. In Northern Ireland, the release of captive bred individuals is being used to support wild populations and repatriate the species in areas where it once existed. We employed a combination of maximum entropy modelling (MAXENT) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to identify ecological parameters necessary to support wild populations using GIS-based landscape scale and ground-truthed habitat scale environmental parameters. The GIS-based landscape scale model suggested that mussel occurrence was associated with altitude and soil characteristics including the carbon, clay, sand, and silt content. Notably, mussels were associated with a relatively narrow band of variance indicating that M. margaritifera has a highly specific landscape niche. The ground-truthed habitat scale model suggested that mussel occurrence was associated with stable consolidated substrates, the extent of bankside trees, presence of indicative macrophyte species and fast flowing water. We propose a three phase conservation strategy for M. margaritifera identifying suitable areas within rivers that (i) have a high conservation value yet needing habitat restoration at a local level, (ii) sites for population supplementation of existing populations and (iii) sites for species reintroduction to rivers where the mussel historically occurred but is now locally extinct. A combined analytical approach including GIS-based landscape scale and ground-truthed habitat scale models provides a robust method by which suitable release sites can be identified for the population supplementation and restoration of an endangered species. Our results will be highly influential in the future management of M. margaritifera in Northern Ireland. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a harmful insect-borne plant pathogen that causes severe diseases to major agricultural crops and many forest, ornamental and uncultivated plants. The pathogen, native to the Americas, has recently been detected in Europe, where it causes huge agricultural losses. The effect of landscape composition on the distribution of the vectors of the bacterium in Europe remains little explored. The present study aims at identifying how landscape composition impacts the distribution of the spittlebugs Philaenus spumarius and Neophilaenus campestris, which can carry and transmit the pathogen to plants and are considered to be the main vectors of Xf in the Mediterranean region. During the period 2015-2018, we thoroughly sampled the distribution of both species in the southwest of Iberian Peninsula. We characterized landscape composition in the sampling area by computing landscape metrics and fitted multivariate analyses and species distribution models (SDMs) to investigate spittlebugs' response to climate and landscape structure. High densities of Mediterranean agro-forestry systems (named "dehesas" in Spanish), sclerophyllous vegetation and broad-leaved forests in the landscape, were positively associated with the presence of P. spumarius. Conversely, the high density of coniferous vegetation in the landscape was positively associated with the occurrence of N. campestris. For P. spumarius, SDMs accounting for ecologically relevant landscape descriptors yielded better predictive accuracy than models relying on climate only. These results highlight the importance of considering landscape information when modelling pests' distributions and provide practical information to design landscape-informed monitoring plans to prevent the spread of Xf in Europe.

AB  - Mountain ungulates around the world have been decimated to small, fragmented populations. Restoring these species often is limited by inadequate information on where suitable habitat is found, and which restoration measures would help to increase and link existing populations. We developed an approach to spatially target threat-specific restoration actions and demonstrate it for bezoar goats (Capra aegagrus) in the Caucasus. Using a large occurrence dataset, we identified suitable habitat patches and evaluate them in terms of connectivity, protection status, and competition with other mountain ungulates. We found extant bezoar goat populations to be highly isolated, yet with widespread areas of suitable, unoccupied habitat between them. Many unoccupied habitat patches were well-connected to extant populations, were at least partly protected, and have low potential for competition with otherCapraspecies. This signals substantial pressure on bezoar goats, likely due to poaching, which currently prevents natural recolonization. Our study shows how restoration planning is possible in the face of multiple threats and scarce data. For bezoar goats in the Caucasus, we pinpoint priority patches for specific restoration measures, including reintroductions and anti-poaching action. We highlight that many patches would benefit from multiple interventions and that transboundary restoration planning is needed, a situation likely similar for many mountain ungulates around the world.

AB  - Understanding where species occur and how difficult they are to detect during surveys is crucial for designing and evaluating monitoring programs, and has broader applications for conservation planning and management. In this study, we modelled occupancy and the effectiveness of six sampling methods at detecting vertebrates across the Top End of northern Australia. We fitted occupancy-detection models to 136 species (83 birds, 33 reptiles, 20 mammals) of 242 recorded during surveys of 333 sites in eight conservation reserves between 2011 and 2016. For modelled species, mean occupancy was highly variable: birds and reptiles ranged from 0.01-0.81 and 0.01-0.49, respectively, whereas mammal occupancy was lower, ranging from 0.02-0.30. Of the 11 environmental covariates considered as potential predictors of occupancy, topographic ruggedness, elevation, maximum temperature, and fire frequency were retained more readily in the top models. Using these models, we predicted species occupancy across the Top End of northern Australia (293,017 km(2)) and generated species richness maps for each species group. For mammals and reptiles, high richness was associated with rugged terrain, while bird richness was highest in coastal lowland woodlands. On average, detectability of diurnal birds was higher per day of surveys (0.33 +/- 0.09) compared with nocturnal birds per night of spotlighting (0.13 +/- 0.06). Detectability of reptiles was similar per day/night of pit trapping (0.30 +/- 0.09) as per night of spotlighting (0.29 +/- 0.11). On average, mammals were highly detectable using motion-sensor cameras for a week (0.36 +/- 0.06), with exception of smaller-bodied species. One night of Elliott trapping (0.20 +/- 0.06) and spotlighting (0.19 +/- 0.06) was more effective at detecting mammals than cage (0.08 +/- 0.03) and pit trapping (0.05 +/- 0.04). Our estimates of species occupancy and detectability will help inform decisions about how best to redesign a long-running vertebrate monitoring program in the Top End of northern Australia.

AB  - Modelling tree habitat suitability (HS) is a common practice to assess tree species distribution across a broad range of spatial scales. However, it is seldom used to test the extent that modelled HS-scores (probability of species occurrence) can represent on-the-ground measures of species-structural characteristics. In this study, we compare four parametric and non-parametric models generated with the R-package, sdm, to assess the potential for these models to estimate tree species distribution of balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] in naturally-growing forests across an extensive landscape. Central to this development are inventory plot data of species presence-absence and four abiotic factors linked to plant growth and distribution. The study's abiotic factors include: (1) photosynthetically active radiation; (2) growing degree-days; (3) relative extractable soil water content; and (4) near-surface wind speed, all expressed spatially at 30-m resolution. To gauge whether modelled HS can explain structural characteristics in balsam fir-dominated stands, field-based estimates of site index (SI) and cumulative aboveground biomass (ABG) were compared against independently-derived HS-scores. The results showed that: (i) random forest was the most successful at representing species distribution of balsam fir among the four methods considered; (ii) overall growing conditions for balsam fir was observed to be most favourable on north-facing slopes, particularly in the northwest part of the target landscape, where near-surface air temperatures are cooler, soils are moderately wetter, and wind speeds are lower; (iii) tree-based calculations of SI were partially characterised by patterns in modelled HS-scores, due to scale differences (i.e., from individual tree to 30-m grid cells) and an inadequate number of sample trees; and (iv) patterns of cumulative AGB were more accurately represented by species HS. Modelled HS-scores, as potential indicators of tree species habitat preference, AGB, and species distribution, can offer key ecological information essential to inform forest management and conservation planning at the landscape level.

AB  - Ecological responses of nocturnal predatory birds to forest cover and other geospatial predictors vary both geographically and taxonomically. Considerable knowledge gaps exist regarding the habitat associations of the Sri Lanka Frogmouth, a nocturnal bird restricted to Sri Lanka and the Indian Western Ghats. via a 20-year island-wide survey, we searched for frogmouths in Sri Lanka to determine their habitat associations at both local and landscape scales and developed a habitat suitability model (HSM) to predict both current and future distribution. We confirmed frogmouth presence in 18% of the surveyed sites across all major bioclimatic zones (wet, intermediate, dry, and arid) from lower elevations (11-767m), comprising a broad geographic range. Frogmouth presence was mostly limited to forests (90%) with a few sites in agricultural mosaics. Land protection, altitude and both local and landscape-scale forest cover, as well as forest-cover loss at both spatial scales, were strong predictors of frogmouth presence. According to our HSM, the southwestern lowlands and parts of the intermediate zone contained the most suitable areas for frogmouths despite their smaller extent. Although the dry and intermediate zones contained extensive habitats for frogmouth, these regions were relatively less suitable. The habitat associations and geographic range of this species in Sri Lanka differ from that seen in India through negative associations with altitude and absence from montane zones, absence from degraded or severely disturbed habitats and independence from proximity to waterways. The Sri Lanka Frogmouth is sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances, including historical forest losses. We recommend landscape-scale conservation planning that incorporates both primary and mature persistent secondary forests to ensure the protection of this unique iconic species.

AB  - Introduction: Biological invasions are a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystems, with current and potential impacts on public health and conservation. Procambarus clarkii is a decapod crustacean, native to the Southern United States and Northeastern Mexico, which may adapt to different environmental conditions due to its ecological plasticity. Objective: The existing fundamental ecological niche of Procambarus clarkii was characterized in order to predict areas with environmental suitability for the potential establishment of the species in South America and Colombia. Methods: We used models of calibrated ecological niches in the native area, elaborated with the Maxent algorithm, based on occurrence data extracted from GBIF and hydroclimatic variables of aquatic ecosystems at a resolution of 1 km(2). Results: The model indicated a wide geographic area for invasion potential in South America, predicting environmentally suitable areas for the presence and expansion towards Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Guyana, Surinam, Bolivia, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Chile. In Colombia, suitable areas predicted by the model are located mainly in the North and East of the country, spanning a diversity of ecosystems, such as tropical forests, basal forests, riparian forests and savannas. The species has a high possibility of expanding into low latitude distribution areas, occupying areas towards the Northern part of the Colombian Caribbean region, in the departments of Magdalena, Cesar, Cordoba and Atlantico. Suitability areas environmental were also predicted in Eastern Colombia, towards the extension of the Eastern plain of the Orinoquia, a low altitude region in Arauca, Casanare, Meta and Vichada. Conclusion: This study applies ecological niche models, which may be of interest in the planning of strategies or the creation of management plans, such as early warning systems that prevent the establishment of this species.

AB  - Accurate information on the distribution, demography, and conservation status of endangered populations in threatened habitats are essential to provide the basis for conservation actions and management plans. Neglect of western Ecuador by biologists has resulted in a paucity of information of primate populations in the region. Capuchins (Cebus spp.) and howlers (Alouatta sp.) occur in the Tumbes-Choc-Magdalena hotspot along the Pacific coast. We conducted the first primate survey in Pacoche Marine and Coastal Wildlife Refuge, one of the few protected areas in western Ecuador. Although the Pacoche refuge is protected, illegal activities inside the area include slash-and-burn agriculture and natural resource extraction. We surveyed 18 1-km transects within the protected area between April and July 2012 to evaluate the effects of anthropogenic disturbance and habitat characteristics on population densities of the Critically Endangered Ecuadorian white-fronted capuchin (Cebus aequatorialis) and the Vulnerable mantled howler (Alouatta palliata aequatorialis). We confirmed the presence of C. aequatorialis through direct observation on three occasions outside transects. The low detection rate of C. aequatorialis underscores the need for immediate conservation action for this species. Using a hierarchical distance sampling model, we predicted group size as a proxy of probability of detection and found that canopy cover explained group density of A. p. aequatorialis, following a half-normal distribution. We estimated the mean density of A. p. aequatorialis as 12.4 ind./km(2) and the total population to be 621.5 individuals. The correlation between the density of A. p. aequatorialis and canopy cover underlines the need to preserve the remaining forest and its connectivity. Our results also highlight the importance of including vegetation structure in primate censuses.

AB  - Land use rules in the Brazilian environmental legislation were not explicitly designed to protect key areas for biodiversity In this paper, we evaluated the degree to which areas legally protected as 'Permanent Preservation Areas' (PPA) match key areas for biodiversity conservation in the suburbs of Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil. The analysis was based on the structure and spatial context of natural biotopes and the distribution of potential habitats of endangered species. Urban areas cover 22% of the study area, while PPAs cover 25.8%. Of the total area, 21.5% and 28% were considered, respectively, important for biodiversity according to coarse and fine filter approaches. Forty percent of the PPAs coincide with important areas for biodiversity, protecting 27.5% of them. Banks of bodies of water more than expectedly contributed for the protection of important areas. We conclude that the current Brazilian legislation on land usage is not enough to protect key areas for biodiversity We discuss complementary approaches and the challenges to fulfilling biodiversity conservation needs.

AB  - The wolves in the Hindukush-Himalayan region belong to one of the most basal lineages of Canis lupus, yet little is known about their ecology and behavior. In this study, we determine wolf movement and analyze diet patterns in contrast with studies from within its distribution range. We determine conflict perception and identify hotspots using ecological, social, and remotely sensed information. Wolf diet (n = 283 scats) constituted mostly of domestic prey (79%), while wild prey constituted 17.8% of the wolf diet. Interview-based questionnaire surveys revealed that 55% of the respondents claimed to have seen wolves. Over 98% of the respondents claimed wolves as a possible threat to various livestock in the study area. Marginal response curves through the MaxEnt model showed that wolf hotspots were positive in response to their density of location, landuse-landcover, village population, village density, and depredation. Comparisons between scat- and questionnaire-based depredation data showed that the perceived levels of depredation by wolves differed significantly from the actual proportion of livestock prey species consumed by wolves (chi 2 = 99.64, p-value < 0.0001). Wolf conflict hotspots showed a very high conflict zone area of 36 km(2), high conflict zone of 62 km(2), medium conflict zone of 196 km(2), and low conflict zone of 3,636 km(2). Future conflict mitigation strategies may focus on such areas primarily to reduce livestock losses and enhance conservation outcomes. Negative perceptions toward wolves can be managed through a holistic conservation action plan in concert with the existing snow leopard conservation program alongside local traditions that do not hinder livelihood security.

AB  - 1. Opportunistically collected species observations contributed by volunteer reporters are increasingly available for species and regions for which systematically collected data are not available. However, it is unclear if they are suitable to produce reliable habitat suitability models (HSMs), and hence if the species-habitat relationships found and habitat suitability maps produced can be used with confidence to advice conservation management and address basic and applied research questions.
   2. We evaluated HSMs with opportunistically collected observations against HSMs with systematically collected observations. We enhanced the opportunistically collected presence-only data by adding inferred species absences. To obtain inferred absences, we asked individual reporters about their identification skills and if they reported certain species consistently and combined this information with their observations. We evaluated several HSM methods using a forest bird species, Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus), in Sweden: logistic regression with inferred absences, two versions of MaxEnt, a model combining presence-absence with presence-only observations and a Bayesian site-occupancy-detection model.
   3. All HSM methods produced nationwide habitat suitability maps of Siberian jay that agreed well with systematically collected observations (AUC: 086-0.88) and were very similar to a habitat suitability map produced from the HSM with systematically collected observations (Spearman rho: 0.94-0.98). At finer geographical scales there were differences among methods.
   4. At finer scale, the resulting habitat suitability maps from logistic regression with inferred absences agreed better with results from systematically collected observations than other methods. The species-habitat relationships found with logistic regression also agreed well with those found from systematically collected data and with prior expectations based on the species ecology.
   5. Synthesis and application. For many regions and species, systematically collected data are not available. By using inferred absences from high-quality, opportunistically collected contributions of few very active reporters in logistic regression we obtained HSMs that produced results similar to those from a systematic survey. Adding high-quality inferred absences to opportunistically collected data is likely possible for many less common species across various organism groups. Well-performing HSMs are important to facilitate applications such as spatial conservation planning and prioritization, monitoring of invasive species, understanding species habitat requirements or climate change studies.

AB  - Climate change and particularly warming are significantly impacting marine ecosystems and the services they provided. Temperature, as the main factor driving all biological processes, may influence ectotherms metabolism, thermal tolerance limits and distribution species patterns. The joining action of climate change and local stressors (including the increasing human marine use) may facilitate the spread of non-indigenous and native outbreak forming species, leading to associated economic consequences for marine coastal economies. Marine aquaculture is one among the most economic anthropogenic activities threatened by multiple stressors and in turn, by increasing hard artificial substrates at sea would facilitate the expansion of these problematic organisms and face negative consequences regarding facilities management and farmed organisms' welfare. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are considered powerful tools for forecasting the future occurrences and distributions of problematic species used to preventively aware stakeholders. In the current study, we propose the use of combined correlative SDMs and mechanistic models, based on individual thermal performance curve models calculated through non-linear least squares regression and Bayesian statistics (functional-SDM), as an ecological relevant tool to increase our ability to investigate the potential indirect effect of climate change on the distributions of harmful species for human activities at sea, taking aquaculture as a food productive example and the benthic cnidarian Pennaria disticha (one of the most pernicious fouling species in aquaculture) as model species. Our combined approach was able to improve the prediction ability of both mechanistic and correlative models to get more ecologically informed "whole" niche of the studied species. Incorporating the mechanistic links between the organisms' functional traits and their environments into SDMs through the use of a Bayesian functional-SDM approach would be a useful and reliable tool in early warning ecological systems, risk assessment and management actions focused on important economic activities and natural ecosystems conservation.

AB  - The conservation of any species requires understanding and predicting the distribution of its habitat and resource use, including the effects of scale-dependent variation in habitat and resource quality. Consequently, testing for resource selection at the appropriate scales is critical. We investigated how the resource selection process varies across scales, using koalas in a semi-arid landscape of eastern Australia as a case study. We asked: at what scales does tree selection by koalas vary across regions? We tested the importance of the variation of our ecological predictors at the following scales: (i) the site-scale (a stand of trees representing an individual koala's perception of local habitat); (ii) the landscape-scale (10x10km area representing a space within which a population of koalas exists); and (iii) a combination of these scales. We used a mixed-modelling approach to quantify variation in selection of individual trees by koalas among sites and landscapes within a 1600km2 study area. We found that tree species, and tree height, were the most important factors influencing tree selection, and that their effect did not vary across scales. In contrast, preferences for trees of different condition, which is the state of tree canopy health, did vary across landscapes, indicating spatial variation in the selection of trees with respect to tree condition at the landscape-scale, but not at the site-scale. We conclude that resource selection processes can depend on the quality of those resources at different scales and their heterogeneous nature across landscapes, highlighting the consequence of scale-dependent ecological processes. Designing studies that capture the heterogeneity in habitat and resources used by species that have an extensive distribution is an important prerequisite for effective conservation planning and management.

AB  - Bonelli's eagle, Hieraaetus fasciatus, has recently suffered a severe population decline and is currently endangered. Spain supports about 70% of the European population. We used stepwise logistic regression on a set of environmental, spatial and human variables to model Bonelli's eagle distribution in the 5167 UTM 10 x 10 km quadrats of peninsular Spain. We obtained a model based on 16 variables, which allowed us to identify favourable and unfavourable areas for this species in Spain, as well as intermediate favourability areas. We assessed the stepwise progression of the model by comparing the model's predictions in each step with those of the final model, and selected a parsimonious explanatory model based on three variables - slope, July temperature and precipitation - comprising 76% of the predictive capacity of the final model. The reported presences in favourable and unfavourable areas suggest a source-sink dynamics in Bonelli's eagle Populations. The fragmented spatial structure of the favourable areas suggests the existence of a superimposed metapopulation dynamics. Previous LIFE (The Financial Instrument of the European Union for the Environment and Nature) projects for the conservation of this species have focused mainly on the northern limit of its range, where the sharpest population decline has been recorded. In these areas, favourability is low and Bonelli's eagle populations are probably maintained by the immigration of juveniles produced in more favourable zones. However, southern populations, although stable, show signs of reduction in productivity, which could menace the population sizes in the whole study area. We suggest that conservation efforts should focus also on known favourable areas, which might favour population persistence in unfavourable areas through dispersal.

AB  - A species, especially when it is endangered and surrounded by anthropogenic elements, can be threatened by habitat fragmentation. Food resource availability in the species' usual or surrogate habitats may reinforce or decrease its use of certain areas. Our objective was to to determine the influence of natural and anthropogenic variables on spatial distribution of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). We first determined the home range of a wild chimpanzee community (hereafter Sebitoli Chimpanzee Community [SCC]) based on global positioning system (GPS) point locations (n = 2,586 direct observations and feces locations) collected between 2009 and 2013 in Sebitoli, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We described SCC home range using grid cells (2,959 cells of 100 m x 100 m) referencing environmental, spatial, and topographical variables (n = 15). We then determined diet and food species abundance within their territory (n = 63 vegetation plots and 18 months phenological survey) and predicted distribution of the 10 most foraged fruit species within SCC home range, using environmental, spatial, and topographical variables (n = 10) by applying a maximum entropy model (maxent). We then predicted chimpanzee presence as a function of environmental, spatial, and topographical variables (n = 15) using the maxent model and assessed its truthfulness with the kernel model, based only on GPS point locations. Chimpanzees in Sebitoli were mostly observed in a core area of 5.42 km(2) within the 25-km(2) home range. They did not avoid forest edges in contact with human populations, especially males who used larger core areas than females. Factors with the greatest positive impact on the chimpanzee distribution model (maxent area under the curve [AUC] = 0.907) were related to 3 different food resources: 1) proximity to forest edges considered as attractive because of presence of crops cultivated by local farmers; 2) proximity to a tarmac road that crosses the SCC home range with shoulders covered by attractive terrestrial herbaceous vegetation; and 3) presence of wild forest fruiting resources. The results obtained with the maxent predictive model, applied on a fine scale, were consistent with the kernel model, based on real observations. Therefore, such an approach may be recommended for surveys or action plans interested in sustainable management of wildlife in an anthropogenic environment and may be a useful tool to better understand parameters of a prefered zone for an endangered species.

AB  - The conversion of natural lands to developed uses may pose the single greatest human threat to global terrestrial biodiversity. Continued human growth and development over the next century will further exacerbate these effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. Natural resource managers are tasked with managing wildlife as a public trust, yet often have little say in land use decisions. Generally speaking, decision makers could benefit from an understanding of what different regulations mean in terms of wildlife distribution. In a previous paper (Bettigole et al., 2013), we surveyed town residents throughout Vermont to measure how respondents feel about a range of development levels within their town boundaries. We estimated the "social carrying capacity for development" - or SKd - for 251 towns in Vermont. SKd provides an estimate of the level of developed land cover classes that town residents deem "acceptable" within their town boundaries. In this paper, we design a framework for linking the town-specific SKd estimates with the wildlife distribution patterns for three wide-ranging mammalian species: American black bear (Ursus americanus), fisher (Martes pennant, and bobcat (Lynx rufus). We simulated landscape conditions at SKd for each town in Vermont, and then used existing occupancy models for the three target species to spatially map and compare occupancy rates in the baseline year 2000 with occupancy rates at SKd. With nearly 90% of Vermont towns willing to increase developed landcover classes within town boundaries compared to baseline levels, significant state-wide changes in occupancy rates were predicted for all three focal species. Average occupancy rates declined by -15.9% and -3.1% for black bear and bobcats, respectively. Average occupancy rates for fisher increased by 9.0%. This study provides a method for linking development standards within a town with wildlife occurrence. Across towns, the methodology spatially identifies areas that may be at risk of future development, as well as identifying areas where wildlife distribution patterns may face future change as a result of increased human population growth and development.

AB  - The Jamaican boa (Epicrates subflavus; also called Yellow boa) is an endemic species whose natural populations greatly and constantly declined since the late 19th century, mainly because of predation by introduced species, human persecution, and habitat destruction. In-situ conservation of the Jamaican boa is seriously hindered by the lack of information on demographic and ecological parameters as well as by a poor understanding of the population structure and species distribution in the wild. Here, using nine nuclear microsatellite loci and a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from 87 wild-born individuals, we present the first molecular genetic analyses focusing on the diversity and structure of the natural populations of the Jamaican boa. A model-based clustering analysis of multilocus microsatellite genotypes identifies three groups that are also significantly differentiated on the basis of F-statistics. Similarly, haplotypic network reconstruction methods applied on the cytochrome b haplotypes isolated here identify two well-differentiated haplogroups separated by four to six fixed mutations. Bayesian and metaGA analyses of the mitochondrial data set combined with sequences from other Boidae species indicate that rooting of the haplotypic network occurs most likely between the two defined haplogroups. Both analyses (based on nuclear and mitochondrial markers) underline an Eastern vs. (Western + Central) pattern of differentiation in agreement with geological data and patterns of differentiation uncovered in other vertebrate and invertebrate Jamaican species. Our results provide important insights for improving management of ex-situ captive populations and for guiding the development of proper in-situ species survival and habitat management plans for this spectacular, yet poorly known and vulnerable, snake.

AB  - Biodiversity on farmland is declining due to agricultural intensification and Occurs across many taxa such as plants. insects or birds Here. we modelled population sizes of five farmland birds in central Germany as the German Sustainability Indicator for Species Diversity (SISD) is based on this taxon. We explored options for sustainable farmland management by generating land-use scenarios at the regional scale. For individual bird species, high SISD scores could be reached by changing environmental variables. such as landscape or crop diversity, percent cover of spring cereals or hedge density. However, contrasting species responses to these variables prevented from reaching high scores for all species simultaneously. We were able to improve the total SISD score from 0.77 at present to 0 94 by increasing landscape and crop diversity or to 087 by increasing hedge density and reducing spring cereals. respectively An economic evaluation of the return losses associated with these changes revealed that annual costs of approx 5 5 (sic)/ha farmland would suffice for this latter increase by optimizing hedges and spring cereals towards high SISD. We conclude that balancing three levels of trade-offs. i.e. contrasting requirements of species, diverging responses in different landscapes, and alternative economic options, is difficult to achieve without systematic modelling Yet, by accounting for differences in landscape structure and species distributions at a regional spatial scale and by focusing oil clearly defined measures Such as hedge density or the cover of spring cereals rather than composite indices like landscape or crop diversity it seems possible to develop realisable, affordable and Sustainable management strategies (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - P>1. We evaluated the accuracy of presence-only modelling for predicting the distribution of rare species, when data are scarce and usually collected with sampling biases. We modelled the potential distribution in Portugal of one of the rarest European bats Barbastella barbastellus and subsequently ground-validated predictions by using acoustic transects.
   2. We used ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) and maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling to build distribution models of B. barbastellus, and determined which ecological factors were more relevant for each model. As ENFA only accepts continuous variables, we built one Maxent model using the same variables as ENFA and another using land cover as a categorical variable.
   3. Ecological niche factor analysis and both Maxent models predicted similar areas of occurrence in central and northern regions of Portugal, although ENFA predicted suitable habitat over a wider range. Conversely, there was substantial disagreement on the location of high-suitability areas in the south. This could be a consequence of a different choice of important variables made by each model. Native woodland and average temperature were the most relevant variables for Maxent, while in ENFA B. barbastellus was linked to higher altitudes although avoiding production forests and infrastructures.
   4. Threshold-independent and -dependent statistics showed that Maxent models outperformed ENFA, probably as a consequence of divergent predictions in the new areas of occurrence. Overall, 15 new B. barbastellus sites were discovered and known distribution was extended c. 100 km to the south.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results support the use of presence-only modelling as an indispensible tool for survey design as shown by the discovery of B. barbastellus populations outside of the previously known range. ENFA seems to be more suited to determining a species' potential distribution, although failing to extrapolate it. In contrast, Maxent is better suited to determining a species' realized distribution. It was successful in predicting occurrence in previously unsurveyed areas and can be recommended as a technique for determination of a conservative distribution for a species. Maxent modelling would greatly aid biodiversity conservation, especially when it is necessary to develop survey plans or first assessments of a species' distribution.

AB  - Urbanization affects amphibian communities through habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat quality. The effects of these changes in habitat at different scales vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. We assessed the breeding distribution of anurans along an urban-rural gradient in Shanghai, China, a region experiencing intensive urbanization. Our results showed that urban density had a significantly negative influence on the overall anuran abundance and diversity and that the responses of individual species to urbanization varied. Pond age was an overall predictor in models describing the responses of Pelophylax nigromaculatus, Fejervarya multistriata, and M. fissipes and total anuran abundance. The quality of habitat at a pond was also important, and the high abundance of Bufo gargarizans and Pelophy lax plancyi was associated with ponds with aquatic vegetation coverage. Urban density showed strong negative effects on B. gargarizans, total anuran abundance, and species richness. The broad-scale landscape variables associated with forests, agricultural fields, and wetlands surrounding breeding ponds have been shown to affect anuran abundance and species richness. The response of individual species, total abundance, and species richness to urbanization reflected differences in their ecological requirements. We quantified the effects of urbanization on frogs in a rapidly urbanizing region, and our results demonstrated that both multi-spatial and temporal variables affect anurans in Shanghai. Our results emphasized the importance of anuran conservation planning in urbanized areas to preserve and/or restore terrestrial habitat and to improve connectivity between ponds and other wetlands.

AB  - Using long-term data from government, non-government, academic, and industry sources, we developed species distribution models (SDMs) to predict priority areas in which to target and enhance blue whale Balaenoptera musculus and northern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon ampullatus monitoring efforts in eastern Canada. Priority areas for blue whales were located primarily on the Scotian Shelf and along the south shelf break in waters off Newfoundland. Priority areas for northern bottlenose whales were identified primarily in areas along the edges of the eastern Scotian Shelf and the Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves, in submarine canyons, and deep basins. The SDM results and the tools presented in this study indicate that there are few conservation areas in eastern Canada that currently protect whales at risk, and that priority areas for blue and northern bottlenose whales overlap with regions where noise-producing activities (shipping and seismic exploration) occur. This study also highlighted large gaps in the cetacean data related to human activities (e.g. seismic survey lines are outdated and recent information from the past 5 to 10 yr is not available). The SDM approach developed in this study can be used as an iterative, adaptive process by including updated data as it becomes available, further refining and validating the SDM results and thereby improve our understanding of the distribution of cetaceans and noise-producing activities in eastern Canada.

AB  - Quaternary period geological events and climatic oscillations significantly affect the geographic structure and genetic diversity of species distribution in arid northwestern China. Amygdalus mongolica is a relict and endangered shrub that occurs primarily in arid areas of northwestern China. Based on variation patterns present at three cpDNA regions (psbK-psbI, trnL-trnF and trnV) and in one nDNA sequence (ITS1-ITS4) in 174 individuals representing 15 populations, the spatial genetic structure and demographic history of A. mongolica was examined across its entire geographic range. The 17 different haplotypes and 10 ribotypes showed two lineages, distributed across the Western (Mazong Mountains, Hexi Corridor, and Alxa Left Banner) and Eastern regions (Urad Houqi, Yinshan Mountains, Urad Zhongqi, and Daqing Mountains) according to the median-joining network and the BI (Bayesian inference) and ML (Maximum likelihood) trees. AMOVA analysis demonstrated that over 65% of the observed genetic variation was related to this lineage split. The expansions of the Ulanbuhe and Tengger deserts and the eastward extension of the Yinshan Mountains since the Quaternary period likely interrupted gene flow and triggered the observed divergence in the two allopatric regions; arid landscape fragmentation accompanied by local environmental heterogeneity further increased local adaptive differentiation between the Western and Eastern groups. Based on the evidence from phylogeographical patterns and the distribution of genetic variation, A. mongolica distributed in the eastern and western regions are speculated to have experienced eastward migration along the southern slopes of the Lang Mountains and westward migration along the margins of the Ulanbuhe and Tengger deserts to the Hexi Corridor, respectively. For setting a conservation management plan, it is recommended that the south slopes of the Lang Mountains and northern Helan Mountains be identified as the two primary conservation areas, as they have high genetic variation and habitats that are more suitable.

AB  - Habitat classifications provide guidelines for mapping and comparing marine resources across geographic regions. Calcareous bio-concretions and their associated biota have not been exhaustively categorized. Furthermore, for management and conservation purposes, species and habitat mapping is critical. Recently, several developments have occurred in the field of predictive habitat modeling, and multiple methods are available. In this study, we defined the habitats constituting northern Adriatic biogenic reefs and created a predictive habitat distribution model. We used an updated dataset of the epibenthic assemblages to define the habitats, which we verified using the fuzzy k-means (FKM) clustering method. Redundancy analysis was employed to model the relationships between the environmental descriptors and the FKM membership grades. Predictive modelling was carried out to map habitats across the basin. Habitat A (opportunistic macroalgae, encrusting Porifera, bioeroders) characterizes reefs closest to the coastline, which are affected by coastal currents and river inputs. Habitat B is distinguished by massive Porifera, erect Tunicata, and noncalcareous encrusting algae (Peyssonnelia spp.). Habitat C (non-articulated coralline, Polycitor adriaticus) is predicted in deeper areas. The onshore-offshore gradient explains the variability of the assemblages because of the influence of coastal freshwater, which is the main driver of nutrient dynamics. This model supports the interpretation of Habitat A and C as the extremes of a gradient that characterizes the epibenthic assemblages, while Habitat B demonstrates intermediate characteristics. Areas of transition are a natural feature of the marine environment and may include a mixture of habitats and species. The habitats proposed are easy to identify in the field, are related to different environmental features, and may be suitable for application in studies focused on other geographic areas. The habitat model outputs provide insight into the environmental drivers that control the distribution of the habitat and can be used to guide future research efforts and cost-effective management and conservation plans.

AB  - Luciobarbus guiraonis (Eastern Iberian barbel) is an endemic ish species restricted to Spain, mainly distributed in the Jucar River Basin District. Its study is important because there is little knowledge about its biology and ecology. To improve the knowledge about the species distribution and habitat requirements, nonlinear modelling was carried out to predict the presence/absence and density of the Eastern Iberian barbel, based on 155 sampling sites distributed throughout the Jucar River Basin District (Eastern Iberian Peninsula). We used multilayer feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN) to represent nonlinear relationships between L. guiraonis descriptors and variables regarding the physical habitat and biological components (macroinvertebrates, ish, riparian forest). The gradient descent algorithm was implemented to find the optimal model parameters; the importance of the ANN's input variables was determined by the partial derivatives method. The predictive power of the model was evaluated with the Cohen's kappa (k), the correctly classified instances (CCI), and the area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plots. The best model predicted presence/absence with a high performance (k = 0.66, CCI = 87% and AUC = 0.85); the prediction of density was moderate (CCI = 62%, AUC = 0.71 and k = 0.43). The fundamental variables describing the presence/absence were; solar radiation (the highest contribution was observed between 2000 and 4200 WH/m(2)), drainage area (with the strongest inluence between 3000 and 5.000 km(2)), and the proportion of exotic ish species (with relevant contribution between 50 and 100%). In the density model, the most important variables were the coeficient of variation of mean annual lows (relative importance of 50.5%) and the proportion of exotic ish species (24.4%). The models provide important information about the relation of L. guiraonis with biotic and abiotic variables, this new knowledge can help develop future studies and management plans for the conservation of this species in the Jucar River Basin District and, potentially, for the conservation of other endemic ish species of Barbus and Luciobarbus in Mediterranean rivers.

AB  - Climate change is expected to bring about profound rearrangement of ecological communities by affecting individual species distributions. The resulting communities arise from the idiosyncratic responses of species to future changes, which ultimately relate to both shrinking and expanding species ranges. While spatial patterns of colonisation and extirpation events have received great attention, the identification of specific drivers remains poorly explored. This study aims to investigate the relative contribution of species gain and loss to the turnover of fish assemblages in French rivers under future climate change, and to identify their principal drivers. Future projections of potential habitat suitability in 2080 derived from species distribution models for 40 fish species showed that colonisations and extirpations could play counterbalancing roles in the reshuffling of communities. Simultaneously, these two processes exhibited patchy spatial patterns, segregated along the longitudinal and altitudinal gradients, resulting in dramatic species turnover of approximate to 60% of the current composition of species assemblages. Beyond the effect of topographic location, colonisations were found to be driven by temperature seasonality while extirpations were affected by modifications in both thermal and precipitation regimes. These results generate the possibility of developing ecosystem-based management tools focused on the early identification of areas where particular species may be sensitive to climate changes. Disentangling the drivers of colonisation and extirpation processes provides ready-to-use information that may be easily integrated into conservation planning. This information could be used to identify potential hotspots of species gain and loss and to then compare these hotspots with newly favourable areas so as to consider their actual accessibility in order to facilitate future range shifts.

AB  - Aim
   Robust and reliable predictions of the effects of climate change on biodiversity are required in formulating conservation and management strategies that best retain biodiversity into the future. Significant challenges in modelling climate change impacts arise from limitations in our current knowledge of biodiversity. Community-level modelling can complement species-level approaches in overcoming these limitations and predicting climate change impacts on biodiversity as a whole. However, the community-level approaches applied to date have been largely correlative, ignoring the key processes that influence change in biodiversity over space and time. Here, we suggest that the development of new 'semi-mechanistic' community-level models would substantially increase our capacity to predict climate change impacts on biodiversity.
   Location
   Global.
   Methods
   Drawing on an expansive review of biodiversity modelling approaches and recent advances in semi-mechanistic modelling at the species level, we outline the main elements of a new semi-mechanistic community-level modelling approach.
   Results
   Our quantitative review revealed a sharp divide between mechanistic and non-mechanistic biodiversity modelling approaches, with very few semi-mechanistic models developed to date.
   Main conclusions
   We suggest that the conceptual framework presented here for combining mechanistic and non-mechanistic community-level approaches offers a promising means of incorporating key processes into predictions of climate change impacts on biodiversity whilst working within the limits of our current knowledge.

AB  - Crayfish are ecologically important in freshwater systems worldwide and are imperiled in North America and globally. We sought to examine landscape- to local-scale environmental variables related to occupancy and detection probability of a suite of stream-dwelling crayfish species. We used a quantitative kickseine method to sample crayfish presence at 102 perennial stream sites with eight surveys per site. We modeled occupancy (psi) and detection probability (P) and local- and landscape-scale environmental covariates. We developed a set of a priori candidate models for each species and ranked models using (Q)AICc. Detection probabilities and occupancy estimates differed among crayfish species with Orconectes eupunctus, O. marchandi, and Cambarus hubbsi being relatively rare (psi < 0.20) with moderate (0.46-0.60) to high (0.81) detection probability and O. punctimanus and O. ozarkae being relatively common (psi > 0.60) with high detection probability (0.81). Detection probability was often related to local habitat variables current velocity, depth, or substrate size. Important environmental variables for crayfish occupancy were species dependent but were mainly landscape variables such as stream order, geology, slope, topography, and land use. Landscape variables strongly influenced crayfish occupancy and should be considered in future studies and conservation plans.

AB  - In densely populated northwestern Europe, native large mammals are confronted with a very fragmented landscape, and most of the areas they inhabit are island-like reserves threatened with total isolation from other reserves. The only way to counteract the threat of further decline in the numbers of large-mammal species is to restore their habitats. The appropriate size of future reserves could be estimated from the habitat requirements of wild ungulates that are considered key species for ecosystem functioning. The species selected to guide the design of large nature reserves in northwestern Europe is the red deer (Cervus elaphus) because of its widespread distribution, key role in ecosystem functioning, and home-range size. We describe a network analysis of the Netherlands, Belgium, and adjacent parts of France and Germany, performed with the LARCH landscape ecology model, that was conducted in order to identify the structure of the ecological network for red deer and the spatial connectivity of the landscape. The resulting maps show areas that could support viable populations and indicate habitat areas that will support persistent populations only if they are in a network of linked habitats. The gaps and barriers that prevent connectivity in such networks guide the design of effective corridors to increase spatial connectivity. The results of our analysis can be used for policy decisions on nature conservation and spatial planning, and the method is applicable to other regions and species.

AB  - We sought to identify priority areas for the conservation of Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus) habitat in the northern portion of the eastern Andean cordillera in Ecuador. The study area included paramo and montane forest habitats within the Antisana and Cayambe-Coca ecological reserves, and unprotected areas north of these reserves with elevations ranging from 1,800 to 4,300 m. We collected data on bear occurrence along 53 transects during 2000-01 in the Oyacachi River basin, an area of indigenous communities within the Cayambe-Coca Ecological Reserve. We used those data and a set of 7 environmental variables to predict suitability of Andean bear habitat using Mahalanobis distance, a multivariate measure of dissimilarity. The Mahalanobis distance values were classified into 5 classes of habitat suitability and generalized to a resolution of 1,650-m x 1,650-m grid cells. Clusters of grid cells with high suitability values were delineated from the generalized model and defined as important habitat areas (IHAs) for conservation. The IHAs were ranked using a weighted index that included factors of elevation range, influence from disturbed areas, and current conservation status. We identified 12 IHAs, which were mainly associated with paramo and cloud forest habitats; 2 of these areas have high conservation priorities because they are outside existing reserves and close to areas of human pressure. The distribution of the IHAs highlighted the role of human land use as the main source of fragmentation of Andean bear habitat in this region, emphasizing the importance of preserving habitat connectivity to allow the seasonal movements among habitat types that we documented for this species. Furthermore, the existence of areas with high habitat suitability close to areas of intense human use indicates the importance of bear-human conflict management as a critical Andean bear conservation strategy. We suggest that a promising conservation opportunity for this species is linked to its occurrence in highland habitats, which play a key role in the maintenance of long-term water supplies.

AB  - As rural landscapes experience increasing levels of residential development, the persistence of species that rely on them will depend on informed planning and management decisions. An understanding of habitat requirements is essential for setting priorities and developing landscape-level plans for the survival of these species. In many temperate rural landscapes, artificially created ponds may be the only wetlands available for aquatic reproduction by amphibians. The introduction of non-native fish into these ponds reduces survival and prohibits successful reproduction of many native pond-breeding amphibians. We surveyed 105 randomly selected wetlands in a primarily privately-owned, rural landscape in north Idaho, USA, for pond-breeding amphibian larvae in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic multimodel inference and an algorithmic (random forests) approach to model habitat for each species based on local and landscape characteristics. We also used a mail survey to quantify how landowners value fish in their wetlands and their plans for future wetland development and fish stocking. Sixty-seven percent of pond owners reported that fishing in their pond was at least slightly important to them and 36% of owners indicated that they were at least 50% likely to add fish to their ponds in the next 5-10 years. Landscape change predictions for this area indicate that forests will become more open due to thinning; habitat models indicated that this is likely to be detrimental to long-toed salamanders and beneficial to Pacific treefrogs. Habitat models also indicate that Columbia spotted frog breeding sites consist of wetlands on flat ground with high solar insolation and that this species is sensitive to nearby development, indicating that as this landscape becomes further developed, this species may require habitat protection for persistence.

AB  - Aim Intraspecific genetic variation is a key component of biodiversity, with higher diversity indicating greater resilience and population substructuring suggesting unique evolutionary histories. Comparative approaches, in which intraspecific genetic variation is assessed across multiple species, are powerful tools to identify evolutionary hotspots, but are still rarely applied at spatial scales relevant to conservation planning. Here, we use comparative phylogeography to understand patterns and potential drivers of genetic variation within a biodiversity and ocean warming hotspot. Location The South African coastline, Indian/Atlantic Oceans. Methods A literature search was conducted to obtain mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase c subunit I and cytochrome b sequence data for 17 marine fish and invertebrate species. From these data, we compared averages of haplotype and nucleotide diversity, and within-region phi(ST) between four biogeographic provinces in the region. Mixed linear models tested whether environmental variability, habitat preference, or geographic location significantly influence genetic variation. Results Average diversity values differed between haplotype and nucleotide diversity, but both broadly displayed highest diversity levels within the South-West bioregion, which is also a region of high levels of within-region phi(ST). Range in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) was the only significant fixed-effect term in the haplotype diversity mixed linear models. Mean SST, stability in SSTs since the Mid-Holocene and position within the species' geographic distribution all had no significant effect on genetic variation. Main conclusions Along this coastline characterized by high environmental heterogeneity, we find that variation in temperature is a prominent source of intraspecific variation. Genetic diversity differs between bioregions, but does not display higher levels within the core of each species' range when assessed across multiple species. With elevated levels of genetic diversity, the South-West region of the South African coast is highlighted as a conservation priority area, representing both high genetic diversity and differentiation across taxa.

AB  - Climate-wise connectivity is essential to provide species access to suitable habitats in the future, yet we lack a consistent means of quantifying climate adaptation benefits of habitat linkages. Species range shifts to cooler climates have been widely observed, suggesting we should protect pathways providing access to cooler locations. However, in topographically diverse regions, the effects of elevation, seasonality, and proximity to large water bodies are complex drivers of biologically relevant temperature gradients. Here, we identify potential terrestrial and riparian linkages and their cooling benefit using mid-century summer and winter temperature extremes for interior coastal ranges in Northern California. It is rare for the same area to possess both terrestrial and riparian connectivity value. Our analysis reveals distinct differences in the magnitude and orientation of cooling benefits between the summer maximum and winter minimum temperatures provided by the linkages we delineated for the area. The cooling benefits for both linkage types were maximized to the west during summer, but upslope and to the northeast during winter. The approach we employ here provides an improved method to prioritize climate-wise connectivity and promote landscape resilience for topographically diverse regions.

AB  - Deep-sea corals (DSCs) are important living marine resources, forming both oases of biodiversity and three-dimensional habitat structure for fishes and invertebrates. However, because of logistical difficulties and expense of deep-sea exploration, much less is known about the distribution of DSCs than is known for their shallow-water counterparts. Predictive modeling, therefore, is essential for estimating the extent of DSC habitat in areas that are unexplored in order to support conservation efforts, to provide information for effective management of offshore activities affecting the seafloor, and for future exploration and research. In support of research and management efforts in the U.S. Northeast (Cape Hatteras, NC north to the Canadian border), we developed a comprehensive set of habitat suitability models covering this entire geographic region for nine taxonomic groups of DSCs (Alcyonacea, gorgonian corals, non-gorgonian corals, Scleractinia, Caryophylliidae, Flabellidae, Pennatulacea, Sessiliflorae, and Subselliflorae). Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models were fit to DSC presence records and spatially-explicit environmental predictors depicting depth and seafloor topography, surficial sediment characteristics, and oceanography. A stepwise model selection procedure was then implemented to identify the set of predictor variables that maximized predictive performance for each taxonomic group. To allow for comparisons across taxonomic groups, the standard MaxEnt logistic predictions were converted into calibrated classes of habitat suitability. Overall, model performance was high for all taxonomic groups. Model fit was best for Caryophylliidae, Sessiliflorae, and Flabellidae, whereas model stability was greatest for the three taxonomic groups of Alcyonacea. Model results reported here corroborate known distributions of corals in the region. For example, large structure-forming taxa are predicted to occur mainly in canyon environments, particularly in areas of steep slope (>30 degrees); sea pens in softer sediments of the continental shelf and slope. Additionally, the models successfully predicted DSC locations during field testing. Despite the limitations of presence-only data, several novel extensions to the traditional MaxEnt analysis workflow improved model selection, accuracy assessment, and comparability of results across taxonomic groups. This approach, when integrated with management processes, could be a powerful tool for science-based conservation, management, and spatial planning for these marine resources.

AB  - The detection of target species is of paramount importance in ecological studies, with implications for environmental management and natural resource conservation planning. This is usually done by sampling the area: the species is detected if the presence of at least one individual is detected in the samples. Green & Young (Green & Young 1993 Sampling to detectrare species. Ecol. Appl. 3, 351-356. (doi:10.2307/1941837) introduce two models to determine the minimum number of samples n to ensure that the probability of failing to detect the species from them, if the species is actually present in the area, does not exceed a fixed threshold: based on the Poisson and the Negative Binomial distributions. We generalize them to two scenarios, one considering the area size N to be finite, and the other allowing detectability errors, with probability delta. The results in Green & Young are recovered by taking N -> infinity and delta = 0. Not taking into consideration the finite size of the area, if known, leads to an overestimation of n, which is vital to avoid if sampling is expensive or difficult, while assuming that there are no detectability errors, if they really exist, produces an undesirable bias. Our approximation manages to skirt both problems, for the Poisson and the Negative Binomial.

AB  - Conservation efforts often use habitat models as surrogates for empirical data on the distribution or,population size of target species as well as to predict the efficacy of proposed conservation and management actions. Such a model was used to evaluate preserves for the Palm Springs ground squirrel (Spermophilus tereticaudus chlorus) under a proposed Habitat Conservation Plan in the Sonoran Desert of southern California. The habitat model was developed from expert opinion and data from nonprobability-based sample surveys for ground squirrels. We evaluated the model and tested the underlying assumptions about the ground squirrel's habitat affinities, estimated the occupancy rates and detection probabilities of ground squirrels in modeled habitat, quantified the total area of the proposed preserves occupied by ground squirrels, and tested a priori hypotheses about how occupancy differed among vegetation and substrate types. Occupancy rate varied with vegetation and substrate types and, by repeatedly visiting survey points, we found that detection probability was -0.22 (SE = 0.05). We found ground squirrels were more likely to occupy mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa variety torreyana) on dunes/hummocks (0.99 +/- 0.01) than creosote (Lamea tridentata) on dunes/hummocks (0.33 +/- 0.09) or other vegetation/substrate types (<= 0.08). Our results suggest that this and comparable habitat models should be refined to incorporate detection probabilities and variation in ground squirrel affinity for different vegetation and substrates. In contrast to the existing habitat model, our data suggested that ground squirrel occupancy rate differed by vegetation/substrate types. We suggest that conservation efforts focus on protecting and enhancing the mesquite hummock/dune system that has largely disappeared over the last 50 years due to agricultural and urban development and a lowering of water tables.

KW  - CONSERVATION
AB  - Recent surveys of recovery plans indicate that criteria, such as population sizes, for delisting species from the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) are often unrealistically low by scientific standards. We describe the delisting criterion for the threatened southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) developed by the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Team. A major oil spill is the most serious threat to this sea otter population. After extensive modeling of oil spills, the recovery team concluded that it was not scientifically defensible to develop a delisting criterion in terms of a single probability of extinction over a specified time period. Instead, the team decided to define a size at which it would consider the population endangered and to consider the population threatened as long as a major oil spill might reduce it to that size. The effective population size (N-e) for endangered status was set at 500, estimated to be about 1850 otters. Using a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez spill (250,000 bbl), the oil spill model was iterated to generate a frequency distribution of the number of sea otters contacted by oil, from which the team estimated that less than 800 otters would be killed by 90% of the simulated spills. Thus, the delisting criterion was set at 1850 + 800 = 2650 individuals. There have been several proposals to improve the Endangered Species Act by providing quantitative guidance, in the form of specific probabilities of extinction within some time frame or specific criteria like those used by the Wordl Conservation Union as to the levels of extinction risk represented by the terms ''threatened'' and ''endangered''. Experiences of the Sea Otter Recovery Team indicate that guidelines should not be overly rigid and should allow flexibility for dealing with specific situations. The most important consideration is to appoint a recovery team that is both technically well qualified and unconstrained by pressures from management agencies.

AB  - Relict species are an extremely important part of biodiversity and as such studies on the factors that allow their current persistence are required. The aim of this study was to assess the determinants of the distribution and range-wide population performance of the Tertiary relict tree Prunus Iusitanica L. This threatened species is confined to Iberia, Northern Morocco and Macaronesia with a fragmented and scattered distribution. Using ecological niche modelling, we calculated the level of range filling across the range and tested its relationship with human impact. We then assessed the relative importance of climatic suitability as obtained through niche modelling, topographic factors and contemporary human impact on range-wide population performance. Results showed that the species occupies only 2.4% of the overall area predicted to be climatically suitable for its presence and the level of range filling varied across regions. A weak negative relationship among range filling and human impact was found. Overall climatic suitability was the strongest predictor of population performance. However, it showed high variability across regions: the effect was positive in Iberia whereas negative but not significant in Macaronesia and Morocco. Human impact showed a significant negative effect and finally topographic factors such as altitude had a minor negative effect. Our results highlight that both climate and human impact play a major role in the current limited range filling and performance of the species. Management plans to minimize anthropogenic disturbances together with reforestation measures are urgently needed in order to conserve this unique species.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms by which similar species coexist in sympatry is a major driver of ecological research. Niche partitioning and ecological plasticity can facilitate spatial and habitat use overlap between generalist and specialist species. Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are a highly speciose group of small primates that are endemic to the forests of Madagascar. In northwestern Madagascar, the relatively widespread M. murinus occurs sympatrically with the microendemic M. ravelobensis. We investigated spatial distributions and densities of these two species across a mangrove-dry forest habitat gradient in Mariarano commune. We used capturemark-recapture techniques and nocturnal line transect surveys along six transects during June and July 2017. Spatial capture-recapture and distance sampling models were used to estimate lemur densities across habitat types. The congeners displayed differential patterns of spatial distribution and densities. Microcebus murinus was found in similar densities across all habitat types, while M. ravelobensis was found at much higher densities in dry forests compared with mangroves. This suggests that the generalist M. murinus uses a wider array of habitats more evenly than the specialist M. ravelobensis. Our study provides empirical evidence of how cryptic lemur species differ in their habitat use and distribution across an environmental gradient and provides new insights into their ecology in an understudied habitat. Lemurs arc one of the most threatened groups of mammals in the world, and understanding how these species are distributed across different forest types is crucial for planning and implementing conservation measures to protect lemur habitat.

AB  - 1. A number of parallel initiatives in South Africa have been addressing the prioritization and management of invasive alien plant species, the prioritization of rivers for the conservation of biodiversity, and broad-scale planning for water resource management. This paper has combined aspects of these approaches to develop a composite index of prioritization of quaternary catchments for alien plant control purposes.
   2. We calculated, for each quaternary catchment, a simple composite index that combined estimates of (i) the number of invasive alien plant species present; (ii) the potential number of invasive alien plant species that would be present if they occupied the full range as determined by climatic envelope models; (iii) the degree of habitat loss in rivers; and (iv) the degree of water stress. Each of the four components contributed between one and four to the combined index, which had a range of values between four and 16.
   3. We used a geographic information system to map the distribution of priority catchments for invasive alien plant control. Of the 1911 quaternary catchments in South Africa and Lesotho, just over one-third (650) were in the highest priority category with an index of 13 or more. A relatively small proportion (273, or 14%) of the catchments had the maximum scores of 15 or 16.
   4. The approach identified priority areas that have not currently been identified as such, and should provide decision makers with an objective and transparent method with which to prioritize areas for the control of invasive alien plants. We anticipate debate about the way in which components of the index are calculated, and the weight given to the different components, and that this will lead to the transparent evolution of the index. Improvements would also come about through the addition of a more comprehensive list of species, and through the addition of further components.

AB  - Intermittent rivers are the focus of a burgeoning subdiscipline of freshwater science, driven by mounting recognition of their ubiquity, biodiversity, and climate sensitivity. However, our understanding of their ecology is hampered by a reliance on unstandardised diversity measures, an underrepresentation of certain stream types in metacommunity research and a reticence to acknowledge biotic interactions as a potentially fundamental driver of catchment-scale patterns in assemblage composition. This study analysed both local- and catchment-scale responses of invertebrates to flow intermittence and hydrological isolation in an understudied ecosystem type (low-gradient, groundwater-fed headwaters). We compared responses of conventional (taxonomic richness, Shannon diversity) and more robust (coverage-adjusted Hill-Shannon) alpha-diversity metrics to drying, and analysed changes in beta-diversity components as a function of hydrological and spatial distances between samples. We also inferred the influence of biotic interactions on metacommunity structure, using hierarchical species distribution modelling to capture species-to-species associations after accounting for hydrological variability and dispersal traits. The conventional and robust alpha-diversity metrics exhibited broadly similar shifts, although richness overestimated the decline in alpha-diversity with intermittence and the Shannon index failed to detect a significant interaction between flow duration and hydrological isolation. Decomposition of beta-diversity revealed a dominance of species turnover over nestedness along the flow gradient, a finding contrary to prevailing conceptual wisdom in intermittent river ecology and one we attribute to the climatic and geological context of our study. Even after accounting for differences in hydrological niche occupation, we discovered a significant propensity for species to co-occur with others of similar conservation status, implying that competition/colonisation trade-offs involving rare specialists and widespread generalists could underpin metacommunity assembly in some drying headwater networks. Our results suggest that enhancing aquatic habitat connectivity in headwaters harbouring intermittent-stream specialists could be counterproductive, and conservation plans should instead look to safeguard isolated habitats serving as biotic refuges for rare species.

AB  - Background and Objectives: As urbanisation is a significant global trend, there is a profound need for biodiversity protection in urban ecosystems. Moreover, the potential of urban green space to support urban biodiversity should be appreciated. Butterflies are environmental indicators that are sensitive to urbanisation. Therefore, it is important to identify butterfly distribution patterns and the factors influencing butterfly diversity and species composition in urban parks within cities. Research Highlights: To our knowledge, ours is the first study evaluating the effects of both land cover and local habitat features on butterfly species composition in urban parks of Beijing, China. Materials and Methods: In this study, we surveyed butterfly richness and abundance in 28 urban parks in Beijing, China. The parks differed in age and location in the urban area. Meanwhile, we investigated the green space in the surroundings of the parks at multi-spatial scales at the landscape level. We also investigated local park characteristics including the age of the park (Age), perimeter/area ratio of the park (SQPRA), area of the park (ha) (Area), green space cover within the park (Greenp), nectar plant species richness (Necpl), abundance of flowering nectar plants (Necabu) and overall plant species richness (Pl). Generalised linear models (GLMs) and redundancy discriminant analysis (RDA) were applied to relate butterfly diversity and butterfly species composition to environmental variables, respectively. Results: We recorded 3617 individuals belonging to 26 species from July to September in 2019. Parks on the city fringe had significantly higher butterfly diversity. Butterfly species richness was mostly related to total plant richness. The abundance of flowering nectar plants was closely linked to butterfly abundance. Land cover had little impact on butterfly diversity and community structure in urban parks. Conclusions: Once a park has sufficient plants and nectar resources, it becomes a useful haven for urban butterflies, regardless of the surrounding land cover. Well-planned urban parks focused on local habitat quality support butterfly conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary Climate change is the main threat for conservation in the 21st century. Reliable methodologies and tools for the evaluation of its impact are urgently needed. Correlative ecological niche models (ENMs) are effective tools for predicting the future distribution of species under climate change scenarios. Despite this, many alternative different methods have been proposed, and objective reasons for a proper selection are unclear. Therefore, a comparative study to evaluate the consistency of predictions of the main ENM algorithms was performed. To test the effectiveness of correlative ENM temporal projection, we compared predictions generated using historical data and projected to the modern climate with predictions generated using modern distribution and climate data. In total, 600 case studies were generated, by using 25 Italian endemic plant species, 12 algorithms and 2 alternative sets of environmental variables. As a result, we highlighted the similarity of eight algorithms and the poor performance of four. Correlative ecological niche modelling (ENM) is a method widely used to study the geographic distribution of species. In recent decades, it has become a leading approach for evaluating the most likely impacts of changing climate. When used to predict future distributions, ENM applications involve transferring models calibrated with modern environmental data to future conditions, usually derived from Global Climate Models (GCMs). The number of algorithms and software packages available to estimate distributions is quite high. To experimentally assess the effectiveness of correlative ENM temporal projection, we evaluated the transferability of models produced using 12 different algorithms on historical and modern data. In particular, we compared predictions generated using historical data and projected to the modern climate (simulating a "future" condition) with predictions generated using modern distribution and climate data. The models produced with the 12 ENM algorithms were evaluated in geographic (range size and coherence of predictions) and environmental space (Schoener's D index). None of the algorithms shows an overall superior capability to correctly predict future distributions. On the contrary, a few algorithms revealed an inadequate predictive ability. Finally, we provide hints that can be used as guideline to plan further studies based on the adopted general workflow, useful for all studies involving future projections.

AB  - Dry tropical forest communities are among the world's most threatened systems and urgent measures are required to protect and restore them in degraded landscapes. For planning conservation strategies, there is a need to determine the few essential measurable properties, such as number of species and basal area, that best describe the dry forest vegetation and its environment, and to document quantitative relationships among them. This paper examines the relationships between forest basal area and diversity components (number of species and evenness) for a disturbed dry tropical forest of northern India. Data were collected from five sites located in the Vindhyan dry tropical forest of India, selected on the basis of satellite images and field observations to represent the entire range of conditions in terms of canopy cover and disturbance regimes. These sites represented different communities in terms of species composition. The forest was poorer in species richness, and lower in stem density and basal area than wet forests of the tropics. Across sites (communities), the diversity components and tree density were positively related with total tree basal area. Considering basal area as a surrogate of biomass and net production, diversity is found to be positively associated with productivity. A positive relationship between basal area, tree density and species diversity may be an important characteristic of the dry forest, where recurring disturbance does not permit concentration of biomass or stems in only a few strong competitors. However, the relationships of basal area with density, alpha diversity and evenness remain statistically significant only when data from all sites, including the extremely disturbed one, are used in the analysis. In some sites there was a greater coefficient of variation (CV) of basal area than in others, attributed to patchy distribution of stems and resultant blanks. Therefore, to enhance the tree diversity of these forests, the variability in tree basal area must be reduced by regulating local disturbances. Conservation activities, particularly fuelwood plantations near human settlements, deferred grazing and canopy enrichment through multi-species plantations of nursery-raised or wild-collected seedlings of desirable species within the forest patches of low basal area, will be needed to attain restoration goals, but reforestation programmes will have to be made attractive to the forest-dwelling communities.

AB  - Refuges for threatened species are important to prevent species extinction. They provide protection from a range of environmental and biotic stressors, and ideally provide protection against all threatening processes. However, for some species it may not be clear why some areas are refuges and others are not. The forty-spotted pardalote (Pardalotus quadragintus) is an endangered, sedentary, cryptic and specialised bird endemic to the island of Tasmania, Australia. Having undergone an extreme range contraction over the past century the species is now mostly confined to a few small offshore island refuges. Key threatening processes to the species include habitat loss, wildfire, competition and predation. The ways in which these processes have molded the species' contemporary range have not been clearly evaluated. Furthermore, the security of the remnant population within refuges is uncertain. To overcome this uncertainty we assessed key threats and established the population status in known refuges by developing a robust survey protocol within an occupancy modelling framework. We discuss our results in the context of planning trial reintroductions of this endangered species in suitable habitat across its former range. We found very high occupancy rates (0.75-0.96) at two refuges and in suitable conditions, the species was highly detectable (p, 0.43-0.77). At a third location our surveys indicated a local extinction, likely due to recent wildfire. We demonstrate that all refuges are at high risk of one or more threatening processes and the current distribution across island refuges is unlikely to secure the species from extinction. We identified large areas of potential habitat across the species' former mainland range, but these are likely too distant from source populations for natural recolonisation. We propose that establishing new populations of forty-spotted pardalotes via reintroduction is essential to secure the species and that this is best achieved while robust source populations still exist.

AB  - Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a booming area of research that has had an exponential increase in use and development in recent years. We performed a search of scientific literature and found 5,533 documents published from 1993 to 2018 using SDM, representing a global network of 4,329 collaborating institutions from 155 countries, with Brazil and Mexico being in the top 10 of the most prolific countries globally. National Autonomous University of Mexico, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Kansas, and U.S. Geological Survey are the most prolific institutions worldwide. Latin American institutions (n = 556) participated in 1,000 (18% of global productivity) documents published in collaboration with 591 institutions outside Latin American countries, from which the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Federal University of Goias, Institute of Ecology A.C., National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, University of Sic, Paulo, and University of Brasilia were the most productive. From this body of literature, the most frequently modeled taxonomic groups were Chordata and Insecta, and the most common realms of application were conservation planning and management, climate change, species conservation, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, and biological invasions. From the 36 modeling methods identified to generate SDMs, MaxEnt is used in 73.5% of the papers, followed by Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) with 18.7%, and just 7.4% of the papers compared between 3 and 10 modeling methods. In Latin American countries, productivity in SDM research could be improved as the network of collaborations diversifies and connects with other productive countries (such as United Kingdom, China, Spain, Germany, Australia, and France). The scientific collaboration between Latin American countries should be increased, as the most prolific countries (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia) share less than 10% of its productivity. Some of the main challenges for SDM development in Latin America include bridging the gaps from (a) software use to research productivity and (b) translation to decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose to strengthen communities of practice where modelers, species experts, and decision-makers come together to discuss and develop SDM to shift and enhance current paradigms on how science and decision-making are linked.

AB  - The eradication of newly detected alien plant species is often prescribed, but rarely successful. Eradication programs fail for many reasons, however, for eradication to remain a cost-efficient management option it is clear that good decisions must be made at the outset. Here we re-frame the project prioritization protocol (PPP), a tool widely used in conservation biology, for use with the metrics typically used by a biosecurity agency. We then use existing methods to estimate the cost-efficiency of eradicating 50 hypothetical species incursions and compare the reduction in weed risk achieved by allocating resources using the PPP framework with the allocation based on risk ranking. By allocating resources to plant eradication programs using the PPP our analysis indicated that it is possible to improve the return on public expenditure by 25% compared to investing based solely on weed risk assessment scores. We also demonstrate how the cost-efficiency of the overall portfolio is influenced by the choice of planning horizon; including the decline in overall portfolio performance that arises when attempting to eradicate individual species too quickly. Finally, we discuss the logistical benefits to a management agency that arise from the use of a generic overarching framework such as the PPP. We believe that the PPP has considerable potential for use in biosecurity and can help focus attention on those species where management can make the biggest difference.

AB  - Ixobrychus exillis (Least Bittern) is listed as a species of high concern in the North American Waterbird Conservation Plan and is a US Fish and Wildlife Service migratory bird species of conservation concern in the Northeast. Little is known about the population of Least Bitterns in the Northeast because of their low population density, tendency to nest in dense wetland vegetation, and secretive behavior. Urban and agricultural development is expected to encroach on and degrade suitable wetland habitat; however, we cannot predict the effects on Least Bittern populations without more accurate information on their abundance and distribution. We conducted surveys of wetlands in Vermont to assess the efficacy of a monitoring protocol and to establish baseline Least Bittern abundance and distribution data at a sample of 29 wetland sites. Surveys yielded detections of 31 individuals at 15 of 29 sites across 3 biophysical regions and at 5 sites where occupancy had not been previously reported. Probability of occupancy was positively related to wetland size and number of patches, though the relationships were not strong enough to conclude if these were true determinants of occupancy. Call-response broadcast surveys yielded 30 detections, while passive surveys yielded 13. Call-response broadcasts (P = 0.897) increased the rate of detection by 55% compared to passive surveys (P = 0.577). Our results suggest that call-response broadcast surveys are an effective means of assessing Least Bittern occupancy and may reduce bias in long-term monitoring programs.

AB  - P>1. Statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool for planning conservation interventions, particularly for areas where species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect. Sometimes however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability modelling are themselves difficult to obtain or not meaningful at the geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur confined to the marshes of Lake Alaotra in Madagascar.
   2. We developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor variables, including vegetation indices and image texture measures at different scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived from Landsat7 satellite imagery. Using relatively few presence records, the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach and AUC were used to assess the performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the effect of scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat.
   3. This study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for a Maxent habitat suitability model at the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a fine grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable.
   4. In the case of H. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat suitability map to inform conservation management in Lake Alaotra and a replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps in the future. The exploration of candidate predictor variables allowed the identification of scales that appear ecologically relevant for the species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a cost-effective combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from Landsat7 images. With a habitat modelling method like Maxent that shows good performance with few presence samples and Landsat images now freely available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little use or difficult to obtain.

AB  - Species diversity commonly increases with succession and this relationship is an important justification for conserving large areas of old-growth habitats. However, species with different ecological roles respond differently to succession. We examined the relationship between a range of diversity measures and time since disturbance for boreal forest beetles collected over a 285 year forest chronosequence. We compared responses of "functional" groups related to threat status, dependence on dead wood habitats, diet and the type of trap in which they were collected (indicative of the breadth of ecologies of species). We examined fits of commonly used rank-abundance models for each age class and traditional and derived diversity indices. Rank abundance distributions were closest to the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution, suggesting little role for competition in structuring most assemblages. Diversity measures for most functional groups increased with succession, but differences in slopes were common. Evenness declined with succession; more so for red-listed species than common species. Saproxylic species increased in diversity with succession while non-saproxylic species did not. Slopes for fungivores were steeper than other diet groups, while detritivores were not strongly affected by succession. Species trapped using emergence traps (log specialists) responded more weakly to succession than those trapped using flight intercept traps (representing a broader set of ecologies). Species associated with microhabitats that accumulate with succession (fungi and dead wood) thus showed the strongest diversity responses to succession. These clear differences between functional group responses to forest succession should be considered in planning landscapes for optimum conservation value, particularly functional resilience.

AB  - Species abundance calculated from the number of individuals per hectare in phytosociological surveys is a key parameter to measure plant population size. The species density calculated by the occurrences per grid cell provides a proxy of population size when the species abundance is lacking, but its efficiency as a population parameter is poorly understood. Here, we quantified the species density of 79 woody species of the Cerrado. We tested to what extent species density quantified from grid cells could predict species local abundance. Species density per grid cell was calculated using herbarium data and data from published papers for six spatial reso-lutions, ranging from 30 s to 1 degrees. General additive models and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used to test the species abundance-density relationship. Although we found a correlation between abundance and density, the model fit ranged from poor to moderate. Herbarium and paper data together improved the species abundance-density relationship relative to herbarium data only. Resolutions between 30-min and 1 degrees produced better fits than fine resolution. We concluded that species density per grid cell no longer predicts the local abundance of woody species satisfactorily, multiple data sources are better than a single one, and the coarse resolutions are more suitable for the predicted species abundance-density relationship.

AB  - Biodiversity surrogates are needed because detailed data on the distributions of species and communities is very limited. Among alternative surrogate strategies there is an environmental diversity (ED) framework, which uses the p-median model to sample environmental space as evenly as possible. The underlying idea is that such a sample would represent underlying species diversity well. However, tests of the effectiveness of ED as a surrogate for species diversity have been inconclusive, and there is a debate concerning the usefulness of different implementations of ED. In particular, it has been argued that tests of the ED framework are flawed because they used discrete algorithms (calculating the p-median from an observed environmental space), while continuous versions of ED should be preferred (i.e. calculating the p-median from a theoretical, continuously spaced, environmental space). Unfortunately, progress has been hampered by lack of independent testing of the two ED approaches. Here, we provide the first empirical test of the effectiveness of both continuous and discrete ED using European distributions of amphibians and reptiles. Analyses were implemented considering two different extents: (1) western Europe and (2) the Iberian Peninsula. In both cases, implementations of ED represented species at a lower rate than expected by chance (P < 0.05). Unlike suggested by some authors, the continuous ED was not consistently superior to the discrete form: continuous implementations of ED performed slightly better when fewer areas were selected and discrete ED performed better when the whole of the western European region was considered. Our results support findings that ED has only limited value as a surrogate for biodiversity and invite the interpretation that failure of ED is more likely to be related with oversimplification of assumptions underlying the model than to the particular p-median algorithm used.

AB  - Primates occur in 90 countries, but four-Brazil, Madagascar, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)-harbor 65% of the world's primate species (439) and 60% of these primates are Threatened, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2017-3). Considering their importance for global primate conservation, we examine the anthropogenic pressures each country is facing that place their primate populations at risk. Habitat loss and fragmentation are main threats to primates in Brazil, Madagascar, and Indonesia. However, in DRC hunting for the commercial bushmeat trade is the primary threat. Encroachment on primate habitats driven by local and global market demands for food and non-food commodities hunting, illegal trade, the proliferation of invasive species, and human and domestic-animal borne infectious diseases cause habitat loss, population declines, and extirpation. Modeling agricultural expansion in the 21st century for the four countries under a worstcase-scenario, showed a primate range contraction of 78% for Brazil, 72% for Indonesia, 62% for Madagascar, and 32% for DRC. These pressures unfold in the context of expanding human populations with low levels of development. Weak governance across these four countries may limit effective primate conservation planning. We examine landscape and local approaches to effective primate conservation policies and assess the distribution of protected areas and primates in each country. Primates in Brazil and Madagascar have 38% of their range inside protected areas, 17% in Indonesia and 14% in DRC, suggesting that the great majority of primate populations remain vulnerable. We list the key challenges faced by the four countries to avert primate extinctions now and in the future. In the short term, effective law enforcement to stop illegal hunting and illegal forest destruction is absolutely key. Long-term success can only be achieved by focusing local and global public awareness, and actively engaging with international organizations, multinational businesses and consumer nations to reduce unsustainable demands on the environment. Finally, the four primate range countries need to ensure that integrated, sustainable land-use planning for economic development includes the maintenance of biodiversity and intact, functional natural ecosystems.

AB  - The production of methane (CH4) by methanogens (Mgen) in mangrove sediments is known to contribute signifi-cantly to global warming. In such an estuarine environment, the abundance and population assemblage of Mgen are not well understood. Recently, there has been an increase of interest to understand about the properties of habitat distribu-tion and the main environmental factors that influence mangrove suitability. Here, we used a maximum entropy (Max-ent) species distribution model and a geographic information system (GIS) to determine the current habitat suitability distribution of Mgen in the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem in India. The Worldclim elevation (elev), precipitation (precp), solar radiation (srad), average temperature (t(avg)), maximum temperature (t(max)), minimum temperature (t(min)), water vapor pressure (vap) and the wind speed (wind) data and 36 spatially well-dispersed species occurrence points were used to predict the potential distribution of Mgen in the 14,317 km(2) study area. The results indicated that Mgen has a high potential distribution at the deforested areas adjacent to the riverine system in the Indian Sundarban mangrove ecosystem. Jackknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modeling. The prcp is the most important environmental variable which influences the distribution of Mgen in mangrove sediments. With an AUC (area under curve "Sensitivity vs. Specificity") of 0.826, the Maxent model was extremely accurate. The study shows that Maxent could be a useful tool for species rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation planning in the face of climate change.

AB  - Wildlife species' habitats throughout North America are subject to direct and indirect consequences of climate change. Vulnerability assessments for the Intermountain West regard wildlife and vegetation and their disturbance as two key resource areas in terms of ecosystems when considering climate change issues. Despite the adaptability potential of certain wildlife, increased temperature estimates of 1.67-2 degrees C by 2050 increase the likelihood and severity of droughts, floods, heatwaves and wildfires in Utah. As a consequence, resilient flora and fauna could be displaced. The aim of this study was to locate areas of habitat for an exemplary species, i.e., sage-grouse, based on current climate conditions and pinpoint areas of future habitat based on climate projections. The locations of wildlife were collected from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) observations in addition to normal temperature and precipitation, vegetation cover and other ecosystem-related data. Four machine learning algorithms were then used to locate the current sites of wildlife habitats and predict suitable future sites where wildlife would likely relocate to, dependent on the effects of climate change and based on a timeframe of scientifically backed temperature-increase estimates. Our findings show that Random Forest outperforms other competing models, with an accuracy of 0.897, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.917 and 0.885, respectively, and has great potential in Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), which can provide useful insights into habitat predictions. Based on this model, our predictions show that sage-grouse habitats in Utah will continue to decrease over the coming years due to climate change, producing a highly fragmented habitat and causing a loss of close to 70% of their current habitat. Priority Areas of Conservation (PACs) and protected areas might be deemed insufficient to halt this habitat loss, and more effort should be put into maintaining connectivity between patches to ensure the movement and genetic diversity within the sage-grouse population. The underlying data-driven methodical approach of this study could be useful for environmentalists, researchers, decision-makers, and policymakers, among others.

AB  - There has been an increasing use of predictive spatial distribution of main communities or dominant species at the landscape scale for ecological restoration planning, biodiversity conservation planning and regional management decisions in the Qilian Mountains, northwest China. Understanding the spatial distribution of dominant species at the regional scale is also essential for assessing the impacts of environmental change or human effects on vegetation distribution. Based on the spatial distribution of resource variables that correlate with or control plant distribution, this study focused on the prediction of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) distribution at the regional scale, i.e., where the extent of the prediction was within the biogeographic range of Qinghai spruce in the upper reach of Heihe River. The development of the predictive model in the study required the integration of geographical information system (GIS) with remote sensing (RS), spatial analytic and statistical tools. First, we selected the main resource variables such as mean July temperature, water and solar radiation. These variables were spatialized as functions of elevation and horizontal coordinates or as functions of aspect and slope via a GIS. Second, the niche spaces of Qinghai spruce were determined by incorporating the spatially-distributed resource variables with the current distribution of the species, which came from remote sensing data (Landsat TM image). The niche spaces defined then were extrapolated over the study area. Third, the distribution pattern was validated by field investigations. The study showed that the scope of mean July temperature ranged from 8.5 degrees C to 13.5 degrees C, average annual precipitation from 370 mm to 660 mm, the soil moisture index from 2.3 m(3) m(-1) year(-1) to 4.5 m(3) m(-1) year(-1) and the shortwave radiation for an average July day from 3.8 mm m(-2) day(-1) to 7.8 mm m(-2) day(-1). The elevation range belonging to Qinghai spruce in Qilian Mountains was also determined according to the mean July temperature space occupied by the forest. The elevation occupied by Qinghai spruce was about from 2600 m to 3400 m. We found that the density of the species has higher value from 2650 m to 3100 m based on the field investigation, and from 3 100 m the density decreased with elevation increase. The basal area of Qinghai spruce had the same change as the density. That is, the suitable niche of the species ranged from 2650 m to 3 100 m. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The geographical expansion of invasive species depends mainly on its dispersal potential, and the abiotic and biotic factors affecting it. Knowing the invasive dynamic of non-native species, as well as its behavior at different natural or anthropogenic scenarios, is fundamental for planning conservation management policies and control plans. The invasive sea anemone Anemonia alicemartinae in habits from the north (18 degrees S) to the south-central (36 degrees S) coast of Chile and its distribution range has expanded by approximately 1,928 km in the last 50 years. Previous works have proposed that human-mediated southward transport associated with regional-scale maritime activities could explain its rapid spread. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used ecological niche models (ENM) to evaluate the potential colonization of the southernmost area of South America. Additionally, we conducted a post hoc analysis to evaluate the relationship between the prediction of the ENM and human activity measured as the number of landings of ships in ports. The models were built based on presence records of A. alicemartinae, and oceanographic variables. Results showed that sea surface salinity and annual sea surface temperature (variance) are the best predictor variables to explain the distribution of A. alicemartinae. There was a positive and significant relationship between the geographical distribution of the sea anemone predicted by the ENM and the number of landings, as a proxy of anthropogenic activity. The most susceptible areas to invasion were those that showed the highest variability in both oceanographic predictors. These areas included the Biobio region, Chiloe's inland sea, Aysen, and Chacabuco regions, which together comprise two biogeographical provinces. These results sustain the proposed hypothesis and, overall, the results suggest that along with the characteristics of the life history of A. alicemartinae, oceanographic conditions and maritime transport as vector contribute to the southern range expansion of this invasive cryptogenic species in the Humboldt-current large marine ecosystem.

AB  - The central North Pacific Ocean includes diverse temperate and tropical pelagic habitats. Studies of the abundance and distribution of cetaceans within these dynamic marine ecosystems have generally been patchy or conducted at coarse spatial and temporal scales, limiting their utility for pelagic conservation planning. Habitat-based density models provide a tool for identifying pelagic areas of importance to cetaceans, because model predictions are spatially explicit. In this study, we present habitat-based models of cetacean density that were developed and validated for the central North Pacific. Spatial predictions of cetacean densities and measures of uncertainty were derived based on data collected during 15 large-scale shipboard cetacean and ecosystem assessment surveys conducted from 1997 to 2012. We developed generalized additive models using static and remotely sensed dynamic habitat variables, including distance to land, sea-surface temperature (SST), standard deviation of SST, surface chlorophyll concentration, seasurface height (SSH), and SSH root-mean-square variation. The resulting models, developed using new grid-based prediction methods, provide finer scale information on the distribution and density of cetaceans than previously available. Habitat-based abundance estimates around Hawaii are similar to those derived from standard line-transect analyses of the same data and provide enhanced spatial resolution to inform management and conservation of pelagic cetacean species.

AB  - Aim As the global climate is changing rapidly, there is a need to make conservation decisions to facilitate species' persistence under climate change. Models employed to make predictions regarding the impacts of climate change on species' distributions, and ultimately persistence, typically assume that interannual variability in environmental conditions is independent between years. However, the colour of environmental noise has been shown to affect extinction risk in populations occupying spatially static environments, and should therefore affect persistence during climate change. This study aims to investigate the importance of noise colour for extinction risk during climate-induced range shifts. Methods We use a spatially explicit coupled map lattice with a latitudinal gradient in climatic suitability, together with time series of environmental noise, to simulate periods of directional climate change and investigate the effects of noise colour on extinction risk and range size. Results Extinction risk increases with reddening of the environmental noise, and this effect is particularly pronounced over short time frames when climate change is rapid. Main conclusions Given that management decisions are typically made over such short time frames, and the rapid rates of climate change currently being experienced, we highlight the importance of incorporating realistic time series of environmental noise into models used for conservation planning under climate change.

AB  - In the summer of 2019-2020, southern Australia experienced the largest fires on record, detrimentally impacting the habitat of native species, many of which were already threatened by past and current anthropogenic land use. A large-scale restoration effort to improve degraded species habitat would provide fire-affected species with the chance to recover and persist in burnt and unburnt habitat. To facilitate this, decision-makers require information on priority species needs for restoration intervention, the suite of potential restoration interventions, and the priority locations for applying these interventions. We prioritize actions in areas where restoration would most likely provide cost-effective benefits to priority species (defined by each species proportion of habitat burned, threat status, and vulnerability to fires), by integrating current and future species habitat suitability maps with spatially modelled costs of restoration interventions such as replanting, removing invasive species, and implementing ecologically appropriate fire management. We show that restoring the top similar to 69% (112 million hectares) of the study region (current and future distributions of priority species) accounts for, on average, 95% of current and future habitat for every priority species and costs similar to AUD$73 billion yr(-1) (AUD$650 hectare(-1) yr(-1)) annualized over 30 years. This effort would include restoration actions over 6 million hectares of fire-impacted habitat, costing similar to AUD$8.8 billion/year. Large scale restoration efforts are often costly but can have significant societal co-benefits beyond biodiversity conservation. We also show that up to 291 MtCO2 (similar to 150 Mt DM) of carbon could be sequestered by restoration efforts, resulting in approximately AUD$253 million yr(-1) in carbon market revenue if all carbon was remunerated. Our approach highlights the scale, costs, and benefits of targeted restoration activities both inside and outside of the immediate bushfire footprint over vast areas of different land tenures.

AB  - Habitat conservation, and hence conservation of biodiversity hinges on knowledge of the spatial distribution of habitats, not least those that are particularly valuable or vulnerable. In offshore Norway, benthic habitats are systematically surveyed and described by the national programme MAREANO (Marine AREA' database for NOrwegian waters). Benthic habitats and biotopes are defined in terms of the species composition of their epibenthic megafauna. Some habitats are of special conservation interest on account of their intrinsic value and/or vulnerability (e.g., long-lived species, rareness, to comply with international regulations such as OSPAR). In Norway, off Nordland and Troms, the following habitats of special interest can be found: Umbaula encrinus Stands, Radicipes sp. Meadows, Deep Sea Sponge Aggregations, Seapen and Burrowing Megafauna Communities, Hard Bottom Coral Gardens. In this paper, we used underwater video data collected within the MAREANO programme to define and describe benthic habitats and biotopes of special interest, and to map the geographic distribution thereof by means of habitat modelling.
   We first evaluated the community structure of each habitat in the list using a SIMPROF test. We determined that the class Deep Sea Sponge Aggregations, as defined by OSPAR, had to be split into at least three classes. We then re-defined seven new types of ecological features, including habitats and biotopes that were sufficiently homogeneous. Then we modelled the spatial distributions of these habitats and biotopes using Conditional Inference Forests. Since the purpose of the distribution maps is to support spatial planning we classified the heat maps using density thresholds.
   The accuracy of models ranged from fair to excellent. Hard Bottom Coral Gardens were the most rare habitat in terms of total area predicted (224 km(2), 0.3% of the area modelled), closely followed by Radicipes Meadows (391 km(2), 0.6%). Soft Bottom Demosponges (Geodid sponges and other taxa) represent the largest habitat, with a predicted area of 9288 km(2) (14%). Distribution maps of classes defined by habitat-forming species (Hard Bottom Coral Gardens) were more reliable than those defined by a host of species, or where no single species was a clear habitat provider (e.g. Seapen and Burrowing Megafauna Communities). We also put forward that a scale of patchiness larger than the scale of observation, and homogeneity of the community both play a role in model performance, and hence in map usefulness. These along with density threshold values based on observed data should all be taken into account in marine classifications and habitat definitions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A simulation program that runs on a geographic information system (GIS) was developed to predict the multi-species size-structure dynamics of forest stands. Because important characteristics of a forest stand, including woody biomass accumulation, carbon storage, commercial value of timber, and functions for environmental conservation, can be inferred from the size structures of the component populations, management plans can be made from the predictions of the size-structure dynamics. For example, the simulation can incorporate various forms of thinning; forest managers can then try several thinning plans in simulated forest stands and choose the appropriate plan that achieves the best results. Using GIS to predict the size-structure dynamics of forest stands is of practical importance, because GIS has been used widely in forest management and can easily handle spatial distributions of environmental information (e.g., climate, geology, soils) that may influence tree performance. To predict size-structure dynamics, the program numerically solves a continuum equation that describes size-structure dynamics based on growth and mortality rates of individual trees. When predicting size-structure dynamics of a forest stand, the program obtains the environmental information of the stand from a database stored in the GIS and calculates environmental factors such as warmth index and potential evapotranspiration/precipitation ratio that influence growth and mortality rates. The simulation program calculates growth and mortality rates using published growth and mortality models that incorporate the effects of size of the individual, competition between trees, and abiotic environmental factors. To demonstrate the effects of abiotic environmental factors on the multi-species size-structure dynamics, sensitivity analyses were conducted. The size-structure dynamics varied in a way that was predictable from the responses of the growth and mortality rates to variations in the abiotic environmental factors. To demonstrate the size-structure dynamics in different locations, five test runs of the simulation program were also performed using the same initial size-structure and five different sets of abiotic environmental conditions from five locations. At the end of the simulation, the predicted size structures differed because the growth and mortality rates differed among the five locations. Finally, the response of the size structure to thinning was clarified. The result showed how the size structure of a component species in a forest stand is dependent on the presence of other species.

AB  - British Columbia (BC), Canada, has a diverse landscape that provides breeding habitat for >300 avian species, and the recent development of the BC Breeding Bird Atlas data set presents key information for exploring the landscape conditions which lead to biological richness. We used the volunteer-collected raw breeding bird evidence data set to analyze the effects of sampling biases on spatial distribution of observed breeding bird species and implemented regression tree analysis (Random Forests) to examine the influence of productivity, ambient energy, and habitat heterogeneity on independently measured breeding bird richness. Results indicated that total breeding species richness is correlated with total survey effort (alpha < 0.001). By stratifying species richness by survey effort, we observed that ambient energy is the top-ranked environmental predictor of breeding bird richness across BC, which, when used in combination with a number of other environmental variables, explains similar to 40% of the variation in richness. Using our modeled relationships, we predicted breeding bird species richness in the areas of BC not presently surveyed between three and six hours. The majority of the productive Boreal Plains, the southern portion of the Taiga Plains region, the lowlands of the Southern and Central Interior, along the Rocky Mountain Trench, and the coastal areas of the Georgia Depression are predicted to have the highest categories of breeding richness (35-57 unique species). Our results support ongoing species diversity gradient research, which identifies ambient energy as an important factor influencing species diversity distributions in the Northern Hemisphere. By linking breeding bird richness to environmental data derived from remotely sensed data and systematically collected climate data, we demonstrate the potential to monitor shifts in ambient energy as a surrogate for vertebrate habitat condition affecting population levels. By analyzing the influence of survey effort on species richness metrics, we also highlight the need to consider adding attributes to the raw breeding bird data set to describe observer experience, such as hours or seasons spent surveying, and provide survey dates to allow greater flexibility for removing survey bias. These additions can increase the utility of atlas data for species richness studies useful for conservation planning.

AB  - Planning for conservation success requires identifying effective and efficient monitoring strategies but multiple types of uncertainty affect the accuracy and precision of wildlife abundance estimates. Observation uncertainty, a consequence of sampling effort and design as well as the process of observation, is still understudied, with little attention given to the multiple potential sources of error involved. To establish error minimization priorities and maximize monitoring efficiency, the direction and magnitude of multiple sources of uncertainty must be considered. Using monitoring of two contrasting ungulate species in the Serengeti ecosystem as a case study, we developed a virtual ecologist' framework within which we carried out simulated tests of different monitoring strategies for different types of species. We investigated which components of monitoring should be prioritized to increase survey accuracy and precision and explored the robustness of population estimates under different budgetary scenarios. The relative importance of each process affecting precision and accuracy varied according to the survey technique and biological characteristics of the species. While survey precision was mainly affected by population characteristics and sampling effort, the accuracy of the survey was greatly affected by observer effects, such as juvenile and herd detectability. Synthesis and applications. Monitoring efficiency is of the utmost importance for conservation, especially in the context of limited budgets and other priorities. We provide insights into the likely effect of different types of observation and process error on population estimates for savanna ungulates, and more generally present a framework for evaluating monitoring programmes in a virtual environment. In highly aggregated species, the main focus should be on survey precision; sampling effort should be defined according to wildlife spatial distribution. For random or slightly aggregated species, accuracy is the key factor; this is most sensitive to observer effects which should be minimized by training and calibration by observer.

AB  - Reefs and subtidal rocky habitats are sites of high biodiversity and productivity which harbour commercially important species of fish and invertebrates. Although the conservation management of reef associated species has been informed using species distribution models (SDM) and community based approaches, to date their use has been constrained to specific regions where the locality and spatial extent of reefs is well known. Much of the world's subtidal habitats remain either undiscovered or unmapped, including coasts of intense human use. Consequently, to facilitate a stronger understanding of species-environmental relationships there is an urgent need for a cost and time effective standard method to map reefs at fine spatial resolutions across broad geographical extents. We used bathymetric data (similar to 250 m resolution) to calculate the local slope and curvature of the seabed. We then constructed artificial neural networks (ANNs) to forecast the probability of reef occurrence within grid cells as a function of bathymetric and slope variables. Testing over an independent data set not used in training showed that ANNs were able to accurately predict the location of reefs for 86% of all grid cells (Kappa = 0.63) without over fitting. The ANN with greatest support, combining bathymetric values of the target grid cell with the slope of adjacent grid cells, was used to map inshore reef locations around the Southern Australian coastline (similar to 250 m resolution). Broadly, our results show that reefs are identifiable from coarse-scale bathymetry data of the seabed. We anticipate that our research technique will strengthen systematic conservation planning tools in many regions of the world, by enabling the identification of rocky substratum and mapping in localities that remain poorly surveyed due to logistics or monetary constraints.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) relate species information to environmental conditions to predict potential species distributions. The majority of SDMs are static, relating species presence information to long-term average environmental conditions. The resulting temporal mismatch between species information and environmental conditions can increase model inference's uncertainty. For SDMs to capture the dynamic species-environment relationships and predict near-real-time habitat suitability, species information needs to be spatiotemporally matched with environmental conditions contemporaneous to the species' presence (dynamic SDMs). Implementing dynamic SDMs in the marine realm is highly challenging, particularly due to species and environmental data paucity and spatiotemporally biases. Here, we implemented presence-only dynamic SDMs for four migratory baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean (SO): Antarctic minke, Antarctic blue, fin, and humpback whales. Sightings were spatiotemporally matched with their respective daily environmental predictors. Background information was sampled daily to describe the dynamic environmental conditions in the highly dynamic SO. We corrected for spatial sampling bias by sampling background information respective to the seasonal research efforts. Independent model evaluation was performed on spatial and temporal cross-validation. We predicted the circumantarctic year-round habitat suitability of each species. Daily predictions were also summarized into bi-weekly and monthly habitat suitability. We identified important predictors and species suitability responses to environmental changes. Our results support the propitious use of dynamic SDMs to fill species information gaps and improve conservation planning strategies. Near-real-time predictions can be used for dynamic ocean management, e.g., to examine the overlap between habitat suitability and human activities. Nevertheless, the inevitable spatiotemporal biases in sighting data from the SO call for the need for improving sampling effort in the SO and using alternative data sources (e.g., passive acoustic monitoring) in future SDMs. We further discuss challenges of calibrating dynamic SDMs on baleen whale species in the SO, with a particular focus on spatiotemporal sampling bias issues and how background information should be sampled in presence-only dynamic SDMs. We also highlight the need to integrate visual and acoustic data in future SDMs on baleen whales for better coverage of environmental conditions suitable for the species and avoid constraints of using either data type alone.

AB  - Pollinators such as bees and hoverflies are essential components of an urban ecosystem, supporting and contributing to the biodiversity, functioning, resilience and visual amenity of green infrastructure. Their urban habitats also deliver health and well-being benefits to society, by providing important opportunities for accessing nature nearby to the homes of a growing majority of people living in towns and cities. However, many pollinator species are in decline, and the loss, degradation and fragmentation of natural habitats are some of the key drivers of this change. Urban planners and other practitioners need evidence to carefully prioritise where they focus their resources to provide and maintain a high quality, multifunctional green infrastructure network that supports pollinators and people. We provide a modelling framework to inform green infrastructure planning as a nature based solution with social and ecological benefits. We show how habitat suitability models (I-ISM) incorporating remote sensed vegetation data can provide important information on the influence of urban landcover composition and spatial configuration on species distributions across cities. Using Edinburgh, Scotland, as a case study city, we demonstrate this approach for bumble bees and hoverflies, providing high resolution predictive maps that identify pollinator habitat hotspots and pinch points across the city. By combining this spatial HSM output with health deprivation data, we highlight 'win-win' opportunity areas in most need of improved green infrastructure to support pollinator habitat quality and connectivity, as well as societal health and well-being. In addition, in collaboration with municipal planners, local stakeholders, and partners from a local greenspace learning alliance, we identified opportunities for citizen engagement activities to encourage interest in wildlife gardening as part of a 'pollinator pledge'. We conclude that this quantitative, spatially explicit and transferable approach provides a useful decision-making tool for targeting nature-based solutions to improve biodiversity and increase environmental stewardship, with the aim of providing a more attractive city to live, work and invest in.

AB  - Objectives: We quantify spatial turnover in communities of 1939 plant and 59 mammal species at 2.5 km resolution across a topographically heterogeneous region in south-eastern Australia to identify distributional breaks and low turnover zones where multiple species distributions overlap. Environmental turnover is measured to determine how climate, topography and geology influence biotic turnover differently across a variety of biogeographic breaks and overlaps. We identify the genera driving turnover and confirm the versatility of this approach across spatial scales and locations.
   Methods: Directional moving window analyses, rotated through 360 degrees, were used to measure spatial turnover variation in different directions between gridded cells containing georeferenced plant and mammal occurrences and environmental variables. Generalised linear models were used to compare taxic turnover results with equivalent analyses for geology, regolith weathering, elevation, slope, solar radiation, annual precipitation and annual mean temperature, both uniformly across the entire study area and by stratifying it into zones of high and low turnover. Identified breaks and transitions were compared to a conservation bioregionalisation framework widely used in Australia.
   Results/Significance: Detailed delineations of plant and mammal turnover zones with gradational boundaries denoted subtle variation in species assemblages. Turnover patterns often diverged from bioregion boundaries, though plant turnover adhered most closely. A prominent break zone contained either comparable or greater numbers of unique genera than adjacent overlaps, but these were concentrated in a small subsection relatively under-protected by conservation reserves. The environmental correlates of biotic turnover varied for different turnover zones in different subsections of the study area. Topography and temperature showed much stronger relationships with plant turnover in a topographically complex overlap, relative to a lowland overlap where weathering was most predictive. This method can quantify transitional turnover patterns from small to broad extents, at different resolutions for any location, and complements broad-scale bioregionalisation schemes in conservation planning.

AB  - Resource managers often have little information regarding the habitat requirements and distribution of rare species. Factor analysis-based habitat suitability models describe the ecological niche of a species and identify locations where these conditions occur on the landscape using existing occurrence data. We used factor analyses to assess the suitability of habitats for Thamnophis gigas (Giant Gartersnake), a rare, threatened species endemic to the Central Valley of California, USA, and to map the locations of habitat suitable for T. gigas in the Sacramento Valley. Factor analyses indicated that the niche of T. gigas is composed of sites near rice agriculture with low stream densities. Sites with high canal densities and near wetlands also appeared suitable, but results for these variables were sensitive to potential sampling bias. In the Sacramento Valley, suitable habitats occur primarily in the central portion of the valley floor. Based upon the results of the factor analyses, recovery planning for T. gigas will require an on-the-ground assessment of the current distribution and abundance of T. gigas, maintaining the few remaining natural wetlands and the practice of rice agriculture in the Sacramento Valley, and studying the effects of agricultural practices and land use changes on populations of T. gigas.

AB  - With the combination of worldwide landscape changes and the uncertainty about the impact on species abundance and distribution, the value of spatio-temporal modelling tools is increasingly obvious. The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax breeds on low-intensity arable cultivation and pastoral land and is currently threatened by diverse landscape modifications. The aim of this research was to predict Little Bustard population trends in the face of realistic scenarios of land use and infrastructure changes, applying a recently developed spatially explicit framework, based on the stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM). The application of this approach provided some basis to analyse the responses of breeding populations' spatial distribution and abundance to the scenarios implemented. Since some of these scenarios represent local and/or regional risks to the viability of Little Bustard breeding populations, the results obtained demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework for landscape planning in the scope of the conservation of this threatened species. This approach also provides a promising baseline to support ecological risk assessments for other species, derived from ecological models with increased predictive power and intuitiveness to decision makers and environmental managers.

AB  - The Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita, NBI) is an endangered migratory species, which went extinct in Europe in the 17th century. Currently, a translocation project in the frame of the European LIFE program is carried out, to reintroduce a migratory population with breeding colonies in the northern and southern Alpine foothills and a common wintering area in southern Tuscany. The population meanwhile consists of about 200 individuals, with about 90% of them carrying a GPS device on their back. We used biologging data from 2021 to model the habitat suitability for the species in the northern Alpine foothills. To set up a species distribution model, indices describing environmental conditions were calculated from satellite images of Landsat-8, and in addition to the well-proven use of optical remote sensing data, we also included Sentinel-1 actively sensed observation data, as well as climate and urbanization data. A random forest model was fitted on NBI GPS positions, which we used to identify regions with high predicted foraging suitability within the northern Alpine foothills. The model resulted in 84.5% overall accuracy. Elevation and slope had the highest predictive power, followed by grass cover and VV intensity of Sentinel-1 radar data. The map resulting from the model predicts the highest foraging suitability for valley floors, especially of Inn, Rhine, and Salzach-Valley as well as flatlands, like the Swiss Plateau and the agricultural areas surrounding Lake Constance. Areas with a high suitability index largely overlap with known historic breeding sites. This is particularly noteworthy because the model only refers to foraging habitats without considering the availability of suitable breeding cliffs. Detailed analyses identify the transition zone from extensive grassland management to intensive arable farming as the northern range limit. The modeling outcome allows for defining suitable areas for further translocation and management measures in the frame of the European NBI reintroduction program. Although required in the international IUCN translocation guidelines, the use of models in the context of translocation projects is still not common and in the case of the Northern Bald Ibis not considered in the present Single Species Action Plan of the African-Eurasian Migratory Water bird Agreement. Our species distribution model represents a contemporary snapshot, but sustainability is essential for conservation planning, especially in times of climate change. In this regard, a further model could be optimized by investigating sustainable land use, temporal dynamics, and climate change scenarios.

AB  - In recent years, brown bear Ursus arctos populations in Iran have experienced a clear trend of reduction and the species is now officially listed as threatened under provincial legislation. Anthropogenic habitat alteration and increasing human access to previously remote landscapes are potential source of stress for this species in Iran. Therefore, land cover changes in the Chelcheli protected area were mapped for 1991-2013 using time sequential Landsat TM and ETM at 30 meters resolution. Moreover, Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling was used to investigate habitat selection of brown bear. The results showed that suitable patches overlapped with forest areas (Hyrcanian forest) and rivers. Our results also indicate that the brown bear habitat suitability is negatively influenced by human disturbance (e.g., roads, settlements). Increased human disturbance in brown bear habitat in recent decades may cause bears to avoid the disturbed areas. Therefore, the management plans should focus on reducing the human infrastructures around brown bear habitat. A suggestion is to place the core secure areas for brown bear inside the suitable habitat close to rivers where the human access is restricted. Promoting awareness of biodiversity conservation among tourism should also be one of the major focuses of management plans.

AB  - Aim: Large carnivores are currently recolonizing parts of their historical ranges in Europe after centuries of persecution and habitat loss. Understanding the mechanisms driving these recolonizations is important for proactive conservation planning. Using the brown bear (Ursus arctos) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) as examples, we explore where and when large carnivores are likely to expand into human-dominated landscapes and how varying levels of resistance due to human pressure might impact this recolonization process.

   Methods: We used ensembles of species distribution models to relate species occurrence data to climate, topography and satellite-based land-cover predictors at a 10 km spatial resolution. Resulting predictions of suitable habitat areas were fed into a dispersal model to simulate range expansion over the 10 time-steps for different human pressure scenarios. Finally, we overlaid predictions with protected areas to highlight areas that are likely key for future connectivity, but where human pressures might hamper dispersal.
   Results: We found widespread suitable habitat for both species (bear: 30,000 km(2), lynx: 170,000 km(2)), yet human pressure limits potential range expansions. For brown bears, core habitats between the Cantabrian and Pyrenean populations remained unconnected despite suitable habitat in between. For lynx, we predicted higher range expansion potential, although high human pressures in southern coastal Spain negatively affected expansion potential.
   Main conclusions: Our results highlight that the recolonization potential of brown bears and lynx in the Iberian Peninsula is likely more constrained by lower permeability of landscapes due to human pressure than by habitat availability, a situation likely emblematic for large carnivores in many parts of the world. More generally, our approach provides a simple tool for conservation planners and managers to identify where range expansion is likely to occur and where proactively managing to allow large carnivores to safely disperse through human-dominated landscapes can contribute to viable large carnivore populations.

AB  - Climate change is expected to threaten endemic plants in the Alps. In this context, the factors that may modulate species responses are rarely investigated at a local scale. We analyzed eight alpine narrow endemics of the Dolomites (southeastern Alps) under different predicted climate change scenarios at fine spatial resolutions. We tested possible differences in elevation, topographic heterogeneity and velocity of climate change among areas of gained, lost, or stable climatic habitat. The negative impact of climate change ranged from moderate to severe, depending on scenario and species. Generally, range loss occurred at the lowest elevations, while gained and stable areas were located at highest elevations. For six of the species, climate change velocity had higher values in stable and gained areas than in lost ones. Our findings support the role of topographic heterogeneity in maintaining climatic microrefugia, however, the peculiar topography of the Dolomites, characterized by high altitude plateaus, resulted in high climate change velocity in areas of projected future climatic suitability. Our study supports the usefulness of multiple predictors of spatio-temporal range dynamics for regional climate-adapted management and eventual assisted colonization planning to not overlook or overestimate the potential impact of climate change locally.

AB  - Determining occurrence and distribution is an essential 1st step in conservation planning for rare species. Spatial habitat models can be used to increase efficiency of field surveys and to improve understanding about factors influencing animal distributions. We used a modeling approach to identify and prioritize potential habitat for survey efforts for an uncommon mammal, the pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), for which detailed habitat data are limited. A base map of potential habitat in Idaho was defined using vegetation type and soil depth data. Documented locations (n=164) were used to evaluate additional habitat variables to prioritize the potential habitat for surveys. We conducted field surveys to evaluate the predicted habitat attributes and document presence or absence of the species. Newly confirmed occurrences (n=112) and absences (n=139) were used to assess accuracy in predicting habitat priority ratings. Overall model accuracy was 65%. Eighty-four percent of the new occurrences were located in the 2 highest priority ranks, and < 0.4% were located in the 2 lowest priority ranks. We offer several examples of how survey results can be used to improve the habitat model and increase efficiency of future survey efforts.

AB  - LiDAR remote sensing allows the direct retrieval of vegetation structure parameters and has been widely used to assess habitat quality for various species. The aim of this study is to test whether LiDAR can help in providing estimates of habitat suitability over larger scales and inform conservation management planning in stronghold areas of an endangered forest mammal, the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris L.). The Eurasian red squirrel is endangered in the UK and under strict legal protection. Hence, long-term habitat management is a key goal of the UK conservation strategy. This involves understanding habitat preferences of the species. In a previous study, we demonstrated the importance of forest structure for red squirrels' habitat preference. We used a general linear model (GLM) to relate the distribution and abundance of squirrel feeding signs to mean canopy closure, mean tree height, and the total number of trees at the plot level. However, this analysis was limited to a few sample areas. In the current study, we implement the GLM using LiDAR-derived explanatory variables in Abernethy Forest. Results suggest that when forest structure is considered, only 27% of the total forest area is highly suitable for red squirrel. Implications for management are discussed.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change is affecting biodiversity. Reducing or stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions may slow global warming, but past emissions will continue to contribute to further unavoidable warming for more than a century. With obvious signs of difficulties in achieving effective mitigation worldwide in the short term at least, sound scientific predictions of future impacts on biodiversity will be required to guide conservation planning and adaptation. This is especially true in Mediterranean type ecosystems that are projected to be among the most significantly affected by anthropogenic climate change, and show the highest levels of confidence in rainfall projections. Multiple methods are available for projecting the consequences of climate change on the main unit of interest - the species - with each method having strengths and weaknesses. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied for forecasting climate change impacts on species geographic ranges. Aggregation of models for different species allows inferences of impacts on biodiversity, though excluding the effects of species interactions. The modelling approach is based on several further assumptions and projections and should be treated cautiously. In the absence of comparable approaches that address large numbers of species, SDMs remain valuable in estimating the vulnerability of species. In this review we discuss the application of SDMs in predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with special reference to the species-rich South West Australian Floristic Region and South African Cape Floristic Region. We discuss the advantages and challenges in applying SDMs in biodiverse regions with high levels of endemicity, and how a similar biogeographical history in both regions may assist us in understanding their vulnerability to climate change. We suggest how the process of predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with SDMs can be improved and emphasize the role of field monitoring and experiments in validating the predictions of SDMs.

AB  - Climate change has the potential to severely threaten endangered tree species. These species are important and sometimes dominant elements of natural communities. We conducted four years of field surveys to identify the distributions of endangered tree species present in the forests of north-eastern China. We conducted a detailed investigation of 1886 study plots and selected seven endangered trees (each with a total of 5 records) for further analysis. We modelled and mapped the distributions of potentially suitable climatic habitat for these species using the case of north-eastern China. We then developed a method that uses a combination of a species distribution model and geographic information system (GIS) to evaluate the ability of nature reserves to protect endangered tree species from disruptions caused by climate change. We found that the locations of suitable habitats for the seven endangered trees would shift variously according to different emissions scenarios and that this would result in a change in the effectiveness of each nature reserve to conserve the trees. Hence, emissions scenarios that result in increased amounts of suitable habitat give those nature reserves a strong ability to protect endangered trees. Emissions scenarios that result in decreased amounts of suitable land will decrease the ability of some nature reserves to protect endangered trees. Some of the tree species may be able to adapt to climate change, allowing the trees to survive in many of the nature reserves, but some may not. Ultimately, our method assesses the ability of nature reserves to protect endangered trees effectively and is a methodology that can be applied to any endangered species requiring planning for future protection and management.

AB  - Ecological Reserve determination for rivers in South Africa presently does not include it water temperature component, in spite of its importance in determining species distribution patterns. To achieve this requires an understanding of how lotic thermographs front South African rivers differ from northern hemisphere rivers, to avoid mismanaging rivers based oil incorrect regional assumptions. Hourly water temperatures from 20 sites in lour river systems, representing a range of latitudes, altitudes and stream orders, were assessed using a range of metrics. These data were analysed using principal component analyses and multiple linear regressions to understand what variables a water temperature model for use in ecoregions within South Africa should include. While temperature data are generally lacking in low- and higher-order South African rivers, data suggest that South African rivers are warmer than northern hemisphere rivers. Water temperatures could be grouped into cool, warm and intermediate types. Based oil temperature time series analyses, this paper argues that a suitable water-temperature model for use in ecological Reserve determinations should be dynamic, include flow and air temperature variables, and be adaptive through It heat exchange coefficient term. The inclusion of water temperature in the determination and management of river ecological Reserves would allow for more holistic application of the National Water Act's ecological management provisions. Water temperature guidelines added to the ecological Reserve could be integrated into heuristic aquatic monitoring programmes within priority areas identified in regional conservation plans.

AB  - Sandy beaches have been identified as threatened ecosystems but despite the need to conserve them, they have been generally overlooked. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) has emerged as an efficient method of selecting areas for conservation priority. However, SCP analyses require digital shapefiles of habitat and species diversity. Mapping these attributes for beaches from field data can take years and requires exhaustive resources. This study thus sought to derive a methodology to classify and map beach morphodynamic types from satellite imagery. Since beach morphodynamics is a strong predictor of macrofauna diversity, they could be considered a good surrogate for mapping beach biodiversity. A dataset was generated for 45 microtidal beaches (of known morphodynamic type) by measuring or coding for several physical characteristics from imagery acquired from Google Earth. Conditional inference trees revealed beach width to be the only factor that significantly predicted beach morphodynamic type, giving four categories: dissipative, dissipative-intermediate, intermediate and reflective. The derived model was tested by using it to predict the morphodynamic type of 28 other beaches of known classification. Model performance was good (75% prediction accuracy) but misclassifications occurred at the three breaks between the four categories. For beaches around these breaks, consideration of surf zone characteristics in addition to beach width ameliorated the misclassifications. The final methodology yielded a 93% prediction accuracy of beach morphodynamic type. Overlaying other considerations on this classification scheme could provide additional value to the layer, such that it also describes species' spatial patterns. These could include: biogeographic regions, estuarine versus sandy beaches and short versus long beaches. The classification scheme was applied to the South African shoreline as a case study. The distribution of the beach morphodynamic types was partly influenced by geography. Most of the long, dissipative beaches are found along the west coast of the country, the south coast beaches are mostly dissipative-intermediate, and the east coast beaches range from short, estuarine pocket and embayed beaches in the former Transkei (south east), to longer intermediate and reflective beaches in KwaZulu-Natal (in the north east). Once combined with the three biogeographic regions, and distinguishing between estuarine and sandy shores, the South African coast comprised 24 different beach types. Representing shorelines in this form opens up potential for numerous spatial analyses that can not only further our understanding of sandy beach ecology at large spatial scales but also aid in deriving conservation strategies for this threatened ecosystem.

AB  - In the context of urbanization, due to lack of the unified planning of land use for representative ecological indicators, the sustainable wildlife existence in urban ecosystems is emerging as a burning issue. A new descriptive method is proposed to establish the sustainable conservation strategy of protected wildlife in the current urbanization scenario. We use the Habitat Quality module in the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model (InVEST-HQ), straightforward construction package of complex ecological niche Ecological Niche Modeling at The MetaLand EcologyLab (ENMTML) and ecological corridors construction model Species Distribution Model toolbox (SDMtoolbox) to distinguish the priority protected areas (PAs) and construct the ecological corridors of Gallinula chloropus (G. chloropus) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China in 2018. The results show that the PAs are fragmented and only occupy 0.05% of total area in BTH region, which indicate an urgent conservation issue in highly urbanization area. For the sustainable conservation strategy of protected G. chloropus, 25 ecological corridors comprised 2790.8 km are required to construct, mainly distributed in Beijing and Tianjin city. Ecological corridors are also distributed close to the border of southeast, southwest and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. In order to optimize the ecological corridors, 9 important ecological corridors comprised 813.4 km are suggested to build firstly, which are mainly distributed in the central and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. Our combined modeling (ENMTML-InVEST-HQ) indicate that based on actual species occurrence data and land uses, it can successfully generate the PAs which should be paid more attention. Furthermore, concrete measures to build ecological corridors which connect PAs in BTH region are proposed. In order to well-targeted organized planning in highly urbanized areas, measures to protect key habitats of wildlife need to be defined and this research provides a reference for sustainable protection and management of wildlife.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly proposed as a fisheries management tool besides their conservation purposes. When assessing the ecological, economic, and social-cultural impacts of protection, the dynamics of fisheries and fishers reallocation within and around multiple-use MPAs should be analyzed. Despite this, few studies incorporate the baseline information of fisheries distribution, therefore compromising an understanding of fishers' preferences, choices and constrains before losing fishing grounds through the establishment of zoning and protection measures. To fulfil this gap, here we assess the spatial and seasonal fishers' preferences from local artisanal fisheries (nets, traps, jigs and longlines) before the implementation of a MPA management plan (the Arrabida Marine Park, Portugal). Zero inflated modelling, hotspot analysis, vessels distribution range and site fidelity statistics showed that the main drivers of fishing effort allocation are the placement of preferred fishing grounds which are likely related to the distribution of target species and associated habitats. Proximity to port, weather conditions and distance to coast are also important factors influencing, in different ways, these artisanal fisheries. Our findings highlight the complex dynamics of the distribution of artisanal fisheries operating multiple-gears and targeting multiple-species and are likely transferable to many coastal multiple-use MPAs where no baseline data exist. Moreover, the variety of responses and preferences found between gears and fishers before the establishment of zoning are important to understand the dynamics of local fisheries, to contribute to an ecosystem-based management and to improve both conservation and fisheries management decisions. Our study is one of the few characterizing fisheries dynamics and fishers' preferences before protection measures are implemented providing important lessons to the management of coastal fisheries where artisanal fisheries prevail.

AB  - The invasion of alien plant species is a serious problem for conservation and the maintenance of biodiversity in grasslands. Therefore, it is important to find environmental factors correlated with the distribution of invasive species in such areas. In this study, we examined the impacts of environmental factors operating at different spatial scales on the distribution of invasive species. The study area were located in the Sudetes Mountains, Poland (3800 km(2)). We sampled field data from 163 random plots located in grassland, among which there were 94 plots with invasive species and 69 plots without invasive species. For each plot, we collected data on resident vegetation (species richness, community structure), geodiversity (topography, soil type), environmental heterogeneity (landscape structure) and climate (temperature and precipitation). Since the factors examined are likely to operate at different spatial scales, we calculated values of environmental variables with different spatial scopes (10 m(2) plot and buffers with 50, 250 and 1250 m radii). The probability of invasive plant presence was modeled using boosted regression trees (BRT). The results of our study showed that the distribution of invasive species is explained by factors operated at different spatial scale: in the finer scale the presence of invasive species was driven predominantly by the average Ellenberg's Indicator Values for soil moisture, in medium-scale by the average topographic wetness index and sum of edges, while at coarse-scale by temperature. It was also presented that the effect of drivers operating at fine-spatial scale is overwhelming by effect of drivers operating at coarse scale. From a practical point of view, the results demonstrate that effective grassland management should be planned on a larger spatial context, because focussing on the management of a single site cannot be successful.

AB  - To conserve biological diversity, protected-area networks must be based not only on current species distributions but also on the landscape's long-term capacity to support populations. We used spatially explicit population models requiring detailed habitat and demographic data to evaluate the ability of existing park systems in the Rocky Mountain region (U.S.A. and Canada) to sustain populations of mammalian carnivores. Predicted patterns of extirpation agreed with those from logistic-regression models based only on park size and connectedness (or isolation) for the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) in developed landscapes (northern US. Rocky Mountains) and semideveloped landscapes (southern Canadian Rocky Mountains). The area-isolation model performed poorly where the landscape matrix contained large amounts of suitable habitat (northern Canadian Rocky Mountains). Park area and connectedness were poor predictors of gray wolf (Canis lupus) occurrence because of this species' broader-scale range dynamics and greater ability to inhabit the landscape matrix. A doubling of park area corresponded to a 47% and 57% increase in projected grizzly bear population persistence in developed and semideveloped landscapes, respectively. A doubling of a park's connectedness index corresponded to a 81% and 350% increase in population persistence in developed and semideveloped landscapes, respectively, suggesting that conservation planning to enhance connectivity may be most effective in the earliest stages of landscape degradation. The park area and connectivity required for population persistence increased as the landscape matrix became more hostile, implying that the relatively small combined area of parks in the boreal forest and other undeveloped regions may fall below the threshold for species persistence if parks become habitat islands. Loss of carnivores from boreal landscapes could further reduce the viability of temperate populations occupying refugia at the southern range margin. Spatially realistic population models may be more informative than simplerpatch-matrix models in predicting the effects of landscape change on population viability across a continuum of landscape degradation.

AB  - We investigated the brown bear habitat suitability in an 8000 kin 2 study area encompassing Abruzzo, Latium, and Molise regions in central-southern Italy. Based on long-term field surveys and published records, we classified bear habitat as occupied or unoccupied in 92 out of 320 sample squares (5 x 5 km). For each sample square 36 habitat variables were measured from topographic maps and Corine land-cover III level digital maps. The influence of habitat features on bear presence was investigated by multivariate and one-way analyses of variance and by logistic regression analysis. The logistic model correctly classified 95.5% of sample squares of bear presence and 93.8% of those where bears were absent. Average altitude, deciduous woodlands and ecotone length, showed a positive relationship with bear presence, whereas vineyard-olive groves and shrublands were negatively correlated with bear presence. No specific land management guidelines or strategies exist for bear conservation in central Italy, based on knowledge of habitat-population relationships. The landscape scale habitat model we developed could be useful to predict bear occurrence, to identify critical areas for a brown bear conservation strategy, and to enhance the arrangement of the protected areas network for the conservation of this species.

AB  - Forecasting future species distributions under climate change scenarios using Ecological Niche Models (ENM) is common practice. Typically, these projections do not account for landscape connectivity and species dispersal abilities. When they do account for these factors, they are based on either rather simplistic or overly complex and data-hungry approaches. Here we apply a new approach for predicting species range shifts under different climate change and landscape connectivity scenarios that balances data requirements and output quality. The approach builds on the metapopulation concept to produce a dispersal model based on repeated simulations of stochastic extinction-colonization dynamics across multiple landscapes of variable connectivity. The model is then combined with an ENM to produce more realistic predictions of species range shifts under environmental change. Using the near-threatened Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) as a model species and considering two contrasting climate change scenarios (B2 and Al b) and three scenarios of increasing landscape connectivity, we confirmed that model predictions based solely on ENM overestimated future range sizes (2050 and 2080) in relation to predictions incorporating both future climates and landscape connectivity constraints. This supports the idea that landscape change critically affects species range shifts in addition to climate change, and that models disregarding landscape connectivity tend to produce overly optimistic predictions, particularly for species with low dispersal abilities. We suggest that our empirically-based simulation modelling approach provides a useful framework to improve range shift predictions for a broad range of species, which is essential for the conservation planning of metapopulations under climate and landscape change.

AB  - In recent years, climate change has become a major threat and has been widely documented in the geographic distribution of many plant species. However, the impacts of climate change on the distribution of ecologically vulnerable medicinal species remain largely unknown. The identification of a suitable habitat for a species under climate change scenario is a significant step towards the mitigation of biodiversity decline. The study, therefore, aims to predict the impact of current, and future climatic scenarios on the distribution of the threatened Garcinia indica across the northern Western Ghats using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. The future projections were made for the year 2050 and 2070 with all Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenario (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) using 56 species occurrence data, and 19 bioclimatic predictors from the BCC-CSM1.1 model of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change's (IPCC) 5th assessment. The bioclimatic variables were minimised to a smaller number of variables after a multicollinearity test, and their contributions were assessed using jackknife test. The AUC value of 0.956 +/- 0.023 indicates that the model performs with excellent accuracy. The study identified that temperature seasonality (39.5 +/- 3.1%), isothermality (19.2 +/- 1.6%), and annual precipitation (12.7 +/- 1.7%) would be the major influencing variables in the current and future distribution. The model predicted 10.50% (19318.7 sq. km) of the study area as moderately to very highly suitable, while 82.60% (151904 sq. km) of the study area was identified as 'unsuitable' or 'very low suitable'. Our predictions of Climate change impact on habitat suitability suggest that there will be a drastic reduction in the suitability by 5.29% and 5.69% under RCP 8.5 for 2050 and 2070, respectively.
   Objective and Significance: Primary objective of this study is to identify the potential distribution of medicinally and ecologically important but threatened Garcinia indica species in the northern Western Ghats on the basis of species occurrence data and nineteen bioclimatic predictors. Using MaxEnt modelling, current and future species distribution and suitability has been predicted using the BCC-CSM1.1 and four RCP scenarios of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. The results also signify the bioclimatic variables contribution to the species distribution in northern Western Ghats.
   Finally, the results signify that the model might be an efficient tool for biodiversity protection, ecosystem management, and species re-habitation planning under future climate change scenarios.

AB  - A major challenge of regional conservation planning is the identification of sets of sites that together represent the overall biodiversity of the relevant region. Environmental cluster analysis (ECA) has been proposed as a potential tool for efficient selection of conservation sites, but the consequences of methodological decisions involved in its application have not been tested so far We evaluated the performance of ECA with respect to two such decisions: the choice of the-clustering algorithm (single linkage, complete linkage, unweighted arithmetic average, unweighted centroid, Ward's minimum variance, and the ALOC algorithm) and the weight given to different groups of environmental variables (rainfall, temperature, and lithology). Specifically we tested bow these decisions affect the spatial configuration of clusters-of sites defined by the ECA, whether and bow they affect the effectiveness of the ECA (i.e., its ability to represent regional species diversity), and whether the effectiveness of alternative methods of hierarchical clustering can be predicted a priori based on the cophenetic correlation. We used an extensive database of the flora of Israel to test these questions, Differences in both the clustering algorithm and the weighting regime had considerable effects on the spatial configuration of the ECA clusters. The single-linkage algorithm produced mostly single-cell clusters plus a single large-sized cluster and was therefore found inappropriate for environmental regionalization. The effectiveness of the ECA was also sensitive to changes in the clustering algorithm and the weighting regime. Yet, most combinations of clustering algorithms and weighting regimes performed significantly better in capturing regional biodiversity than random null models. The main deviation was classifications based on Ward's minimum variance algorithm, which performed less well relative to all other algorithms. The two algorithms that showed the highest effectiveness (unweighted average and unweighted centroid clustering) also exhibited the highest values of the cophenetic correlation, suggesting that this index may serve as a potential indicator for the effectiveness of alternative ECA algorithms.

AB  - Characterising the future risk to biodiversity across multiple environmental drivers is fraught with uncertainty and is a major conservation challenge. Scenario planning - to identify robust decisions across a range of plausible futures - can aid biodiversity conservation when tactical decisions need to be made in the present-day, yet consequences are realised over many decades. Management responses to the impact of tree disease are an excellent candidate for scenario planning, because actions to reduce an imminent biodiversity threat need to be effective in the long-term by accounting for concomitant factors such as a changing climate. Lichen epiphytes were used to exemplify a guild sensitive to woodland change, such as a tree disease impact. Bioclimatic models for 382 British epiphytes were combined with species-specific tree association values, to explore scenarios of tree disease (ash dieback), climate change, and range-filling under a lower SO2 pollution regime, for northern Britain focussed on Scotland. Results indicated: 1. Exposure of lichen diversity to projected climate change is spatially structured and expected to be greater in continental northeast Scotland, compared to oceanic western Scotland. 2. Impact of tree disease showed analogous geographic trends, evidencing a critical interaction between the climatic and local ecological setting. On average, the loss of ash could have an effect on epiphyte assemblages comparable in magnitude to that of climate change under a 2080s high emissions scenario. 3. In general, tree disease impacts can be mitigated by increasing the diversity of substitute tree species within a stand, to generate complementarity among epiphyte communities. However, the effectiveness of alternate management scenarios varied locally between sites and temporally with the progression of climate change. Given this variability, scenario analysis is recommended to effectively manage for resilience, by scoping how local factors (e.g. managed woodland composition) can reduce epiphyte assemblage turnover beyond that uniquely associated with larger-scale environmental impacts.

AB  - We estimated the potential impact of Global Warming on the species richness of Iberian butterflies. First, we determined the grid size that maximized the balance between geographic resolution, area coverage and environmental representativeness. Contemporary richness was modelled in several alternative ways that differed in how sampling effort was controlled for, and in whether the non-climatic variables (physiography, lithology, position) were incorporated. The results were extrapolated to four WorldClim scenarios. Richness loss is to be expected for at least 70% of the area, with forecasts from the combined models being only slightly more optimistic than those from the purely climatic ones. Overall, the most intense losses are predicted for areas of highest contemporary species richness, while the potential slightly positive or nearly neutral changes would most often concentrate in cells of low to moderate present richness. The environmental determinants of richness might not be uniform across the geographical range of sampling effort, suggesting the need of additional data from the least intensively surveyed areas. Implications for insect conservation Re-assessing richness and its environmental determinants in the area proves necessary for more detailed forecasts of the climate-driven changes in butterfly species richness. The expected future conditions imply widespread losses of regional richness, even under the less severe scenarios. Since the negative impact of warming is expected to be extensive, long term conservation plans should concentrate in the present protected areas of highest richness as these are most likely to represent the last refuges for mountain species.

AB  - We analyzed the applicability of forest planning data in predicting the occurrence of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) in managed northern boreal forests, in northeast Finland. Forest planning data is a source of information about forest characteristics for forest managers that may be used in estimating the availability of certain habitats for species conservation. Flying squirrel populations have declined in Finland, most probably due to habitat change and loss and maintenance of suitable habitats can be seen as a fundamental task in species conservation. First, we Surveyed 715 ha of older spruce-dominated forest consisting of 91 stands, of which 35 were found occupied by flying squirrel. Flying squirrels inhabited larger stands, which had a higher volume of spruce and birch. Occupied stands also had more good quality forests surrounding them than the unoccupied stands. We based the model building on already existing knowledge of the habitat preferences of the species and built four alternative predictive models with logistic regression. Forest planning data seemed useful in estimating the forest quality and the Suitability of habitats for the flying squirrel, with a model fit of ca. 72% with the original data. Second, we built the predictive models similarly with data from another study area (n = 98) situating ca. 150 km south from the first area. Third, we evaluated the first models using data of the second study area and also using new independent data from three municipalities situating almost in between the two study areas. Moreover, we reciprocally evaluated one model of the second study area using data of the first study area and of the three municipalities. The prediction success of our models indicated some applicability to other areas. The results also showed that the structure of the surrounding landscape is more important in a coarse-grained landscape than in a fine-grained landscape. However, because of some inaccuracies, predictive occupancy models built for the flying squirrel cannot replace field surveys and their generalizations to other areas must be made with caution.

AB  - In biogeography the competitive exclusion principle (CEP) has been confirmed in some cases but not in others. This has fueled an unresolved debate between those advocating niche theory or the neutral theory in biodiversity and biogeography. We suggest that this situation mainly arises from the use of crisp logic, where the CEP is defined as either completely true or false. We propose the application of the fuzzy concepts of favorability (the degree to which environmental conditions are propitious for the occurrence of individual species) and favorableness (the degree to which environmental conditions are simultaneously favorable for competing species) to operationalize a fuzzy version of the CEP. Favorability was obtained by performing species distribution models applying favorability functions, while favorableness was derived from the application of the fuzzy intersection between the favorability for competing species. Then we plotted individual favorability values along the gradient of favorableness. Two potentially competing species would coexist in high-favorableness locations, as the demands of both species would be well fulfilled. In locations of low favorableness, the result would be either autecological exclusion of both species or autecological segregation, as abiotic conditions are unfavorable for at least one of the species. Competitive exclusion would occur at the intermediate stretch of the favorableness gradient, as the conditions would be good enough for persistence of each species separately but not enough for permanent coexistence. According to this theoretical framework, the observed probability that a location belongs to the intermediate favorableness area given that the two species co-occur in this location should be lower than expected according to the environmental probability models for the two species. We tested this prediction on published data about the distribution of pairs of native and introduced deer species in Great Britain, using a Bayesian approach. In two thirds of comparisons between a native and an introduced deer species the predictions of the fuzzy CEP were corroborated, which suggests that these are the pairs of species and the specific geographical areas affected by competitive exclusion. This is important both theoretically and for biodiversity conservation planning.

AB  - Reliably modelling the demographic and distributional responses of a species to environmental changes can be crucial for successful conservation and management planning. Process-based models have the potential to achieve this goal, but so far they remain underused for predictions of species' distributions. Individual-based models offer the additional capability to model inter-individual variation and evolutionary dynamics and thus capture adaptive responses to environmental change. We present RangeShiftR, an R implementation of a flexible individual-based modelling platform which simulates eco-evolutionary dynamics in a spatially explicit way. The package provides flexible and fast simulations by making the software RangeShifter available for the widely used statistical programming platform R. The package features additional auxiliary functions to support model specification and analysis of results. We provide an outline of the package's functionality, describe the underlying model structure with its main components and present a short example. RangeShiftR offers substantial model complexity, especially for the demographic and dispersal processes. It comes with elaborate tutorials and comprehensive documentation to facilitate learning the software and provide help at all levels. As the core code is implemented in C++, the computations are fast. The complete source code is published under a public licence, making adaptations and contributions feasible. The RangeShiftR package facilitates the application of individual-based and mechanistic modelling to eco-evolutionary questions by operating a flexible and powerful simulation model from R. It allows effortless interoperation with existing packages to create streamlined workflows that can include data preparation, integrated model specification and results analysis. Moreover, the implementation in R strengthens the potential for coupling RangeShiftR with other models.

AB  - This study attempts to link the distribution and movement rate of the critically endangered Arabian Leopard (Panthera pardus nimr) to environmental and anthropogenic features, and to identify environmental constraints and priority areas for the recovery of leopard in Arabian Peninsula. Generalized linear and additive models were used to fit leopard presence/absence locations to environmental and anthropogenic variables. Movement rates between the polygons of modeled leopard presence were inferred and mapped using the isolation-by-resistance model, where probability values of the species distribution model were treated as those of conductance. Our results suggest that currently the Arabian Leopard prefers to live and move in terrain that has high values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and is difficult for humans to reach. The current network of protected areas largely under-represents the species suitable habitat only covering its 11%, and most of the survey effort to detect and ensure the survival of the leopard in the peninsula has taken place outside the polygons identified by our models as core areas for the species. Our models coupled with existing data suggest the following scenario of the species biogeography: The Arabian Leopard accumulated genetic and phenotypic differences from its conspecifics at a series of glacial maxima during the last glacial period in the Yemeni refugium, from where it expanded elsewhere in the Holocene warming following the expansion of suitable landscape types. Humans expanded too, eventually restricting the source populations of the leopard to an area intersecting eastern Yemen and western Oman today. Our models may serve as a tool for planning future research and conservation for Arabian Leopard.

AB  - Context Better balancing agricultural production and biodiversity conservation is a central goal for many landscapes. Yet, empirical work on how to best achieve such a balance has focused mainly on the local scale, thereby disregarding that landscape context might mediate biodiversity-agriculture trade-offs. Objectives Focusing on vertebrates in the Argentine Chaco, we evaluate how trade-offs between agriculture and biodiversity vary with landscape context, from landscapes where agricultural and natural areas are separated to landscapes where both are interspersed. Methods We modelled the distributions of 226 vertebrates and use the resulting maps to describe the species richness of ecosystem-service providing guilds. We calculated three agricultural intensity metrics, and evaluated how both species richness and agricultural intensity vary along a gradient of landscape configuration, while controlling for landscape composition. Results Species richness and agricultural yields both varied with landscape configuration. Biodiversity was highest in mixed landscapes where agricultural and natural area are interspersed, whereas agricultural yields showed a more heterogeneous response, with some yield metrics highest in mixed and others in separated landscapes. As a result, agriculture/biodiversity trade-offs depended strongly on landscape configuration, irrespective of landscape composition. We also identified large areas with low vertebrate richness and agricultural yields, suggesting considerable potential for improving in at least one dimension. Conclusions Agriculture/biodiversity trade-offs varied with landscape configuration, suggesting that landscape design can balance these trade-offs. Our simple and broadly applicable approach can provide baseline information for landscape planning aimed at realizing co-benefits between agriculture and biodiversity-in the Gran Chaco and elsewhere.

AB  - We provide a global, spatially explicit characterization of 47 terrestrial habitat types, as defined in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) habitat classification scheme, which is widely used in ecological analyses, including for quantifying species' Area of Habitat. We produced this novel habitat map for the year 2015 by creating a global decision tree that intersects the best currently available global data on land cover, climate and land use. We independently validated the map using occurrence data for 828 species of vertebrates (35152 point plus 8181 polygonal occurrences) and 6026 sampling sites. Across datasets and mapped classes we found on average a balanced accuracy of 0.77 (-/+ 0.14SD) at Level 1 and 0.71 (-/+ 0.15SD) at Level 2, while noting potential issues of using occurrence records for validation. The maps broaden our understanding of habitats globally, assist in constructing area of habitat refinements and are relevant for broad-scale ecological studies and future IUCN Red List assessments. Periodic updates are planned as better or more recent data becomes available.

AB  - Although Albania has a rich reptile fauna, efforts to reveal its diversity have so far been limited. To fill this gap, we collected available published and unpublished (museum collections, online sources) records of reptile occurrences and conducted several expeditions to search for reptiles in areas with few or no previous records. Our georeferenced database contains 3731 records of 40 species from between 1918 and 2015. Based on this comprehensive dataset, we prepared distribution maps for each reptile species of the country. Applying spatial statistics, we revealed that overall sampling effort was clustered, with hotspots associated with easily accessible areas and natural heritage sites. The maximum number of species per cell was 26 with an average of seven. Cells harbouring large reptile diversity were located along the Adriatic and Ionian coasts, on the western slopes of south Albanian mountains, i.e. in areas generally considered as Balkans biodiversity hotspots or potential historical refugia. We found that species presence and diversity is strongly influenced by landscape features. Diversity of land cover, altitudinal variation, temperature and precipitation variation explained the observed pattern in our models. Our study presents the largest database of reptile occurrences to date and is the first to analyse reptile diversity patterns in Albania. The database and the diversity patterns can provide a basis for future macroecological studies and conservation planning.

AB  - Decreased snowpack with climate warming will shift the timing of peak streamflows, decrease summer low flows, and in combination with higher air temperature, increase stream temperatures, all of which will reduce the vigor of cold-water fish species. Abundance and distribution of cutthroat trout and especially bull trout will be greatly reduced, although effects will differ by location as a function of both stream temperature and competition from non-native fish species. Increased wildfire will add sediment to streams, increase peak flows and channel scouring, and raise stream temperature by removing vegetation.
   Primary strategies to address climate change threats to cold-water fish species include maintaining or restoring functionality of channels and floodplains to retain ( cool) water and buffer against future changes, decreasing fragmentation of stream networks so aquatic organisms can access similar habitats, and developing wildfire use plans that address sediment inputs and road failures. Adaptation tactics include using watershed analysis to develop integrated actions for vegetation and hydrology, protecting groundwater and springs, restoring riparian areas and American beaver populations to maintain summer baseflows, reconnecting and increasing off-channel habitat and refugia, identifying and improving stream crossings that impede fish movement, decreasing road connectivity, and revegetating burned areas to store sediment and maintain channel geomorphology. Removing non-native fish species and reducing their access to cold-water habitat reduces competition with native fish species.

AB  - 1. The Amur or Siberian tiger Panthera tigris altaica forms a relatively small and disjunct population of less than 600 individuals in the Russian Far East. Because tigers in this region require large territories to acquire sufficient prey, current strictly protected areas, comprising 3.4% (10 300 km(2)) of the region, are unlikely to prevent extirpation of the subspecies in the face of expanding forestry and external demand for tiger parts.
   2. We used resource selection function models and spatially explicit population models to analyse the distribution and predict the demographic structure of the population to identify policy options that may enhance population viability.
   3. A resource selection function model developed from track distribution data predicted that tigers were most likely to occur in lower altitude valley bottoms with Korean pine forest and low human impacts.
   4. The results from the spatially explicit population model suggested that current tiger distribution is highly dependent on de facto refugia with low human impacts but without statutory protection, and that small increases in mortality in these areas will result in range fragmentation. Although an expanded reserve network only marginally increases tiger viability under current conditions, it dramatically enhances distribution under potential future scenarios, preventing regional extirpation despite a more hostile landscape matrix.
   5. The portion of tiger range most resistant to extirpation connects a large coastal reserve in the central portion of the region with largely unprotected watersheds to the north. A southern block of habitat is also important but more severely threatened with anthropogenic disturbances. The results suggest that preserving source habitat in these two zones and ensuring linkages are retained between blocks of habitat in the north and south will be critical to the survival of the tiger population.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Conservation priorities identified in this analysis differ from those suggested by a conservation paradigm focusing only on sustaining and connecting existing protected areas that has been applied to tiger conservation in more developed landscapes with higher prey densities. An alternative paradigm that assesses population viability in a whole-landscape context and develops priorities for both protected area expansion and increasing survival rates in the landscape matrix may be more appropriate in areas where tigers and other large carnivores coexist with low-density human populations. Although landscape connectivity merits increased emphasis in conservation planning, identification of landscape linkages should be tied to broad-scale recommendations resulting from spatial viability analyses in order to prevent misdirection of resources towards protecting corridors that add little to population persistence.

AB  - Long-distance movements are important adaptive behaviors that contribute to population, community, and ecosystem connectivity. However, researchers have a poor understanding of the characteristics of long-distance movements for most species. Here, we examined long-distance movements for the lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), a species of conservation concern. We addressed the following questions: (1) At what distances could populations be connected? (2) What are the characteristics and probability of dispersal movements? (3) Do lesser prairie-chickens display exploratory and round-trip movements? (4) Do the characteristics of long-distance movements vary by site? Movements were examined from populations using satellite GPS transmitters across the entire distribution of the species in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado. Dispersal movements were recorded up to 71 km net displacement, much farther than hitherto recorded. These distances suggest that there may be greater potential connectivity among populations than previously thought. Dispersal movements were displayed primarily by females and had a northerly directional bias. Dispersal probabilities ranged from 0.08 to 0.43 movements per year for both sexes combined, although these movements averaged only 16 km net displacement. Lesser prairie-chickens displayed both exploratory foray loops and round-trip movements. Half of round-trip movements appeared seasonal, suggesting a partial migration in some populations. None of the long-distance movements varied by study site. Data presented here will be important in parameterizing models assessing population viability and informing conservation planning, although further work is needed to identify landscape features that may reduce connectivity among populations.

AB  - Dhole (Cuon alpinus) is threatened with extinction across its range due to habitat loss and prey depletion. Despite this, no previous study has investigated the distribution and threat of the species at a regional scale. This lack of knowledge continues to impede conservation planning for the species. Here we modeled suitable habitat using presence-only camera trap data for dhole and dhole prey species in mainland Southeast Asia and assessed the threat level to dhole in this region using an expert-informed Bayesian Belief Network. We integrated prior information to identify dhole habitat strongholds that could support populations over the next 50 years. Our habitat suitability model identified forest cover and prey availability as the most influential factors affecting dhole occurrence. Similarly, our threat model predicted that forest loss and prey depletion were the greatest threats, followed by local hunting, non-timber forest product collection, and domestic dog incursion into the forest. These threats require proactive resource management, strong legal protection, and cross-sector collaboration. We predicted <20% of all remaining forest cover in our study area to be suitable for dhole. We then identified 17 patches of suitable forest area as potential strongholds. Among these patches, Western Forest Complex (Thailand) was identified as the region's only primary stronghold, while Taman Negara (Malaysia), and northeastern landscape (Cambodia) were identified as secondary strongholds. Although all 17 patches met our minimum size criteria (1667 km(2)), patches smaller than 3333 km(2) may require site management either by increasing the ecological carrying capacity (i.e., prey abundance) or maintaining forest extent. Our proposed interventions for dhole would also strengthen the conservation of other co-occurring species facing similar threats. Our threat assessment technique of species with scarce information is likely replicable with other endangered species.

AB  - In national conservation plans, it is necessary to comparatively assess species pools of different regions and monitor their changes over time. Two specific problems arise: i) species diversity must be standardized per area, because regions differ in size, and ii) the diversity measure should take into account how common or rare the species are on the regional scale. We used the rarefaction method combined with a fitting procedure to calculate the expected number of species E(S). The method takes into account the nonlinearity of species and area, as well as how common or rare each species is and allows analysis of species groups' contribution to total species diversity. The slope parameter of the fitted power function is used as an indicator of species turnover, and thus, of beta-diversity. For the analysis, Switzerland was divided into seven biogeographic regions (256-10 642 km(2)). The diversity of the total species pool and of six ecological species groups was investigated for each region. In every biogeographic region, we find the lowest species turnover in the fertilized meadow group, and the highest species turnover in the pioneer/weedy species and the mountain species groups pioneer/weedy. The results show that among Swiss regions, differences in E(S) are mainly due to the presence or absence of mountain species. Other species groups show a rather constant contribution to the regional species pools. We found the rarefaction method to be a very useful tool for assessing Swiss plant species diversity on a regional scale.

AB  - Knowledge of the distribution of plant species is essential for planning management and conservation actions, especially for economically important species. Available data on plant species in the Amazon usually do not represent their whole area of occurrence. The most widely used approach to infer predictions on species occurrence is niche modelling, which consists of correlating records of species with environmental conditions in their occurrence areas, generating maps with the potential distribution based on a combination of environmental features suitable for each species. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of modelling to improve knowledge on the distribution of six timber species and six palm trees in the Amazon, and whether these models can benefit from using data from field surveys added to those of biological collections. Models were generated using the Maxent algorithm. All models generated showed a low extrinsic omission rate (TOE) and AUC above 0.75. Areas predicted for timber species were more consistent with empirical knowledge than those predicted for palm trees, probably due to the greater amount of occurrence sites available for timber species, especially after adding data from field surveys. The extent of the predicted area and the Jaccard index were used to compare the maps after insertion of field survey data. There was a large difference in extent just for two species, one timber and one palm, and a reduction in the predicted area for one species, Swietenia macro phylla. The application of the Jaccard index resulted in values between 0.41 and 0.65 for timber species, reinforcing that the inclusion of field survey data changed predicted areas. For palms, the similar extent of predicted areas and Jaccard values above 0.80, indicated a subtle difference between maps generated before and after the inclusion of field survey records, probably due to the addition of fewer records. The exception was Astrocaryum murumuru, for which the new records increased the extent of the predicted area. The niche models associated with field studies can contribute enormously to increase knowledge concerning the current distribution of species, but new field surveys should be carefully designed to cover wide and undersampled areas. However, it is necessary to consider that this strategy can only be adopted for species with clearly distinctive features, for which field identifications are reliable. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   Methods. A range of methods are used including: multilocus phylogeography (chloroplast and high- and low-copy nuclear DNA), molecular dating and species distribution modelling (SDM).
   Results. The results support an 'evolutionarily distinct catchment' hypothesis where: (1) different catchments contain genetically distinct lineages, (2) limited genetic structuring was detected within basins whilst high structuring was detected between basins, and (3) within primary catchment populations display a high degree of genealogical lineage sorting. In addition, the results support,la glacial refugia hypothesis as: (a) the timing of chloroplast lineage diversification is restricted to the Pleistocene in a landscape that has been relatively unchanged since the late Pliocene, and (b) the projected LGIVI distribution of suitable climate for N. capensis suggest fragmentation into refugia that correspond to the current phylogeographic populations.
   Discussion. This study highlights the interaction of topography and subtle Pleistocene climate variations as drivers limiting both seed and pollen flow along these lowlands. This lends support to the region's large-scale conservation planning efforts, which used catchments as foundational units for conservation as these are likely to be evolutionarily significant units.

AB  - The identification of geographical distribution of a plant species is crucial for understanding the importance of environmental variables affecting plant habitat. In the present study, the spatial potential distribution of Astragalus fasciculifolius Boiss. as a key specie was mapped using maximum entropy (Maxent) as data mining technique and bivariate statistical model (FR: frequency ratio) in marl soils of southern Zagros, Iran. The A. fasciculifolius locations were identified and recorded by intensive field campaigns. Then, localities points were randomly split into a 70% training dataset and 30% for validation. Two climatic, four topographic, and eight edaphic variables were used to model the A. fasciculifolius distribution and its habitat potential. Maps of environmental variables were generated using Geographic Information System (GIS). Next, the habitat suitability index (HSI) maps were produced and classified by means of Maxent and FR approaches. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve was used to compare the performance of maps produced by Maxent and FR models. The interpretation of environmental variables revealed that the climatic and topographic parameters had less impact compared to edaphic variables in habitat distribution of A. fasciculifolius. The results showed that bulk density, nitrogen, acidity (pH), sand, and electrical conductivity (EC) of soil are the most significant variables that affect distribution of A. fasciculifolius. The validation of results showed that AUC values of Maxent and FR models are 0.83 and 0.76, respectively. The habitat suitability map by the better model (Maxent) showed that areas with high and very high suitable classes cover approximately 22% of the study area. Generally, the habitat suitability map produced using Maxent model could provide important information for conservation planning and a reclamation project of the degraded habitat of intended plant species. The distribution of the plants identifies the water, soil, and nutrient resources and affects the fauna distribution, and this is why it is relevant to research and to understand the plant distribution to properly improve the management and to achieve a sustainable management.

AB  - Amphibians are particularly vulnerable to climate changes that are expected to cause habitat fragmentation and loss and, ultimately, local extirpations. However, little is known about how the interaction between climate change and fragmentation may impede the ability of amphibians to adapt to climate change. Here, we used the iconic mountain frog Quasipaa boulengeri as an indicator species to extrapolate climate-driven shifts in its habitat availability and connectivity in central and southern China according to the minimum and maximum rep-resentative concentration pathways. The models projected an average habitat loss of 36%-71% and the in situ and ex situ climate-change refugia to be 29%-64% and 5%-18% of the present-day suitable habitats, respectively. An increase in habitat fragmentation was reflected in a 51% decrease in core patch size, a 9% increase in the mean least-cost path (LCP) length, and a 19% increase in the cost-weighted distance. These climate-driven shifts varied spatially around the Sichuan Basin, with those in the southeast of the Basin being the most pronounced habitat and connectivity losses and those along the Basin being relatively optimistic. The effectiveness of refugia may only be maintained through a narrow passageway along the southern Sichuan Basin because of the presence of LCPs over time. Our results emphasize the need to understand how climate change and connectivity will jointly affect the distribution of mountain amphibians and to accordingly adopt conservation strategies. Further, our findings highlight the importance of identifying and preserving climate-change refugia and habitat connectivity for species persistence and conservation planning. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Livestock predation by tiger and leopard in Bhutan is a major threat to the conservation of these felids. Conflict mitigation planning would benefit from an improved understanding of the spatial pattern of livestock kills by the two predators.
   We aimed to identify the landscape features that predict livestock kills by tiger and leopard throughout Bhutan. Our goals were to: (1) identify the predictors that have the largest influence in determining livestock kills, (2) assess the influence of scale across the different predictors evaluated and identify the scale at which each was most important.
   We used livestock kills obtained from compensation records of tiger (n = 326) and leopard (n = 377) across Bhutan between 2003 and 2012 to run predation risk models with MaxEnt algorithm, using a multi-scale modeling approach (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 km).
   Human-presence (density of settlements and roads) and land-cover (percentage of tree cover and meadow patches) were the main variables contributing to livestock kills by both species. Livestock kills were likely driven by a trade-off between livestock density and predator ecology, and the balance of this trade-off varied with scale. Risk maps revealed different hotspots for tiger and leopard kills, and analysis showed both species preferentially killed equids over other livestock types.
   Our results highlight the importance of evaluating scale when investigating the spatial attributes of livestock kills by tiger and leopard. Our findings provide guidance for reducing conflict between humans and large felids throughout the country.

AB  - Background: Minimizing fishery bycatch threats might involve trade-offs between maintaining viable populations and economic benefits. Understanding these trade-offs can help managers reconcile conflicting goals. An example is a set of bycatch reduction measures for the Critically Endangered vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus), in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico. The vaquita is an endemic species threatened with extinction by artisanal net bycatch within its limited range; in this area fisheries are the chief source of economic productivity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyze trade-offs between conservation of the vaquita and fisheries, using an end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model for the Northern Gulf of California. Atlantis is a spatially-explicit model intended as a strategic tool to test alternative management strategies. We simulated increasingly restrictive fisheries regulations contained in the vaquita conservation plan: implementing progressively larger spatial management areas that exclude gillnets, shrimp driftnets and introduce a fishing gear that has no vaquita bycatch. We found that only the most extensive spatial management scenarios recovered the vaquita population above the threshold necessary to downlist the species from Critically Endangered. The scenario that excludes existing net gear from the 2008 area of vaquita distribution led to moderate decrease in net present value (US$ 42 million) relative to the best-performing scenario and a two-fold increase in the abundance of adult vaquita over the course of 30 years.
   Conclusions/Significance: Extended spatial management resulted in the highest recovery of the vaquita population. The economic cost of proposed management actions was unequally divided between fishing fleets; the loss of value from finfish gillnet fisheries was never recovered. Our analysis shows that managers will have to confront difficult trade-offs between management scenarios for vaquita conservation.

AB  - Upper trophic level predators dramatically impacted by fisheries include the large-bodied hammerhead sharks, which have become species of conservation concern worldwide. Implementing spatial management for conservation of hammerhead populations requires knowledge of temporal distribution patterns and habitat use, identification of essential habitat for protection, and quantification of interactions with human activities. There is little such information for the smooth hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena. We used fin-mounted satellite tags to examine the movements and habitat use of juvenile smooth hammerheads, a demographic segment particularly threatened by exploitation. Six sharks were tagged off the US mid-Atlantic and tracked for 49-441 days (mean 187 +/- 136 days). Sharks consistently showed area-restricted movements within a summer core area in waters of the New York Bight and a winter core area off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with directed movements between them in autumn. There was high overlap of shark winter core area use and the Mid-Atlantic Shark Area (MASA) - a 7 month per year, bottom-longline fishery closure - indicating that this area closure offers seasonal reduction in fishing pressure for this species. Based on timing of shark movements and the MASA closure, protection for juvenile smooth hammerheads may be increased by beginning the closure period 1 month earlier than currently scheduled. Generalized additive mixed models revealed that area-restricted movements of sharks in their summer and winter core areas coincided with high primary productivity, and elevated sea surface temperature. Consistency in use of summer and winter core areas suggests that the coastal waters of the New York Bight and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina could be considered for Essential Fish Habitat designation for this species. This study reveals the first high resolution movements and habitat use for smooth hammerheads in the western North Atlantic to inform management planning for this population.

AB  - The combined study of movement patterns and habitat selection, behaviors that are affected by landscape structure, is of critical importance for effective conservation of wildlife. In the same context, maintaining connectivity is a key component for facilitating movement and ensuring species persistence. The brown bear is a wide-ranging predator that moves across large areas, crossing various habitats of different quality. Here, we provide a methodological framework that allowed us to explore the relative importance of habitat quality upon movement patterns and connectivity. First, we developed habitat-suitability models by using telemetry data of eight male brown bears (12,893 radio-locations) collected in Greece. Next, we combined habitat-suitability maps with real movement data to develop graph models that represent movement networks as inter-connected patches of different quality. Network analyses revealed that movement networks demonstrate some well-studied properties regarding their structure and robustness (i.e. scale-free and small-world), providing insights on the contribution of patches of different quality to connectivity. Less suitable patches were found to play a critical role for facilitating brown bear's movement and landscape connectivity. Our findings raise the importance of considering the entire habitat of brown bear in conservation planning rather than isolated patches of high quality, as it might have been revealed by simple habitat-suitability models. Our results highlight the need of assessing the importance of the intervening matrix for facilitating connectivity and movement specifically in the case of large and highly mobile species that do not perceive landscape as strictly dichotomous.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch can severely affect the population status of species with low resilience such as sharks. Bycatch monitoring is an important issue for the development of conservation and management plans for these species. The main objectives of this study were to quantify and model the spatiotemporal trend of bycatch for porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus) in the Argentinean surimi trawl fleet to identify hotspots in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Using onboard observer data, we have demonstrated that L. nasus was usually caught as bycatch by the surimi trawl fleet operating in the southern limits of the southwestern Atlantic (51 degrees S-57 degrees S), representing an important part of the reported catch for the Atlantic Ocean. Delta and Tweedie models indicated that bycatch had a relatively stable trend, was concentrated in a limited region of the study area, and was associated with spatiotemporal, operational, environmental, and prey availability variables. The model with the best predictive capability used for the spatial delineation of hotspots for L. nasus bycatch showed that the areas located south of 54 degrees 12'S and over the continental shelf-break were critical for the porbeagle conservation and management strategies in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - As an iconic species linked to First Nations culture and economy in western North America, wild plains bison (Bison bison bison) currently rely on intensive management to persist. Yet, their presence maintains grassland ecological function, protects biodiversity and preserves important cultural heritage. Estimating carrying capacity is a key to achieve wildlife conservation without risking overall ecosystem health. Plains bison carrying capacity should be estimated to provide guideline for developing subsequent management plans. We reckoned that drivers of plains bison carrying capacity are forage availability and animal requirement, meanwhile its adjusting factors comprise spatio-temporal distribution and sustainable consideration. An integration of remote sensing and GIS can help to investigate variables of carrying capacity. Also Habitat Suitability Model built in Geographic Information System (GIS) is able to compile variables influencing carrying capacity. The review found multiple challenges of carrying capacity estimation in terms of implementing and practicing not only from remote sensing and GIS perspective. We expect that the advancement of remote sensors in accordance with modern GIS technology can provide timely effective carrying capacity estimation to achieve conservation goals of animal species as well as maintain sustainable ecosystems.

AB  - Natural resource managers are tasked with assessing the impacts of climate change on conservation targets and developing adaptation strategies to meet agency goals. The complex, transboundary nature of climate change demands the collaboration of scientists, managers, and stakeholders in this effort. To share, integrate, and apply knowledge from these diverse perspectives, we must engage in social learning. In 2009, we initiated a process to engage university researchers and agency scientists and managers in collaborative learning to assess the impacts of climate change on terrestrial fauna in the state of Wisconsin, USA. We constructed conceptual Bayesian networks to depict the influence of climate change, key biotic and abiotic factors, and existing stressors on the distribution and abundance of 3 species: greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), and Karner blue butterfly (Plebejus melissa samuelis). For each species, we completed a 2-stage expert review that elicited dialogue on information gaps, management opportunities, and research priorities. From our experience, collaborative network modeling proved to be a powerful tool to develop a common vision of the potential impacts of climate change on conservation targets.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) that span elevational gradients enhance protection for taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and facilitate species range shifts under climate change. We quantified the global protection of elevational gradients by analyzing the elevational distributions of 44,155 PAs in 1,010 mountain ranges using the highest resolution digital elevation models available. We show that, on average, mountain ranges in Africa and Asia have the lowest elevational protection, ranges in Europe and South America have intermediate elevational protection, and ranges in North America and Oceania have the highest elevational protection. We use the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11 to assess the proportion of elevational gradients meeting the 17% suggested minimum target and examine how different protection categories contribute to elevational protection. When considering only strict PAs [International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories I-IV, n = 24,706], nearly 40% of ranges do not contain any PAs, roughly half fail to meet the 17% target at any elevation, and similar to 75% fail to meet the target throughout >= 50% of the elevational gradient. Observed elevational protection is well below optimal, and frequently below a null model of elevational protection. Including less stringent PAs (IUCN categories V-VI and nondesignated PAs, n = 19,449) significantly enhances elevational protection for most continents, but several highly biodiverse ranges require new or expanded PAs to increase elevational protection. Ensuring conservation outcomes for PAs with lower IUCN designations as well as strategically placing PAs to better represent and connect elevational gradients will enhance ecological representation and facilitate species range shifts under climate change.

AB  - Although there is increasing evidence for the effects on wildlife of primary infrastructure (paved roads and human settlements), the effect of secondary infrastructure (tracks and isolated buildings) is generally assumed to be low in sparsely developed areas. We hypothesized that secondary infrastructure may have a negative effect similar to that of primary infrastructure, and hence may be the source of extended impacts in landscapes that are otherwise relatively undisturbed. We studied multi-year breeding site data for a community of large birds (raptors and storks) in the Monfrague Biosphere Reserve, in the south-west Iberian Peninsula. Using a bootstrap model selection approach we modelled the distribution of breeding sites, using as predictors measures of habitat accessibility (relief, hydrography) and various types of infrastructure (primary and secondary) at different scales. Distance effect functions were developed. Secondary infrastructure exerted a negative effect on breeding sites that was equivalent to that of primary infrastructure, in terms of both transport (track vs road) and dwellings (scattered vs aggregated). The negative effect was distance (rather than density) mediated, and remained within the 1 km scale. The potential impact of secondary infrastructure is greater than that of primary infrastructure as it occupies more extensive areas and includes richer communities, with significant proportions of threatened populations. Our results contradict common assumptions about the negligible impact of secondary infrastructure on biodiversity, reveal new challenges for biodiversity conservation, and provide insights relevant for the spatial planning of isolated buildings and tracks in sparsely developed areas with species of conservation interest.

AB  - Background Understanding the impacts of past and contemporary climate change on biodiversity is critical for effective conservation. Amphibians have weak dispersal abilities, putting them at risk of habitat fragmentation and loss. Both climate change and anthropogenic disturbances exacerbate these risks, increasing the likelihood of additional amphibian extinctions in the near future. The giant spiny frog (Quasipaa spinosa), an endemic species to East Asia, has faced a dramatic population decline over the last few decades. Using the giant spiny frog as an indicator to explore how past and future climate changes affect landscape connectivity, we characterized the shifts in the suitable habitat and habitat connectivity of the frog. Results We found a clear northward shift and a reduction in the extent of suitable habitat during the Last Glacial Maximum for giant spiny frogs; since that time, there has been an expansion of the available habitat. Our modelling showed that "overwarm" climatic conditions would most likely cause a decrease in the available habitat and an increase in the magnitude of population fragmentation in the future. We found that the habitat connectivity of the studied frogs will decrease by 50-75% under future climate change. Our results strengthen the notion that the mountains in southern China and the Sino-Vietnamese transboundary regions can act as critical refugia and priority areas of conservation planning going forward. Conclusions Given that amphibians are highly sensitive to environmental changes, our findings highlight that the responses of habitat suitability and connectivity to climate change can be critical considerations in future conservation measures for species with weak dispersal abilities and should not be neglected, as they all too often are.

AB  - Human-induced changes to river loads of nutrients and sediments pose a significant threat to marine ecosystems. Ongoing land-use change can further increase these loads, and amplify the impacts of land-based threats on vulnerable marine ecosystems. Consequently, there is a need to assess these threats and prioritise actions to mitigate their impacts. A key question regarding prioritisation is whether actions in catchments tomaintain coastal-marine water quality can be spatially congruent with actions for other management objectives, such as conserving terrestrial biodiversity. In selected catchments draining into the Gulf of California, Mexico, we employed Land Change Modeller to assess the vulnerability of areas with native vegetation to conversion into crops, pasture, and urban areas. We then used SedNet, a catchment modelling tool, to map the sources and estimate pollutant loads delivered to the Gulf by these catchments. Following these analyses, we used modelled river plumes to identify marine areas likely influenced by land-based pollutants. Finally, we prioritised areas for catchment management based on objectives for conservation of terrestrial biodiversity and objectives for water quality that recognised links between pollutant sources and affected marine areas. Our objectives for coastal-marine water quality were to reduce sediment and nutrient discharges from anthropic areas, and minimise future increases in coastal sedimentation and eutrophication. Our objectives for protection of terrestrial biodiversity covered species of vertebrates. We used Marxan, a conservation planning tool, to prioritise interventions and explore spatial differences in priorities for both objectives. Notable differences in the distributions of land values for terrestrial biodiversity and coastal-marine water quality indicated the likely need for trade-offs between catchment management objectives. However, there were priority areas that contributed to both sets of objectives. Our study demonstrates a practical approach to integrating models of catchments, land-use change, and river plumes with conservation planning software to inform prioritisation of catchment management.

AB  - The Great Bustard is afforded the highest category of protection in China. This species has disappeared from much of its former range, and identification of factors influencing habitat suitability can play a key role in development of conservation plans. We used distance sampling and interviews to census Great Bustards in the Tacheng Basin of western China in October from 2014 to 2016, and obtained 210 occurrence points. We then used high-resolution species distribution models to explore the role of 16 environmental variables, including a novel high-resolution contemporary climate dataset, in habitat suitability. Our ensemble model classifies approximately 3,885 km2, or 9.9% of our study area in the most suitable and moderately suitable categories. These suitable areas are distributed primarily in the north of our study area, in farmlands along the southern slope of Talbahetai Mountain, and to a lesser degree along the eastern slope of Balluk Mountain. The variables which contributed most significantly to habitat suitability include distance to county highway, elevation, distance to field edge, and mean summer temperature. We propose reducing disturbance associated with roads by conducting awareness campaigns among local residents and creating campaigns and policies to promote responsible bird photography. Given the important role of farmlands to Great Bustards, we recommend planting compatible crops and establishing a Great Bustard protection demonstration area to implement and inform others about measures to improve farmland habitat for Great Bustards.

AB  - Ability to predict species distribution in a landscape is of crucial importance for natural resource management and species conservation. Therefore, the understanding of species habitat requirements and spatio-temporal dynamics in occurrence is needed. We examined patch occupancy patterns of the Siberian flying squirrel Pteromys volans in northern Finland across a seven year study period. Forest patches dominated by mature spruce (Picea abies) in a study area (375 km(2)) were surveyed to monitor the presence or absence of the flying squirrel. The patch occupancy pattern was dynamic: about half of the habitat patches were occupied at least once during the study period and more patches were colonised than were abandoned. Patches that were continuously occupied (i.e. occupied during all sample periods) were typically of high quality (based on habitat and landscape characteristics), continuously unoccupied patches were usually of low quality, and intermediate quality patches were occupied intermittently. The variables explaining patch occupancy were similar each year, and a statistical model based on data from the year 2000 also predicted occupancy in 2004 with similar accuracy. However, data from a single survey were inadequate for identifying patches used intermittently by flying squirrels. Despite inconsistent occupancy, these patches may be important for the local persistence of flying squirrels. The dynamic occupancy pattern may thus affect estimates of suitable habitat area and identification of functional patch networks for landscape planning. These results emphasise the need for follow-up studies to better understand population patterns and processes in time.

AB  - Myrtaceae is one of the richest families in the Atlantic Forest, a priority biodiversity hotspot that continues to be highly threatened, subject to rapid urbanisation and high levels of resource exploitation. Authors have suggested that individual lineages can be used as models to study biome evolution and ecology and to provide data for conservation planning in these areas. Here we review how Myrtaceae fit the 'model' criteria and examine the family's distribution throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest answering the questions: What is the ecological representation of Myrtaceae in the Atlantic Forest?; What is the current taxonomic situation of Myrtaceae in the biome?; What is the current phylogenetic understanding in the family?; Does the historical timeframe of the lineage coincide with that of the biome?; Can Myrtaceae be used to discuss species diversity hotspots within the Atlantic forests?; What is the role of Myrtaceae in conservation strategy? And finally, Can Myrtaceae be used as a 'model' taxon? The concept of the 'model taxon' is also discussed. The review concludes that taxonomic and phlyogenetic understanding in Myrtaceae are rapidly increasing, giving hope that taxonomic stability, easy species identification and management are realistic in a way unthinkable only a few decades ago. Myrtaceae function well as a 'model' within the Atlantic forest but fit some criteria better than others. Taxa can qualify as 'models' representing different times and pressures in the history of a given biome; each tells its own story. For future 'model' group studies to have maximum impact and implementation for evolutionary studies and conservation strategy, synthetic studies of multiple 'model' groups using multiple approaches are required; only then can a predictive understanding of past and future processes in the biomes concerned, be glimpsed.

AB  - Early detection and rapid response plans are a set of principles to reduce the establishment, spread and impact of invasive species and it is a critical step in management in marine ecosystems. Two potentially invasive ascidians attached to the hull of a recently sunk fishing vessel were early detected in Patagonia. With the aim of assisting in the management decision-making process during the early steps of a rapid response, we conducted several analyses through different approaches. First, we identified the species through classic taxonomical and genetic analyses. Then, we evaluated the regional and international shipping connectivity to study potential donor regions and finally, we used species distribution models (SDMs) to predict the potential distribution of these species. The potentially invasive ascidians were identified as Styela clava and Styela plicata, and this is the first record for both species in the Nuevo gulf, Patagonia Argentina. Both species have a widespread distribution around the world with strong ecological and economic impacts documented. Shipping traffic analysis suggested that S. plicata could have arrived by secondary spread from regional ports, while the arrival of S. clava was likely to be associated with international shipping traffic. Furthermore, the SDM predicted that S. clava has suitable coastal areas along the entire Southwestern Atlantic shoreline, where it is currently absent. On the contrary, the SDM predicted that further southward spread of S. plicata is unlikely, being limited by the minimum annual temperature. We discussed the different approaches, tools, and expertise integrated in this work in the light of the decision-making process for the early detection of marine invasive species in the Southwestern Atlantic. Moreover, we call attention to the increased creation of artificial habitats through the intentional sinking of ships and the potential consequences of these actions in the conservation of marine ecosystems.

AB  - African rangelands support diverse ungulate communities whose member species exhibit unique combinations of body morphology and behaviour that have evolved over millions of years to limit the effects of competition and predation on fitness, and more recently, to cope with people and livestock. The mechanisms by which native ungulates cope with the combined effects of competition, predation and human disturbance are poorly understood. Addressing this knowledge gap will help guide management and conservation plans for large mammal communities outside of strictly protected areas. We conducted animal counts on line transects and used a spatially explicit distance sampling model to test the influence of bottom-up effects (vegetation), top-down effects from African lion Panthera leo and spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta and human disturbance (livestock density, occupied human settlements) on native ungulate densities and distributions across a multiple-use rangeland in Kenya. We examined five species that varied in body morphology and foraging strategy, including two large-bodied grazers (zebra Equus quagga; wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus), two medium-bodied, mixed-feeders (Grant's gazelle Nanger granti; impala Aepyceros melampus) and one very large-bodied browser (giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi). Densities and distributions of all species varied across available land-use types, with bottom-up effects (vegetation) and human disturbance having the strongest overall effects. Responses varied by ungulate foraging strategy. Distributions of grazers and the browser (giraffe) changed seasonally, while distributions of mixed-feeders and a grazer (zebra) changed diurnally. At broad spatial scales, ungulates did not respond to long-term variation in predation risk though they have been shown to respond behaviourally to short-term variation in risk.Synthesis and applications. Our results revealed that native ungulates in this multiple-use rangeland occur at densities comparable to many flagship protected area populations. We attribute observed densities to spatial heterogeneity across this landscape that included variation in human land use (community conservation area, seasonal settlements and livestock grazing, permanent settlements) and vegetation (grassland, bushland, woodland) that changed through time (seasonally, diurnally). This variation allowed ungulates to carve out ecological niches while reducing exposure to the potential limiting effects of competition and human disturbance. For some species, securing access to forage resources and avoiding human disturbance may be associated with costs through increased risk of predation. Our research reveals the trade-offs native ungulates make to cope with changes in forage availability, human disturbance and predation risk, providing important insights to help guide native ungulate conservation efforts in multiple-use rangelands.

AB  - A population of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx was established by reintroductions in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem in the 1970s and 1980s. The most recent information on the population status indicates that the distribution has stagnated since the late 1990s, for unknown reasons. We assessed the availability of suitable habitat along the Austrian-German-Czech border, and hypothesized that the Bohemian-Bavarian lynx population is not in equilibrium with habitat suitability. Based on global positioning system data from 10 radio-collared lynx, we used a maximum entropy approach to model suitable habitat. Variables reflecting anthropogenic influence contributed most to the model and were negatively associated with the occurrence of lynx. We evaluated the model prediction using independent records of lynx from monitoring in Bavaria, Germany. Using our habitat approach we estimated the area of potential habitat, based on a mean annual home range of 445 km(2) for males and 122 km(2) for females. Our results indicated there were 12,415 km(2) of suitable habitat, distributed among 13 patches, for a potential population of c. 142 (93-160) resident lynx. We assessed connectivity via least-cost paths and found that all suitable patches could be reached by the lynx. A comparison with the current distribution of lynx, however, confirms that a significant proportion of suitable habitat is not occupied, which indicates that the distribution is limited by factors other than habitat, with illegal killing being the most likely cause. Our study provides crucial information for the development of a conservation strategy and regional planning for the Bohemian-Bavarian lynx population.

AB  - 1. Knowledge of elephants in forested environments where visibility is poor is often restricted to elephant density estimates derived from counts of elephant dung piles along line transects. Elephant dung piles are a good indicator of elephant habitat use over a period of time (i.e. a season) because they remain visible for several months. Using Mount Kenya (MK) in Kenya as a case study, we demonstrate how those dung pile counts can additionally be used to develop elephant dung pile explanatory models and distribution maps.
   2. The dung pile explanatory models are built from a selected number of line-transect samples per season using generalized linear model analysis, in which the counted dung of each sample is explained by the combined effects of a series of environmental and anthropomorphic parameters. For the significant explanatory parameters in the models, digital map layers are developed and integrated into a geographic information system. Applying the explanatory models, predictive seasonal elephant dung pile distribution maps are developed.
   3. Data preparation and analysis are intensive, but the distribution maps derived from explanatory parameters of distribution are a powerful tool for patrol planning and land-use management and to locate areas of high elephant density and the habitats they move between. This method is useful for sites where physical, environmental, logistical or other constraints render it impossible to spread line transects evenly over the entire study area, assuming that transects are representative samples of the entire habitat.

AB  - Submarine canyons play an important role in the regional distribution, abundance and dispersal of marine biota and are increasingly being recognised as geomorphic features of high conservation significance along Australia's continental margin. Certain canyons have been described as foraging hotspots' attributable to the high abundance of apex cetacean species aggregating in these areas. Anecdotal evidence of large seasonal aggregations of killer whales in the Bremer Canyon, south-west Australia, has attracted significant research attention in the last decade. To identify important environmental drivers influencing aggregation patterns, a predictive spatial habitat model using the Maxent model was developed based on presence-only whale sighting data. In addition, remotely sensed sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations were assessed to investigate the spatio-temporal variation in sea surface conditions. Habitat preference was predicted in areas between canyon heads, with the most influential predictor variables being depth and distance from the continental shelf break. Analysis of remote-sensing data highlighted low localised variability in surface waters and illustrated the seasonal trends of the Leeuwin Current. This study demonstrates the influence of bathymetry and submarine geomorphology on enhanced cetacean abundance and highlights the need for recognition of this potential foraging area in marine reserve planning.

AB  - Aim
   To use herbarium records to characterize important correlates of spatial spread, areal occupancy and clustering of 100 alien plant species of conservation concern in the North and South Islands of New Zealand.
   Location
   New Zealand.
   Methods
   Using herbarium data of 6294 records representing 100 alien plant species, we assessed spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of alien species by examining the role of major urban areas as sources of sampling bias. A novel method to account for spatial biases in sampling effort was developed and applied to two simple distance metrics: nearest- and furthest-neighbour spread rate. The relative importance of these two distance metrics in determining the range, areal extent and dispersion of alien species across both the North and South Islands of New Zealand was also assessed.
   Results
   The spatial distribution of herbarium records was highly clustered with a significant bias towards the more populated regions. Once sampling bias was taken into account, there was no indication that species were found closer to these urban centres than might be expected based on sampling effort. The nearest-neighbour spread rates were usually 1-5 km yr-1 and correlated positively with the furthest-neighbour spread rates that were an order of magnitude higher. Range and area increased and clustering decreased with higher spread rates and longer recording time span. The spread rates divided species into five groups that were clearly distinguishable in terms of the extent of their distribution and the degree of clustering. Species occurring on both islands did not exhibit similar spread rates or spatial patterns.
   Main conclusions
   The nearest- and furthest-neighbour spread rates from herbarium records can explain the area and pattern of alien plant distributions and improve the understanding of the dynamics of their spread. Five groups emerge from the spread rates in relation to a null model. Fast-spreading plants had the widest, least clustered distribution, which suggests widespread chronic problems; slow-spreading plants had localized, but dense, clustered distributions, indicating acutely problematic weeds. These patterns appear robust and may be useful in predicting the future patterns of spread and in planning long-term management strategies in New Zealand.

AB  - Habitat suitability models (HSMs) are widely used to plan actions for species of conservation interest. Models that will be turned into conservation actions need predictors that are both ecologically pertinent and fit managers' conceptual view of ecosystems. Remote sensing technologies such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can describe landscapes at high resolution over large spatial areas and have already given promising results for modeling forest species distributions. The point-cloud (PC) area-based LiDAR variables are often used as environmental variables in HSMs and have more recently been complemented by object-oriented (OO) metrics. However, the efficiency of each type of variable to capture structural information on forest bird habitat has not yet been compared. We tested two hypotheses: (1) the use of OO variables in HSMs will give similar performance as PC area-based models; and (2) OO variables will improve model robustness to LiDAR datasets acquired at different times for the same area. Using the case of a locally endangered forest bird, the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), model performance and predictions were compared between the two variable types. Models using OO variables showed slightly lower discriminatory performance than PC area-based models (average Delta AUC = -0.032 and -0.01 for females and males, respectively). OO-based models were as robust (absolute difference in Spearman rank correlation of predictions <= 0.21) or more robust than PC area-based models. In sum, LiDAR-derived PC area-based metrics and OO metrics showed similar performance for modeling the distribution of the capercaillie. We encourage the further exploration of OO metrics for creating reliable HSMs, and in particular testing whether they might help improve the scientist-stakeholder interface through better interpretability.

AB  - Aim Roads impact wildlife in different ways, among which road mortality has been the most studied. Budgets in conservation biology are usually small, and macroecological approaches have been employed in recent years as the first steps towards guiding management. Carnivores are particularly vulnerable to mortality on roads due to their elevated ecological needs (low population density, often low fecundity and relatively large home ranges). Our aim was to develop a ranking methodology to prioritize specific areas for road-kill mitigation. Location Continental Italy. Methods We studied 271 occurrences of live polecats (Mustela putorius) and 212 polecat road-kill sites. We used the former to generate a species distribution model and the latter to identify the variables that determined the road-kill risk. Habitat suitability was derived from a spatial distribution model that combined the polecat occurrence data with a set of environmental variables. Prey availability was derived from the combination of suitability maps of 26 prey species. We used generalized linear modelling to identify the set of variables that best explained the occurrence of road-kills. The variables included in the best performing model were combined to produce the road risk map and to identify the areas with the highest densities of road sections with highest risk. Results Road-kills were positively associated with the road sections with higher broad-leaved forest coverage. The number of casualties was found to be higher than expected on the national and provincial roads and lower than expected on the local roads. Main conclusions This approach allowed us to identify the 10 x 10 km cells where mitigation actions to prevent road-kills should be prioritized. As mitigation actions (wildlife passage construction, fencing) are expensive, measures should be prioritized on the specific high-risk road sections inside these selected cells, avoiding generalized mitigation plans.

AB  - 1. Environmental variables are often used as indirect surrogates for mapping biodiversity because species survey data are scant at regional scales, especially in the marine realm. However, environmental variables are measured on arbitrary scales unlikely to have simple, direct relationships with biological patterns. Instead, biodiversity may respond nonlinearly and to interactions between environmental variables. 2. To investigate the role of the environment in driving patterns of biodiversity composition in large marine regions, we collated multiple biological survey and environmental data sets from tropical NE Australia, the deep Gulf of Mexico and the temperate Gulf of Maine. We then quantified the shape and magnitude of multispecies responses along >30 environmental gradients and the extent to which these variables predicted regional distributions. To do this, we applied a new statistical approach, Gradient Forest, an extension of Random Forest, capable of modelling nonlinear and threshold responses. 3. The regional-scale environmental variables predicted an average of 1335% (up to 5085% for individual species) of the variation in species abundance distributions. Important predictors differed among regions and biota and included depth, salinity, temperature, sediment composition and current stress. The shapes of responses along gradients also differed and were nonlinear, often with thresholds indicative of step changes in composition. These differing regional responses were partly due to differing environmental indicators of bioregional boundaries and, given the results to date, may indicate limited scope for extrapolating bio-physical relationships beyond the region of source data sets. 4. Synthesis and applications. Gradient Forest offers a new capability for exploring relationships between biodiversity and environmental gradients, generating new information on multispecies responses at a detail not available previously. Importantly, given the scarcity of data, Gradient Forest enables the combined use of information from disparate data sets. The gradient response curves provide biologically informed transformations of environmental layers to predict and map expected patterns of biodiversity composition that represent sampled composition better than uninformed variables. The approach can be applied to support marine spatial planning and management and has similar applicability in terrestrial realms.

AB  - One way that climate change will impact animal distributions is by altering habitat suitability and habitat fragmentation. Understanding the impacts of climate change on currently threatened species is of immediate importance because complex conservation planning will be required. Here, we mapped changes to the distribution, suitability, and fragmentation of giant panda habitat under climate change and quantified the direction and elevation of habitat shift and fragmentation patterns. These data were used to develop a series of new conservation strategies for the giant panda. Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi, China. Data from the most recent giant panda census, habitat factors, anthropogenic disturbance, climate variables, and climate predictions for the year 2050 (averaged across four general circulation models) were used to project giant panda habitat in Maxent. Differences in habitat patches were compared between now and 2050. While climate change will cause a 9.1% increase in suitable habitat and 9% reduction in subsuitable habitat by 2050, no significant net variation in the proportion of suitable and subsuitable habitat was found. However, a distinct climate change-induced habitat shift of 11 km eastward by 2050 is predicted firstly. Climate change will reduce the fragmentation of suitable habitat at high elevations and exacerbate the fragmentation of subsuitable habitat below 1,900 m above sea level. Reduced fragmentation at higher elevations and worsening fragmentation at lower elevations have the potential to cause overcrowding of giant pandas at higher altitudes, further exacerbating habitat shortage in the central Qinling Mountains. The habitat shift to the east due to climate change may provide new areas for giant pandas but poses severe challenges for future conservation.

AB  - Modeling the relationships between environmental factors and the distribution at sea of species of conservation interest can be useful in predicting their occurrence from a local to a regional scale. This information is essential for planning management and conservation initiatives. In this study, generalized additive models (GAMs) were applied to investigate the influence of environmental, temporal and spatial variables on the catch rates of the twaite shad Alosa fallax (Lacepede) by the pelagic trawl fishery in the north-central Adriatic Sea. Presence/absence and abundance [catch per unit effort (CPUE)] data between 2006 and 2012 were separately modeled, and the two models were then validated using a test data set. The most important factor influencing the presence and abundance of adult twaite shads was the spatial predictor (latitudexlongitude). Two areas of major shads aggregations were observed, the most important of which being located near the estuaries of three main river systems of northern Italy. The twaite shad presence was also significantly affected by season, the largest and lowest occurrences being observed in autumn and spring, respectively. Among the environmental variables tested, only sea surface temperature was included in both models. Alosa fallax showed a wide thermal tolerance (6-27 degrees C) with preference for temperature around 23 degrees C. The model developed from the abundance data showed a moderate predictive power, whereas the accuracy of the presence/absence model was rather low. Some conclusions on the ecological requirements of A.fallax at sea arising from this study are useful to orient future monitoring and research programs and to develop effective conservation actions.

AB  - Forest degradation is arguably the greatest threat to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and rural livelihoods. Therefore, increasing understanding of how organisms respond to degradation is essential for management and conservation planning. We were motivated by the need for rapid and practical analytical tools to assess the influence of management and degradation on biodiversity and system state in areas subject to rapid environmental change. We compared bird community composition and size in managed (ejido, i.e., communally owned lands) and unmanaged (national park) forests in the Sierra Tarahumara region, Mexico, using multispecies occupancy models and data from a 2-year breeding bird survey. Unmanaged sites had on average higher species occupancy and richness than managed sites. Most species were present in low numbers as indicated by lower values of detection and occupancy associated with logging-induced degradation. Less than 10% of species had occupancy probabilities >0.5, and degradation had no positive effects on occupancy. The estimated metacommunity size of 125 exceeded previous estimates for the region, and sites with mature trees and uneven-aged forest stand characteristics contained the highest species richness. Higher estimation uncertainty and decreases in richness and occupancy for all species, including habitat generalists, were associated with degraded young, even-aged stands. Our findings show that multispecies occupancy methods provide tractable measures of biodiversity and system state and valuable decision support for landholders and managers. These techniques can be used to rapidly address gaps in biodiversity information, threats to biodiversity, and vulnerabilities of species of interest on a landscape level, even in degraded or fast-changing environments. Moreover, such tools may be particularly relevant in the assessment of species richness and distribution in a wide array of habitats.

AB  - 1. The Sunda gharial Tomistoma schlegelii is, with 2500-3000 remaining specimens, one of the least studied and at the same time most endangered crocodile species. Inhabiting peat swamps in Southeast Asia, threats affecting the species are mainly associated with habitat loss and illegal hunting.
   2. The effectiveness of the existing reserve network in Southeast Asia for the protection of the Sunda garial was assessed by combining spatially explicit habitat analyses derived from land cover information with species distribution modelling. Subsequently, possible improvements of the existing reserve network are derived from the habitat availability analyses.
   3. The results of the spatially explicit analyses indicate that suitable habitats for the Sunda gharial in Southeast Asia, i.e. peat swamps and riverine forests, are highly fragmented. Spatial coverage of remaining habitats with protected areas fulfilling IUCN standards generally varies among regions and is best in Indonesia. However, large, currently unprotected suitable areas remain in Sumatra. Establishment of 10 additional, already proposed reserves may improve the protection of major parts of the remaining suitable habitats of the Sunda gharial.
   4. According to the results of this study, the reserve network protecting this species could be significantly improved by expanding it to include seven national reserves not currently listed by the IUCN and an additional 10 reserves that have recently been proposed. Improvements and extensions of the existing reserve networks in Southeast Asia are pivotal to guarantee the long-term survival of the Sunda gharial. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Substantial new housing and infrastructure development planned within England has the potential to conflict with the nature conservation interests of protected sites. The Breckland area of eastern England (the Brecks) is designated as a Special Protection Area for a number of bird species, including the stone curlew (for which it holds more than 60% of the UK total population). We explore the effect of buildings and roads on the spatial distribution of stone curlew nests across the Brecks in order to inform strategic development plans to avoid adverse effects on such European protected sites.
   Methodology: Using data across all years (and subsets of years) over the period 1988-2006 but restricted to habitat areas of arable land with suitable soils, we assessed nest density in relation to the distances to nearest settlements and to major roads. Measures of the local density of nearby buildings, roads and traffic levels were assessed using normal kernel distance-weighting functions. Quasi-Poisson generalised linear mixed models allowing for spatial autocorrelation were fitted.
   Results: Significantly lower densities of stone curlew nests were found at distances up to 1500m from settlements, and distances up to 1000m or more from major (trunk) roads. The best fitting models involved optimally distance-weighted variables for the extent of nearby buildings and the trunk road traffic levels.
   Significance: The results and predictions from this study of past data suggests there is cause for concern that future housing development and associated road infrastructure within the Breckland area could have negative impacts on the nesting stone curlew population. Given the strict legal protection afforded to the SPA the planning and conservation bodies have subsequently agreed precautionary restrictions on building development within the distances identified and used the modelling predictions to agree mitigation measures for proposed trunk road developments.

AB  - Logistic regression is being used increasingly to develop regional-scale predictive models of species distributions for use in regional conservation planning. These models are usually developed using automated stepwise procedures to select the explanatory variables to include in each model and to fit the functions relating each of these variables to the probability of species occurrence. Available procedures for fitting logistic regression models differ in terms of a number of factors, including the basic modelling technique employed (generalised linear or generalised additive modelling), the strategy used to select explanatory variables and to determine the complexity of fitted functions, and the approach used to correct for multiple testing. This study evaluates the effect that each of these factors has on the predictive accuracy of fitted models, using fauna and flora survey data from north-east New South Wales. The results suggest that predictive accuracy is maximised by employing variable selection procedures that stringently guard against the inclusion of extraneous variables in a model, such as forwards selection with a 5% significance level and removal of insignificant variables at each stage of the selection process. Models fitted using generalised additive modelling were more accurate than those derived using generalised linear modelling. The best approach to controlling the complexity of fitted models was less clear, as it tended to vary between the biological groups examined. Small reptile species were best modelled by complex relationships (3 or 4 df), and vascular plants and diurnal birds by simple relationships (1 or 2 df). Correction for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction factor did not improve the accuracy of models. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we predicted the impact of climate change on the distribution of three vulnerable ungulates in central Iran. We then evaluated future suitability of corridors connecting the protected areas for movement of the ungulates in response to climate change. Location Central Iran. Methods Impact of climate change on distribution of goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa), wild sheep (Ovisspp) and wild goat (Capra aegagrus) was predicted adapting an ensemble modelling approach and under the RCP 8.5 emission scenario. We then used CIRCUITSCAPE software with current and future distribution maps to identify corridors for movement of the three ungulates, and evaluate likely changes in their suitability under climate change. Results Our results revealed that climate change might result in loss of 55%, 69% and 76% of suitable habitats for goitered gazelle, wild sheep and wild goat by 2070, respectively. These losses also resulted in some protected areas to become unsuitable for the ungulates. However, we identified key protected areas with the potential for future protection of these ungulates. For the three species, we also identified corridors which would persist into the future, allowing the impacted populations to move in response to climate change. Main conclusions Conservation of ungulate populations in Iran mainly depends on the protected areas. To maintain the role of the protected areas in conserving these mammals under climate change, we recommend the incorporation of their potential future distribution into conservation plans, increasing protection status of the key protected areas, and maintain critical corridors. In this regard, combining results of distribution and connectivity models provides useful information for effective management of these ungulates in the future.

AB  - Environmental changes are driving rapid geographic shifts of suitable environmental conditions for species. These might survive by tracking those shifts, however successful responses will depend on the spatial distribution of suitable habitats (current and future) and on their connectivity. Most herptiles (i.e., amphibians and reptiles) have low dispersal abilities, and therefore herptiles are among the most vulnerable groups to environmental changes. Here we assessed the vulnerability of herptile species to future climate and land use changes in fragmented landscapes. We developed and tested a methodological approach combining the strengths of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and of functional connectivity analysis. First, using SDMs we forecasted current and future distributions of potential suitable areas as well as range dynamics for four herptile species in Portugal. SDM forecasts for 2050 were obtained under two contrasting emission scenarios, translated into moderate (low-emissions scenario) or large (high-emissions scenario) changes in climate and land use conditions. Then, we calculated and analysed functional connectivity from areas projected to lose environmental suitability towards areas keeping suitable conditions. Landscape matrix resistance and barrier effects of the national motorway network were incorporated as the main sources of fragmentation. Potential suitable area was projected to decrease under future conditions for most test species, with the high-emissions scenario amplifying the losses or gains. Spatiotemporal patterns of connectivity between potentially suitable areas signalled the most important locations for maintaining linkages and migration corridors, as well as potential conflicts due to overlaps with the current motorway network. By integrating SDM projections with functional connectivity analysis, we were able to assess and map the vulnerability of distinct herptile species to isolation or extinction under environmental change scenarios. Our framework provides valuable information, with fairly low data requirements, for optimizing biodiversity management and mitigation efforts, aiming to reduce the complex and often synergistic negative impacts of multiple environmental change drivers. Implications for conservation planning and management are discussed from a global change adaptation perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge of species compositional turnover, the rate of change in the number of species shared between locations along geographic and environmental gradients, is important for conservation planning. Spatially global models relating species and environmental turnover are well established. However, to date there has been no explicit assessment of the effects of geographical variation in parameters (spatial non-stationarity) and directional dependence (anisotropy) on these models. Such processes are well known to affect other geospatial analyses. Here, we assess how these affect the shape, goodness of fit and composition of species turnover-environment relationships. We use the eastern Australian distribution of species in the Myrtaceae, an important family of vascular plants in the region. We obtained distribution data for Myrtaceae species from herbarium records and corresponding environmental attributes (mean of 1 km gridded cell values aggregated to 10 km grid cells). Species compositional turnover was quantified using the Sorensen pairwise dissimilarity index. The turnover-environment relationship was analysed using generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM), a purpose-designed statistical regression technique. The data were divided into three sets of spatially local subsamples: 27 rectangular east-west-aligned coastal-inland bands, 8 north-south coastally aligned bands and 12 symmetrical omnidirectional blocks. A separate GDM was fitted to each spatially local subsample. The results display marked evidence of spatial variation in the shape, goodness of fit and composition of local species turnover-environment relationships, with this variation appearing strongly directional. The observed spatial structure of local biodiversity-environment relationships, expressed as species compositional turnover, is unsurprising considering both the steep east-west environmental gradients associated with Australia's eastern ranges and the known decreasing sampling intensity in the same direction. Local spatial non-stationarity and anisotropy are expected outcomes irrespective of the chosen turnover index, study taxa or statistical model used. Currently, it is difficult to separate genuine biogeographic effects from data bias. Future analyses could better account for the observed spatial structure of both biodiversity-environment relationships and data bias by incorporating directionality in data subsampling strategies and explicit biogeographic predictors in model design.

AB  - Chinese caterpillar fungus (Ophiocordyceps sinensis) is a precious traditionalmedicinewhich ismostly distributed on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Due to itsmedicinal values, it has become one of the most valuable biological commodities and widely traded in recent years worldwide. However, its habitat has changed profoundly in recent years under global warming as well as anthropogenic pressures, resulting in a sharp decline in its wild population in recent years. Based on the occurrence samples, this paper estimates the potential distribution of caterpillar fungus using MaxEnt model. The model simulates potential geographical distribution of the species under current climate conditions, and examine future distributions under different climatic change scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 have beenmodelled in 2050s and 2070s, respectively). For examining the impacts of climate change in future, the integrated effects of climatic impact, trading, and overexploitation had been analyzed in detailed routes. The results show that: 1) The distribution patterns of caterpillar fungus under scenario RCP 2.6 have been predicted without obvious changes. However, range shift has been observed with significant shrinks across all classes of suitable areas in Tianshan, KunlunMountains, and the southwestern QTP in 2050s and 2070s under RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. 2) The exportswere decreasing drastically in recent years. Guangzhou and Hongkong are two international super import and consumption centres of caterpillar fungus in the world. 3) Both ecological and economic sustainable utilization of the caterpillar fungus has been threatened by the combined pressures of climate change and overexploitation. A strict but effective regulation and protection system, even a systematic management plan not just on the collectors but the whole explore process are urgently needed and has to be issued in the QTP.

AB  - Human induced land-use change in the form of urbanization and agriculture are rapidly transforming our planet's terrestrial landscapes and causing the loss of species at unprecedented rates. Studies documenting the impacts of development are extensive; however, less is known about the scale at which species respond to development and specific features of altered landscapes that make them vulnerable. This shortcoming may be due to the difficulty of collecting data across large spatial extents, but filling these information gaps are critical, particularly for species that have a disproportionate influence on ecosystems, such as ecosystem engineers. One such species, the southeastern pocket gopher (Geomys pinetis), has been declining throughout its range (south-eastern United States) and continued loss will likely have strong effects on the imperiled longleaf pine ecosystem in which it is closely associated. Using range-wide data from presence-absence surveys and publicly available presence-only data, we used recent advances in species distribution modeling to understand this ecosystem engineer's associations with extensive land use and cover changes. Our study showed that pocket gophers inhabit a variety of land-use types, including regions with low levels of anthropogenic development, but are largely absent from intensely urbanized areas and closed-canopy forests. Conservation planning to reduce the spread of extensive development and forest management strategies to reduce closed-canopy systems will be instrumental in reducing the decline of the species and ultimately protection of the longleaf pine ecosystem. The approach used in this study will be increasingly beneficial for understanding species response to land-use change.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning (SCP) to design marine protected areas (MPAs) has traditionally focused on species distributions or benthic habitat features that drive the determination of conservation priorities. Pelagic ecosystem protection is usually incidental because these ecosystems are often data poor and are difficult to visualize in a planning context. Pelagic ecosystems, however, face increasing and cumulative impacts from threats such as overfishing and climate change, and a precautionary approach is required to protect both known and unknown biodiversity patterns and ecosystem processes. Data-driven pelagic habitat classifications are important when planning for habitat protection in the absence of sufficient in-situ data. In this study, we describe a method for creating a bioregional map of the upper-mixed layer of South Africa's pelagic realm. We selected relevant variables and parameters that best reflect key ecosystem properties at broad, meso, and local scales. We conducted a hierarchal cluster analysis using open-access sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), net primary productivity (NPP), mean sea level anomalies (MSLA), and seabed slope and depth data. The resulting map delineates three bioregions subdivided into seven biozones and sixteen pelagic habitats within South Africa's continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This habitat map was incorporated into SCP of a proposed expanded MPA network that includes offshore protected areas and meets National objectives. The proposed network will increase protection of the pelagic realm (>30 m depth) of the EEZ from 0.002% to 6.0%. We contend that bioregional analyses based on publicly available remote-sensing data are useful for identification of offshore habitats, especially when robust biological data are unavailable, as a framework for ecosystem reporting, and for inclusion in a systematic design for a representative offshore MPA network. Further research should focus on modelling and mapping the permanence of pelagic habitats and different spatio-temporal scales of variability, validating habitat boundaries with biological data, and understanding the threats and efficacy of achieving pelagic protection through management mechanisms like MPAs.

AB  - Urbanised estuaries, ports and harbours are often utilised for recreational purposes, notably recreational angling. Yet there has been little quantitative assessment of the footprint and intensity of these activities at scales suitable for spatial management. Urban and industrialised estuaries have previously been considered as having low conservation value, perhaps due to issues with contamination and disturbance. Studies in recent decades have demonstrated that many of these systems are still highly biodiverse and of high value to local residents. As a response, urbanised estuaries are now being considered by coastal spatial management initiatives, where assessments of recreational use in these areas can help avoid 'user-environmental' and 'user-user' conflict. The models of these activities need to be developed at a scale relevant to governments and regulatory authorities, but the few human-use models that do exist integrate fishing intensity to a regional or even continental scale; too large to capture the fine scale variation inherent in complex urban fisheries. Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) is a tool commonly used to assess drivers of species range, but can be applied to models of recreational fishing in complex environments, at a scale relevant to regulatory bodies. Using point-data from 573 visual surveys with recently developed Poisson point process models, we examine the recreational fishery in Australia's busiest estuarine port, Sydney Harbour. We demonstrate the utility of these models for understanding the distribution of boat and shore-based fishers, and the effects of a range of temporally static (geographical) and dynamic (weather) predictors on these distributions.

We analysed how continued warming over the 21st century would affect the distribution of eelgrass Zostera marina, the dominant seagrass in the Northwest Atlantic and provider of essential ecosystem functions and services. We compiled presence-only occurrence records and built a species distribution model using Maxent to determine a present-day distribution, which was compared to physiological thresholds for eelgrass growth and reproduction. Present-day models were then projected to mid- (2040-2050) and end-century (2090-2100) using 2 contrasting emissions scenarios and different global climate models. Our projections suggest an average shift of the southern range limit by 1.41 degrees N to the north under a strong mitigation scenario (RCP 2.6) and 6.48 degrees N under a business-as-usual emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) by 2100, resulting in substantial loss of eelgrass habitat along the eastern coast of the USA. The northern edge shift was less certain, yet resulted in an expansion of total eelgrass habitat. To minimize the extent of eelgrass bed extinction and areas of reduced growth along the southern range, strong climate mitigation is critical. Moreover, warm-temperature stress in reduced-growth areas will greatly increase the susceptibility of eelgrass to other natural or anthropogenic stressors. Our results can inform coastal management and conservation planning to protect the essential structure, functions and services provided by eelgrass in a warming climate.

AB  - Up to date 264 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been declared in the western Mediterranean Sea. The management plans of 25 of these MPAs include the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) as a priority species to protect. However, the actual use of these MPAs by the species remains unknown. Therefore, it is important to assess their contribution to loggerhead conservation in the area. To this end, satellite tracking data of 103 loggerhead turtles of varying sizes and life stages released in Spanish Mediterranean waters and Southern Tyrrhenian Sea over the 2003-2018 period were herein used. Home range and use of MPAs by tracked loggerhead turtles were analysed using post-processed state-space model locations. The tracked turtles visited several Mediterranean MPAs, but barely used them (mean percentage of monitoring time = 12.6 +/- 18.2 %). There was very little overlap between turtle's core areas and tracks with the protected areas. Indeed, most of the core areas and high-density areas estimated (> 85 %) were not included within any of the MPAs. Furthermore, less than 5 % of the Mediterranean MPAs were used by any tracked loggerhead sea turtles. Most of these MPAs have no protection measures that focus on this species. Loggerheads mainly use wide oceanic zones and international waters, which are difficult to protect. A high-use core area was identified for loggerhead turtles, located at the western waters of the Algerian Basin, an important fishing area outside any designated MPA and with no protection measures that focus on marine turtle conservation. We conclude that existing MPAs in the western Mediterranean may not contribute enough to loggerhead turtle conservation. We propose potential MPAs designations to be considered for loggerhead sea turtle conservation in the Mediterranean Sea at the Alboran Sea, the Algerian basin, the Northern area of the Strait of Sicily, Northeast Tunisian waters, waters around Malta, waters at the Tyrrhenian Sea and at the Ionian Sea.

AB  - Knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of cetaceans is particularly important for conservation and management, but is still limited within Namibian waters. We collated 3211 cetacean records from the Namibian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for the period 2008 to 2016 and applied the principle of minimum cross entropy (MinxEnt) to predict habitat suitability. MinxEnt is a generalised form of maximum entropy modelling that allows incorporation of additional information such as sampling bias. The habitat suitability of 9 cetacean species or species groups (5 odontocete species, 2 mysticete species and 2 taxonomic groups: pilot whales Globicephalus spp. and balaenopterids Balaenopteridae spp.) were predicted per season, in relation to environmental variables likely to drive cetacean presence: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, water depth or distance to shore, seabed slope and habitat complexity. The environmental variable which most frequently influenced habitat suitability was depth, which was the main environmental driver for bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and southern right whales Eubalaena australis. Further, Heaviside's dolphin Cephalorhynchus heavisidii habitat was best predicted by distance to shore in all seasons, while common dolphin Delphinus delphis and the balaenopterid group habitats were best predicted by habitat complexity, and sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus habitats by chlorophyll a concentration. We identify distinct spatial patterns in habitat suitability for different species and provide baseline maps which can be used by managers of wildlife resources.

AB  - Understanding climate change and its potential impact on species, populations and communities is one of the most pressing questions of twenty-first-century conservation planning. Palaeobiogeographers working on Cenozoic fossil records and other lines of evidence are producing important insights into the dynamic nature of climate and the equally dynamic response of species, populations and communities. Climatic variations ranging in length from multimillennia to decades run throughout the palaeo-records of the Quaternary and earlier Cenozoic and have been shown to have had impacts ranging from changes in the genetic structure and morphology of individual species, population sizes and distributions, community composition to large-scale bio-diversity gradients. The biogeographical impacts of climate change may be due directly to the effects of alterations in temperature and moisture on species, or they may arise due to changes in factors such as disturbance regimes. Much of the recent progress in the application of palaeobiogegraphy to issues of climate change and its impacts can be attributed to developments along a number of still advancing methodological frontiers. These include increasingly finely resolved chronological resolution, more refined atmosphere-biosphere modelling, new biological and chemical techniques in reconstructing past species distributions and past climates, the development of large and readily accessible geo-referenced databases of biogeographical and climatic information, and new approaches in fossil morphological analysis and new molecular DNA techniques.

CP  - 23rd National Passive Solar Conference
AB  - The hierarchical patch theory of ecology describes the dynamic relationship between the broad scale landscape and a mosaic of smaller patches that define the landscape. It notes that these landscape patches are constantly changing and evolving, apparently in complete chaos at the smaller scale. Yet at the landscape level, the overall age and species distribution of the ecosystem remains relatively stable. In the midst what might seem chaotic at one scale, constancy is found at another.
   This concept can inform designers of the need to establish criteria for sustainable development that utilizes the 'ecosystem approach' and considers the entire landscape when evaluating impacts of human development patterns on the ecology of a place. Conservation biologist's are well aware that it is impossible to save one species in a landscape without preserving the entire ecosystem that supports it.
   This paper attempts to quantify the landscape scale effects of low density urban development on the ecology of an existing agricultural site by focusing on the hydrological impacts of the development. A hydrological evaluation of existing site conditions is compared to conditions simulating historic pre-settlement, complete suburban development and conditions simulating environmentally sensitive planning practices.
   Hydrographed results conclude that environmentally sensitive planning practices can reduce developmental impacts on the hydrological performance of a landscape.

KW  - DEFORESTATION
AB  - Primary forest cover in western Madagascar declined from 12.5% in 1950 to 2.8% in 1990. Approximately 23% of remaining forest is located within reserves, but this is no guarantee of protection. Forest cover in the Andranomena Reserve in western Madagascar has been reduced by 44% since 1950. The identification of priority areas for establishment of development projects has been constrained by lack of information on the distribution, abundance, and habitat requirements of threatened species and the size, condition, and threats to survival of forest remnants. We evaluate a rapid fauna survey and habitat modeling procedure specifically designed to generate information for reserve selection and design using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The study was conducted in the largest remnant (94,000 ha) of primary monsoon rainforest in western Madagascar, using lemurs as an indicator group. Lemur abundance and microhabitat variables were measured at 64 stratified survey sites dispersed throughout the region. These records were incorporated into a GIS with other environmental and landuse data derived from maps and satellite imagery. Statistical procedures were applied to analyze species habitats, predict and map species distributions, and estimate species population sizes throughout the study area. Patterns of slash and burn agriculture and anthropogenic disturbance were also analyzed to identify areas at low risk of cultural disturbance. A map of disturbance risk was overlaid with a map of relative lemur biodiversity to identify conservation priority areas with high biodiversity and low risk of short term disturbance. Lemur diversity was most strongly influenced by habitat clearing and human disturbance (harvesting, stock grazing, and hunting) within 8 km of villages. Lemur diversity was highest in a region of higher elevation and rainfall, distant from villages and roads. The only existing reserve in the study area was located in a region of high disturbance risk. Almost half the reserve has been degraded during the past 45 years. There is considerable scope for re-allocation of land use within the study area to include a core protected area, a buffer zone with controlled hunting and timber harvesting, and an adjacent ecotourism facility. We found that information generated by a stratified biodiversity and landuse survey at a sampling intensity of less than 0.1% was sufficient to provide and objective foundation for regional biodiversity planning.

AB  - Tropical dry forest in Mesoamerica has long been disturbed by the extraction of different forest products by local inhabitants. Bursera glabrifolia (white "copalillo") is a dry tropical forest tree extensively used in several communities of the State of Oaxaca, Mexico, for the elaboration of folk-art woodcarvings called "alebrijes". Historically, the extraction of B. glabrifolia had not been regulated; however, in October 2002, the first management plan for this species was implemented in San Juan Bautista Jayacatlan, based on abundance, distribution and dasonomic data. However, no demographic information is available on which to base a sounder management plan that would guarantee the ecological sustainability of this extractive activity. Thus, we studied the population dynamics of this species over a 2-year period in Jayacatlan, where no tree extraction had taken place since 1998. We used stem expansion rates and observations on survival and fecundity to build size-based population projection matrices. The projected population growth rate values (lambda) were 1.14 and 1.04 for the 2001-2002 and the 2002-2003 periods, respectively. These values suggest that the B. glabrifolia population at Jayacatlan shows a growing trend. Several harvesting scenarios were simulated to theoretically assess the impact on population dynamics of harvesting whole trees and, in particular, to ascertain whether the extraction regime recommended by the management plan (8 trees/ha/yr) is sustainable. For this purpose, we used an average population matrix where specific entries were modified to simulate different extraction levels. The results suggest that the harvesting regimes established in the management plan for B. glabrifolia are sustainable. However, resource managers should not exceed the amounts recommended by the management plan and should avoid extrapolating our results to other regions of the country where no demographic studies have been carried out. The need for long-term demographic studies and their incorporation in 'adaptive management plans' is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bridging information gaps in an animal's habitat configuration is an explicit challenge in planning habitat protection actions (HPAs) for marine megafauna species near sites of intense anthropogenic activity. This challenge is further complicated by inadequate field survey designs and data manipulation that likely bias habitat configuration baselines. In this study, the likely habitat configuration of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, in the Chinese provinces of Fujian and Guangdong was projected using species distribution modeling (SDM). The influence of inadequate survey design and data manipulation of the baseline presentation was explored by comparing the SDM results from different datasets with current knowledge of humpback dolphin distributions in Chinese waters. Only the SDM based on data from systematically designed surveys projected a habitat configuration matching the current humpback dolphin distribution in China. The likely habitat configuration of humpback dolphins was characterized by high primary productivity and a shallow water depth. This study showed that ecosystem service losses, indexed by CO2 absorption, due to coastal alteration activities need to be factored into environmental impact assessments. Sound HPA practices include sharing information between research teams, mitigating the adverse impacts of anthropogenic activities, associating protected area networking with regional maritime spatial planning, monitoring coastal landscapes and seascape baselines, reducing land-based pollution, restoring degraded habitats for aquatic biota, and recovering land-to-sea connectivity. These measures require comprehensive coordination and collaboration between scientific research teams, policy representatives, NGOs/NPOs and stakeholder groups.

AB  - This study examined the relative impacts of different human activities and natural resource protections on the spatial distribution of beach vegetation and related habitat features (wrack, dune succession) in New Jersey (USA). Field surveys of the 209-km shoreline categorized beach segments according to vegetation cover classes, human activities, protection measures (exclosures, beach management plans, access restrictions) and ownership status (federal, state, etc.). A partition model (classification tree) was used to confirm the relative dominance hierarchy of human actions on the distribution of beach vegetation observed, and quantitative comparisons of dominant activities were conducted using vegetation data collected on 218 transects. The spatial extent of beach vegetation was found to be severely restricted by human activities when unconstrained by resource protections. The greatest reductions were found to result from mechanical raking (-99 %), scraping (-91 %) and all-year recreational ORV use (-86 %), which were dominant on nearly 70 % of the state shoreline. Beaches containing larger areas of vegetation (> 5 m) were concentrated in areas with resource protections of various kinds (99 %), and on federal or other public parklands (68 %). Exclosures resulted in the greatest coverage of vegetation (48 % of beach surface) compared to public access restricted areas (41 %), beach management plans (31 %), government-only ORV use (31 %), and off-season recreational ORVs (15 %). Greater protection and recovery of beach vegetation and habitat is needed for species conservation and erosion protection in New Jersey and other coastal environments where these activities occur.

TI  - Most Likely Bridges as Roosting Habitat for Bats: Study for Iowa
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
KW  - MYOTIS SODALIS
AB  - Bats play an important role in the natural balance of many ecosystems. There has been a growing concern about the bat population in the United States, mainly because of white-nose syndrome (WNS). The primary objective of this work was to better understand what types of bridges are the most likely to be used by bats as roosting locations. In one of the most comprehensive studies in the United States to date, 517 structures in the state of Iowa were inspected for evidence of bat roosting. Logistic regression models were fitted to identify structure, land cover distribution, and predicted bat species distribution characteristics that increase the probability of bat roosting. The final model indicated that probability of bat roosting on bridges increases under the following conditions: structures are prestressed concrete continuous, prestressed concrete or steel continuous; increased superstructure height above ground; increased superstructure depth; increased wetland coverage within a 0.1-mile radius of the structure; and increased number of potential bat species present at the location. The findings show that bridge characteristics, combined with land cover and bat species distribution data, are significant for higher probabilities of bat roosting. This information can be useful to transportation agencies as they plan bridge maintenance and renewal and can also help conservation efforts targeted toward bats. It is thought that the integration of objective, geospatial land cover data with potential bat presence data, and estimation of quantitative and relative influence of variables on probability of bat roosting are unique to this study.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are important factors determining animal population dynamics and spatial distribution. Such landscape changes can lead to the deleterious impact of a significant drop in the number of species, caused by critically reduced survival rates for organisms. In order to obtain a deeper understanding of the threeway interplay between habitat loss, fragmentation and survival rates, we propose here a spatially explicit multi-scaled movement model of individuals that search for habitat. By considering basic ecological processes, such as predation, starvation (outside the habitat area), and competition, together with dispersal movement as a link among habitat areas, we show that a higher survival rate is achieved in instances with a lower number of patches of larger areas. Our results demonstrate how movement may counterbalance the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation in altered landscapes. In particular, they have important implications for conservation planning and ecosystem management, including the design of specific features of conservation areas in order to enhance landscape connectivity and population viability.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) have become tools of great importance in ecology, as advanced knowledge of suitable species habitat is required for the process of global biodiversity conservation. Presence-only data are the more abundant and readily available data widely used in SDM applications. These data should be treated as a thinned Poisson process to account for detection errors related to sampling bias and imperfect detection that arise in them. Failure to do so could be detrimental to SDM's predictions. This study assesses the effects of the species abundance, the variation in detection probability, and the number of sites visited in planned surveys on the performance of SDMs accounting for detection errors using simulated data. The results show that the accuracy and precision of estimates differ depending on models and species abundance. Their main difference lies in their ability to estimate beta(0), the model intercept. The lower the species abundance, the higher the bias and variance of (beta) over cap (0). Furthermore, the lower the detection probability, the higher the bias and variance of (beta) over cap (0). However, beta(1), the slope parameter, is estimated with almost high accuracy and precision for all models. This study demonstrates the low efficiency of accounting for sampling bias and imperfect detection based on presence-only data alone. Analysing presence-only data in conjunction with point-count outperformed the other approaches, whatever the species abundance, as long as the detection probability is at least 0.25 with average values of detectability covariates. The acceptable accuracy and precision, the minimum number of sites to consider vary depending on species abundance. At least 200 sites are required for the rare species, whereas 50 sites can suffice for the abundant species. Since collecting high-quality data are very expensive, this study emphasizes the need to promote initiatives such as citizen science programs that aim to collect species occurrence data with as little bias as possible.

AB  - We evaluated the long-term implications from modifying rotation lengths in production forests for four forest-reliant species with different habitat requirements. By combining simulations of forest development with habitat models, and accounting both for stand and landscape scale influences, we projected habitat availability over 150 years in a large Swedish landscape, using rotation lengths which are longer (+22% and +50%) and shorter (-22%) compared to current practices. In terms of mean habitat availability through time, species requiring older forest were affected positively by extended rotations, and negatively by shortened rotations. For example, the mean habitat area for the treecreeper Certhia familiaris (a bird preferring forest with larger trees) increased by 31% when rotations were increased by 22%, at a 5% cost to net present value (NPV) and a 7% decrease in harvested volume. Extending rotation lengths by 50% provided more habitat for this species compared to a 22% extension, but at a much higher marginal cost. In contrast, the beetle Hadreule elongatula, which is dependent on sun-exposed dead wood, benefited from shortened rather than prolonged rotations. Due to an uneven distribution of stand-ages within the landscape, the relative amounts of habitat provided by different rotation length scenarios for a given species were not always consistent through time during the simulation period. If implemented as a conservation measure, prolonging rotations will require long-term strategic planning to avoid future bottlenecks in habitat availability, and will need to be accompanied by complementary measures accounting for the diversity of habitats necessary for the conservation of forest biodiversity.

AB  - Habitat classification models (HCMs) are invaluable tools for species conservation, land-use planning, reserve design, and metapopulation assessments, particularly at broad spatial scales. However, species occurrence data are often lacking and typically limited to presence points at broad scales. This lack of absence data precludes the use of many statistical techniques for HCMs. One option is to generate pseudo-absence points so that the many available statistical modeling tools can be used. Traditional techniques generate pseudo-absence points at random across broadly defined species ranges, often failing to include biological knowledge concerning the species-habitat relationship. We incorporated biological knowledge of the species-habitat relationship into pseudo-absence points by creating habitat envelopes that constrain the region from which points were randomly selected. We define a habitat envelope as an ecological representation of a species, or species feature's (e.g., nest) observed distribution (i.e., realized niche) based on a single attribute, or the spatial intersection of multiple attributes. We created HCMs for Northern Goshawk (Accipiter geatilis atricapillus) nest habitat during the breeding season across Utah forests with extant nest presence points and ecologically based pseudo-absence points using logistic regression. Predictor variables were derived from 30-m USDA Landfire and 250-m Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) map products. These habitat-envelope-based models were then compared to null envelope models which use traditional practices for generating pseudo-absences. Models were assessed for fit and predictive capability using metrics such as kappa, threshold-independent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots, adjusted deviance (Dad), and cross-validation, and were also assessed for ecological relevance. For all cases, habitat envelope-based models outperformed null envelope models and were more ecologically relevant, suggesting that incorporating biological knowledge into pseudo-absence point generation is a powerful tool for species habitat assessments. Furthermore, given some a priori knowledge of the species-habitat relationship, ecologically based pseudo-absence points can be applied to any species, ecosystem, data resolution, and spatial extent.

AB  - Aim Invasive alien species (IAS) can cause profound impacts on ecosystem function and diversity, human health, well-being and livelihoods. Climate change is an important driver of biological invasions, so it is critical to develop models and climate-driven scenarios of IAS range shifts to establish preventive measures. In this study, we analyse how projected changes in the frequency and magnitude of climate extreme events could affect the spread of the six most widely distributed invasive vertebrate species in the Iberian Peninsula. Location Iberian Peninsula. Taxa Red avadavat (Amandava amandava), common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus), rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), American mink (Neovison vison) and pond slider (Trachemys scripta). Methods We followed best-practice standards for species distribution models (SDMs) regarding handling of the response and predictor variables, model building and evaluation using metrics that assess different facets of model performance. We used an ensemble approach with four modelling methods of varying complexity, including both regression-based and tree-based machine-learning algorithms. We analysed five regional models for current (1971-2000) and future climate (2021-2050). We used principal components analysis to assess consensus among model outputs and positively weighed predictions from well-performing models. Results Selected models showed high consensus and good predictive capacity on block cross-validation areas. Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models scored highest in reliability (calibration), but Bayesian Additive Regression Trees provided the best balance between calibration and discrimination capacity. Forecasts include visible changes in environmental favourability, with losses generally outweighing the gains, but with some areas becoming more favourable for several species. Main conclusions Increased frequency and/or intensity of climate extreme events associated with ongoing climate change are projected to reduce overall invasion risk for the species examined although increases in favourability should be expected locally.

AB  - Determining habitat quality for wildlife populations requires relating a species' habitat to its survival and reproduction. Within a season, species occurrence and density can be disconnected from measures of habitat quality when resources are highly seasonal, unpredictable over time, and patchy. Here we establish an explicit link among dynamic selection of changing resources, spatio-temporal species distributions, and fitness for predictive abundance and occurrence models that are used for short-term water management and long-term restoration planning. We used the wading bird distribution and evaluation models (WADEM) that estimate (1) daily changes in selection across resource gradients, (2) landscape abundance of flocks and individuals, (3) conspecific foraging aggregation, and (4) resource unit occurrence (at fixed 400m cells) to quantify habitat quality and its consequences on reproduction for wetland indicator species. We linked maximum annual numbers of nests detected across the study area and nesting success of Great Egrets (Ardea alba), White Ibises (Eudocimus albus), and Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) over a 20-year period to estimated daily dynamics of food resources produced by WADEM over a 7490km(2) area. For all species, increases in predicted species abundance in March and high abundance in April were strongly linked to breeding responses. Great Egret nesting effort and success were higher when birds also showed greater conspecific foraging aggregation. Synthesis and applications: This study provides the first empirical evidence that dynamic habitat selection processes and distributions of wading birds over environmental gradients are linked with reproductive measures over periods of decades. Further, predictor variables at a variety of temporal (daily-multiannual) resolutions and spatial (400m to regional) scales effectively explained variation in ecological processes that change habitat quality. The process used here allows managers to develop short- and long-term conservation strategies that (1) consider flexible behavioral patterns and (2) are robust to environmental variation over time.

AB  - Aim
   Urbanization is a leading threat to global biodiversity, yet little is known about how the spatial arrangement and composition of biophysical elements - buildings and vegetation - within a metropolitan area influence habitat selection. Here, we ask: what is the relative importance of the structure and composition of these elements on bird species across multiple spatial scales?
   Location
   The temperate metropolitan area of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.
   Methods
   We surveyed breeding birds on 71 plots along an urban gradient. We modelled relative density for 48 bird species in relation to local woody vegetation composition and structure and to tree cover, grass cover and building density within 50-1000 m of each plot. We used an information-theoretic approach to compare models and variables.
   Results
   At the proximate scale, native tree and understory stem frequency were the most important vegetation variables explaining bird distributions. Species' responses to landscape biophysical features and spatial scales varied. Most native species responded positively to vegetation measures and negatively to building density. Models combining both local vegetation and landscape information represented best or competitive models for the majority of species, while models containing only local vegetation characteristics were rarely competitive. Smaller spatial scales (< 500 m) were most important for 36 species, and eight species had best models at larger scales (> 500 m); however, several species had competitive models across multiple scales.
   Main conclusions
   Habitat selection by birds within the urban matrix is the result of a combination of factors operating at both proximate and broader spatial scales. Efforts to manage and design urban areas to benefit native birds require both fine-scale (e.g., individual landowners and landscape design) and larger landscape actions (e.g., regional comprehensive planning).

AB  - Predicting habitat for rare species at landscape scales is a common goal of environmental monitoring, management, and conservation; however, the ability to meet that objective is often limited by the paucity of location records and availability of spatial predictors that effectively describe their habitat. To address this challenge, we used an adaptive, model-based iterative sampling design to direct four years of rare plant surveys within 0.25 ha plots across 602 sites in northeast Alberta, Canada. We used these location records to model and map rare plant habitats for the region using a suite of geospatial predictors including airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) vegetation structure metrics, land cover types, soil pH, and a terrain wetness model. Our results indicated that LiDAR-derived vegetation structural metrics and land cover were the most important individual factors, but all variables contributed to predicting the occurrence of rare plants. For LiDAR variables, rarity was negatively related to maximum canopy height, but positively related to canopy relief ratio. Rarity was therefore more likely in places with shorter canopy heights and greater structural complexity. This included fens, which overall had the highest rates of rare plant occurrence. Model-based allocation of sampling led to detections of uncommon species at nearly all sites, while the rarest species in the region were detected at an average encounter rate of 8%. Landscape predictions of rare plant habitat can improve our understanding of environmental limits in rarity, guide local management decisions and monitoring plans, and provide regional tools for assessing impacts from resource development.

AB  - Invasion of protected areas by non-native species is currently one of the main threats to global biodiversity. Using an ensemble of bioclimatic envelope models we quantify the degree of exposure of South American protected areas to invasion by two invasive amphibian species. We focus on protected areas that coincide with global biodiversity hotspots. The species modeled, Lithobates catesbeianus and Xenopus laevis, have been reported to threaten local faunas in several non-native areas that they invaded, including areas in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. We show that 87.5% of the protected areas within the Atlantic Forest may be most at risk of invasion by L. catesbeianus and X. laevis under current climate conditions, followed by areas in the Cerrado (51.7), Tropical Andes (37.6%), Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena (22.5%), and Chilean Winter Rainfall and Valdivian Forests (20.5%). Conservation plans for these regions should, therefore, consider latent threats from multiple sources including invasion by highly competitive non-native species such as the ones modeled in our study.

AB  - Understanding how seabirds use the marine environment is key for marine spatial planning, and maps of their marine distributions derived from transect-based surveys and from tracking of individual bird's movements are increasingly available for the same geographic areas. Although the value of integrating these different datasets is well recognised, few studies have undertaken quantitative comparisons of the resulting distributions. Here we take advantage of four existing distribution maps and conduct a quantitative comparison for four seabird species (black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla; European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis; common guillemot Uria aalge; and razorbill Alca torda). We quantify the amount of overlap and agreement in the location of high use areas identified from either tracking or transect samples and use Bhattacharyya's Affinity to quantify levels of similarity in the general distribution patterns. Despite multiple differences in the properties of the datasets, there was a far greater degree of overlap than would be expected by chance, except when adopting the most constrained definition of high use. Distance to the nearest conspecific colony appeared to be an important driver of the degree of similarity. Agreed areas of highest use tended to occur close to colonies and, with increasing distance from colonies, similarity between datasets declined and/or there was similarity in respect of their being relatively low usage. Interpreting reasons for agreement between data sources in some areas and not others was limited by an inability to control for the multiple potential sources of differences from both the sampling and modelling processes of the underlying datasets. Nevertheless, our quantitative comparative approach provides a valuable tool to quantify the degree to which an area's importance is corroborated across multiple datasets, and therefore confidence that an important area has been correctly identified. This can help prioritise where the implementation of conservation measures should be targeted and identify where greatest scrutiny is required of the potential adverse environmental effects of any planned anthropogenic activities.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate whether simple geographical data can be used to predict the probability of the presence of two threatened snail species: Vertigo angustior and V. moulinsiana, occurring within wetland areas across their central European range. Our research was based on data from 226 localities across Poland fitting with the species requirements according to the current literature. We used Canonical Variance Analysis with variance partitioning and tree classifications to model relationships between the species presence/absence and rough geographic features describing each locality (landscape and geomorphological types and hydrography). Our results have shown that the localities of the studied species are related to particular types of landform and landscape and are not distributed uniformly. Both species occur predominantly in young postglacial lowland landscapes and are usually associated with particular succession stages of lakes, with V. moulinsiana occurring in earlier phases of habitat evolution. Results from modelling show that cost- and time effectiveness of surveying for these species could be substantially increased by avoiding particular location types. The prediction models presented will be a useful tool for planning future surveys of the vertiginids and in studies on their ecology and distribution.

AB  - Twenty-eight diadromous fish species occurred in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East in historical times. Their current distributions were assessed in terms of abundance classes (missing, rare, common and abundant) in 196 basins ranging from Morocco to northern Norway and from Greenland to Iran.
   Their current distributions were modelled using abiotic, biotic, climatic and anthropogenic (regional anthropogenic pressures) variables. Anthropogenic variables were derived from characteristics of large dams (height, distance from the outlet, percentage of main stem river available downstream of dam) and human population density. These data were taken from the EEA Eldred 2.08 (European Lakes, Dams and Reservoirs Database) that deals comprehensively with large European dams and includes all obstacles of this type. To deal with ordinal response variables, we applied proportional odds models.
   Twenty-two species-specific models were successfully built according to the reduction of deviance and the validation process, of which eight included one or more anthropogenic variables. No model could be established for six endemic or highly endangered species such as Acipenser sturio and Coregonus oxyrinchus.
   Most response curves were easily interpretable since they were related to specific aspects of species' ecology. Anthropogenic variables related to large dams impacted negatively on the distribution of diadromous fishes through the perturbation of river discharge patterns, the loss of river connectivity and the accessibility to essential habitats, particularly for Salmonid species that spawn in headwater streams. However, one species which can complete its life cycle using only the most downstream part of the basin, Liza ramada, was found to be favoured by the changes in hydrological regime. The bell-shaped curves obtained from human population density for three diadromous species were connected on one side to a common settlement history of human and animal populations and on the other side to negative impacts of human activities arising at high population density.
   Our approach can provide the basis for identifying special areas of conservation prior to planning restoration programmes at country or basin scales, as well as for more specialized studies focusing on one species only or at the local scale.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the largest threats to amphibian populations. However, most studies have not provided clear insights into their population-level implications. There is a critical need to investigate the mechanisms that underlie patterns of distribution and abundance. In order to understand the population- and species-level implications of habitat loss and fragmentation, it is necessary to move from site-specific inferences to assessments of how the influences of multiple factors interact across extensive landscapes to influence population size and population connectivity. The goal of this paper is to summarize the state of knowledge, identify information gaps and suggest research approaches to provide reliable knowledge and effective conservation of amphibians in landscapes experiencing habitat loss and fragmentation. Reliable inferences require attention to species-specific ecological characteristics and their interactions with environmental conditions at a range of spatial scales. Habitat connectivity appears to play a key role in regional viability of amphibian populations. in amphibians, population connectivity is predominantly effected through juvenile dispersal. The preponderance of evidence suggests that the short-term impact of habitat loss and fragmentation increases with dispersal ability. However, species with limited dispersal abilities are likely to be equally imperiled by habitat loss and fragmentation over longer time periods. Rigorous understanding of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on amphibians will require species-specific, multi-scale, mechanistic investigations, and will be benefit from integrating large empirical field studies with molecular genetics and simulation modeling. Molecular genetic methods are particularly suited to quantifying the influences of habitat structure across large spatial extents on gene flow and population connectivity. Conservation strategies would benefit by moving from generalizations to species and process specific recommendations and by moving from site-specific actions to implementing conservation plans at multiple scales across broad landscapes.

AB  - Estimating relationships between landscape variables and the presence of a species via occupancy modeling is common practice for many animal species. However, estimating these relationships can be difficult for specie: where availability for detection is driven by factors that match the traditional primary sampling period. WW present a new hierarchical formulation of the occupancy model to estimate these relationships in the presence o among-year variation in availability for detection for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) There were large swings in apparent annual proportion of area occupied ranging from 0.19 to 0.66, with year-to year changes in the apparent annual proportion ranging from - 25.7% to 230.2%. The model estimated the true latent proportion of area occupied was 0.57 (95% Cr.I. 0.51-0.631). The predictive raster surface developer from the novel model formulation validated well using an independent data set (Pearson's r = 0.948), witl radio-telemetered desert tortoises spending disproportionately more time in higher predicted probability o occurrence portions of the study area. The coefficients from the model, and more specifically the occupance probability predictive raster surface developed from them, can be used by land managers to guide future surve3 efforts and to spatially prioritize restoration actions across a 35,000 ha conservation reserve. In general, ac knowledging the challenge of confounding availability for detection with apparent annual occupancy and using the modeling framework presented here can be used to determine fundamental relationships between landscape configuration and latent occupancy for a variety of heretofore unaddressed species.

AB  - Different organisms respond to landscape configuration and spatial structure in different terms and across different spatial scales. Here, regression models with variation partitioning were applied to determine relative influence of the three groups of variables (climate, land use and environmental heterogeneity) and spatial structure variables on plant, bird, orthopteran and butterfly species richness in a region of the Southern Alps, ranging in elevation from the sea level to 2,780 m. Grassland and forest cover were positively correlated with species richness in both taxonomic groups, whilst species richness decreased with increasing urban elements and arable land. The variation was mainly explained by the shared component between the three groups in plants and between landscape and environmental heterogeneity in birds. The variation was related to independent land use effect in insects. The distribution in species richness was spatially structured for plants, birds and orthopterans, whilst in butterflies, no spatial structure was detected. Plant richness was associated with linear trend variation and broad-scale spatial structure in the northern part of the region, whilst bird richness with broad-scale variation which occurs on the external Alpine ridge. Orthopteran diversity was strongly related to fine-scale spatial structure, generated by dynamic processes or by unmeasured spatially structured abiotic factors. Although the study was carried out in relatively small area, the four taxonomic groups seem to respond to biodiversity drivers in a surprisingly different way. This has considerable implications for conservation planning as it restricts the usefulness of simple indicators in prioritizing areas for conservation purposes.

AB  - 1. The implementation of effective and appropriate protection actions is frequently hindered by lack of thorough knowledge on species ecology especially in the case of endemic, vulnerable and elusive species.
   2. Using a recently updated and unpublished dataset describing the spatial distribution of the Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) in its northern range (French Pyrenees), an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) was conducted to provide a quantitative estimate of local habitat use by this endangered semi-aquatic mammal. A comparative approach was used to investigate potential differences in habitat use among the three main hydrological regions of the French Pyrenees.
   3. The Pyrenean desman was identified as a marginal and specialist species concerning the selection of its local habitat in the French Pyrenees. Key habitat variables corresponded mainly to river-bed characteristics (i.e. high heterogeneity of shelters and river substrates, fast flowing water facies, low amounts of fine sediment) and river-bank characteristics (i.e. high proportion of rocks, low proportion of earth). A difference in habitat selection between the three hydrological regions of the French Pyrenees was also highlighted. A decrease in marginality and specialization from west to east as well as differences in habitat variables driving the ecological niche of the Pyrenean desman and its range suggested a spatial structure in desman populations regarding local ecological factors.
   4. These results stress the importance of effective and sustainable river management for the habitat quality of this endangered species and also demonstrate the importance of taking into account the variability in habitat preferences that can exist between geographically distinct populations. This finding has important implications for conservation planning that should thus be conducted at the population level instead of the traditional species level in order to target the specific needs of each hydrological region.

AB  - Confirming presence and distribution of a species is necessary for effective conservation. However, obtaining robust occupancy estimates and confidently identifying factors important to occupancy may be difficult for rare and elusive species. Further, in surveys to assess presence, false-positive detections bias results; however, false-positive occupancy models can resolve this bias and, thus, better support conservation. We assessed the performance of false-positive versus standard occupancy models and important factors predicting presence for a low-density bat population in the southern Appalachian Mountains. From May to August 2013-2015, we surveyed 35 sites for northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) using both mist-net and acoustic methods. We compared AIC(c) values for 13 standard occupancy models and 13 corresponding false-positive occupancy models. In our model comparison, false-positive models received more support, while none of the standard occupancy models were plausible. False-positive occupancy models produced a wider range of probability of occupancy estimates (0.004-0.998) and lower mean occupancy estimate (0.62) than standard models (0.482-0.970, mean = 0.86). Weighted parameter estimates for important predictors in two plausible false-positive occupancy models indicated the probability of occupancy for northern long-eared bats was higher at less-rugged, lower-elevation sites. In contrast, there was more ambiguity regarding the most plausible standard occupancy models and important predictors of occupancy from standard models. Due to low capture rates and the uncertainty of acoustic identifications, we recommend coupling a certain method with uncertain methods when surveying rare and elusive bat species. Applying false-positive occupancy models to our data yielded less-biased site-specific occupancy estimates and informative predictors, and, hence, more reliable predictions to inform conservation management plans.

AB  - Aim: Predicting accurate species responses to climate change in fragmented landscapes is challenging in conservation biogeography. We assessed the role of dispersal, including long-distance dispersal (LDD), for the long-term persistence of a rare plant species (Vella pseudocytisus subsp. paui) under current climate conditions and four future climate scenarios; and analysed the effect of competition for its regional survival.
   Location: Ester Iberian system, Aragon, Spain.
   Methods: We used BioMove, a linked modelling platform that integrates demographic, dispersal and competition features with biogeographic predictions of range dynamics, and whose results can inform risk assessments and conservation planning. We linked Vella's population dynamics and habitat suitability models with its well-documented life history traits and ecological characteristics to enhance our understanding of its inherent vulnerability to dispersal, competitive interactions and climate change.
   Results: We found thresholds in the effect of long dispersal distances on population persistence, suggesting a mid-distance optimum, which reduces mortality risk associated with the increasing proportion of LDD seeds. Moreover, increasing the proportion of LDD propagules reduces Vella's ability to compete in currently occupied and nearby unoccupied habitats by reducing the number of local recruitments.
   Main conclusions: Whereas LDD ability is generally assumed to be beneficial for the long-term persistence of plant species in fragmented landscapes, our results suggest that moderate to high distances between new colonization increase the species' dispersal-related mortality. Higher numbers of LDD events reduce the number of local propagules in established populations, reducing regional survival for Vella. Moreover, associated range shifts of potentially better climate-adapted competitors could prevent Vella individuals from colonizing new climatically suitable habitats. These findings can support development of more efficient conservation management strategies for establishing new population patches to mitigate population losses due to climate change. Our findings may also apply as a framework for other narrowly distributed endemic shrub species, particularly edaphic endemics.

AB  - There are large numbers of records of uncommon beetles from exposed riverine sediments (ERS) (gravel, sand and silt shoals) in the UK. However, systematic surveys of their occurrence in relation to environmental controls are seldom undertaken. Data are presented here from a survey of 69 shingle ERS across England and Wales and used to establish which factors were important in constraining species assemblages. Over 480 species of Coleoptera were collected by a combination of pitfall trapping, hand searching and excavation techniques. A total of 81 species with conservation status of Vulnerable, Rare or Nationally Scarce were recorded during the work and this includes six species on the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) lists. A subset of 42 of these rare species can be classified as ERS specialists. The data were analysed using TWINSPAN, redundancy analysis (RDA), single factor ANOVA, general linear modelling (GLM) and correlation to examine the importance of selected environmental variables and their relationships with the species assemblages. The results indicate that: (i) ERS sites with large numbers of species that are either rare or exhibit strong fidelity to the sediments have a markedly western distribution in the UK and are found on unregulated rivers in Wales and a number of rivers in the south west of England, (ii) the type of substrate, habitat heterogeneity, the percentage of shade from trees, the percentage of fine sediments on the ERS, the amount of trampling and ERS size are important in determining invertebrate communities and (iii) ERS provide valuable and important habitats for rare beetles species in the UK. The importance of river regulation, engineering and trampling by stocking for ERS invertebrates is discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exciting developments in biodiversity informatics, and particularly the growth of aggregated data networks such as ORNIS and VertNet, have stimulated new areas of research in ornithology and other disciplines that would not have been possible otherwise. In addition to aggregating data from across natural history collections, VertNet provides valuable tools and services for assessing and improving data quality through pre- and postdata publication workflows as well as through feedback mechanisms, and for providing usage statistics back to participating collections. Furthermore, VertNet's outreach to the collections community has resulted in national and international training in georeferencing and biodiversity informatics that has had a broad impact. Rapid access to high-quality data has made possible studies that explore large and complex datasets reflecting the global and temporal distributions of species. Specific examples include studies of niche evolution and speciation, risk assessment of invasive species, phenotypic evolution and the colonization of novel habitats, latitudinal gradients and evolutionary divergence, and biodiversity and conservation planning. These studies showcase the value of natural history collections, and highlight the need for ongoing support to protect and grow those collections and to enable efficient access to their data. The role of natural history collections in addressing challenges faced by society is more important than ever before. In the modern era of sharing data, collections hold exciting promise for future and emerging avenues of research that extend the value of specimens beyond what we have ever dreamed before.

AB  - Aim Many species are susceptible to climatic extremes, yet few fine-scale studies consider the factors that determine the distribution of extreme temperatures at landscape and regional scales. These factors include cold air drainage, canopy cover and topographical exposure to winds and radiation. We used the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) to test whether innovative topoclimatic grids of extreme temperatures are an important predictor of regional-scale species distributions. Location Hunter Valley region, New South Wales, Australia (31.2-33.4 degrees S, 148.6-153.0 degrees E). Methods We modelled the regional distributions of rock-wallaby observations and colonies using topoclimatic, macroclimatic, topographical and habitat factors. We employed a randomization procedure to reduce spatial clustering of records and divide the data into 10 different training and testing datasets. Models were assessed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) on the training datasets, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on the test datasets, and the consistency of the response curves. We compared multiple univariate and multivariate models, rather than producing one true' model, to examine the evidence that different environmental factors consistently influenced the distribution of rock-wallabies. Results The environmental factors that were consistently strongest at explaining the distribution of rock-wallabies were the topoclimatic estimate of extreme cold, the macroclimatic estimate of annual precipitation, and the amount of cleared land within 1600m. Rock-wallaby colonies were in areas where minimum temperatures were high, rainfall was low, and there was a low proportion of cleared land. Topographical surrogates performed well in univariate models but poorly in multivariate models. Main conclusions We have shown that topoclimatic maps of extreme conditions have the potential to model the regional distributions of at least some species better than indirect surrogates based on topography or macroclimate. Topoclimatic grids are an important tool for regional conservation planning, but practitioners need to place more emphasis on the derivation and accuracy of the climate grids, not just the spatial resolution.

AB  - Australia is a large continent with a relatively small population, and government agencies and research institutions are devoting considerable resources to the development of nerv approaches anti tools For conserving and managing Australia's biodiversity. Issues of data duality, choice of analysis method, ecological theory, anti GIS (geographic information system) use are discussed using examples from recent Australian studies with emphasis on the scientific components. The problem of data quality is examined in terms of a suitable minimum data set and the need for a survey design for representative sampling using results from a survey of 24,000 km(2) in northeastern New South Wales. Examples of analytical tools for modeling species distribution, e.g., generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized additive models (GAM). are presented using data from a database of 9537 plots and 273 tree species for an area of 40,000 knit in southeastern New South Wales. The necessity for ecological theory, in particular continuum theory as opposed to community concepts, is examined in the contest of these results. The interface between ecological and evolutionary theory is discussed drawing on the results of statistical modeling (GLM) of species richness patterns of Eucalyptus subgenera in the same area. The predictive use of GIS in mapping; vegetation. using statistical modeling (GAM) and multivariate classification techniques. is demonstrated with an application to a comprehensive regional assessment (CRA) process for establishing a regional conservation plan. These methods and analytical tools have been collated into a package, BioRap, which also includes methods for the selection of priority areas fdr conservation. Rapid progress is being made in developing new tools. IIowever, theory for ecological. statistical, environmental, and evolutionary processes is urgently needed to ensure effective use of these emerging tools for investigating and managing biodiversity.

AB  - Environmental policies and the objective of no net loss highlight the importance of preserving ecological networks to limit the fragmentation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss, especially due to urbanization. In the environmental impact assessment context, habitat connectivity and the spatio-temporal dynamics of biodiversity are crucial to obtaining reliable predictions that can support decision-making. We propose a methodological framework 1) to quantify the overall impact of a development project on the functioning of an ecological network, and 2) to select the best locations for implanting new habitat patches intended to enhance landscape connectivity. The amount of reachable habitat concept was applied to three representative terrestrial mammal species: the red squirrel, the Eurasian badger and the European hedgehog. All three species are recognized as vulnerable to human pressures and potentially affected by the construction of a new stadium in our study site, Lyon (Southern France). The method combines the species distribution model Maxent with the landscape functional connectivity model Graphab. The results showed that using any one of the avoidance and reduction measures on its own was unsuccessful in achieving the objective of no net loss when habitat connectivity is considered. However, the combination of new habitat patches and corridors offered a higher gain than distinct measures. This is especially important in the short term, when new hedgerow plantations have not yet developed enough to be used by the target species. Our findings indicate, first, the need to take the temporal scale into account in environmental impact assessment. We also show that applying the optimal scenario, constructed using a cumulative patch addition followed by a similar process testing a set of potential land-use changes, maximizes habitat connectivity. Our methodology provides a useful tool to increase target species' habitat connectivity within the mitigation hierarchy and to enhance development project design for increased environmental efficiency.

AB  - Niche description and differentiation at broad geographic scales have been recent major topics in ecology and evolution. Describing the environmental niche structure of sister taxa with known evolutionary trajectories stands out as a useful exercise in understanding niche requirements. Here we model the environmental niche structure and distribution of the recently resolved phylogeography of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) lineages on the western slope of the southern Andes. Using a maximum entropy framework, field data, and information on climate, topography, human density, and vegetation cover, we identify differences between the two subspecies (L. g. cacsilensis, L. g. guanicoe) and their intermediate-hybrid lineage, that most likely determine the distribution of this species. While aridity seems to be a major factor influencing the distribution at the species-level (annual precipitation <900 mm), we also document important differences in niche specificity for each subspecies, where distribution of Northern lineage is explained mainly by elevation (mean = 3,413 m) and precipitation seasonality (mean = 161 mm), hybrid lineage by annual precipitation (mean = 139 mm), and Southern subspecies by annual precipitation (mean = 553 mm), precipitation seasonality (mean = 21 mm) and grass cover (mean = 8.2%). Among lineages, we detected low levels of niche overlap: I (Similarity Index) = 0.06 and D (Schoener's Similarity Index) = 0.01; and higher levels when comparing Northern and Southern subspecies with hybrids lineage (I = 0.32-0.10 and D = 0.12-0.03, respectively). This suggests that important ecological and/or evolutionary processes are shaping the niche of guanacos in Chile, producing discrepancies when comparing range distribution at the species-level (81,756 km(2)) with lineages-level (65,321 km(2)). The subspecies-specific description of niche structure is provided here based upon detailed spatial distribution of the lineages of guanacos in Chile. Such description provides a scientific tool to further develop large scale plans for habitat conservation and preservation of intraspecific genetic variability for this far ranging South American camelid, which inhabits a diversity of ecoregion types from Andean puna to subpolar forests.

AB  - Aldabrachelys gigantea (Aldabra giant tortoise) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world and survives as a single wild population of over 100,000 individuals on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. Despite this large current population size, the species faces an uncertain future because of its extremely restricted distribution range and high vulnerability to the projected consequences of climate change. Captive-bred A. gigantea are increasingly used in rewilding programs across the region, where they are introduced to replace extinct giant tortoises in an attempt to functionally resurrect degraded island ecosystems. However, there has been little consideration of the current levels of genetic variation and differentiation within and among the islands on Aldabra. As previous microsatellite studies were inconclusive, we combined low-coverage and double-digest restriction-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to analyze samples from 33 tortoises (11 from each main island). Using 5426 variant sites within the tortoise genome, we detected patterns of within-island population structure, but no differentiation between the islands. These unexpected results highlight the importance of using genome-wide genetic markers to capture higher-resolution genetic structure to inform future management plans, even in a seemingly panmictic population. We show that low-coverage ddRAD sequencing provides an affordable alternative approach to conservation genomic projects of non-model species with large genomes.

AB  - Forest and woodland landscape restoration is a key undertaking of renewed interest for forestry and conservation practitioners, but is hampered by the lack of information on the distributions of tree species and of patterns of intra-specific genetic variation. Through the first meta-analysis of its type, we here tested the utility of a high-resolution potential natural vegetation (PNV) map for eastern Africa (vegetationmap4africa) for supporting restoration activities by comparison with 20 molecular marker genetic datasets, identified through literature review and other sources, for ten indigenous tree species. Our analysis indicated that site suitability and stability values from PNV-based ecological niche modelling involving current and past climate scenarios were positively related to population genetic diversity values revealed by molecular markers, supporting the value of PNV maps for the practical planning of restoration activities accounting for anthropogenic climate change. Furthermore, population pairwise genetic divergence was strongly positively correlated with population pairwise geographic distances for most datasets, indicating generalizable sampling implications for tree genetic resource conservation in the region. Population pairwise genetic divergence was however not well explained by sampling across PNV and wider physiognomic types, possibly due to molecular markers' adaptive neutrality and high rates of recombination in trees, among other factors. Patterns of neutral molecular marker variation are thus no substitute for trials of adaptive variation for confirming or refuting the utility of vegetation boundaries in defining tree planting zones. We discuss the importance of results for eastern Africa and more widely.

AB  - Spatial modelling based on line transect data is a standard method for characterising marine mammal distributions and habitat preference. However, collecting the data required is costly and may be difficult in remote areas. Models based on habitat variables offer the potential to predict where the species will occur in areas outside the area of a localised survey. This has important implications for spatial management where decisions have to be made that affect wide areas over which comprehensive survey efforts may not be feasible. This study demonstrates that it is possible, using a spatially limited data set, to characterise habitat use and predict the distribution of two poorly known sympatric delphinids around the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands (FI), Commerson's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus commersonh) and Peale's dolphins (Lagenorhynchus australis). We used a Hurdle model approach to investigate the relationship between dolphin sightings (from a spatially restricted boat-based line transect survey) and environmental covariates. We then used the modelled relationships to predict the distribution and relative abundance of Commerson's and Peale's dolphins over the entire FI inshore waters. We compared the predicted distribution maps to independent sightings from a subsequent island-wide aerial line transect survey, and found a close match between predicted and observed distributions. Commerson's dolphins preferred nearshore waters with strong tidal mixing and were most numerous close to river mouths and in upper inlets or channels. In contrast, Peale's dolphins preferred deeper, well-stratified areas further from shore as well as nearshore waters with extensive kelp beds. While the two dolphin species are often considered sympatric, our results indicate fine-scale habitat partitioning based on specific habitat preferences, which is important to consider in further studies and marine spatial planning. We provide several methodological refinements to prepare transect sighting data for spatial analysis and implement Hurdle models more easily using the new "dshm" R-package. We also show the usefulness of such refinements applied to a carefully chosen spatially limited dataset as a cost-effective approach to elucidating species distribution patterns. Our methodology and software implementations can be easily applied to transect survey data of other marine and terrestrial taxa.

AB  - 1. Model-based approaches have been used increasingly in conservation biology over recent years. Species presence data used for predictive species distribution modelling are abundant in natural history collections, whereas reliable absence data are sparse, most notably for vagrant species such as butterflies and snakes. As predictive methods such as generalized linear models (GLM) require absence data, various strategies have been proposed to select pseudo-absence data. However, only a few studies exist that compare different approaches to generating these pseudo-absence data.
   2. Natural history collection data are usually available for long periods of time (decades or even centuries), thus allowing historical considerations. However, this historical dimension has rarely been assessed in studies of species distribution, although there is great potential for understanding current patterns, i.e. the past is the key to the present.
   3. We used GLM to model the distributions of three 'target' butterfly species, Melitaea didyma, Coenonympha tullia and Maculinea teleius, in Switzerland. We developed and compared four strategies for defining pools of pseudo-absence data and applied them to natural history collection data from the last 10, 30 and 100 years. Pools included: (i) sites without target species records; (ii) sites where butterfly species other than the target species were present; (iii) sites without butterfly species but with habitat characteristics similar to those required by the target species; and (iv) a combination of the second and third strategies. Models were evaluated and compared by the total deviance explained, the maximized Kappa and the area under the curve (AUC).
   4. Among the four strategies, model performance was best for strategy 3. Contrary to expectations, strategy 2 resulted in even lower model performance compared with models with pseudo-absence data simulated totally at random (strategy 1).
   5. Independent of the strategy model, performance was enhanced when sites with historical species presence data were not considered as pseudo-absence data. Therefore, the combination of strategy 3 with species records from the last 100 years achieved the highest model performance.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The protection of suitable habitat for species survival or reintroduction in rapidly changing landscapes is a high priority among conservationists. Model-based approaches offer planning authorities the possibility of delimiting priority areas for species detection or habitat protection. The performance of these models can be enhanced by fitting them with pseudo-absence data relying on large archives of natural history collection species presence data rather than using randomly sampled pseudo-absence data.

AB  - Approximately 20%-30% of plant and animal species are at risk of extinction by the end of the 21st century owing to climate change. Range shifts and range contractions in plant species will dramatically affect the distribution of animals relying on them for food and shelter. The negative impacts of climate change on forested landscapes of the northern highlands of Pakistan (NHP) could change the species composition and distribution. The Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), a forest-dwelling species, primarily depends on plants for foraging, and is assumed to be affected by climate change in NHP. Scat analyses and indigenous knowledge from Machiara National Park revealed the maximum consumption of Quercus species (natural food) and Zea mays (human grown food) by the Asiatic black bear in autumn season. We collected the occurrence data of the Asiatic black bear and its commonly used food (three Quercus spp.) in the NHP. We used the MaxEnt model to simulate current and future (in 2050 and 2070) distribution of the species under RCP4.5 (medium carbon emission scenario) and RCP8.5 (extreme carbon emission scenario). The results predict range reduction and extreme fragmentation in the habitats of all the Quercus spp. Besides, a dramatic decrease in the suitable (SH) and very highly suitable (HSH) habitats was predicted in the future. Range shift and range reduction of Quercus spp. may interrupt the denning chronology of Asiatic black bears, escalate the human-black bear conflicts and local extirpation of the species. Given the extent and magnitude of climate change, it will likely not be enough to focus solely on the conservation of the Asiatic black bear. We need more dynamic planning aiming at mitigating the effect of climate change in forested landscapes including the Quercus forests.

AB  - The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), is one of the world's most endangered species. Habitat loss and fragmentation have reduced its numbers, shrunk its distribution, and separated the population into isolated subpopulations. Such isolated, small populations are in danger of extinction due to random demographic factors and inbreeding. We used least-cost modeling as a systematic approach to incorporate satellite imagery and data on ecological and behavioral parameters of the giant panda collected during more than 10 years of field research to design a conservation landscape for giant pandas in the Minshan Mountains. We identified 8 core habitats and 4 potential linkages that would link core habitats CH3, CH4, and CH5 with core habitats CH6, CH7, and CH8. Establishing and integrating the identified habitats with existing reserves would create an efficient reserve network for giant panda conservation. The core habitats had an average density of 4.9 pandas/100 km(2) and contained approximately 76.6% of the giant panda population. About 45% of the core habitat (3245.4 km(2)) existed outside the current nature reserves network. Total estimated core habitat decreased between 30.4 and 44.5% with the addition of residential areas and road networks factored into the model. A conservation area for giant panda in the Minshan Mountains should aim to ensure habitat retention and connectivity, improve dispersal potential of corridors, and maintain the evolutionary potential of giant pandas in the face of future environmental changes.

AB  - Context. The identification of suitable habitats and the assessment of connectivity are important to preserve key areas for small isolated, endangered populations. The brown bear, Ursus arctos, needs connectivity to supply the primary habitat requirements including food, water, shelter and space and to provide gene flow among all populations in the Iranian Caucasus.
   Aims. In the present study, we investigated the status and habitat requirements of an endangered brown bear population within the Iranian Caucasus.
   Methods. We applied an approach of consensus species distribution modelling to estimate the distribution of suitable habitats for brown bears using uncorrelated environmental variables. We then used the concept of circuit theory on resultant breeding patches to evaluate regional patterns of connectivity among these patches.
   Key results. We predicted that similar to 9.10% of the study area is suitable for the brown bear at present. Ten patches (7.95% of the study area) were detected as suitable for breeding populations, where some populations are not able to survive without connectivity. The results indicated that habitat connectivity is sometimes widely affected by a high concentration of human activities such as roads, settlements and mining activities. Our findings showed that existing conservation areas could not safeguard the connectivity of brown bear habitats across the Iranian Caucasus.
   Conclusions. Our results can help target fine-scaled planning approaches for the maintenance of bear meta-population structure, as well as facilitate the movement of individuals by protecting different landscape features.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are routinely applied to assess current as well as future species distributions, for example to assess impacts of future environmental change on biodiversity or to underpin conservation planning. It has been repeatedly emphasized that SDMs should be evaluated based not only on their goodness of fit to the data, but also on the realism of the modeled ecological responses. However, possibilities for the latter are hampered by limited knowledge on the true responses as well as a lack of quantitative evaluation methods. Here we compared modeled niche optima obtained from European-scale SDMs of 1476 terrestrial vascular plant species with empirical ecological indicator values indicating the preferences of plant species for key environmental conditions. For each plant species we first fitted an ensemble SDM including three modeling techniques (GLM, GAM and BRT) and extracted niche optima for climate, soil, land use and nitrogen deposition variables with a large explanatory power for the occurrence of that species. We then compared these SDM-derived niche optima with the ecological indicator values by means of bivariate correlation analysis. We found weak to moderate correlations in the expected direction between the SDM-derived niche optima and ecological indicator values. The strongest correlation occurred between the modeled optima for growing degree days and the ecological indicator values for temperature. Correlations were weaker for SDM-derived niche optima with a more distal relationship to ecological indicator values (notably precipitation and soil moisture). Further, correlations were consistently highest for BRT, followed by GLM and GAM. Our method gives insight into the ecological realism of modeled niche optima and projected core habitats and can be used to improve SDMs by making a more informed selection of environmental variables and modeling techniques.

AB  - Introduction
   The future protection of marine biodiversity through good conservation planning requires both the identification of key habitats with unique ecological characteristics and detailed knowledge of their human utilization through fisheries. Demersal fisheries are important disturbers of benthic habitats. They often have a heterogeneous spatial distribution, pressurizing particular habitats with high abundances of target species. For the North Sea, we quantified the commonness/rarity of habitats in relation to the environmental determinants of so-called fishing hotspots, to support better-informed conservation planning of benthic habitats in this intensively used continental shelf.
   Methods
   We first distinguished 9 main seascapes in the study area based on seabed morphology. Secondly, we determined average fishing intensity and fishing hotspots using VMS-data for the three dominant Dutch fisheries from 2008 to 2015: beam-trawlers targeting sole Solea solea (Beam-Sole), beam-trawlers targeting plaice Pleuronectes platessa (Beam-Plaice), and otter-trawlers targeting Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus and demersal fish (Otter-Mix). Within the seascapes subjected to >80% of the fishing activity, nineteen environmental factors (summarized by PCA) were used to ecologically characterize fishing hotspot locations using MaxEnt response modelling.
   Results
   We found that all three fisheries target highly specific, uncommon habitats. Beam-Sole fishers targeted warmer, shallow, dynamic, nearshore habitats, and within these specifically the depressions between sand ridges. Beam-Plaice fishers mainly targeted the exposed, non-muddy flanks of the Dogger Bank and similar large-scale elevations (50-75 km) where especially the ridges of smaller sand banks are used. Otter-Mix fisheries concentrated in areas with low bed shear stress, located in muddy, relatively deeper areas.

AB  - We present a Geographic Information System (GIS) tool, SeaMaST (Seabird Mapping and Sensitivity Tool), to provide evidence on the use of sea areas by seabirds and inshore waterbirds in English territorial waters, mapping their relative sensitivity to offshore wind farms. SeaMaST is a freely available evidence source for use by all connected to the offshore wind industry and will assist statutory agencies in assessing potential risks to seabird populations from planned developments. Data were compiled from offshore boat and aerial observer surveys spanning the period 1979-2012. The data were analysed using distance analysis and Density Surface Modelling to produce predicted bird densities across a grid covering English territorial waters at a resolution of 3 kmx3 km. Coefficients of Variation were estimated for each grid cell density, as an indication of confidence in predictions. Offshore wind farm sensitivity scores were compiled for seabird species using English territorial waters. The comparative risks to each species of collision with turbines and displacement from operational turbines were reviewed and scored separately, and the scores were multiplied by the bird density estimates to produce relative sensitivity maps. The sensitivity maps reflected well the amassed distributions of the most sensitive species. SeaMaST is an important new tool for assessing potential impacts on seabird populations from offshore development at a time when multiple large areas of development are proposed which overlap with many seabird species' ranges. It will inform marine spatial planning as well as identifying priority areas of sea usage by marine birds. Example SeaMaST outputs are presented.

AB  - Understanding the amount of impact and distribution of invasive species is important for both basic ecological research and making management decisions. Because of their extensive impacts in southern Patagonia, invasive North American beavers (Castor canadensis) are considered both a scientific and conservation priority. However, little is known about the landscape-scale effects of these exotic ecosystem engineers. Using satellite imagery, we estimated the impact of beavers in the Argentine portion of Tierra del Fuego Island and determined the habitat factors (vegetation cover, forest type, stream presence and topography) related to their presence using both non-parametric statistical and information-theoretic approaches. Results indicated that more than 31,000 ha (1.6 % of the study area) were impacted by beavers and that the presence, but not the amount, of beaver impacts were spatially clustered. Impacts were greater in the Mountain ecoregion (2.8 % of the ecoregion) and lower in the Steppe (0.1 %). The best model for predicting beaver presence included variables related to water availability (presence of peatlands and streams), forage availability (forest type cover), and topography (slope and elevation). These findings support previous assertions that this invasion is the largest alteration to the sub-Antarctic forests in the Holocene. They also serve as a foundation for the development of maps based on habitat- and landscape-scale conditions to assist with the orientation of control, eradication, and restoration efforts currently being planned.

AB  - The expansion of land being used for cash crop cultivation has threatened wildlife in recent decades. Tea has become the dominant cash crop in southwestern China. Unfortunately, tea plantations may threaten Asian elephant (Elephus maximus) populations via habitat loss and fragmentation. Identifying areas of suitable habitat for tea plant cultivation, and where this habitat overlaps with Asian elephant distribution, is vital for planning land use, managing nature reserves, shaping policy, and maintaining local economies. Here, we assess the potential impact of tea plantations on Asian elephants in southwestern Yunnan province, China. We used MaxEnt modeling with bioclimatic and environmental variables to identify suitable habitat for tea plant cultivation under the current climate scenario, and then overlapped this habitat with 9 known Asian elephant distribution areas (G1-G9) to determine "threatened areas." Our results showed that (1) annual precipitation (48.1% contribution), temperature constancy (29 % contribution), and slope (8.7 % contribution) were key in determining suitable habitat for tea plants; (2) the cumulative area of suitable habitat for tea plants was 13,784.88 km(2), mainly distributed in Menghai (3934.53 km(2)), Lancang (3198.67 km(2)), and Jinghong (2657.74 km(2)); (3) the distribution area of elephants was 943.75 km(2), and these areas overlapped with suitable tea plant habitat primarily located in G4 (379.40 km(2)), G3 (251.18), and G7 (168.03 km(2)); and (4) threatened areas in G1 and G7 were predominately located along the periphery of current nature reserves. Win-win solutions that work for elephant conservation and economic development include rescoping nature reserve boundaries, strengthening management on the periphery of nature reserves, establishing ecological corridors and new nature reserves within regions where elephants are currently distributed, planting alternative cash crops, and financial subsidies to farmers. This study improves understanding of human-elephant coexistence, and will assist in guiding land use policy for the future conservation outcomes seeking to promote responsible and profitable cash crop farming and elephant conservation.

AB  - AimSpecies distribution models based on breeding occurrence data allow for identifying both environmental drivers and geographic areas potentially relevant for breeding. However, the interpretation of model predictions in terms of reproductive performance should be further investigated, as this information is crucial for conservation planning. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of a correlative modelling approach based on breeding occurrence data (presence-absence) against another approach based on vital rates' data (breeding success) for gaining insights on species persistence in the case of Great Bustards (Otis tarda).
   LocationSpain.
   MethodsBreeding occurrence and breeding success were independently modelled using generalized linear models and multimodel inference analyses. Sensitivities to the way in which the population parameter (breeding success) was defined were explored by building five versions of the dependent variable. We evaluated differences in model performance and identified areas of congruence for breeding occurrence and breeding success.
   ResultsThe agreement between the spatial predictions achieved by breeding occurrence and breeding success models differed substantially across databases, with the largest differences in occupied breeding areas. The deviance explained by the breeding occurrence model was 64.98% and ranged from 7.83% to 62.27% for the breeding success models. Model performance was higher for models calibrated within potential than within occupied breeding areas.
   Main conclusionsThe combination of data on both breeding occurrence and breeding success into a species distribution modelling framework showed the limitations of breeding occurrence models for inferring reproductive parameters. The definition of the population parameter as dependent variable was a key factor that strongly affected the inference of vital rates' models. The approach allowed for discriminating between areas and landscape attributes necessary for the long-term species persistence from others that may be relevant, but not so much for reproductive performance.

AB  - Predictive habitat mapping has shown great promise to improve the understanding of the spatial distribution and complexity of benthic habitats and is a valuable means to highlight species-environment relationships where field data are limited. Although spatial distribution models may represent an important step forward in science based ecosystem management, reliable predictions are hard to obtain in deep-sea environments, mainly owing to the usual paucity of high resolution maps in these settings. The aim of this study is to apply and test different spatial models to statistically predict the distribution of two Cold-Water Coral (CWC) species (Madrepora oculata, Dendrophyllia cornigera) in the Cap de Creus Canyon (NW Mediterranean), based on high-resolution swath-bathymetry (5 m resolution) and video observations through the manned submersible JAGO (IFM-GEOMAR). Several submarine canyons host CWC communities, as the environmental conditions tend to be particularly suitable for their settlement and development. Along the Cap de Creus Canyon, presence/absence of CWC was estimated in each 5 m resolution pixel based on video imagery. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), General Additive Model (GAM) and Random Forest were applied to represent non-linear species-environment relationships using terrain variables derived from multibeam bathymetry (slope, rugosity, aspect, backscatter). According to the models, CWC were most likely to be found on the steep walls of the southern flank which face the head and the thalweg of the canyon, aligning with the known CWC ecology acquired from previous studies. Outputs from the three models showed similar average performances in predicting CWC distribution from the available environmental variables. Slope and aspect for Madrepora oculata, and rugosity for Dendrophyllia cornigera drive their distribution, although in some cases the three models identified different variables controlling each species. To reduce differences and associated uncertainties between model outputs, 5 m resolution ensembles were produced for the two species. As a final step, an up-scaled 50 m resolution predictive map based on the fine scale ensembles is proposed as a valuable contribution for stakeholders, which need to manage large natural areas using objective and repeatable science-based approaches.

AB  - Mineral rich regions can pose particular land use planning challenges due to economic pressure to mine that can face strong opposition from those concerned about social and environmental impacts. While fundamentally opposing values cannot easily be resolved, progress has been made in developing GIS planning tools that provide a common ground for analysis of scenarios and options. However, the complexity of integrating models across disciplines such as hydrology and ecology poses a considerable challenge.
   This paper describes a GIS tool that highlights priority areas for biodiversity conservation and water provisioning services and then integrates both to characterize water provisioning ecosystem services (WPES). Biodiversity conservation priority areas were modelled with the spatial prioritization tool Zonation, and water provisioning services were assessed based on runoff, flow path length and the presence of vegetation. Zonation produces prioritisation in a balanced manner that maximises high quality habitats for all biodiversity features (e.g. species) in accordance to their rarity. The top priorities typically represent the full range of regional biodiversity within a relatively small area. These priorities were derived from spatial data describing the distribution of biodiversity features, including flora and fauna species and endangered ecological communities. Water provisioning services were calculated through modelling flow length with a digital elevation model in combination with runoff and spatial data on vegetation cover. Areas with longer flow length, in areas with higher runoff and vegetation cover, have higher values for water provisioning services. Spatial data for biodiversity and water provision services were then combined using a stream network to characterize the value of runoff generating areas in terms of their contribution to downstream riparian biodiversity.
   A case study of land use planning in the Greater Hunter region, a mining and agricultural area of New South Wales, Australia, is used to demonstrate our approach to quantifying WPES. The impacts of potential future locations of surface coal mining were assessed by examining the spatial overlap of a coal seam geological layer with WPES. Our analysis identified areas that have high WPES value that may be affected by mining in the future. The aim of this research is not to present an end-point for a planning process but to demonstrate the value of and ways forward for incorporating system interactions by combining outputs of modelling tools. We conclude by discussing future research and the challenge of considering jointly water impacts and biodiversity impacts, including the need to evaluate interactions among the various GIS layers.

AB  - Species-environment relationships are key information for the development of planning and management strategies for conservation or restoration of ecosystems. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are one widely applied type of species distribution model (SDM). Fuzzy neural networks (FNNs), that is, fuzzified ANNs, have been introduced to take into account the uncertainties inherent in fish behaviour and errors in input data. Despite their high predictive ability in modelling complex systems, FNNs cannot describe habitat preference curves (HPCs), although these are the basis for habitat quality assessment. The present study therefore aimed to evaluate the applicability of FNNs for modelling habitat preference and spatial distributions of Japanese medaka (Ozyzias Mapes). one of the most common freshwater fish in Japan. Three independent data sets were collected during a series of field surveys and used for model development and evaluation of FNNs. A weight decay backpropagation algorithm was additionally introduced, and its effects on the FNNs were evaluated on the basis of model performance and habitat preference information retrieved from the field observation data. Modified sensitivity analysis was applied to derive HPCs of the target fish. Application of weight decay backpropagation markedly reduced the variability of the model structures, improved the generalization ability of the FNNs, and resulted in well-converged and consistent HPCs that were similar to those evaluated by fuzzy habitat preference models. These results support the applicability of FNNs to habitat preference modelling, which can provide useful information on the habitat use by the target fish. Further study should focus on the effects of sources of uncertainty, such as zero abundance, on the SDMs and the resulting habitat preference evaluation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) has experienced significant decline and habitat degradation in recent decades. At present, nearly half of the total population inhabits Poyang Lake. The hydrological seasonality of the lake significantly influences porpoise habitat configuration, which brings problems for conservation in the delineation of reserve design and the management of human activities. A hydrodynamic model was used to distinguish the different hydrological conditions between the flood and dry seasons. The MaxEnt model was used to investigate the major environmental variables affecting porpoise distribution and delineate likely habitats of the porpoise under different hydrological conditions. The effectiveness of the present nature reserve was evaluated based on these results. Flow velocity and distance to fish spawning grounds were the primary variables influencing porpoise distribution during the dry season. Water depth, flow velocity and the distance to bank were the major variables during the flood season. The likely habitats were distributed discontinuously along the main channel during the dry season, with a total area of 112 km(2). During the flood season, the habitats extended into the central areas of the lake and tributaries with a total area of 628 km(2). At present, the nature reserve covers 4% and 18% of the likely core habitats during dry and flood seasons. An ideal nature reserve should be designed as an integrative network with reference to the seasonality of likely habitat distribution and major environmental variables. The habitats in conditions of extreme low water should be strictly protected in the dry season. Enhanced survey efforts, long-term hydrodynamic modelling and species distribution modelling can greatly assist in understanding habitat configuration and changing processes for other freshwater cetaceans inhabiting river-lake systems. Future planning to improve protection should consider habitat characteristics under the shifting hydrological conditions caused by climate change or artificial flow alteration.

AB  - Effective management and conservation of wild populations requires knowledge of their habitats, especially by mean of quantitative analyses of their spatial distributions. The Pelagos Sanctuary is a dedicated marine protected area for Mediterranean marine mammals covering an area of 90,000 km(2) in the north-western Mediterranean Sea between Italy, France and the Principate of Monaco. In the south of the Sanctuary, i.e. along the Sardinian coast, a range of diverse human activities (cities, industry, fishery, tourism) exerts several current ad potential threats to cetacean populations. In addition, marine mammals are recognized by the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive as essential components of sustainable ecosystems. Yet, knowledge on the spatial distribution and ecology of cetaceans in this area is quite scarce. Here we modeled occurrence of the three most abundant species known in the Sanctuary, i.e. the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), using sighting data from scientific surveys collected from 2012 to 2014 during summer time. Bayesian site-occupancy models were used to model their spatial distribution in relation to habitat taking into account oceanographic (sea surface temperature, primary production, photosynthetically active radiation, chlorophyll-a concentration) and topographic (depth, slope, distance of the land) variables. Cetaceans responded differently to the habitat features, with higher occurrence predicted in the more productive areas on submarine canyons. These results provide ecological information useful to enhance management plans and establish baseline for future population trend studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Ecological niche modelling (ENM) is used widely to aid in conservation planning and management, often focusing on rare species characterized by the biased observations associated with restricted geographic ranges, habitat specialization, small population size and limited natural history information. Generating reliable ENMs for such species is a challenge, however, owing to issues that arise from spatial sampling bias, such as model inaccuracy and overfitting. Here, using virtual scenarios, we assess the utility of integrating occurrence data for closely related species with varying degrees of niche overlap into ENMs of focal species.
   2. We consider two approaches to merge related and focal species models: integrating occurrences of focal and related species directly as inputs with which to generate ENMs, vs. creating ENMs based on occurrences of focal and related species separately and merging results based on Bayesian inference approaches.
   3. Both single, integrated models and Bayesian inference approaches performed better than models based on focal species only when niche overlap between the focal and related species was large, across ENM algorithms examined. While assessing sensitivity and specificity separately, the performances of the two integration approaches over different ENM algorithms were complicated.
   4. The results of the study offer a novel way forward in managing the challenge of creating useful, predictive models even for the rarest species, taking advantage of the reasonably general property of niche conservatism over small-to-moderate amounts of evolutionary time.

AB  - Public participatory mapping is a method of crowdsourcing where the lay public can contribute spatial information for a range of applications including conservation planning. When used to collect wildlife observation data, participatory mapping becomes a type of "geographic citizen science" that involves collaboration with members of the public. While the potential of crowdsourcing to assist in wildlife conservation appears to be large, the quality and validity of the observational data collected remain a key concern. In this study, we examined the quality and validity of spatial data collected in a public participatory mapping project implemented in northern New South Wales (Australia) in 2018 where the public was asked to identify and map the location and frequency of koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) sightings using an internet mapping application. The iconic koala is a nationally-listed threatened species and has wide public recognition, making it an ideal test of our approach to examining the value of citizen science for wildlife. We assessed the validity of koala observation data from two perspectives of validity-as-accuracy (positional accuracy and data completeness) and validity-as-credibility (characteristics of spatial data contributors). To assess validity-as-accuracy, we analysed the distribution of citizen observations of koala sightings compared to an expert-derived probability distribution of koalas (likelihood model). To assess validity-as-credibility, we analysed the survey data to determine which participant characteristics increased the credibility of observational data. We found significant spatial association between crowdsourced koala observations and the likelihood model to validate koala locations, but there was under-reporting in more rural, remote areas. Significant variables contributing to accuracy in koala observations included participant knowledge of koalas, age, length of residence, and formal education. We also compared the crowdsourced results to a field-based citizen science koala observation project implemented in the same region and found crowdsourced participatory mapping provided comparable, if not superior results. Crowdsourced koala observations can augment field-based koala research by covering large geographic areas while engaging a broader public in conservation efforts. However, effective geographic citizen science projects require a significant commitment of resources, including the creation of community partnerships, to obtain high quality spatial data.

AB  - This study aims to determine the effects of extreme heavy metal contamination and other soil factors on the structure and species richness of pioneer communities on artificial slag-soil substrates. Lichens, bryophytes, and vascular plants were examined in study plots and chemical properties of corresponding substrate samples were analyzed. Species responses to soil factors were identified by detrended correspondence analysis with interpretation of ordination axes and identification of significant soil parameters using linear mixed-effects models. The interrelationships between species richness and soil factors were evaluated by generalized linear mixed-effects model with Poisson error distribution. Three different responses to substrate contamination were recognized: species most tolerant and favored by strong contamination, less resistant species appearing only on less contaminated dumps and cryptogams indifferent to heavy metal contamination and abundant on all dumps. The species richness of lichens and vascular plants respond differently in relation to heavy metal contamination. Our results indicate that certain cryptogamic species are indifferent to enormous contamination and well adapted to slag substrate. In contrast, highly elevated levels of heavy metals negatively affect vascular plant species richness. Assemblages of pioneer cryptogams are an important element in the natural regeneration of post-smelting wastes and should be taken into account when reclamation activities are planned.

AB  - Context With the expansion in urbanization, understanding how biodiversity responds to the altered landscape becomes a major concern. Most studies focus on habitat effects on biodiversity, yet much less attention has been paid to surrounding landscape matrices and their joint effects. Objective We investigated how habitat and landscape matrices affect waterbird diversity across scales in the Yangtze River Floodplain, a typical area with high biodiversity and severe human-wildlife conflict. Methods The compositional and structural features of the landscape were calculated at fine and coarse scales. The ordinary least squares regression model was adopted, following a test showing no significant spatial autocorrelation in the spatial lag and spatial error models, to estimate the relationship between landscape metrics and waterbird diversity. Results Well-connected grassland and shrub surrounded by isolated and regular-shaped developed area maintained higher waterbird diversity at fine scales. Regular-shaped developed area and cropland, irregular-shaped forest, and aggregated distribution of wetland and shrub positively affected waterbird diversity at coarse scales. Conclusions Habitat and landscape matrices jointly affected waterbird diversity. Regular-shaped developed area facilitated higher waterbird diversity and showed the most pronounced effect at coarse scales. The conservation efforts should not only focus on habitat quality and capacity, but also habitat connectivity and complexity when formulating development plans. We suggest planners minimize the expansion of the developed area into critical habitats and leave buffers to maintain habitat connectivity and shape complexity to reduce the disturbance to birds. Our findings provide important insights and practical measures to protect biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Onshore wind farm development may impact vulnerable large eagles at both individual and population levels and requires appropriate assessment under the EU Bird and Habitat Directives. The present conservation policy (e.g. fixed safety zones around nest sites) improves species conservation but may not prevent habitat loss or reduce collision risk in the best possible way because this policy may not consider habitat-specific effects on eagle behaviour. Here, we develop a method for estimating habitat use and flying time distribution within Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) home ranges. Location data retrieved with GPS-transmitters (Global Positioning system) in Finland indicated that these large raptors used vast areas (mean 297 km(2), 95% Minimum Convex Polygon), reaching up to 14 km, but not uniformly around their nests. The best resource selection function models (cross-validation performance 83%) revealed that flying Golden Eagles preferred the vicinity of their nests, steep slopes, and old forests in their home range. They avoided human settlements and neighboring territories. GPS data indicated short flying times per day (mean 2.2 h) and about 30% of the flying time within collision risk heights (50-200 m). Together with information on habitat selection, flying times can be used for predicting airspace use of birds and in assessing the collision risk at particular wind farm locations. Thus, our method can be applied in planning wind farm locations that enable a safer co-existence of large territorial birds and wind power plants in the same landscape.

AB  - We used general linear modelling to assess the influence of environmental variables on the spatial distribution patterns of the bullhead (Cottus gobio) at stream system, site, and microhabitat scales in southwestern France. Bullheads occurred at 67 sites (out of 554 sampling sites), chiefly close to the source, in small and shallow streams. Population density at a site was primarily influenced by thermal conditions. Stream width was negatively related to the probability of presence of bullheads within the stream system, but positively related to local density, showing that bullhead density could increase within a range of stream width, but that wider rivers were unsuitable. Slope was negatively correlated to bullhead's occurrence and local density, and depth was negatively correlated to local density and microhabitat use, suggesting that bullhead's shimming performance was weak under greater erosive forces. Therefore, the most significant results suggested that the distribution of populations and individuals was first governed by the suitability of physical and hydraulic habitat, then population dynamics at a site was mainly governed by the thermal regime. Multi-scale studies of factors influencing a species' distribution thus allow to integrate patterns observed at different scales, and enhance our understanding of interactions between animals and their environment. Such models are essential in the exploratory phase of fundamental and applied investigations, because they help to target further research, and they should influence the measures to be taken in field surveys or conservation plans.

AB  - Conservation of terrestrial salamanders requires consideration for landscape-level features and processes; and, therefore, tools are needed to support planning at large spatial scales. We assessed terrestrial salamander distribution patterns using an existing salamander data set and two previously developed landscape-level spatial tools, a landscape classification (LC) model and flow accumulation (FLOW) model, both based on 100-m(2) pixels. The LC model assigned each pixel to one of eight categories defined by slope, aspect and landform. The FLOW model assigned each pixel to one of five categories based on the number of 100-m(2) cells that drained into a given cell. Salamander data had been collected in the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia during 2001-2003 on 543 100-m(2) plots located along random transects. Using area-constrained searches we collected 1879 individuals of eleven species. Plethodon cinereus, Desmognathus ochrophaeus, D. monticola and D. fuscus represented 92.8% of all captures. All plots were georeferenced and associated with one of the LC and FLOW categories. Because of non-normally distributed data, we used a Friedman rank sum test to compare treatment means. Total captures (P < 0.001), total mass (P = 0.001) and species richness (P = 0.001) differed among LC categories and total captures (P = 0.010), and species richness (P = 0.007) differed among FLOW categories. Species diversity did not differ among LC or FLOW categories (P > 0.27 and 0.26, respectively). Body Mass Index (BMI; mass/snout-vent length) was calculated for the four most abundant species and differed (P < 0.05) among LC or FLOW categories for P. cinereus, D. ochrophaeus and D. fuscus for at least one sex-age class. In several cases, BMI was higher at sites with low total captures and mass. These results suggest that commonly available and easily derived tools such as LC and FLOW models may be valuable as landscape planning tools and warrant further exploration.

AB  - Landscape models are essential tools that link landscape patterns to ecological processes. Barrier island vegetation communities are strongly correlated with geomorphology, which makes elevation-based metrics suitable for developing a predictive habitat classification model in these systems. In this study, multinomial logistic regression is used to predict herbaceous, sparse, and woody habitat distributions on the North End of Assateague Island from slope, distance to shore, and elevation change, all of which are derived from digital elevation models (DEMs). Sparse habitats, which were generally found closest to shore in areas that are exposed to harsh conditions, had the highest predictive accuracy. Herbaceous and woody habitats occupied more protected inland settings and had lower predictive accuracies. A majority of woody cells were misclassified as herbaceous likely because of the similarity in the predictive parameter distributions. This relatively simple model is transparent and does not rely on subjective interpretations. This makes it an effective tool that can directly aid practitioners making coastal management decisions surrounding storm response planning and conservation management. The model results were used in a nutrient sequestration application to quantify carbon and nitrogen stored in barrier island vegetation. This represents an example of how the model results can be used to assign economic value of ecosystem services in a coastal system to justify different management and conservation initiatives.

AB  - An similar to 80% decline in the eastern population of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) has prompted conservation efforts to increase summer reproductive success in the Midwest United States. Implementation of conservation practices will create a patchwork of milkweed (mainly Asclepius spp.) habitat within agricultural landscapes dominated by corn and soybean production. Since the monarch butterfly is a vagile species, reproductive success is, in part, a function of both the amount and spatial arrangement of habitat patches in a fragmented landscape. To inform conservation planning we developed a spatially-explicit, agent-based model for summer breeding, non-migratory female monarch butterfly movement and egg-laying on an Iowa, USA landscape. Our model employs a unique movement algorithm when monarch agents encounter habitat edges that incorporates monarch perceptual range to their host plant and spatial memory of previously visited habitat. These behavioral factors are rarely incorporated into animal movement algorithms; however, they can influence estimates of resource utilization. Model exploration assessed the distribution and density of eggs laid on a spatially-explicit 148,665 ha landscape comprised of 17 land cover classes with varying milkweed densities. Uncertainty analysis was undertaken by sampling 25 combinations of perceptual range, spatial memory, flight step length and flight directionality parameters from a total of 256 (4(4)) possible combinations. Movement paths simulated with our new movement algorithm show preferential use of high density milkweed areas that would not be simulated using a correlated random walk. Increasing perceptual range caused a decrease in the area used by monarch agents and caused a skewed egg distribution where most eggs were laid in relatively few habitat patches. Increasing spatial memory caused an increase in the area used but decreased the median number of eggs laid in roadside habitat. Current national and regional monarch conservation goals assume a uniform distribution of milkweed in different land cover classes. Translating these goals into spatially-explicit, heterogeneous habitat patches is essential for predicting realized fecundity in the landscape. Our model provides the foundation to link national and regional monarch conservation goals to fine scale spatial configurations of habitat patches in defined landscapes.

AB  - Understanding biodiversity pressures associated with recreation and tourism is a major challenge for conservation planning and landscape management. While estimates of landscape use are often collected using mechanisms such as park entry fees and traffic density estimates, these data do not provide substantial detail about the spatial location or intensity of recreation and tourism across biodiversity management areas. To better predict patterns of recreation and tourism likelihood to support conservation planning, we used social network data from Facebook(()(TM)()), Flickr(()(TM)()), Google(()(TM)()), Strava(()(TM)()), and Wikilocs(()(TM)()) along with a suite of remote-sensing-derived environmental covariates in a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) presence-only modelling framework. Social network samples were compiled and processed to reduce sampling bias and spatial autocorrelation. Road access, climate data, and remote sensing covariates describing vegetation greenness, disturbance, topography, and moisture were used as predictor variables in the MaxEnt modelling framework. Our focus site was a grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) management area in west-central Alberta, Canada. Individual models were developed for each social network dataset, as well as a combined model including all the samples. Mean cross-validated AUC, partial ROC, and true skill statistics (TSS) were used to evaluate model accuracy. Results indicated that the covariates proposed were able to best model Strava and Wikilocs activity (TSS = 0.69 and 0.50, respectively), while samples from Flickr or the combination of all social networks were least accurate (TSS = 0.32). The "access" covariate was most important for MaxEnt training gain across a number of social network models, highlighting the importance of access for recreation and tourism likelihood. The summer heat moisture index and normalized burn ratio were also useful spatial covariates in many predictions. Recreation and tourism likelihood maps were combined with grizzly bear telemetry data to examine how recreation and tourism may affect grizzly bear behaviour. All social network models found a similar influence on grizzly bear behaviour, with increasing recreation and tourism use resulting in decreased foraging behaviour and increased rapid movement, suggesting that the models developed here are useful tools for predicting grizzly bear behaviour and planning conservation strategies for the species.

AB  - This is the first study based on a planned and intensive sampling effort that describes the community composition and structure of the ground-dwelling arthropod assemblage of Peninsula Valdes (Patagonia). It was carried out using pitfall traps, opened for two weeks during the summers of 2005, 2006 and 2007. A total of 28,111 individuals were caught. Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) dominated this community, followed by beetles (Coleoptera) and spiders (Araneae). The most abundant species were Pheidole bergi Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and Blapstinus punctulatus Solier (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Two new species were very recently described as new based on specimens collected during this study: Valdesiana curiosa Carpintero, Dellape & Cheli (Hemiptera, Miridae) and Anomaloptera patagonica Dellape & Cheli (Hemiptera, Oxycarenidae). The order Coleoptera was the most diverse taxa. The distribution of abundance data was best described by the logarithmic series model both at the family and species levels, suggesting that ecological relationships in this community could be controlled by a few factors. The community was dominated by predators from a trophic perspective. This suggests that predation acts as an important factor driving the distribution and abundances of surface-dwelling arthropods in this habitat and as such serves as a key element in understanding desert, above-ground community structure. These findings may also be useful for management and conservation purposes in arid Patagonia.

AB  - The probability that a propagule reaches, establishes and persists in a certain site is affected by the distance and quality of the environment. Fragmented landscapes promote the isolation of forests surrounded by a matrix that hinders or impedes the movement of species, affecting their distribution and threatening their conservation. Studies of landscape connectivity are essential to provide information for ecological conservation planning. Based on the classification of the landcover of the Rio Doce Basin - RDB and on the circuit theory, we used a habitat / non-habitat approach to assess the connectivity of the RDB to tree species. We built six resistance surface models based on habitat and non-habitat areas, using the GIS plug-in and Linkage Mapper to generate least cost paths maps. Three models explained the Jaccard similarity index matrix of 78 fragments used as a proxy of connectivity to test the models by GLMs, and one out the three was the simplest and most parsimonious. The map generated by the chosen model showed that the RDB is very fragmented but still has well-connected regions. The west to northwestern and southeastern portions of the RDB are well-connected and demand conservation of remaining fragments as well as the creation of reserves, while the center-north, east, and the far southwest of the basin are regions with greater resistance to connectivity as a result of anthropic pressures that reduced and fragmented the forests, requiring intervention through restoration projects to re-establish landscape connectivity.

AB  - This study presents an empirical example of how ES can be incorporated into MSP in developing countries, in particular in the Southern region of Los Lagos (Chile). This paper aims to: (a) assess the overlapping incompatibilities within each zoning area, (b) calculate the importance score of the three key ES selected, (c) assess the importance scores of the ES and develop plausible future scenarios for marine zoning. Here, we use InVEST marine models to spatially map the distribution of marine ES (ecotourism and recreation, wildlife endangered species, and habitat-forming species). Taking the current proposal of the MSP as a baseline scenario, two plausible hypothetical future scenarios were also developed based on policies and decision-making trends, and the results of the ES importance score values within each zoning area. The results of this paper indicate that the environmental conservation-aboriginal development scenario would be considered as the more appropriate future projection in terms of securing the three key ES analysed in the region. However, due to changes in the economic development paradigm for the Inner Sea of Chiloe, decision makers, the scientific community and industry representatives are facing a major challenge in allocating appropriate areas to secure ES which requires a holistic perspective.

AB  - The distribution of living organisms, habitats and ecosystems is primarily driven by abiotic environmental factors that are spatially structured. Assessing the spatial structure of environmental factors, e.g., through spatial autocorrelation analyses (SAC), can thus help us understand their scale of influence on the distribution of organisms, habitats, and ecosystems. Yet SAC analyses of environmental factors are still rarely performed in biogeographic studies. Here, we describe a novel framework that combines SAC and statistical clustering to identify scales of spatial patterning of environmental factors, which can then be interpreted as the scales at which those factors influence the geographic distribution of biological and ecological features. We illustrate this new framework with datasets at different spatial or thematic resolutions. This framework is conceptually and statistically robust, providing a valuable approach to tackle a wide range of issues in ecological and environmental research and particularly when building predictors for ecological models. The new framework can significantly promote fundamental research on all spatially-structured ecological patterns. It can also foster research and application in such fields as global change ecology, conservation planning, and landscape management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantifying how animals use key habitats and resources for their survival allows managers to optimise conservation planning; however, obtaining representative sample sizes of wildlife distributions in both time and space is challenging, particularly in the marine environment. Here, we used unoccupied aircraft systems (UASs) to evaluate temporal and spatial variation in the distribution of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) at two high-density breeding aggregations in the Mediterranean, and the effect of varying sample size and survey frequency. In May-June of 2017 to 2019, we conducted 69 surveys, assimilating 10,075 inwater turtle records at the two sites. Optimal time interval between surveys to capture the dynamics of aggregations over the breeding period was 500 turtles (from the combined surveys). This minimum threshold was attributed to the core-area use of female turtles shifting across surveys in relation to wind direction to access warmer nearshore waters and male presence. Males were more widely distributed within aggregations than females, particularly in May when mating encounters were high. Most males were recorded swimming and oriented parallel to shore, likely to enhance encounter rates with females. In contrast, most females were generally stationary (resting on the seabed or basking), likely to conserve energy for reproduction, with orientation appearing to shift in relation to male numbers at the breeding area. Thus, by identifying the main factors regulating the movement and distribution of animals, appropriate survey intervals can be selected for appropriate home range analyses. Our study demonstrates the versatility of UASs to capture the fine-scale dynamics of wildlife aggregations and associated factors, which is important for implementing effective conservation.

AB  - Backward-in-time Lagrangian model can identify potential spawning areas by reconstructing egg drift trajectories, contributing to accurately designing potential priority conservation plans for spawning areas. In this study, we apply this approach to investigate the small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) with commercial value in China. A two-step spatial random forest (RF) model is used to predict the occurrence probability and abundance of their eggs and describe the optimal ecological range of environmental factors. A priority protection index (BPPI) of the spawning areas is established by combining the sites with the optimal occurrence and abundance and integrating backward tracking pathways. The result indicates that the model with 1-2 day time lags of environmental variables shows the optimum explanatory power. Temperature and salinity are the most important factors affecting oogenesis and show a regime shift in the response curve. They reflect the physiological regulation of parental sexual maturation by the environment. In addition, egg abundance correlates more strongly with chlorophyll-a (Chl a) concentration and depth, suggesting that parents prefer environments with shallow water and high prey density for spawning activities. The egg retrieval shows that the potential spawning sources are distributed near the southeastern part of the oogenesis site, with a maximum egg dispersal distance of no more than 30 km. This finding confirms that the coastal regions of Jiangsu Province are an important spawning ground for the small yellow croaker, making a significant contribution to the productivity and resilience of the fish.

AB  - The Japanese National Biodiversity Strategy 2010 calls for the creation of ecological networks as a biodiversity conservation policy. However, there is an obvious lack of information on the spatial distribution of many species and a lack of scientific methods for examining habitat requirements to establish the need for constructing these networks for target species. This study presents a quantitative method for assessing the need for ecological networks through modeling the potential geographic distributions of species based on a case study of local populations of Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus japonicus) in Fuji and Tanzawa, Japan. A total of 1541 point records of occurrences of Asiatic black bears and 11 potential predictors were analyzed in a GIS environment. After a predictive distributional map was obtained using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, a gap analysis was carried out and population size was estimated. Approximately 24% of the bear's predicted habitat area fell within a wildlife protection area, 2% within a nature reserve, and 37% within natural parks. Conservation forest comprised 54% of the total area of predicted habitat; of this, national forest comprised 2%, and private and communal forest comprised 37%. The total estimated Asiatic black bear population in this region was 242, with 179 individuals in the Fuji local population, 26 in the Tanzawa local population, and 37 in the corridor patch between the two local populations. Our study also found a potential corridor connecting the Fuji and Tanzawa local populations, as well as potential habitat corridors in the Fuji region containing subpopulations on Mt. Fuji (119 individuals) and Mt. Kenashi (53 individuals). An additional subpopulation on Mt. Ashitaka (7 individuals) is isolated and not fully protected by a zoning plan. Mt. Furo's subpopulation is considered to be almost extinct, although black bears were observed here until 2002 based on the report by Mochizuki et al. (2005). The total black bear population of the Fuji-Tanzawa region is considered to be "endangered"; thus, an adequate population size might be difficult to maintain even if this region were to be internally connected by means of an ecological network.

AB  - In the megadiverse conservation hotspot of the Philippines, biodiversity is not uniformly distributed throughout the archipelago, but hierarchically partitioned into islands and island groups that were conjoined during the mid- to late-Pleistocene. Few species groups are widely distributed throughout the archipelago, but some exceptions exist, such as the common scincid lizards of the Sphenomorphus jagori complex (including S. jagori, S. coxi, and S. abdictus). Using mtDNA haplotype data we test biogeographic and taxonomic predictions in these abundant, large-bodied, forest floor lizards and arrive at conclusions that differ significantly from both past, and current, appraisals of species diversity. In contrast to expectations based on existing taxonomy (three species, each with two subspecies), we find evidence of at least eleven highly divergent species lineages diagnosed by haplotypic variation. Each lineage corresponds to a biogeographically circumscribed distribution (i.e., isolated islands or geological components of islands), suggesting lineage cohesion and allopatric differentiation. Parametric bootstrapping tests reject taxonomic and biogeographic hypotheses and suggest a complex pattern of unpredicted relationships. Only one of the former species (S. jagori) appears as a monophyletic entity (including four allopatric, highly divergent lineages that we suspect may represent evolutionary species), and the remaining species are paraphyletic, necessitating a comprehensive future taxonomic revision. The pattern of biogeographic provincialism and hidden cryptic species diversity detected here leads us to suspect that even the most common, presumably well-studied, and widespread species complexes in the Philippines are in need of thorough analysis with modern genetic and phylogenetic techniques. Such studies of speciation genetics in these common, widely distributed groups may lead to a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of biodiversity, allow for an enhanced appreciation of the evolutionary history of this model island archipelago, and enable more informed conservation planning in a global biodiversity hotspot.

AB  - The global Aquatic Warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola, Vieillot, 1817) population has suffered a major decline due to the large-scale destruction of its natural habitat (fen mires). The species is at risk of extinction, especially in NE Germany/NW Poland. In this study, we developed habitat suitability models based on satellite and environmental data to identify potential areas for habitat restoration on which further surveys and planning should be focused. To create a reliable model, we used all Aquatic Warbler presences in the study area since 1990 as well as additional potentially suitable habitats identified in the field. We combined the presence/absence regression tree algorithm Cubist with the presence-only algorithm Maxent since both commonly outperform other algorithms. To integrate the separate model results, we present a new way to create a metamodel using the initial model results as variables. Additionally, a histogram approach was applied to further reduce the final search area to the most promising sites. Accuracy increased when using both remote sensing and environmental data. It was highest for the integrated metamodel (Cohen's Kappa of 0.4, P < 0.001). The final result of this study supports the selection of the most promising sites for Aquatic Warbler habitat restoration.

AB  - High-resolution distribution maps can help inform conservation measures for protected species; including where any impacts of proposed commercial developments overlap the range of focal species. Around Orkney, northern Scotland, UK, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) population has decreased by 78% over 20 years. Concern for the declining harbour seal population has led to constraints being placed on tidal energy generation developments. For this study area, telemetry data from 54 animals tagged between 2003 and 2015 were used to produce density estimation maps. Predictive habitat models using GAM-GEEs provided robust predictions in areas where telemetry data were absent, and were combined with density estimation maps, and then scaled to population levels using August terrestrial counts between 2008 and 2015, to produce harbour seal usage maps with confidence intervals around Orkney and the North coast of Scotland. The selected habitat model showed that distance from haul out, proportion of sand in seabed sediment, and annual mean power were important predictors of space use. Fine-scale usage maps can be used in consenting and licensing of anthropogenic developments to determine local abundance. When quantifying commercial impacts through changes to species distributions, usage maps can be spatially explicitly linked to individual-based models to inform predicted movement and behaviour.

AB  - Question: Evergreen bushlands in Ethiopia have been inadequately studied and mapped. We address the question whether there is a transitional semi-evergreen bushland on the eastern escarpment of the Ethiopian Highlands, with unique floristic characteristics that distinguish it from the evergreen bushlands in other parts of Ethiopia and eastern Africa.
   Methods: Based on a review of the recent descriptions of evergreen bushlands in Ethiopia, we hypothesize that there is a distinct zone of natural semi-evergreen bushland, which is restricted to the eastern and southeastern escarpment of the Ethiopian Highlands. In contrast, evergreen bushlands in other parts of Ethiopia are considered to be of a secondary nature. To test this hypothesis, we carried out qualitative vegetation surveys in 354 locations across Ethiopia and classified the vegetation in these locations based on the occurrences of indicator species. Based on this data, we created predictive distribution models of the semi-evergreen bushland in Ethiopia using various environmental distribution models. We furthermore compared the occurrences of characteristic evergreen bushland species in Ethiopia with the occurrence of these species within the evergreen bushlands in Kenya and Uganda.
   Results: The vegetation surveys confirmed the existence of a distinct type of evergreen bushland vegetation. The transitional semi-evergreen bushland forms a transitional zone between the Acacia-Commiphora woodland and bushland and the Afromontane forest on the eastern and southeastern escarpments of Ethiopia, but is also characterized by a number of species that, within Ethiopia, are unique to this zone. Most of the characteristic species of the transitional semi-evergreen bushland are not found or only in lower densities in western Ethiopia. There is, furthermore, a limited overlap in characteristic species of the evergreen bushlands of Kenya and Uganda.
   Conclusions: Our results provide important information on the hitherto inadequately studied semi-evergreen bushland of Ethiopia. It highlights the unique character of this part of the evergreen bushlands in Ethiopia, which we argue should be taken into account for future conservation planning.

AB  - Subspecies amphochlora of the Lewin's Honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii) is confined to a small isolated population in the McIlwraith Range, Cape York Peninsula, north-eastern Australia. The population is poorly known but is thought to be restricted to elevations above 500 m. We aimed to establish reliable estimates of population size and geographical range to enable a better evaluation of the conservation status of the subspecies. We also sought to quantify elevational patterns of density within the range and test the hypothesis that climate is the dominant factor governing range limits. We estimate the area of occupancy to be 183 km(2), pending the investigation of three small fragments of predicted suitable habitat in mountain ranges to the north of the McIlwraith Range. Our count data indicate that the population probably consists of fewer than 5000 individuals (best estimate = 4666 individuals, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 2868-7591). Highest densities were observed in a geographically limited subset of the range above 650 m. Independent validation of our species-climate distribution model suggests that the restricted spatial distribution of the subspecies is attributable to climate associations and implies that warm temperatures in particular act to restrict the lower elevational limit of the subspecies. We discuss the implications of these findings for the future survival of M. l. amphochlora in the context of contemporary climate warming.

AB  - Climate change is causing rapid shifts in species' range limits, leading to poleward expansions and range losses toward the equator. However, 'climate debt', the gap between required and realized range shifts under changing climates, can accumulate when species are unable to track shifting conditions sufficiently rapidly to keep pace with climate changes. Currently, we do not know the rate at which species will keep pace via dispersal to track their climate envelopes, yet understanding potential differences in climate debt is central to estimating how climate change will influence extinction risk. Here, we use historical observations of 155 butterfly species found in Canada to construct climate-based environmental niche models for each species and then compare projections with observed modern distributions to quantify climate debts. This approach suggests that high levels of climate debt are accumulating within the vast majority of these species. Such failure to track changing climates may arise from some combination of interspecific interactions such as particular food availability for specialists, abiotic barriers such as mountain ranges, or species' intrinsic dispersal capacities. Our linear models relating climate debt to a variety of biological predictors suggest that the debts we documented are accumulating independently of dispersal ability, diet breadth, and phylogeny. A proxy for range size is the only significant predictor of climate debt, with species with narrower ranges accumulating more debt: this suggests that species with narrow ranges may be at risk from both a reduction of suitable habitat in their current range and the failure to colonize newly available habitat. Identifying the factors, whether intrinsic or imposed by local environmental conditions, that limit species' capacities to colonize areas beyond their historical limits is vital to conservation planning.

AB  - Migratory nectarivorous bats provide important ecological services throughout their ranges, particularly for their food plants. These services include pollinating food plants, dispersing seeds, and reducing genetic isolation in plant populations. However, many important food plants occur in imperiled ecosystems, particularly in tropical dry forests. We assessed the conservation status of lands containing high richness of food plants for three migratory nectarivores-the Mexican long-tongued bat (Choeronycteris mexicana), the Mexican long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris nivalis), and the lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae)-throughout their ranges including migratory, transition, and resident habitat zones. We found low to moderate levels of land protection in regions with high chiropterophilic plant diversity, but this may be offset by sustainable agroforestry, cultivation, and in-situ management. The models we used are available as an ArcGIS map package to help allocate conservation and restoration efforts on the ground. Our results support the need for greater land protection throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental to increase contiguity of protected lands and potential stopover habitat for migratory nectarivorous bats. Additionally, our data show the need for greater land protection in southern resident zones to enhance year-round habitat for nectarivorous bats in the face of rapid deforestation.

AB  - Conserving populations of environmentally vulnerable insect species requires a greater understanding of the factors that determine their abundance and distribution, which requires detailed knowledge of their population and community ecology. Chemical ecological tools such as pheromones can be used for non-destructive monitoring of scarab beetle populations, enabling European countries to detect and, in some cases, map the range of some of these species, proving a valuable technique for monitoring elusive saproxylic beetles. In this paper, we investigated the behavioural and chemical ecology of the noble chafer, Gnorimus nobilis L., a model insect species of conservation concern across a Europe-wide distribution, and a red-listed UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species. We identified a potential pheromone of adult beetles using electrophysiological recordings, behavioural measurements and field trials in the UK. Gnorimus nobilis is highly unusual in that although both sexes produce, at high metabolic cost, the natural product 2-propyl (E)-3-hexenoate, it only attracts males. This pattern of chemical signalling makes the classification of the compound, based on current semiochemical terminology, somewhat problematic, but in our view, it should be termed an aggregation pheromone as a consequence of the production pattern. Since both sexes emit it, but apparently only males respond positively to it, 2-propyl (E)-3-hexenoate may reflect an intermediate evolutionary stage towards developing into a sex-specific signal. From an applied perspective, our study provides a model for the non-invasive surveillance of cryptic vulnerable insect species, without the need for habitat searching or disturbance, and continuous human monitoring.

AB  - The concept of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV) and its mapping have become extremely important within the scope of habitat restoration in almost every European country. The aim of this study is to predict the PNV in the sites of Natura 2000 Network 'Sado Estuary' and 'Comporta-Gale' based on the vegetation series and the main environmental variables. The modelling approach is based on the distribution of communities referred to as classification then modelling.
   Subsequently, several statistical model-fitting techniques, such as regression models, machine learning and rule-based, were successfully applied to the survey data (9 vegetation series; and 7 environmental/predictor variables). The spatial database was organized as a Geographic Information System (GIS) and was also used to perform the Species Distribution Models (SDM) at community level. The results show a high correspondence between the vegetation series and the environmental gradients. The predicted PNV maps based on the Maximum Entropy Model were validated with the official map of the PNV of the sites of Natura 2000 Network 'Sado Estuary' and 'Comporta-Gale', and presented an overall accuracy of 86%. Often, conservation planning and biodiversity resource management is carried out at more detailed scales, where SDM allows integration of community direct observations and improve our interpretation of PNV local distributions along environmental gradients VNP in beach and coastal sand dunes environments.

AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of marine species and the temporal and spatial scales of the processes that drive those distributions continues to be limited, but is increasingly more critical with the implementation of marine spatial planning. Lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) are a common demersal fish on the west coast of North America and are exploited both commercially and recreationally across the entirety of their range. Due to stock declines, Lingcod are managed using a variety of fisheries management tools, including spatial management. This study represents a unique in situ investigation of demersal habitat utilization by Lingcod at the southern portion of their range (Point Arena to Morro Bay, California). ROV and towed camera sled derived underwater video imagery were coupled with high-resolution bathymetry data and evaluated using Generalized Linear Models to investigate: a) how Lingcod are distributed relative to seafloor habitats along California's central coast, b) the extent to which any ontogenetic patterns varied across habitats, and c) how associations based on visual observations compare to those from landscape modeling analysis. The results of this study clearly depicted an ontogenetic shift in Lingcod habitat utilization. Lingcod shifted from primarily low relief, soft sediments as young to mixed substrates at intermediate ages and ultimately to primarily harder substrates as adults. These results are important in the context of on-going marine spatial planning wherein further information on the habitat associations of targeted species can allow for more refined management.

AB  - One of the initial measures to planning the conservation strategies is knowing the ecological needs of a species and its favorite habitat. Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) is an applicable tool to achieve this goal. Zarudny's spur-thighed tortoise or Iranian tortoise (Testudo graeca zarudnyi) is one of three subspecies of spur-thighed tortoises found in Iran. To assess the conflicts threatening the habitat of this subspecies, the Maximum Entropy Algorithm (MaxEnt) was used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the integrity of the T. g. zarudnyi habitat and discuss the conflicts threatening the suitable habitat of this taxon in Iran. First, 25 ecological variables were considered to evaluate the habitat suitability, including topographic, land use land cover, and climatic layers (19 Bios). Among climatic variables, only five of them were selected using Pearson correlation analysis at the level of 75%. Finally, 11 variables contributed to running the model. The cell size were set based on Bios cell sizes to prevent biases, only one presence point kept at each cell; therefore, 108 presence points were remained out of 137 occurrence data. The obtained model had a high degree of predictability (AUC= 0.911). Results showed that Zarudny's tortoise favorites good to moderate vegetation structure. Hence, areas with higher vegetation cover and an annual average temperature of 20 degrees C are optimal, which emphasizes the importance of landuse changes in both the range dynamics and the conservation of this subspecies in Iran. Considering the overlap of the protected areas with the suitable habitat of Zarudny's tortoise revealed that insufficient amounts of suitable habitat are protected. Hence, considering the vulnerable conservation status of Iranian tortoise, the importance of establishing more protected areas through the suitable habitat of his taxon is emphasized.

AB  - As many people live in cities that lack green space, biodiversity in such areas is decreasing. Suwon, the study site, a city that strives to improve its biodiversity, is close to the capital city of the Republic of Korea (ROK), and has a large population. This study aims to identify habitat-suitable areas using the longitudinal distribution model in Suwon-si, examine habitat changes when rooftop greening scenarios are applied to various use areas, and distinguish efficient use areas to expand the number of forms. To establish a rooftop greening creation scenario, the area was calculated based on the rooftop greening promotion plan in the metropolitan area, and a representative use area where rooftop greening can be applied was selected. To generate a scenario for creating rooftop greening, the property of the green area was assigned to the corresponding use area, and it was produced as an environmental variable, while the species distribution model was driven. As a result of the study, the area of increase in habitat area according to the rooftop greening for each usage area was derived, and the efficiency of the increase in habitat area compared to the rooftop greening area for each usage area was derived. To improve biodiversity in Suwon-si, rooftop greening in residential areas was found to be the most efficient, and rooftop greening efficiency in commercial areas was the lowest. It is expected that information on the increase and efficiency of the habitat of the wild birds due to rooftop greening by area of use derived from this study will help establish a rooftop greening plan and support decision-making to promote biodiversity in the city.

AB  - Ecosystem management is a theoretical framework in which land managers attempt to approximate natural disturbance with harvesting practices. In the mixedwood boreal forest of northeastern Alberta. Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc. alters cutblock size. structure. and distribution over the landscape to simulate fires, the dominant disturbance type. In 1997 and 1998. we sampled for Rana sylvatica (Le Conte) and Pseudacris triseriata maculata (Wied-Neuwied) near Owl River and Mariana Lake, Alberta. in undisturbed, harvested, and naturally burned landscapes. We compared Patterns of distribution and relative abundance using transects'. time-constrained lake margin searches, and opportunistic detections. In 1998. we characterized the understory, shrub layer, and canopy layer on each transect. We used stepwise. logistic regression to describe microhabitat use by each species. We did not detect consistent differences between burned and logged areas. This may reflect pre-treatment variation in regional habitat. Our data suggest that the presence of R, sylvatica is related to deciduous leaf litter, and that both species may require extensive round cover and moist soil conditions. Although the microhabitat descriptions we present can he used to plan future harvests, further work is required to determine the effectiveness of ecosystem management in the boreal forest.

AB  - Fish is an important vertebrate group due to its diversified role such as stabilization of local aquatic ecosystem, served to be the vital sources for animal protein and also helps to socio-economical upliftment of marginal peoples through culture practices. Nowadays, it becomes a great challenge to improve the fish production without affecting the wild stock in support to the sustainable aquaculture. Therefore, current research showed the application of modern GIS tools and survey-based data which utilize to verify the accurate scenario of sustainable aquaculture and potentiality of fish farming practices in Bankura District, West Bengal, India. In situ survey data discovered that, total 102 numbers of freshwater fish species belonging to 10 Orders and 27 Families out of which 14 fish species are under IUCN-threatened categories found in this district due to the availability of huge freshwater resources. Moreover, the Matrix plot also specified the threatened categorized fish species throughout the year to execute a suitable conservation and management plan. Even a map based representation of fish species distribution surveyed out in 22 different Community Development Blocks of Bankura to find the high, medium and low species diversity. Furthermore, GIS mapping and other crucial survey data have focused that total 48,453 numbers of closed water bodies (up to 0.033 ha areas considered) are found in this district. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to verify the interrelationship in all available wild closed water bodies as well as cultured based water bodies to validate the potentiality of fish farming. Multivariate linear correlation models have exposed the positive and negative relationship in between the species distribution and total numbers of closed water bodies; fish species distribution and percentage of cultured based closed water body (11.08%) distributions, respectively. Meanwhile, a lack of proper management policies toward the aquatic components of the said ecosystem will be ultimately downgrade the production efficiency and interlinked ecological balance in upcoming days.

AB  - Human use of ecosystem resources and services is increasing worldwide, generating pressures that alter ecosystem structure, functioning and provision of services. Unexpected ecosystem change is becoming frequent, and the complex ways through which multiple human pressures may interact leave conservation practitioners and natural resource managers faced with high uncertainty. We developed a geospatial approach for modeling the complex relationships between multiple h man pressures and coastal ecosystems status. This framework was then used to produce maps of the expected status of marine coastal ecosystems resulting from variation in the cumulative human pressure. The geospatial modeling approach we developed was tested on an emblematic study case requiring marine spatial planning, i.e. a recently established marine protected area (MPA) that will have to coexist with the expansion of a close commercial harbor. In the study case presented, our modeling approach was used to predict the status of coastal ecosystems resulting from different management alternatives. Results showed that should Port Authority support MPA in reducing human pressures in the area, coastal ecosystems would not be expected to further deteriorate as a consequence of harbor expansion. Our approach proved effective in modeling complex interaction among multiple pressures (e.g. synergisms) and predicting potential future scenarios. The implementation of this approach into geographical information systems (GIS)allows managers to represent the expected outcomes of their planned conservation effort!, thereby representing an important decision-support tool for finding efficient management solutions in the face of complex interactions and high uncertainty.

AB  - Three of the four known feline species in Jordan are categorized as critically endangered, according to the latest Red List assessment of mammals in Jordan, of which caracal: Caracal caracal, sand cat Felis margarita, and jungle cat Felis chaus. The fourth species, discussed within this paper - the wild cat Felis silvestris, is a species of least concern. Human activities such as hunting, poisoning, habitat destruction, and fragmentation are among the pressures seriously affecting the small and restricted populations of critically endangered felines. This study is the first to provide predictions on habitat suitability for the four species based on the two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), predictions of how greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, of 2.6 (representing "very stringent" corrections to the number of greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere) and 8.5 (the "business-as -usual" or also known as the "worst -case scenario"). Results showed an alarming decline in suitable habitats for all species. The sand cat is predicted to lose its entire suitable habitats in 2050 and 2070 according to RCP 8.5, while both the caracal and jungle cat are to face the very precarious pressure of declined areas of suitable habitat. Jordan's network of protected areas was deemed inadequate, according to this study, to protect the feline species and maintain their population. As potential solutions to counter the combined anticipated impacts occurring from both human activities and anticipated climate forecasts, it is necessary to strengthen the enforcement of environmental policies intended to protect reserves and natural areas, strengthen ex-situ conservation measures, minimize human pressures, to cope with the predicted habitats loss in the future, and to review the current network of protected areas.

AB  - Conservation interventions for threatened species must be based on accurate assessments of the effects of anthropogenic pressures on habitat suitability. We used multiscale multivariable species-distribution modeling to evaluate habitat suitability for an Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) population in Shangyong Reserve, Yunnan Province, southwestern China. We investigated the scales at which measurements of environmental variables best reflected elephant habitat selection, and examined whether these responses changed over 2 decades (2000-2010 and 2011-2020) in response to 20 environmental variables, including 14 variables reflecting landscape fragmentation, the extent of buildings, and transport infrastructure. Elephant presence was sensitive to the scale of each variable, and the effects differed among variables within and between decades. More than half of the variables influenced elephant presence at coarse scales of 8 or 16 km, including 12 variables reflecting anthropogenic pressures in 2000-2010 and 10 in 2011-2020. Overall, multivariate models with variables at their optimal scales had higher discrimination than models at uniformly fine scales of 1 km or 2 km. The extent of suitable habitat for elephants declined by 24% over 2 decades. Less than half of elephant habitat was located within Shangyong Reserve (49% in 2000-2010, 40% in 2011-2020), indicating the importance of managing suitable habitat beyond reserve boundaries. Roads and buildings reduced the probability of elephant presence, with effects that extended beyond their immediate footprint. We advocate that infrastructure be planned with buffers, >= 8 km wide, between roads or buildings and core elephant habitat. Multiscale multivariable species-distribution modeling should be employed to ensure that all suitable habitat for the remaining fragmented elephant populations in Yunnan is identified, mapped, and protected.

AB  - The delineation of essential fish habitats is necessary to identify, design and prioritize efficient marine protected area (MPA) networks with fishery objectives, capable, in addition to other possible objectives and functions of MPAs, of sustaining the renewal of marine living resources. Both the methods available to map essential fish habitats and the usefulness of these maps are discussed in this paper.
   Generally, the first step to obtain maps of essential fish habitats consists in choosing one of the numerous existing statistical approaches to build robust habitat suitability models linking relevant descriptors of the marine environment to the spatial distribution of fish presence or density. When these descriptors are exhaustively known, i.e. maps are available for each of them, geo-referenced predictions from these models and their related uncertainty may be imported into Geographic Information Systems for the quantitative identification and characterization of key sites for the marine living resources.
   The second part of this paper deals with the usefulness of such quantitative maps for management purposes. These maps allow for the quantitative identification of the different habitats that are required for these marine resources to complete their life cycles and enable to measure their respective importance for population renewal and conservation. The consequences of anthropogenic pressures not only fishing but also land reclamation, aggregate extractions or degradation of habitat quality (e.g. nutrient excess or xenobiotics loadings, invasive species or global change) on living resources, may also be simulated from such habitat models. These quantitative maps may serve as input in specific conservation planning software based on the systematic conservation approach. Fish habitat maps thus may help decision makers to select relevant protection areas and design coherent MPA networks which objectives are to sustain fishing resources and fisheries.

AB  - Uganda's small number of resident ornithologists has rendered planning a classic grid-based atlas impractical, since this would require a relatively uniform coverage. Nevertheless, over 33 000 point records are available, many from areas such as Forest Reserves,where particular surveys have been undertaken. We used these data, together with others held by the National Biodiversity Data Bank, and a geographic information system to see whether distribution patterns could be predicted using environmental variables. Six were tested; mean annual rainfall and vegetation type were found to have the strongest predictive power. Two stages of testing were used: a pre-test based on pre-1990 records that were recorded on a basis of Quarters of a Square Degree (QSDs); and a full test based on later point data with reasonably accurate geographic references, and areas of well-known distributions. Pre-1970 records were not used in modelling and therefore acted as a 'control group'. In both tests, modelled lists were generated using different combinations of variables and compared with known distributions. Using this approach,we modelled habitat suitability for approximately 350 of 1007 species known from Uganda. 'Sultable habitat' was defined by mapping point records on a GIS layer representing the variables and deriving the underlying environmental attributes. The method was unsuitable for species that exhibit riverine and/or shoreline distributions (as these respond to humidity conditions); or those with few records. The resulting Bird Atlas of Uganda, due for publication in 2001, shows point records and where these were unavailable, QSD records were plotted at grid centres together with modelled suitable habitat. An approach based on predictive modelling is most useful where ornithologists are scarce,areas are extensive and there is high species diversity. Additionally, it helps to locate hotspots requiring increased conservation efforts or further fieldwork.

AB  - In the context of water resources planning and management, the prediction of fish distribution related to habitat characteristics is fundamental for the definition of environmental flows and habitat restoration measures. In particular, threatened and endemic fish species should be the targets of biodiversity safeguard and wildlife conservation actions. The recently developed meso-scale habitat model (MesoHABSIM) can provide solutions in this sense by using multivariate statistical techniques to predict fish species distribution and to define habitat suitability criteria. In this research, Random Forests (RF) and Logistic Regressions (LR) models were used to predict the distribution of bullhead (Cottus gobio) as a function of habitat conditions. In ten reference streams of the Alps (NW Italy), 95 mesohabitats were sampled for hydro-morphologic and biological parameters, and RF and LR were used to distinguish between absence/presence and presence/abundance of fish. The obtained models were compared on the basis of their performances (model accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa and area under ROC curve). Results indicate that RF outperformed LR, for both absence/presence (RF: 84 % accuracy, k = 0.58 and AUC = 0.88; LR: 78 % accuracy, k = 0.54 and AUC = 0.85) and presence/abundance models (RF: 79 % accuracy, k = 0.57 and AUC = 0.87; LR: 69 % accuracy, k = 0.43 and AUC = 0.81). The most important variables, selected in each model, are discussed and compared to the available literature. Lastly, results from models' application in regulated sites are presented to show the possible use of RF in predicting habitat availability for fish in Alpine streams.

AB  - Species are often observed to occur in restricted patches of particularly warm microclimate at their high latitude/altitude geographic range margin. In these areas, global warming is expected to cause small-scale expansion of the occupied area, but most previous studies of range expansion have used very coarse scale data. Using high resolution microclimate models together with detailed field surveys, we tested whether the butterfly Plebejus argus, occurring on limestone grassland in north Wales, was responding as might be expected due to climate change in the last 30-40 yr. The abundance of adult Plebejus argus at 100 m resolution in 2011 was strongly affected by elevation and near-ground temperatures in May. A statistical model including microclimate, fitted to 2011 data, was successful (67% correct) at hindcasting the occurrence of Plebejus argus in 1983 when the average May air temperature was 1.4 degrees C cooler. However, the model was less accurate at hindcasting occurrences in 1972 (50% correct). Given the distribution of micro-sites in this landscape, we predict that further warming of approximately 1 degrees C would make the majority of sites highly microclimatically suitable for this species. There are a growing number of long-term studies of range change, and investigations into the mechanisms driving them, but still surprisingly few that explicitly make and test predictions with independent data. Our tests are a valuable example of how accurate predictions of distribution change can be, but also of the inevitable uncertainties. Improved understanding of how well models predict will be very important to plan robust climate change adaptation measures.

AB  - Adjacency relationships are pervasive in forest planning problems, especially the ones related to the selection of habitat networks for biodiversity conservation. Two main approaches are applied in the planning of these conservation actions: i) selection grounded on the island biogeography theory, where connected habitats are preferred and ii) selection grounded in the habitat amount hypothesis, where the amount of habitat is enforced in local landscapes, regardless of their spatial distribution. Because the presence of connectivity requirements in the creation of habitat networks impose more stringent limitations on the search for optimal solutions, they are expected to cascade to the total benefit from harvesting revenues and, consequently, to the costs of the habitat networks. The ecological implications of these approaches have been investigated, whereas the economic consequences of imposing connectivity remain unclear. Here, I address this issue and investigate the costs of selecting habitat networks in multiple forest landscapes in central Europe, applying these two approaches. To this end, a conic optimization model is proposed, to find minimum cost allocations of forest reserves. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on the optimal allocation is conducted, regarding the size of the habitat network required and the level of heterogeneity in forest profitability within the landscapes. The results show that habitat networks amounting to 10% of the forest area may be created with up to 5.5% reduction in the total Net Present Value (NPV), with a higher cost when connectivity is imposed (6.5%). The cost of connectivity, however, may increase in landscapes with high heterogeneity in forest profitability and with the minimum amount of habitat required. In conclusion, habitat selection must be tailored to local conditions and weight the additional costs of imposing connectivity against the requirements of the target species and the expected ecological benefits.

AB  - Introduction: The Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida Nelson 1903) is a subspecies threatened by habitat destruction and sensitive to climate change. It is distributed in the old forests of the United States and Mexico. Objective: To determine the potential historical (1970-2000) and future (2021-2040, 2041-2060 y 2061-2080) distribution of the Mexican spotted owl under two climate change scenarios (SSP 245 and SSP 585). Materials and methods: Potential distribution was modeled using the R software with the MaxEnt algorithm, 155 geographically uncorrelated occurrence records, and five bioclimatic layers. Areas of environmental suitability were predicted for eight environmental management units in the United States and Mexico. Results and discussion: Three temperature variables contributed 93.1 % to the model prediction: mean diurnal range (44.8 %), maximum temperature of the warmest month (28.8 %) and average of the coldest quarter (19.5 %). Future scenarios showed gradual and continuous losses of suitable bioclimatic space for the bird in seven management units, especially in the high emissions scenario (SSP 585) in the Sierra Madre Oriental de Mexico (-56.1 to-96.4 %). The Southern Rocky Mountains environmental management unit in the United States was the only one that gained suitable bioclimatic space (51.3 to 167.2 %) in all periods. Conclusion: Although changes are not significant, the loss of areas of bioclimatic suitability begins in 2030 and increases in 2041 and, therefore, climate change represents a current threat to this bird of prey.

AB  - Given historical patterns of decline, the American Black Duck (Anas rubripes) has long been a species of concern. To support the identification of core Maritime habitat, the distribution of breeding ducks was mapped at the landscape scale through the combination of GIS-based land cover information and five years of intensive aerial surveys (2006-2010). A predictive, mixed effects model was used to generate the maps, based on the weighted average of coefficients for the top 95% of all-possible models (as measured by AIC weights). The results of the averaged mixed model indicated that annual variation (YEAR), availability of surface water (WET AREA, LAKE_AREA and WET_DIVERSITY) and occurrence of active agricultural landscapes (AG_PROP and ROAD_DENSITY) were strongly associated with the number of breeding pairs. The presence of larger numbers of breeding ducks in agricultural landscapes represents a departure from studies conducted in more intensively utilized regions (e.g. southern Ontario and Quebec), and suggest that the benefits of breeding in Maritime agricultural areas outweigh potential costs. Using 34,659 prediction points, duck distribution was modeled in relatively high and low years (2008 and 2006, respectively), resulting in detailed maps suitable for the identification of priority areas for habitat restoration and enhancement. In order to help refine conservation management plans, future work should more closely examine the impact of different types and combinations of Maritime agricultural production to better understand the way these landscapes attract breeding ducks.

AB  - In subarctic waters winter may be the period during which seabirds face the greatest environmental and physiological pressures, yet seabird distribution during this time is poorly understood. Using at-sea surveys conducted in Prince William Sound, Alaska on research 'ships of opportunity' from November 2007 to March 2009, we investigated how seabird abundance and distribution vary within and between winters for three common seabird species with extensive ranges: common murre (Uria aalge), marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), and black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). Due to a large proportion of zeros in the survey data, hurdle models were performed using generalized additive mixed models. Across the two winters, consistent temporal patterns in density and distribution were observed for all species. Common murre and marbled murrelet both increased in number in midwinter, while black-legged kittiwake decreased to very low numbers. Habitat association models revealed that common murre favored relatively protected waters while marbled murrelet favored inside bays and passages (which make up 45% of semi-protected waters) and areas of higher sea surface temperatures. Our results suggest that winter storms influenced seabird distribution, particularly in midwinter when temperatures were lowest and storms more frequent. This influence was greater than variables providing proxies for foraging opportunities, which were absent from selected models. Our study highlights the importance of considering species-specific temporal patterns throughout the non-breeding season to guide marine spatial planning that will fully address seabird conservation issues.

AB  - Protected areas play a key role in the preservation of biodiversity, but their implementation at sea is lagged behind terrestrial environments, especially in offshore areas. Here we describe the identification of foraging hotspots off the Mediterranean Iberian coast using three Procellariiform species as examples, and assess the stability of these sites. Then, we show how these foraging hotspots contributed to the delimitation of marine Important Bird Areas (IBAs). The whole process consisted of: (1) seabird data collection (extensive boat-based surveys and seabird tracking, conducted in 1999-2010) and compilation of relevant spatial descriptors of the marine environment; (2) species distribution modeling (SDM) aimed at identifying areas with high habitat quality for the different seabird species (3); identification and delineation of the main seabird hotspots, based on models, supported by direct seabird data, and mediated by expert opinion; (4) application of BirdLife International IBA criteria for hotspot validation; and (5) combination of hotspots from different species to set the final limits of the marine IBAs. This approach allowed to identify a series of hotspots for pelagic species in the study area, and provided nice examples of stability assessment, which slightly differed in performance between seabird species. They contributed to the Spanish marine IBA inventory, which is in the process of receiving legal protection. Future work should be directed at confirming the stability of the marine IBAs in the long term, and to address the development of management plans to make effective the protection of these sites.

AB  - Background Mangroves are tropical and subtropical intertidal forests colonising sheltered coasts across the world. They host a unique faunal community, dominated by brachyuran crabs and gastropods. These invertebrates strongly contribute to the functionality of the entire forest. The reliable assessment of mangrove faunal diversity is, thus, a crucial step for efficient management and conservation plans, but it is hindered by difficulties in species identification. Here we provide a verified DNA barcode library for brachyuran crabs and gastropods inhabiting the mangroves of the Greater Bay Area, Southern China. In particular, we collected and morphologically identified 1100 specimens of mangrove associated brachyuran crabs and gastropods. The partial sequences of the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene were obtained from 275 specimens. Barcode sequences were then used to delineate Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs), employing three different delimitation methods: the automatic barcode gap discovery (ABGD) method, the general mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) model and a Bayesian implementation of the Poisson tree processes (bPTP) model. Results By integrating DNA barcodes with morphology, we identified 44 gastropod species and 58 brachyuran species associated with Hong Kong mangroves, with five and seven new records, for gastropods and crabs, respectively, for the Greater Bay Area. The delineation of MOTUs based on barcode sequences revealed a strong congruence between morphological and molecular identification for both taxa, showing the high reliability of the barcode library. Conclusions This study provides the first reference barcode library for mangrove-associated macrobenthic fauna in the Greater Bay Area and represents a reliable tool to management and conservation plans. Our molecular analyses resolved long lasting taxonomic misidentifications and inconsistencies and updated the knowledge on the geographical distribution of Asian mangrove associated fauna, ultimately highlighting a level of biodiversity higher than previously thought for Southern China.

AB  - Given the rapidly growing human population in mediterranean-climate systems, land use may pose a more immediate threat to biodiversity than climate change this century, yet few studies address the relative future impacts of both drivers. We assess spatial and temporal patterns of projected 21st century land use and climate change on California sage scrub (CSS), a plant association of considerable diversity and threatened status in the mediterranean-climate California Floristic Province. Using a species distribution modeling approach combined with spatially-explicit land use projections, we model habitat loss for 20 dominant shrub species under unlimited and no dispersal scenarios at two time intervals (early and late century) in two ecoregions in California (Central Coast and South Coast). Overall, projected climate change impacts were highly variable across CSS species and heavily dependent on dispersal assumptions. Projected anthropogenic land use drove greater relative habitat losses compared to projected climate change in many species. This pattern was only significant under assumptions of unlimited dispersal, however, where considerable climate-driven habitat gains offset some concurrent climate-driven habitat losses. Additionally, some of the habitat gained with projected climate change overlapped with projected land use. Most species showed potential northern habitat expansion and southern habitat contraction due to projected climate change, resulting in sharply contrasting patterns of impact between Central and South Coast Ecoregions. In the Central Coast, dispersal could play an important role moderating losses from both climate change and land use. In contrast, high geographic overlap in habitat losses driven by projected climate change and projected land use in the South Coast underscores the potential for compounding negative impacts of both drivers. Limiting habitat conversion may be a broadly beneficial strategy under climate change. We emphasize the importance of addressing both drivers in conservation and resource management planning.

AB  - Climate change affects parasitic plants and their hosts on distributions. However, little is known about how parasites and their hosts shift in distribution, and niche overlap in response to global change remains unclear to date. Here, the potential distribution and habitat suitability of four endangered holoparasites and their primary hosts in northern China were predicted using MaxEnt based on occurrence records and bioclimatic variables. The results indicated that (1) Temperature annual range (Bio7) and Precipitation of driest quarter (Bio17) were identified as the common key climatic factors influencing distribution (percentage contribution > 10%) for Cynomorium songaricum vs. Nitraria sibirica (i.e., parasite vs. host); Temperature seasonality (Bio4) and Precipitation of driest month (Bio14) for Boschniakia rossica vs. Alnus mandshurica; Bio4 for Cistanche deserticola vs. Haloxylon ammodendron; Precipitation of warmest quarter (Bio18) for Cistanche mongolica vs. Tamarix ramosissima. Accordingly, different parasite-host pairs share to varying degree the common climatic factors. (2) Currently, these holoparasites had small suitable habitats (i.e., moderately and highly) (0.97-3.77%), with few highly suitable habitats (0.19-0.81%). Under future scenarios, their suitable habitats would change to some extent; their distribution shifts fell into two categories: growing type (Boschniakia rossica and Cistanche mongolica) and fluctuating type (Cynomorium songaricum and Cistanche deserticola). In contrast, the hosts' current suitable habitats (1.42-13.43%) varied greatly, with highly restricted suitable habitats (0.18-1.00%). Under future scenarios, their suitable habitats presented different trends: growing type (Nitraria sibirica), declining type (Haloxylon ammodendron) and fluctuating type (the other hosts). (3) The niche overlaps between parasites and hosts differed significantly in the future, which can be grouped into two categories: growing type (Boschniakia rossica vs. Alnus mandshurica, Cistanche mongolica vs. Tamarix ramosissima), and fluctuating type (the others). Such niche overlap asynchronies may result in severe spatial limitations of parasites under future climate conditions. Our findings indicate that climate factors restricting parasites and hosts' distributions, niche overlaps between them, together with parasitic species identity, may jointly influence the suitable habitats of parasitic plants. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the threatened holoparasites themselves in conjunction with their suitable habitats and the parasite-host association when developing conservation planning in the future.

AB  - Climate and land-cover change will directly impact future species distributions, leading to range expansions, contractions and local extinctions. However, assessments of future range shifts rarely account for the capacity of the landscape matrix to facilitate species dispersals. Here, we assessed future range shifts for a suite of critically endangered plants in Madagascar. We quantified habitat connectivity using a least cost path model that captured the potential of species to disperse within fragmented landscapes. Next, we constructed three scenarios representing landscapes impacted by climate-only, climate and land-cover change, as well as habitat connectivity. We modelled species distributions using a hierarchical Bayesian framework and measured future range shifts using three spatial indices: net-change, range distance and elevation change. Our results show that the median range shift due to contractions increased by 25% under the climate-only scenario compared with the connectivity scenario. Habitat connectivity is predicted to limit range shifts due to contractions, while increasing shifts due to expansions for many of the endangered and critically endangered plants on Madagascar. However, at least onethird of critically endangered and 50% of endangered plants are expected to experience range contractions and upslope displacement under all scenarios, suggesting that even with habitat connectivity the range of some species may still contract. Despite that finding, our study suggests that including connectivity in range shift models is crucial for developing a relevant connectivity conservation plan, since future climate or climate and land-cover change models do not adequately represent species? potential to reach safe sites.

AB  - Xanthium strumarium L. is a globally successful invasive herb that has had significant negative ecological, economic and social impacts in many world regions. The present study was therefore conducted to evaluate the invasive potential and spatial distribution patterns of X. strumarium in heavily invaded plant communities of the semiarid regions of northern Pakistan. Investigations were based on data from 20 plants grown in the Herbarium at the University of Malakand, and from observations in 450 plots distributed across 45 stands representing habitats across Northern Province including open fields, hillocks and abandoned areas in both urban and rural areas. Multivariate analysis identified elevation, organic matter and organic carbon as the environmental variables most associated with communities invaded by X. strumarium. Increased soil silt was positively associated and available water was negatively associated with X. strumarium-invaded communities. These key environmental characteristics allowed us to identify four main associations: Group I: X. strumarium-C. sativa, Group II: X. strumarium-P. hysterophorus, Group III: X. strumarium-A. aspera and Group IV: X. strumarium-C. sativa. Other invasive species were observed, either exotic, such as P. hysterophorus, or indigenous, such as C. sativa and D. inoxia, often co-occurring and responding similarly to these factors. The results suggest that high temperature with drought stress could be a determinant of increasing population at lower elevations, whereas colder climates with adequate moisture are related to reduced populations at higher elevations, near the species' upper range limits. It is recommend that the inclusion of appropriate, additional soil and climatic variables in species distribution models be implemented in order to better explain species' ecological niches and help guide conservation and protection plans for native plant communities.

AB  - Anticipating the effect of climate change on biodiversity, in particular on changes in community composition, is crucial for adaptive ecosystem management(1) but remains a critical knowledge gap(2). Here, we use climate velocity trajectories(3), together with information on thermal tolerances and habitat preferences, to project changes in global patterns of marine species richness and community composition under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways(4) (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Our simple, intuitive approach emphasizes climate connectivity, and enables us to model over 12 times as many species as previous studies(5,6). We find that range expansions prevail over contractions for both RCPs up to 2100, producing a net local increase in richness globally, and temporal changes in composition, driven by the redistribution rather than the loss of diversity. Conversely, widespread invasions homogenize present-day communities across multiple regions. High extirpation rates are expected regionally (for example, Indo-Pacific), particularly under RCP8.5, leading to strong decreases in richness and the anticipated formation of no-analogue communities where invasions are common. The spatial congruence of these patterns with contemporary human impacts(7,8) highlights potential areas of future conservation concern. These results strongly suggest that the millennial stability of current global marine diversity patterns, against which conservation plans are assessed, will change rapidly over the course of the century in response to ocean warming.

AB  - Distinguishing tree species is relevant in many contexts of remote sensing assisted forest inventory. Accurate tree species maps support management and conservation planning, pest and disease control and biomass estimation. This study evaluated the performance of applying ensemble techniques with the goal of automatically distinguishing Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus uncinata Mill. Ex Mirb within a 1.3 km(2) mountainous area in Barcelonnette (France). Three modelling schemes were examined, based on: (1) high-density LiDAR data (160 returns m(-2)), (2) Worldview-2 multispectral imagery, and (3) Worldview-2 and LiDAR in combination. Variables related to the crown structure and height of individual trees were extracted from the normalized LiDAR point cloud at individual-tree level, after performing individual tree crown (ITC) delineation. Vegetation indices and the Haralick texture indices were derived from Worldview-2 images and served as independent spectral variables. Selection of the best predictor subset was done after a comparison of three variable selection procedures: (1) Random Forests with cross validation (AUCREcv), (2) Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and (3) Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). To classify the species, 9 regression techniques were combined using ensemble models. Predictions were evaluated using cross validation and an independent dataset. Integration of datasets and models improved individual tree species classification (True Skills Statistic, TSS; from 0.67 to 0.81) over individual techniques and maintained strong predictive power (Relative Operating Characteristic, ROC = 0.91). Assemblage of regression models and integration of the datasets provided more reliable species distribution maps and associated tree-scale mapping uncertainties. Our study highlights the potential of model and data assemblage at improving species classifications needed in present-day forest planning and management.

AB  - Understanding mortality rates and movement patterns across a species' distribution can provide key insight necessary for developing effective conservation, recovery, and management plans. We directly estimated site fidelity and natural mortality rates for the threatened Gulf sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) across a large portion of their range in the northern Gulf of Mexico using acoustic telemetry methods and a simulation-tested, multistate mark-recapture model. Our results suggest that fidelity rates to riverine habitats used during spring and summer are high, but natural mortality rates vary widely. Our results are highly relevant for managing this species. The high fidelity rates, coupled with supporting genetic analyses, suggest that management of individual riverine populations of Gulf sturgeon should be considered. The need for individual river-based management is exacerbated by the variation in natural mortality rates among rivers. The reasons for these differences in mortality are unclear, but are an important area of future research because higher mortality rates may impede recovery of some Gulf sturgeon populations to stated management targets.

AB  - Estimating patterns of habitat use is challenging for marine avian species because seabirds tend to aggregate in large groups and it can be difficult to locate both individuals and groups in vast marine environments. We developed an approach to estimate the statistical power of discrete survey events to identify species-specific hotspots and coldspots of long-term seabird abundance in marine environments. We illustrate our approach using historical seabird data from survey transects in the US. Atlantic Ocean Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), an area that has been divided into "lease blocks" for proposed offshore wind energy development. For our power analysis, we examined whether discrete lease blocks within the region could be defined as hotspots (3 x mean abundance in the OCS) or coldspots (1/3 x) for individual species within a given season. For each of 74 species/season combinations, we determined which of eight candidate statistical distributions (ranging in their degree of skewedness) best fit the count data. We then used the selected distribution and estimates of regional prevalence to calculate and map statistical power to detect hotspots and coldspots, and estimate the p-value from Monte Carlo significance tests that specific lease blocks are in fact hotspots or coldspots relative to regional average abundance. The power to detect species-specific hotspots was higher than that of coldspots for most species because species-specific prevalence was relatively low (mean: 0.111; SD: 0.110). The number of surveys required for adequate power (>0.6) was large for most species (tens to hundreds) using this hotspot definition. Regulators may need to accept higher proportional effect sizes, combine species into groups, and/or broaden the spatial scale by combining lease blocks in order to determine optimal placement of wind farms. Our power analysis approach provides a general framework for both retrospective analyses and future avian survey design and is applicable to a broad range of research and conservation problems.

AB  - Assessing the effects of climate change on threatened species requires moving beyond simple bioclimatic models to models that incorporate interactions among climatic trends, landscape change, environmental stochasticity, and species life history. Populations of marten (Martes americana) and lynx (Lynx canadensis) in southeastern Canada and the northeastern United States represent peninsular extensions of boreal ranges and illustrate the potential impact of these threats on semi-isolated populations at the range margin. Decreased snowfall may affect marten and lynx through decreased prey vulnerability and decreased competitive advantage over sympatric carnivores. I used a spatially explicit population model to assess potential effects of predicted changes in snowfall by 2055 on regional marten and lynx populations. The models' habitat rankings were derived from previous static models that correlated regional distribution with snowfall and vegetation data. Trapping scenarios were parameterized as a 10% proportional decrease in survival, and logging scenarios were parameterized as a 10% decrease in the extent of older coniferous or mixed forest. Both species showed stronger declines in the simulations due to climate change than to overexploitation or logging. Marten populations declined 40% because of climate change, 16% because of logging, and 30% because of trapping. Lynx populations declined 59% because of climate change, 36% because of trapping, and 20% in scenarios evaluating the effects of population cycles. Climate change interacted with logging in its effects on the marten and with trapping in its effects on the lynx, increasing overall vulnerability. For both species larger lowland populations were vulnerable to climate change, which suggests that contraction may occur in the core of their current regional range as well as among smaller peripheral populations. Despite their greater data requirements compared with bioclimatic models, mesoscale spatial viability models are important tools for generating more biologically realistic hypotheses regarding biotic response to climate change.

AB  - Species Distribution Models (SDMs) constitute an important tool to assist decision-making in environmental conservation and planning. A popular application of these models is the projection of species distributions under climate change conditions. Yet there are still a range of methodological SDM factors which limit the transferability of these models, contributing significantly to the overall uncertainty of the resulting projections. An important source of uncertainty often neglected in climate change studies comes from the use of background data (a.k.a. pseudo-absences) for model calibration. Here, we study the sensitivity to pseudo-absence sampling as a determinant factor for SDM stability and transferability under climate change conditions, focusing on European wide projections of Quercus robur as an illustrative case study. We explore the uncertainty in future projections derived from ten pseudo-absence realizations and three popular SDMs (GLM, Random Forest and MARS). The contribution of the pseudo-absence realization to the uncertainty was higher in peripheral regions and clearly differed among the tested SDMs in the whole study domain, being MARS the most sensitive with projections differing up to a 40% for different realizations and GLM the most stable. As a result we conclude that parsimonious SDMs are preferable in this context, avoiding complex methods (such as MARS) which may exhibit poor model transferability. Accounting for this new source of SDM-dependent uncertainty is crucial when forming multi-model ensembles to undertake climate change projections.

AB  - Merremia peltata is a species with uncertain status in the island nations of the Pacific region. It has been designated introduced and invasive in some countries whereas it is considered native in others. Recent increase in its abundance across some island landscapes have led to calls for its designation as an invasive species of environmental concern with biological control being suggested as a control strategy. Climate change will add to the complications of managing this species since changes in climate will influence its range limits. In this study, we develop a process-oriented niche model of M.peltata using CLIMEX to investigate the impacts of climate change on its potential distribution. Information on the climatic requirements of M.peltata and its current geographic distribution were used to calibrate the model. The results indicate that under current climate, 273,132km(2) of the land area in the region is climatically unsuitable or marginal for M.peltata whereas 664,524km(2) is suitable to highly suitable. Under current climate, areas of climatic suitability for M.peltata were identified on the archipelagos of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. By the end of the century, some archipelagos like Fiji, Hawaii, New Caledonia and Vanuatu will probably become more suitable while PNG and Solomon Islands become less suitable for M.peltata. The results can be used to inform biosecurity planning, management and conservation strategies on islands.

AB  - Assessing and categorizing habitat needs or population trends of organisms with complex life histories, such as Odonata, is challenging. All Odonata have aquatic nymphs and terrestrial adults. As a consequence, their use as indicators of ecosystem health or as umbrella species in conservation plans may be misleading if data from a particular life stage does not reflect actual residency at a freshwater site. We explored this question with an extensive data set for Odonata from Oklahoma, USA, to determine if ecological niches modeled from records of adults (i.e., lacking any evidence of breeding) differed from niches modeled for records indicating breeding (tandem pairs, ovipositing females, larvae, teneral [recently emerged adults], or exuviae [shed exo-skeletons of larvae]) at surveyed sites. We predicted that models would be comparable if adult presence strongly indicates local breeding but would be dissimilar if adults occupy many more sites than those at which the species breeds. Our results supported the latter prediction. Adult models were broader geographically and had a wider, more equitable (higher evenness) balance of contributing environmental variables (niche dimensions) than did models for breeders, which tended to be more ecologically specialized. These findings suggest that surveys of adult Odonata, which are relatively easy to obtain because of organized efforts to encourage observations by citizen scientists, can paint a misleadingly broad picture of a species' ecological niche. We recommend that evidence of breeding, especially presence of tenerals or exuviae, be used to outline ecological requirements when questions of conservation or population monitoring arise.

AB  - Understanding local and geographic factors influencing species distributions is a prerequisite for conservation planning. Our objective in this study was to model local and geographic variability in elevations occupied by native and nonnative trout in the northwestern Great Basin, USA. To this end, we analyzed a large existing data set of trout presence (5,156 observations) to evaluate two fundamental factors influencing occupied elevations: climate-related gradients in geography and local constraints imposed by topography. We applied quantile regression to model upstream and downstream distribution elevation limits for each trout species commonly found in the region (two native and two nonnative species). With these models in hand, we simulated an upstream shift in elevation limits of trout distributions to evaluate potential consequences of habitat loss. Downstream elevation limits were inversely associated with latitude, reflecting regional gradients in temperature. Upstream limits were positively related to maximum stream elevation as expected. Downstream elevation limits were constrained topographically by valley bottom elevations in northern streams but not in southern streams, where limits began well above valley bottoms. Elevation limits were similar among species. Upstream shifts in elevation limits for trout would lead to more habitat loss in the north than in the south, a result attributable to differences in topography. Because downstream distributions of trout in the north extend into valley bottoms with reduced topographic relief, trout in more northerly latitudes are more likely to experience habitat loss associated with an upstream shift in lower elevation limits. By applying quantile regression to relatively simple information (species presence, elevation, geography, topography), we were able to identify elevation limits for trout in the Great Basin and explore the effects of potential shifts in these limits that could occur in response to changing climate conditions that alter streams directly (e.g., through changes in temperature and precipitation) or indirectly (e.g., through changing water use).

AB  - Management plans for threatened or recovering large vertebrate species that are increasing in population size and range focus on the establishment of viable populations within set temporal limits. New Zealand (Hookers) sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) were declared a threatened species in 1997, and New Zealand legislation requires that threatened species of marine mammals must be managed to reduce human-induced mortality and achieve a non-threatened status within 20 years. The present breeding distribution of P. hookeri is highly localised, with over 95% of total annual pup production located at Auckland Islands and almost all of the remainder at Campbell Island. Breeding elsewhere has been ephemeral or restricted to < 10 adult females. The only recorded sustainable breeding at a new location has been at Otago, South Island, New Zealand. This breeding population consisted of a total of four breeding females in 2002 and is derived from one immigrant female that gave birth to her first pup in the 1993/1994 breeding season. The New Zealand Department of Conservation management plan specifies that to achieve a non-threatened status P. hookeri (1) at Otago must increase in the number of breeding females to greater than or equal to 10, and (2) must establish greater than or equal to two new breeding locations within the 20-year time frame, each with greater than or equal to 10 breeding females. This study 1) projects the population growth trends at a new location (Otago) to see if it will achieve greater than or equal to 10 breeding females within the legislated time frame, and (2) examines the likelihood that other breeding locations will establish elsewhere given the demographic information available for this species. We present 20 deterministic and three stochastic Leslie matrix model scenarios for female population growth for the initial years following the start of breeding at a new location. Our results indicate that (1) a new breeding population derived from one immigrant female is unlikely to reach 10 breeding females in 20 years; this duration is more likely to be 23-41 years (deterministic models) or 23-26 years (stochastic model), (2) the likelihood of two new sites establishing within 20 years is unquantifiable, but the probability is low, and (3) if the legislated outcome and time limit are not revised in the population management plan, the feasibility and effectiveness of re-locating young females could be investigated.

AB  - One of the main goals in nature conservation and land use planning is to identify areas important for biodiversity. One possible cost-effective surrogate for deriving appropriate estimates of spatial patterns of species richness is provided by predictive modeling based on remote sensing and topographic data. Using bird species richness data from a spatial grid system (105 squares of 0.25 km(2) within an area of 26.25 km(2)), we tested the usefulness of Landsat TM satellite-based remote sensing and topographic data in bird species richness modeling in a boreal agricultural-forest mosaic in southwestern Finland. We built generalized linear models for the bird species richness and validated the accuracy of the models with an independent test area of 50 grid squares (12.5 km(2)). We evaluated separately the modeling performance of habitat structure, habitat composition, topographical-moisture variables and all variables in the model-building and model-test areas.
   Areas of high observed and predicted bird species richness in the boreal agricultural-forest mosaic were mainly concentrated along river valleys in the grid squares with a high habitat diversity and steep topography. This landscape type also has the highest cover of habitats important for nature conservation: seminatural grasslands, deciduous forests, and watercourses. The covers of deciduous forests and serninatural grassland were included as explanatory variables of the bird species richness model, although they both cover only about 5% of the land in the study area. When the four models were evaluated by fitting them to the model test area, the explanatory power of the topography-moisture model decreased clearly, whereas the habitat-composition, habitat-structure, and all-variables models were more rigorous. Finally, we extrapolated the models to the whole study area of 600 km(2) and produced bird species richness probability maps using GIS techniques.
   We conclude that, instead of scattered study plots in which birds are counted, predictive modeling requires large study areas where the variation within the whole landscape can be taken into account. A spatial grid system with several environmental variables derived from remote sensing data produces the most reliable data sets, which can be used when predicting species richness in other landscapes.

AB  - The ecosystem services provided by tropical forests are affected by deforestation. Territorial management strategies aim to prevent and mitigate forest loss. Therefore, modeling potential land use changes is important for forest management, monitoring, and evaluation. This study determined whether there are relationships between forest vulnerability to deforestation (potential deforestation distribution) and the forest management policies applied in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
   Proxy and underlying variables were used to construct a statistical model, based on the principle of maximum entropy that could predict potential land use changes. Entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty for a density function. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Jackknife Test were used to validate the model. The importance of input variables in the model was determined through: Percent Contribution (PC) and Permutation Importance (PI). The results were compared with prevailing regional forest management strategies.
   The socioeconomic variables that provided the largest amount of information in the overall model (AUC=0.81) and that showed most of the information not present in other variables were: "Protected areas-Intangible zone" (PC=24%, PI=12.4%), "timber harvesting programs" (PC=21.7%, PI=4.7%), "road network" (PC=18.9%, PI=7.7%), and "poverty rate" (PC=3.7%, PI=6.1%). Also, the biophysical variable "temperature" (PC=7,9%, PI=22.3%) provided information in the overall model.
   The results suggested the need for changes in forest management strategies. Forest policies and management plans should consider integrating and strengthening protected areas and intangible zones, as well as restricting timber harvesting in native forest and establishing forest areas under permanent management. Furthermore, the results also suggested that financial incentive programs to reduce deforestation have to be evaluated because their present distribution is inefficient. In this context, conservation incentive plans need to be revised so that they focus on areas at deforestation risk. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental heterogeneity affects not only the distribution of a species but also its local abundance. High heterogeneity due to habitat alteration and fragmentation can influence the realized niche of a species, lowering habitat suitability as well as reducing local abundance. We investigate whether a relationship exists between habitat suitability and abundance and whether both are affected by fragmentation. Our aim was to assess the predictive power of such a relationship to derive advice for environmental management. As a model species we used a forest specialist, the short toed treecreeper (Family: Certhiidae; Certhia brachydactyla Brehm, 1820), and sampled it in central Italy. Species distribution was modelled as a function of forest structure, productivity and fragmentation, while abundance was directly estimated in two central Italian forest stands. Different algorithms were implemented to model species distribution, employing 170 occurrence points provided mostly by the MITO2000 database: an artificial neural network, classification tree analysis, flexible discriminant analysis, generalized boosting models, generalized linear models, multivariate additive regression splines, maximum entropy and random forests. Abundance was estimated also considering detectability, through N-mixture models. Differences between forest stands in both abundance and habitat suitability were assessed as well as the existence of a relationship. Simpler algorithms resulted in higher goodness of fit than complex ones. Fragmentation was, highly influential in determining potential distribution. Local abundance and habitat suitability differed significantly between the two forest stands, which were also significantly different in the degree of fragmentation. Regression showed that suitability has a weak significant effect in explaining increasing value of abundance. In particular, local abundances varied both at low and high suitability values. The study, lends support to the concept that the degree of fragmentation can contribute to alter not only the suitability of an area for a species, but also its abundance. Even if the relationship between suitability and abundance can be used as an early warning of habitat deterioration, its weak predictive power needs further research. However, we define relationships between a species and some landscape features (i.e., fragmentation, extensive rejuvenation of forests and tree plantations) which could be easily controlled by appropriate forest management planning to enhance environmental. suitability, at least in an area possessing high conservation and biodiversity values.

AB  - Climate change is prevalent across the world and can have large influence on plant regeneration, recruitment, survival and diversity. Regeneration and recruitment are the key phases in the plant life cycle and these two aspects are related to survival, adaptation and distribution of species. This study thus aims to explore the effect of projected climate change on germination and establishment response of some timber tree species from the tropical/subtropical broad leaf forests of Nepal. Germination experiments were carried out under three different temperature regimes (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and germination parameters identified from the experimental component were calibrated in the mechanistic model Tree and Climate AssessmentGermination and Establishment Module (TACA-GEM) that helped in identifying species vulnerability to climate change. The model outcome under varied climatic conditions helped in determining the species risk to projected climatic conditions. The model demonstrates that the studied species were able to increase germination under the projected climate change however, establishment consistently failed for most of the species across the hot tropical sites. This finding indicates that spatial vulnerability may limit recruitment in the future. The species-specific responses suggest that, in general, all three species (Alnus nepalensis, Adina cordifolia, and Bombax ceiba) exhibited enhanced germination and establishment in moderately warm and colder sites, indicating that these species may more likely shift their range towards the north in future. Thus, the general species response exhibited in this study may aid in regional climate change adaptation planning in the sector of forest conservation and management.

AB  - Reliable abundance estimates for species are fundamental in ecology, fisheries, and conservation. Consequently, predictive models able to provide reliable estimates for un- or poorly-surveyed locations would prove a valuable tool for management. Based on commonly used environmental and physical predictors, we developed predictive models of total fish abundance and of abundance by fish family for ten representative taxonomic families for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) using multiple temporal scenarios. We then tested if models developed for the GBR (reference system) could predict fish abundances at Ningaloo Reef (NR; target system), i.e., if these GBR models could be successfully transferred to NR. Models of abundance by fish family resulted in improved performance (e.g., 44.1 % < R-2 < 50.6% for Acanthuridae) compared to total fish abundance (9% < R-2 < 18.6%). However, in contrast with previous transferability obtained for similar models for fish species richness from the GBR to NR, transferability for these fish abundance models was poor. When compared with observations of fish abundance collected in NR, our transferability results had low validation scores (R-2 < 6%, p > 0.05). High spatio-temporal variability of patterns in fish abundance at the family and population levels in both reef systems likely affected the transferability of these models. Inclusion of additional predictors with potential direct effects on abundance, such as local fishing effort or topographic complexity, may improve transferability of fist local-scale predictors are often not abundance models. However, observations of these available, and might thereby hinder studies on model transferability and its usefulness for conservation planning and management.

AB  - Increasing urbanization degrades quantity, quality, and the functionality of spatial cohesion of natural areas essential to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. The uncontrolled pace of building activity and the erosion of blue (i.e., aquatic) and green (i.e., terrestrial) landscape elements threaten existing habitat ranges and movability of wildlife. Local scale measures, such as nature-inspired engineered Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) are emerging mitigation solutions. Originally planned to promote sustainable stormwater management, adaptation to climate change and improved human livability in cities, such instruments offer interesting syn-ergies for biodiversity in support of existing ecological infrastructure. BGI are especially appealing for globally declining amphibians, a rich and diverse vertebrate assemblage sensitive to urbanization. We integrated bio-logical and highly resolved urban-rural land-cover data, ensemble models of habitat suitability, and connectivity models based on circuit theory to improve multi-scale and multi-species protection of core habitats and ecological corridors in the Swiss lowlands. Considering a broad spectrum of amphibian biodiversity, we iden-tified distributions of amphibian biodiversity hotspots and four landscape elements essential to amphibian movability at the regional scale, namely i) forest edges, ii) wet-forest habitats, iii) soils with variable moisture and iv) riparian zones. Our work shows that cities can make a substantial contribution (e.g., up to 15% of urban space in the study area) to wider landscape habitat connectivity. We highlight the importance of planning BGI locally in strategic locations across urban and peri-urban areas to promote the permeability and availability of 'stepping stone' habitats in densely populated landscapes, essential to the maintenance of regional habitat connectivity and thereby enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Aim A positive relationship between assemblage diversity (AD) - equivalent to the biotic version of the environment diversity, ED, method - and species diversity has been reported. This being true, reserve networks with many different assemblages would be expected to represent more species than reserve networks including fewer and less different assemblages. This idea was tested using European species atlas distributions of terrestrial vertebrates and plants. It is asked whether: (1) maximizing AD within one group would represent species diversity of this group better than expected by chance; and (2) maximizing AD within one group would represent species diversity of other groups better than expected by chance.
   Location Europe.
   Methods Three ordination techniques (non-metric multidimensional scaling, detrended correspondence analysis and correspondence analysis) are used to summarize patterns of compositional turnover within assemblages. p-Median location-allocation models are then calculated from ordination space to measure the degree of expected species representation within the group being sampled as well as the expected representation within other groups. Results are compared with near-optimal solutions obtained with complementarity-based algorithms and to a null model obtained by simulating selection of areas at random. Matrix correlation analysis was also performed to investigate broad patterns of covariation in compositional turnover of assemblages of species belonging to different taxonomic groups and these values were compared with correlation in species richness scores between groups.
   Results The AD model did not always represent more species of the group being sampled than expected by chance (P < 0.05). Results were independent of the method and taxonomic group considered. Effectiveness of AD within one group to represent species of other groups varied, but in most cases it was worse than using complementarity-based algorithms as a surrogate strategy. Even when correlations indicated high coincidence between assemblages, taxonomic-based surrogates did not always recover more species than expected by chance (P < 0.05).
   Main conclusions Results are discussed in the light of two possible explanations: (1) the AD model is based on unrealistic assumptions, namely that species have equal probability of having the centre of their distributions anywhere in ordination space and that species display unimodal, symmetrical, bell-shaped response curves to gradients; (2) particular implementation of methods may be inadequate to summarize useful complementarity among assemblages, especially for restricted-range species. We conclude that both arguments are likely to play a role in explaining results, but that opportunities exist to improve performance of existing surrogate strategies.

AB  - Along with plant species composition forest structural complexity is an important determinant of forest biodiversity, but difficult to predict in space from field data. We analyzed forest structural complexity based on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available, area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity, as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements, together being indicative of structurally diverse forests. Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The predictive deviances explained (D-2) and the AUC values obtained from cross-validation ranged from 15.5% to 63.1% and 0.77% to 0.97% respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy. To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations, forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position improved all models and were most important for the species depending on weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate the integration of conservation-relevant information into multifunctional forestry.

AB  - Maytenus senegalensis subsp. europaea communities are unique vegetal formations in Europe. In fact, they are considered Priority Habitat by Directive 92/43/EEC. These are ecologically valuable plant communities found in the southeast of Spain. By combining modeling methods of environmental variables, historical photo-interpretation, and fieldwork, a chronosequence of the evolution of their extent of occurrence (EOO) has been reconstructed in 1957 and 2011. Results showed a strong regression range of M. senegalensis subsp. europaea populations. More than 26,000ha of EOO for this species have been lost in the province of Almeria. Considering the final number of polygons, this area has been fragmented 18 times since the 1950s. These results reinforce the idea that the alteration and fragmentation of habitat due to human activities is one of the most important drivers of biodiversity loss and global change. These activities are mostly intensive greenhouse agriculture and urbanization without sustainable land planning. Knowledge about the distribution of M. senegalensis subsp. europaea is of great interest for future habitat restoration. Therefore, this would be the key species to recover these damaged ecosystems.

AB  - High quality habitat suitability maps are indispensable for the management and planning of wildlife reserves. This is particularly important for megadiverse developing countries where shortages in skilled manpower and funding may preclude the use of mathematically complex modeling techniques and resource-intensive field surveys. In this study, we propose a simulation based k-fold partitioning and re-substitution approach to refine and update logistic regression models that are widely used for habitat suitability assessment and modeling. We test the modeling strategy using data from a rapid field survey conducted for habitat suitability assessment for muntjak (Muntiacus muntjak) and goral (Naemorrhaedus goral) in the central Himalayas, India. Results obtained from simulations match expectations in terms of model behavior and in terms of published habitat associations of the investigated species. Qualitative comparisons with predictions from the GARP. MaxEnt and Bioclimatic Envelopes modeling systems also show broad agreement with predictions obtained from the proposed technique. The proposed technique is suggested as a rapid-assessment precursor to detailed habitat studies such as patch occupancy modeling in situations where funds or trained manpower are not available.

AB  - Through spatially explicit predictive models, knowledge of spatial patterns of biota can be generated for out-of-reach environments, where there is a paucity of survey data. This knowledge is invaluable for conservation decisions. We used distribution modeling to predict the occurrence of benthic biotopes, or megafaunal communities of the seabed, to support the spatial planning of a marine national park. Nine biotope classes were obtained prior to modeling from multivariate species data derived from point source, underwater imagery. Five map layers relating to depth and terrain were used as predictor variables. Biotope type was predicted on a pixel-by-pixel basis, where pixel size was 15315 m and total modeled area was 455 km(2).
   To choose a suitable modeling technique we compared the performance of five common models based on recursive partitioning: two types of classification and regression trees ([1] pruned by 10-fold cross-validation and [2] pruned by minimizing complexity), random forests, conditional inference (CI) trees, and CI forests. The selected model was a CI forest (an ensemble of CI trees), a machine-learning technique whose discriminatory power (class-byclass area under the curve [AUC] ranged from 0.75 to 0.86) and classification accuracy (72%) surpassed those of the other methods tested. Conditional inference trees are virtually new to the field of ecology. The final model's overall prediction error was 28%. Model predictions were also checked against a custom-built measure of dubiousness, calculated at the polygon level. Key factors other than the choice of modeling technique include: the use of a multinomial response, accounting for the heterogeneity of observations, and spatial autocorrelation. To illustrate how the model results can be implemented in spatial planning, representation of biodiversity in the national park was described and quantified.
   Given a goal of maximizing classification accuracy, we conclude that conditional inference trees are a promising tool to map biota. Species distribution modeling is presented as an ecological tool that can handle a wide variety of systems (e.g., the benthic system).

AB  - The policy term green infrastructure highlights the need to maintain functional ecosystems as a foundation for sustainable societies. Because forests are the main natural ecosystems in Europe, it is crucial to understand the extent to which forest landscape management delivers functional green infrastructures. We used the steep west-east gradient in forest landscape history, land ownership, and political culture within northern Europe's Baltic Sea Region to assess regional profiles of benefits delivered by forest landscapes. The aim was to support policy-makers and planners with evidence-based knowledge about the current conditions for effective wood production and biodiversity conservation. We developed and modeled four regional-level indicators for sustained yield wood production and four for biodiversity conservation using public spatial data. The western case study regions in Sweden and Latvia had high forest management intensity with balanced forest losses and gains which was spatially correlated, thus indicating an even stand age class distribution at the local scale and therefore long-term sustained yields. In contrast, the eastern case study regions in Belarus and Russia showed spatial segregation of areas with forest losses and gains. Regarding biodiversity conservation indicators, the west-east gradient was reversed. In the Russian, Belarusian, and Latvian case study regions, tree species composition was more natural than in Sweden, and the size of contiguous areas without forest loss was larger. In all four case study regions, 54-85% of the total land base consisted of forest cover, which is above critical fragmentation thresholds for forest landscape fragmentation. The results show that green infrastructures for wood production and biodiversity conservation are inversely related among the four case study regions, and thus rival. While restoration for biodiversity conservation is needed in the west, intensified use of wood and biomass is possible in the east. However, a cautious approach should be applied because intensification of wood production threatens biodiversity. We discuss the barriers and bridges for spatial planning in countries with different types of land ownership and political cultures and stress the need for a landscape approach based on evidence-based collaborative learning processes that include both different academic disciplines and stakeholders that represent different sectors and levels of governance.

AB  - The bobwhites (Colinus) consist of 3 grassland-associated, allopatric species of New World quails (family Odontophoridae): the northern bobwhite (C. virginianus), distributed from the eastern United States to Guatemala; the black-throated bobwhite (C. nigrogularis), which occurs in scattered localities in the Yucatan Peninsula, Nicaragua, and Honduras; and the crested bobwhite (C. cristatus), whose range stretches from Guatemala to northern Brazil. We used mitochondrial DNA(mtDNA) sequences from both the control region and the ND2 gene to study the phylogenetic relationships and phylogeography of the 3 bobwhite species. We developed ecological niche models to evaluate conclusions inferred from genetic data. Colinus was composed of 2 deeply divergent lineages, 1 represented by the crested bobwhite and the other by northern and black-throated bobwhites, both of which were genetically distinct from each other. Although the northern bobwhite had high haplotype diversity, this species exhibited evidence of past demographic and geographic expansion, no phylogeographic structure, and no congruence between genetic variation and subspecies taxonomy. Ecological niche modeling was congruent with a recent range expansion for the northern bobwhite from Late Pleistocene refugia in Mexico and the southern United States. The black-throated bobwhites from the Yucatan Peninsula were distinct from those in Nicaragua, and as a whole this species displayed little evidence of recent expansion. Ecological niche modeling suggested that the current, fragmented distribution of the black-throated bobwhite has existed for the past 130,000 years. Although the crested bobwhite displayed little evidence of population expansion, the mtDNA data revealed 3-4 geographically and genetically distinct lineages. Results of niche modeling suggest that the crested bobwhite had a much wider distribution in Central and South America during the Last Glacial Maximum. Given the sensitivity of all 3 bobwhite species to climatic cycles, managers should consider impacts of climate change in addition to the loss of habitat when crafting conservation plans.

AB  - The biodiversity data typically available for fitting distributional models in the tropics come from museum and scientific collections which are often incomplete and prone to sampling and environmental biases. Nevertheless, most studies undertaken in tropical regions assume that collection data offers a satisfactory environmental coverage without any quantitative assessment. In this study, we investigate the effects of differences in environmental bias and coverage provided by distributional data when aggregated into different grid cell sizes, on the performance of species richness-environment models and predictions. We use an extensive data compilation, including national and regional collections, on the distribution of amphibians, reptiles and fishes in the hydrologic region of the Usumacinta River as a case study. General additive models and environmental variables are used to construct predictive models at 40, 20, 10 and 5 km grid resolutions, based on well-sampled cells. The best multivariate models included nonparametric interaction terms for the effects of precipitation and temperature and suggested an altitudinal shift in the relative importance of energy and water in determining the distribution of species richness. For fishes, geomorphology accounted for fine scale variation in species richness along the hydrologic network, indicated by peaks in species diversity at the junction of the major rivers where major accumulation of water and sediments occurs. For all taxonomic groups, we found that sampling biases deviated most from the mean bias at the extremes of gradients accounting for important environmental factors. The pattern of environmental bias changed with grid size, with the form and amount of change being casespecific. Biases affected distribution predictions when compared with unbiased datasets. Moreover, not all models resulted best at coarser resolution as it is commonly assumed. Our results demonstrate that bias in the available data must be evaluated before mapping biodiversity distributions, irrespective of the choice of scale.

AB  - It is widely accepted that the postfire recovery in Mediterranean plant communities is carried out by direct regeneration, i.e., the fast recovery of a plant community with the same species pool that it had immediately prior to disturbance. However, there is evidence that not all plant species in the Mediterranean basin survive fire in all situations, suggesting that the direct regeneration process might not apply to all situations. We analyze whether the main combinations of forest tree species (up to 16) of the western Mediterranean basin exhibit a postfire direct regeneration process. Based on data from field surveys, we have developed a stochastic model to predict the medium-term forest dynamics. In general, Quercus species (resprouters) and the pines Pinus halepensis and P. pinaster (seeders that produce abundant seedlings) showed direct regeneration patterns. In contrast, forests of P. nigra, P. sylvestris, and P. pinea (seeders that produce few seedlings) changed to other situations after fired This outcome was validated by additional data from plots with known fire history. These results did not support completely the direct regeneration model, since only half of the combinations of tree species analyzed exhibited a >50% probability of recovering the original prefire situation after fire. This partial failure of direct regeneration evidences the need for reconsidering restoration and conservation plans for Mediterranean ecosystems after fire.

AB  - Understanding the nature of migratory behaviors within animal populations is critical to develop and refine conservation and management plans. However, tracking migratory marine animals across life stages and over multiple years is inherently difficult to achieve, especially for highly migratory species. In this paper, we explore the use of acoustic telemetry to characterize the spatial ecology of Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), elucidate the ecology of this poorly studied species, and ultimately inform conservation and management. Using the data from twenty-two acoustically tagged Atlantic tarpon, we found a diversity of tarpon migratory patterns, including spatial and temporal overlap for some individuals. We also reveal fine scale movements within specific ecosystems, as well as a range of distributions and connectivity across coastal waters of the southeastern United States of America. For tarpon with tracking durations greater than one month (n = 13), we found heterogeneous space use and migratory connectivity with some tarpon remaining close to their capture location while others migrated hundreds of kilometers. In addition, we were able to identify a northern and southern limit for one migratory tarpon that had detections spanning over 365 days. We share analyses on Atlantic tarpon data, including model-driven approaches and network analysis, to investigate movement strategies and space use, which may be pertinent to other studies involving highly migratory species. The project was a collaborative effort involving several acoustic telemetry networks which enabled the monitoring of broad- and fine-scale movements for extended periods of time that would normally be difficult to achieve with other monitoring techniques. Although challenges exist with applying acoustic telemetry to monitor highly migratory species, we also discuss its value in enabling researchers to assess movements and space use beyond the focal species, such as cross-ecosystem comparisons and multi-species interactions.

AB  - In the context of implementing the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) approximately 17% of the German forest area was designated in "Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)". Amongst these there are many beech forests which were not subject to a special protection status before.
   Management plans, containing measures for the protection of SACs, are just being developed. These measures may cause restrictions to forest management leading to losses of income. Our study aimed to analyse natural and economic impacts of the implementation of the Habitats Directive which could, e.g. be used as a basis for designing compensation schemes.
   In discussion with operational managers it became clear that the measures most restrictive to forest enterprises were small-area land set-aside, restrictions in choice of tree-species and maintenance of a sufficient share of mature stands.
   The impact of those nature protection measures on case-study forest enterprises was evaluated using an excel-based simulation model which enabled the calculation of, e.g., income losses based on enterprise individual data for a given simulation-period.
   The main factors influencing income losses were age-class distributions, management practices and objectives of forest enterprises. Annual income losses for the enterprises averaged 31 to 39 (sic)/ha. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: Spatial modelling can provide new understanding of patterns in biodiversity and help inform policy, planning and management decisions. However, for many taxa, in many regions, issues with currently available biological data curtail the application of spatial biodiversity models. Here we develop techniques to model spatial patterns of diverse subterranean invertebrate fauna (troglofauna and stygofauna) in the Pilbara region, to better inform biodiversity planning and management for these groups. In this context, the available data are highly biased in their distribution, with specimens often identified only at coarse taxonomic resolution, and individual community surveys sampling a relatively small proportion of the total assemblage at a location.
   Location: Pilbara bioregion, NW Australia.
   Methods: To overcome the challenges presented by the subterranean fauna data sets, we developed a community-level spatial biodiversity modelling framework, and applied this to model and project patterns in species richness and compositional turnover, for both troglofauna and stygofauna, using fine-resolution (similar to 30 m) environmental layers.
   Results: While there was a large amount of inherent noise in the collated data, our spatial models detected potential environmental drivers of community diversity that align with existing knowledge. For troglofauna, species richness was associated with iron-bearing geologies, while community compositional turnover was most strongly related to geographic distance. For stygofauna, groundwater depth was the primary predictor for richness and turnover, alongside other physicochemical groundwater attributes. We identified areas of high biodiversity significance by combining richness and turnover predictions.
   Main Conclusions: The spatial projections from our biodiversity models indicate the importance of the central Hamersley Range in harbouring unique and diverse subterranean assemblages. These models and projections provide an advanced platform for various biodiversity assessments, including identifying priorities for new surveys, and assessing the likely impacts of proposed development activities on the long-term persistence of subterranean species in the Pilbara.

AB  - Coupling habitat models based on GIS and on ground variables could help identify suitable areas (by means of landscape models obtained by GIS variables) to concentrate management actions for species' conservation. In this study, the habitat requirements of Lesser Greys (LGS) and Woodchat Shrikes (WS), two threatened farmland bird species declining in Europe, were assessed in Apulia (south-eastern Italy) by means of binary logistic regression at two different levels: landscape (using GIS-measured variables); and, territory (using ground-measured variables) scales. The LGS occurrence at landscape scale was correlated to steppe-like areas and cereal crops. At the territory level, significant effects were detected for deciduous forests and the presence of isolated trees and shrubs. The WS occurrence at landscape scale was promoted by steppe-like areas and cereal crops, whereas, at the territory level significant effects were detected for steppe-like areas positively and suburban areas negatively. The landscape model was extrapolated to the entire region. Within highly suitable areas (occurrence probability higher than 0.66 according to the landscape model), we measured average habitat features and compared them with the optimal mosaic depicted by the territory level models. This allowed us to give spatially explicit and site-specific management recommendations for these two threatened species. LGS will mostly benefit from an increase in isolated shrubs and trees; whereas for WS, the most widespread recommendations are to increase steppe-like habitat and to prevent further urbanisation.
   Coupling "coarse" landscape models with the species ecology provided by fine-scaled models can integrate relevant information on species potential distribution and territory level requirements, making planning fine-tuned habitat management (within potentially suitable landscapes) in a spatially explicit way possible.

AB  - Capsule: Hen Harriers Circus cyaneus on the Isle of Mull, UK, are associated with habitat mosaics consisting of moorland, scrub and forestry but avoid grazed land, suggesting that forested habitats could be managed sympathetically for the Hen Harrier in the future should the current UK population increase.
   Aims: To use distribution modelling to investigate nesting habitat associations using a long-term data set for the Hen Harrier on Mull.
   Methods: We develop area-interaction models using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalty to explore the distribution of 102 Hen Harrier nest sites in relation to habitat and topography. Our model is then successfully validated in tests using data for 70 nest sites from subsequent years.
   Results: Our model is effective in predicting suitable areas for Hen Harrier nest sites and indicates that Hen Harriers on Mull are found in habitat mosaics below 200 m above sea level. Hen Harrier nest intensity is positively associated with increasing proportions of moorland and scrub, open canopy forestry and closed canopy forestry. Nest intensity is negatively associated with increasing proportions of grazed land.
   Conclusion: Hen Harriers avoid grazed areas but are relatively tolerant of other habitat combinations. These findings are supported by previous observations of Hen Harrier habitat use and have implications for the recovery of some Hen Harrier populations in Special Protection Areas and future forest management. Open canopy forest and forest mosaics could potentially be incorporated into landscape-scale conservation plans for Hen Harriers using the population on Mull as an example.

AB  - Context Grasslands of the North American Great Plains are among the world's most imperiled ecosystems. Determining landscapes at risk of grassland loss will benefit grassland conservation programs by enabling prioritization of parcels for acquisition.
   Objectives We hypothesized that gradients in the amount of grass in local landscapes resulting from past conversion would be a useful predictor of future conversion. We developed simple, intuitive models predicting grassland conversion across the United States northern Great Plains.
   Methods We used the grassland/herbaceous, pasture/hay, and emergent herbaceous wetland classes from the National Land Cover Database to evaluate grassland loss from 2001 to 2016. We classified the amount of grass in 13.2-km(2) landscapes in 2001 into percentage bins and used generalized additive models to relate these values to the total and proportion of grassland lost, by percentage bin. We applied models to landcover data to create spatial surfaces predicting conversion.
   Results Area of grass lost was highest in 40-60% grass bins, except for heavily cropped states, where highest losses occurred in 10-20% grass bins. Percentage of grass in local landscapes was generally a strong predictor of state-level total grassland loss and proportion of grassland lost. Predicted conversion for remaining grasslands varied within and among states.
   Conclusion The amount of grass in local landscapes can be a useful indicator of grassland conversion. Our simple models complement species distribution models used to guide conservation in the region. Mechanistic models of conversion can be improved by including amount of grass in local landscapes.

AB  - As anthropogenic pressure on the landscape increases, invasive alien species (IAS) pose a growing threat to areas designed to protect high biodiversity habitats. In order to assess the present danger of IAS spread, we examined 23 Czech sites of community importance (SCI) within Natura 2000 protected areas (PA) over 2015 and mapped the occurrence of four IAS: Solidago spp. (goldenrod), Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam), Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) and Fallopia spp. (Japanese knotweed). The model areas were divided into five monitoring zones, graded by conservation importance and habitat disturbance level (core area [A], broader core area [B], semi-natural habitat [C], anthropogenically affected habitat [D], anthropogenically degraded habitat [E]). Despite a high number of IAS occurrences (3222 localities), habitats of European importance (zone A) showed a relatively low level of invasion (< 0.3% total area). Highest IAS occurrence number was in SCI border areas and disturbed habitats (zones C and E). There was a significant positive correlation between level of invasion inside and outside SCIs, related to human activities such as logging and urbanisation. A strong effect for watercourse vicinity was noted for the occurrence of I. glandulifera and Fallopia spp.; but not for H. mantegazzianum and Solidago spp. A stratified management approach, employing zones delimitation to assess what threat pose IAS to the PA objects of conservation, can be useful to prioritize control measures in IAS local action plans.

AB  - An important principle of forest management worldwide is the sustained conservancy of regional biodiversity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of climate and climate change on biodiversity in several uneven-aged, mixedwood stands in the world-heritage, Hyrcanian forest of northeastern Iran. The study involves the analysis of site-specific biodiversity records amassed from inventory plots distributed across three distinctive sub-regions of the Hyrcanian forest. In the current study, indices of species richness and evenness were assessed using both parametric and nonparametric techniques, i.e., generalized linear models (GLM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Both methods employed physiographic, historical biometric and climatic data sourced from the three sub-regions as input to model development and validation. Results showed that ANN with R-2-values of 0.68 and 0.57 was better skilled at predicting the indices of species richness and evenness than regression with GLM, yielding R-2-values of 0.13 and 0.10. Climate and physiographic variables were determined as the more important explanatory variables in both models. As per climate scenarios, representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5, biodiversity was predicted to stay mostly unchanged by 2070. These results suggest that management and conservation decisions made today can help ease the potential, undesirable effects of future climate change. Understanding the future distribution of key Hyrcanian forest tree species is critical for effective conservation planning.

AB  - Aim To quantify the role of multiple biodiversity drivers - pollution, woodland structure and climate - controlling lichen epiphyte composition and diversity.
   Location Scotland, north-west Europe.
   Methods Four compatible datasets were assembled: site-scale species distribution data (response) and base-line modelled data on climate, pollution loads and extent of old-growth woodland (explanatory variables). First, partial-canonical correspondence analysis was used: (1) to compare the importance of environmental variables to pure spatial effects and (2) to partition the importance of environmental variables in explaining species composition. Secondly, patterns of species richness were investigated using multiple least-squares regression.
   Results Old-growth woodland was the most important control of species richness. Pollution was the most important explanatory variable for species composition. The impact of pollution on composition (and to a lesser extent on richness) is explained: (1) By recovery of lichens with declining SO2 pollution, although with epiphyte composition shifted by the recent effects of N-pollution and (2) By the limited spatial extent of severe pollution, and generally low-to-moderate pollution loads across our study area, combined with the positive effect of old-growth woodland extent in controlling species richness. The effect of climate and old-growth woodland on species composition covaried, supporting an interaction between habitat quality and climatic setting, which may be important in understanding the epiphyte response to climate change.
   Conclusions Advances in conservation planning will likely require an integrated approach to understanding simultaneous effects of multiple drivers, providing opportunities for integrated management strategies. Our study provides a preliminary example of this approach by combining three key biodiversity drivers into a single framework for lichen epiphytes. Thus, reducing pollution loads may make old-growth woodland that currently exists in a polluted landscape available for colonization, thereby extending the available habitat for epiphytes, and facilitating an effective species response to climate change.

AB  - The Western Tragopan Tragopan melanocephalus is endemic to the Western Himalayas and currently listed as 'Vulnerable' on the IUCN Red List which also emphasizes a data deficiency regarding its distribution and population size. With this study we provide new data from the Palas Valley, northern Pakistan and deliver a range wide estimate of the species current, past, and future potential distribution as derived from environmental niche models. In the Palas Valley, Western Tragopans occupied different summer habitats on north-facing slopes and winter habitats on south-facing slopes. A quantitative estimate of local populations in six side valleys was inferred from individual call-count surveys during two breeding seasons (April and May 2017, 2018) and disturbance factors were evaluated from information of local people provided in questionnaires. Generalized-linear models (GLMs) showed a significant effect of disturbance factors on Western Tragopans, i.e. local abundances decreased with increasing disturbance from livestock, collectors and hunters visiting the area. This effect was visible across survey years and at both, south- as well as north-facing slopes. While the known distributional range of the Western Tragopan is small and fragmented, our niche models inferred climatically suitable space between Himachal Pradesh and northwestern Pakistan to be more continuous. Given the species sensitivity to disturbance, these findings indicate that the observed fragmentation of the current range might also be attributed to habitat transformation or anthropogenic disturbance rather than climatic suitability. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) T. melanocephalus was probably restricted to small forest refugia, whereas projections onto eleven future climate simulations were inconclusive with the majority suggesting that climatically suitable space for T. melanocephalus will likely expand in response to anthropogenic climate change. In conclusion, we recommend that future conservation measures should be planned with regard to the species' sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Over the last decades, timber harvest has greatly reduced the quality of habitat for several species. To mitigate this problem, government authorities often try to support silvicultural practices that help forests recover faster to a natural state while supporting the economic development of forestry. The American marten is a carnivore species that is sensitive to forest disturbances, which is one of the main factors limiting its populations. For several years, trappers have warned that logging reduced the abundance of marten in several areas at the heart of its distribution. We used forest inventories and trapping effort on traplines collected by the Quebec government since 1970 to assess the relationship between habitat quality, capture success of marten and weather over a 25 years span in Quebec. Our results showed that the abundance of marten decreased, following the proportion of good quality habitat since 1990. Furthermore, we observed an increase in capture success with the amount of snowfall suggesting that marten are more numerous in habitats where snow is abundant as it gives them a competitive advantage over sympatric mesocarnivores such as fishers. Consequently, as climate models forecast less snow in the future, the negative effect of logging could be amplified for this species. Forest planning should consider marten needs and improve the quality and connectivity of habitats to ensure the persistence of the American marten with changing climate.

AB  - Aim Predicting environmentally suitable areas for non-native species is an important step in managing biotic invasions, and ecological niche models are commonly used to accomplish this task. Depending on these models to enact appropriate management plans assumes their accuracy, but most niche model studies do not provide validation for their model outputs. South Florida hosts the world's most globally diverse non-native lizard community, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate the predictive ability of niche models by comparing model predictions to observed patterns of distribution, abundance and physiology in established non-native populations. Location Florida, USA. Taxon Lizards. Methods Using Maxent, we developed niche models for all 29 non-native lizard species with established populations in Miami-Dade County, Florida, using native range data to predict habitat suitability in the invaded range. We then used independently collected field data on abundance, geographical spread and thermal tolerances of the non-native populations to evaluate Maxent's ability to make predictions in both geographical and environmental space in the non-native range. Results Maxent performed well in predicting across geographical space where these non-native lizards were most likely to occur, but within a given geographical extent was unable to predict which individual species would be the most abundant or widespread. Comparisons with physiological data also revealed an imperfect fit, but without any consistent biases. Main conclusions We performed one of the most extensive field validations of Maxent's ability to predict where invasions are likely to occur, and our results support its continued use in this role. However, the program was unable to predict the relative abundance and geographical spread of established species, indicating limited utility for identifying which invasive species will be the greatest management concern. These results underscore the importance of other factors, such as time since introduction, dispersal ability and biotic interactions in determining the relative success of non-native species post-establishment.

AB  - Exposure risk is assessed based on modeling suitable habitat of large pelagic fish and oil spill scenarios originating at three wells located in the western GM's deep waters. Since the fate of the oil depends on the oceanographic conditions present during the accident, as well as the magnitude and duration of the spill, which are not known a priori, the scenarios used are a statistical representation of the area in which oil spilled from the well could be found, given all possible outcomes. The ecological vulnerability assessment identified a subset of bony fish with low-medium vulnerability and elasmobranchs with medium-high vulnerability. The oiling probability and exposure risk of both bony fish and elasmobranchs hotspots vary by well analyzed. Thus, these results provide essential information for a risk management plan for the assessed species and others with economic or conservation importance distributed in the GM and worldwide.

AB  - The complexity of global biodiversity in the tropical Indochina Peninsula and subtropical China bioregions has fascinated biologists for decades, but little is known about the spatiotemporal patterns in these regions. Accordingly, the aims of present study were to investigate the evolutionary and distribution patterns of Engelhardia in these regions and establish a model for examining biogeographic patterns and geological events throughout the tropical Indochina Peninsula and subtropical China. The effects of geological events occurring in the area between the Indochina Peninsula and subtropical China bioregions on the two trees species (i.e., E. roxburghiana and E. fenzelii) were evaluated. A robust phylogenetic framework of 884 individuals from 79 populations was used to generate time-calibrated cytoplasmic and nuclear phylogenetic frameworks based on cpDNA, nrDNA, and nSSR data, respectively. When considered along with ancestral area reconstructions, the genetic data were also used to assess and reconstruct the species' population genetic structure and diversity. These analyses yielded important information about the (1) historical distribution relationships between the tropical and subtropical flora of China; (2) effects of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) on the evolutionary history of Asia's plants; and (3) importance of biogeography in conservation planning. Although cytoplasmicnuclear discordance indicated cpDNA and nrDNA were subject to distinct evolutionary mechanisms that reflected respective evolutionary histories of the plastid and nuclear genomes of prior demographic and biogeographic events. The tropical elements of Engelhardia occupied the Indochina Peninsula during the early Eocene, whereas the subtropical elements were transformed from the tropical elements during Miocene cooling and the onset of the EASM at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary, intensified during the late Miocene and Pliocene, facilitating the transformation of Engelhardia from the tropical Indochina Peninsula to subtropical China. Demographic history provided insights into prominent planning frameworks in conservation biology, namely that subtropical China functioned as a refugium during past climate oscillations and will continue to serve in this capacity in the future.

AB  - Observational studies have not yet shown that environmental variables can explain pervasive nonlinear patterns of species abundance, because those patterns could result from (indirect) interactions with other species (e.g., competition), and models only estimate direct responses. The experiments that could extract these indirect effects at regional to continental scales are not feasible. Here, a biophysical approach quantifies environment-species interactions (ESI) that govern community change from field data. Just as species interactions depend on population abundances, so too do the effects of environment, as when drought is amplified by competition. By embedding dynamic ESI within framework that admits data gathered on different scales, we quantify responses that are induced indirectly through other species, including probabilistic uncertainty in parameters, model specification, and data. Simulation demonstrates that ESI are needed for accurate interpretation. Analysis demonstrates how nonlinear responses arise even when their direct responses to environment are linear. Applications to experimental lakes and the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) yield contrasting estimates of ESI. In closed lakes, interactions involving phytoplankton and their zooplankton grazers play a large role. By contrast, ESI are weak in BBS, as expected where year-to-year movement degrades the link between local population growth and species interactions. In both cases, nonlinear responses to environmental gradients are induced by interactions between species. Stability analysis indi-cates stability in the closed-system lakes and instability in BBS. The probabilistic framework has direct application to conservation planning that must weigh risk assessments for entire habitats and communities against competing interests.

AB  - Recovery of threatened species is often necessarily a long-term process. The present paper details the progress towards the recovery of trout cod, Maccullochella macquariensis, an iconic, long-lived fish species first listed as threatened in the 1980s. The objectives, actions and progress over three successive national recovery plans (spanning 18 years) are assessed, documenting changes to population distribution and abundance and updating ecological knowledge. Increased knowledge (especially breeding biology and hatchery techniques, movements, habitats and genetics) has greatly influenced recovery actions and the use of a population model was developed to assist with management options and stocking regimes. Key recovery actions include stocking of hatchery-produced fish to establish new populations, regulations on angling (including closures), education (particularly identification from the closely related Murray cod, M. peelii) and habitat rehabilitation (especially re-instatement of structural woody habitats). In particular, the establishment of new populations using hatchery stocking has been a successful action. The importance of a coordinated long-term approach is emphasised and, although there is uncertainty in ongoing resourcing of the recovery program, much has been achieved and there is cautious optimism for the future of this species.

AB  - Data on fishers' spatial distribution are vital, driven by a requirement for evidence-based management, and the trend towards Marine Spatial Planning. Intertidal fisheries have received considerably less attention from managers and scientists, compared to inshore and offshore counterparts to date. The need for additional intertidal fisheries data to inform management, specifically within European Marine Sites, has been identified. The purpose of this study is to map the spatial distribution of the data-poor Northumberland lugworm fishery, relating this to the sensitive features, habitats, and species present within the Berwickshire and North Northumberland Coast European Marine Site (BNNC EMS), ultimately mapping the vulnerability of areas to lugworm bait digging. Suitability, sensitivity, and vulnerability to the lugworm fishery were spatially modelled using cost-effective methodologies. Weighted Linear Combination models were created using both collated (e.g. sediment type, conservation designations) and collected data (e.g. lugworm density and size). Data processing was undertaken in GIS, and criteria weightings were assigned from expert interviews. Model outputs revealed the most intensely harvested sites (most suitable), the areas which contained the most sensitive habitats or species (most sensitive), and the sites which were most likely to be impacted by the lugworm fishery (most vulnerable). Extant spatial management measures within the BNNC EMS (e.g. byelaws) were found to encompass the majority of the most vulnerable areas identified, with exceptions highlighted for marine managers. There is scope for methods to be developed further, for additional intertidal fisheries and localities, as a useful management tool where spatial data are lacking.

AB  - Species may cope with rapid habitat changes by distribution shifts or adaptation to new conditions. A common feature of these responses is that they depend on how the process of dispersal connects populations, both demographically and genetically. We analyzed the genetic structure of a near-threatened high-Arctic seabird, the ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea) in order to infer the connectivity among gull colonies. We analyzed 343 individuals sampled from 16 localities across the circumpolar breeding range of ivory gulls, from northern Russia to the Canadian Arctic. To explore the roles of natal and breeding dispersal, we developed a population genetic model to relate dispersal behavior to the observed genetic structure of worldwide ivory gull populations. Our key finding is the striking genetic homogeneity of ivory gulls across their entire distribution range. The lack of population genetic structure found among colonies, in tandem with independent evidence of movement among colonies, suggests that ongoing effective dispersal is occurring across the Arctic Region. Our results contradict the dispersal patterns generally observed in seabirds where species movement capabilities are often not indicative of dispersal patterns. Model predictions show how natal and breeding dispersal may combine to shape the genetic homogeneity among ivory gull colonies separated by up to 2800 km. Although field data will be key to determine the role of dispersal for the demography of local colonies and refine the respective impacts of natal versus breeding dispersal, conservation planning needs to consider ivory gulls as a genetically homogeneous, Arctic-wide metapopulation effectively connected through dispersal.

AB  - Background: Rhynchocypris oxycephalus is a cold water fish with a wide geographic distribution including the relatively warm temperate regions of southern China. It also occurs in second-and third-step geomorphic areas in China. Previous studies have postulated that high-altitude populations of R. oxycephalus in southern China are Quaternary glacial relics. In this study, we used the mitochondrial gene Cytb and the nuclear gene RAG2 to investigate the species phylogeographical patterns and to test two biogeographic hypotheses: (1) that divergence between lineages supports the three-step model and (2) climatic fluctuations during the Quaternary resulted in the present distribution in southern China.
   Results: Phylogenetic analysis detected three major matrilines (A, B, and C); with matrilines B and C being further subdivided into two submatrilines. Based on genetic distances and morphological differences, matriline A potentially represents a cryptic subspecies. The geographic division between matrilines B and C coincided with the division of the second and third geomorphic steps in China, suggesting a historical vicariance event. Pliocene climatic fluctuations might have facilitated the southwards dispersal of R. oxycephalus in matriline C, with the subsequent warming resulting in its split into submatrilines C1 and C2, leaving submatriline C2 as a relic in southern China.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that geological events (three steps orogenesis) and climate fluctuations during the Pliocene were important factors in shaping phylogeographical patterns in R. oxycephalus. Notably, no genetic diversity was detected in several populations, all of which possessed unique genotypes. This indicates the uniqueness of local populations and calls for a special conservation plan for the whole species at the population level.

AB  - The use of statistical models to predict species distributions and suitable habitat has become an essential tool for wildlife management and conservation planning. Models have been especially useful with rare and endangered wildlife species. One such species is the mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni), a spiral-horned antelope endemic to the Ethiopian highlands. The full range of the species has never been adequately defined and recent discoveries of new populations suggest that others may exist undetected. To identify potential mountain nyala occurrences, we used classification tree analysis to predict suitable habitat using 76 climatic, topographical and vegetative variables. Three model evaluation methods showed a strong performance of the final model with an overall accuracy of 90%, Cohen's maximised kappa of 0.80 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.89. Minimum temperature and maximum precipitation generally had the greatest predictive contributions to suitable mountain nyala habitat. The predicted habitat covered an area of 39378 km(2), with the majority occurring in remote forests on the southern escarpment of the Bale Mountains. Other areas within the predicted range may be too impacted by human and livestock populations to support mountain nyala; however, the model will be useful in directing future surveys for new populations while offering clues to the species historical range.

AB  - Pangolins are highly-threatened due to illegal hunting and poaching, and by the loss, degradation, and fragmentation of their habitats. In Nepal, effective conservation actions for pangolins are scarce due to limited information on the distribution of pangolins in many areas of the country. To identify the nationwide distribution of pangolins in Nepal, and assess the environmental variables associated with their habitat, we conducted an extensive literature review to collate data from previous studies, canvassed information from key informant interviews and expert opinion, and conducted transect surveys and sign surveys. The occurrence of pangolins was recorded based on sightings and indirect signs (such as burrows, digs, tracks, and scats) along 115 belt transects of 500-m length with a fixed width of 50-m, and habitat parameters were surveyed using 347 quadrats of 10 m*10 m. Pangolin presence was confirmed from 61 out of 75 districts from the eastern to the far western parts of the country. The highest frequency of burrows (74%) was observed in the forested habitat constituting brown soil with medium texture (0.02-2 mm) within an elevation range of 500-1500 m above sea level. Logistic regression suggested that the occurrence of pangolin was highly influenced by ground cover and canopy cover of 50-75%, litter depth, and the distance to termite mounds and roads. We used 4136 occurrence GPS points of pangolin burrows that were compiled and collected from the literature review and field surveys in order to predict the potential habitat distribution of pangolin using maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt 3.4.1). The model predicted 15.2% (22,393 km(2)) of the total land of Nepal as potentially suitable habitat for pangolin, with 38.3% (8574 km(2)) of potential habitat in the eastern region, followed by 37.6% (8432 km(2)) in the central and 24.1% (5,387 km(2)) in the western regions. The results of this study present a national baseline for pangolin distribution and serve as an important document for developing and executing conservation actions and management plans for the long-term conservation of pangolins in Nepal.

AB  - Habitat prioritization and corridor restoration are important steps for reconnecting fragmented habitats and species populations, and spatial modelling approaches are useful in identifying suitable habitat for elusive tropical rainforest mammals. The Endangered Bornean banteng Bos javanicus lowi, a wild bovid endemic to Borneo, occurs in habitat that is highly fragmented as a result of extensive agricultural expansion. Based on the species' historical distribution in Sabah (Malaysia), we conducted camera-trap surveys in 14 forest reserves during 2011-2016. To assess suitable habitat for the banteng we used a presence-only maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach with 11 spatial predictors, including climate, infrastructure, land cover and land use, and topography variables. We performed a least-cost path analysis using Linkage Mapper, to understand the resistance to movement through the landscape. The surveys comprised a total of 44,251 nights of camera trapping. We recorded banteng presence in 11 forest reserves. Key spatial predictors deemed to be important in predicting suitable habitat included soil associations (52.6%), distance to intact and logged forests (11.8%), precipitation in the driest quarter (10.8%), distance to agro-forest and regenerating forest (5.7%), and distance to oil palm plantations (5.1%). Circa 11% of Sabah had suitable habitat (7,719 km(2)), of which 12.2% was in protected forests, 60.4% was in production forests and 27.4% was in other areas. The least-cost path model predicted 21 linkages and a relatively high movement resistance between core habitats. Our models provide information about key habitat and movement resistance for bantengs through the landscape, which is crucial for constructive conservation strategies and land-use planning.

AB  - The Devils Hole pupfish, Cyprinodon diabolis, is a federally-endangered fish that is endemic to Devils Hole, a discontiguous part of Death Valley National Park in Nye County, Nevada. Due to its status, Devils Hole pupfish monitoring must be non-obtrusive and thereby exclude techniques that require handling fish. Due to a recent decline in pupfish abundance, Devils Hole pupfish managers have expressed a need for a model that describes population dynamics. This population model would be used to identify vulnerable life history stage(s) and inform management actions. We constructed a set of individual-based simulation models designed to explore effects of population processes and evaluate assumptions. We developed a baseline model, whose output best resembled both observed length-frequency data and predicted intra-annual abundance patterns. We then ran simulations with 5 % increases in egg-larval, juvenile, and adult survival rates to better understand Devils Hole pupfish life history, thereby helping identify vulnerable life history stages that should become the target of management actions. Simulation models with temporally constant adult, juvenile, and egg-larval survival rates were able to reproduce observed length-frequency distributions and predicted intra-annual population patterns. In particular, models with monthly adult and juvenile survival rates of 80 % and an egg-larval survival rate of 4.7 % replicated patterns in observed data. Population growth was most affected by 5 % increases in egg-larval survival, whereas adult and juvenile survival rates had similar but lesser effects on population growth. Outputs from the model were used to assess factors suspected of influencing Devils Hole pupfish population decline.

AB  - Spatial modelling is part of the solution for incorporating insects into conservation policy. Uptake, however, rests on identifying robust environmental predictors. Coarse-grained climate models based on long-term averages and similarly coarse environmental features may not be adequate, especially at regional scales where most planning is done. Here, we test whether topoclimatic variables, which are derived from local-scale climate forcing factors, are more important for structuring ant assemblages. We quantified ant richness and species composition at 86 sites across a large (200x300km) temperate region of southeast Australia, and tested the explanatory power of three groups of environmental variables: (i) topoclimatic variables, (ii) long-term climatic averages modelled from global data, and (iii) habitat features, namely, habitat complexity, soil pH, and soil texture. Generalised Additive and Generalised Dissimilarity Models were used to test predictors. In univariate models, the topoclimatic estimator of maximum temperature (95maxT) explained the largest amount of variance in both richness and compositional turnover (20% and 24% of deviance respectively). The plot for richness indicated a positive but decelerating function of 95maxT. This was consistent for two of three habitat types. Habitat complexity was the most important predictor in cleared habitat (28%). While a topoclimatic variable was a strong predictor of ant biodiversity across the landscape, this was not a magic bullet'. Other predictors such as complexity may be more applicable in certain habitat types. We concluded that tailored predictors are needed for landscapes with a mosaic of different land use.

AB  - Accurate spatial information on the distribution of whitebark pine, a keystone species in alpine environments across western Canada, is critical for the planning of conservation activities designed to ameliorate the damaging effects of blister rust, mountain pine beetle, and interspecific competition. We compared classification tree analysis and logistic regression analysis to explore their relative abilities to model whitebark pine presence and absence with medium-spatial-resolution satellite and topographic variables across a complex study site in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta. Both techniques were found to be effective, generating map products of roughly equal thematic quality (91% overall accuracy; kappa = 0.76). However, the logistic model was valuable in its ability to predict ratio-level probability surfaces, whereas the classification tree approach was simpler, faster, and found to generate a slightly more balanced model from an individual class accuracy perspective. End users selecting between the two techniques should make choices that balance flexibility with simplicity while always taking care to exercise sound modeling practices.

AB  - A rapidly expanding human footprint - comprised of anthropogenic land-use change and infrastructure - is profoundly affecting wildlife distributions worldwide. Cumulative effects management (CEM) is a regional approach that seeks to manage combined effects of the human footprint on biodiversity across large spatial scales. Challenges to implementing this approach include a lack of ecological data at large spatial scales, the high cost of monitoring multiple indicators, and the need to manage multiple footprints across industries. To inform development of effective CEM, we used large mammals as indicators to address the following questions: a) do species respond more strongly to individual footprint features or to cumulative effects (combined area of all footprint types, measured as total footprint), b) which features elicit the strongest responses across species, and c) are the direction of responses to footprint consistent? We used data from 12 years of snowtrack surveys (2001-2013) in the boreal forest of Alberta, coupled with regional footprint and landcover data, to develop generalized linear mixed-effects models relating the relative abundance of five boreal mammals [gray wolf (Canis lupus), Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), coyote (Canis latrans), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces)] to individual and cumulative effects of the human footprint. We found that across species the strongest responses were to agriculture, roads, and young cutblocks (<10 years), suggesting these as potential priority stressors to address within CEM. Most species also responded to total footprint, indicating that in the absence of detailed information on individual features, this coarse measure can serve as an index of cumulative effects. There was high variability in direction and magnitude of responses across species, indicating that community-level responses are likely and should be considered within CEM planning.

AB  - Source-sink theory is an ecological framework that describes how site and habitat-specific demographic rates and patch connectivity can explain population structure and persistence across heterogeneous landscapes. Although commonly used in conservation planning, source-sink theory has rarely been applied to the management of invasive species. This study tested whether the common carp, one of the world's most invasive species, exhibits source-sink dynamics in a representative watershed in the Upper Mississippi River Basin comprised of a dozen interconnected ponds and lakes. To test for source-sink population structure, we used standard fish sampling techniques, tagging, and genetic assignment methods to describe habitat-specific recruitment rates and dispersal. Five years of sampling revealed that while adult carp were found across the entire watershed, reproductive success (the presence of young carp) was restricted to shallow ponds. Additionally, nearly a third of the carp tagged in a representative pond dispersed into the connected deeper lakes, suggesting that ponds in this system serve as sources and lakes as sinks. This possibility was confirmed by microsatellite analysis of carp tissue samples (n = 1041) which revealed the presence of two distinct strains of carp cohabitating in the lakes, whose natal origins could be traced back to one of two pond systems, with many adult carp attempting to migrate back into these natal ponds to spawn. We conclude that the distribution and persistence of invasive carp in complex interconnected systems may often be driven by source-sink dynamics and that their populations could be controlled by suppressing reproduction in source habitats or by disrupting dispersal pathways, instead of culling individuals from sink habitats.

AB  - Wetlands provide diverse ecosystem services: they create habitats, provide hydrological control, and regulate biogeochemical cycles of flora and fauna through interaction with surrounding wetlands. These services vary temporally, depending primarily on hydro-climatic conditions and the type of wetland. To better understand the functions of wetlands, it is necessary to analyze the effect of stochastic hydro-climatic conditions on the dynamics of wetland surface area and the resulting dispersal of species. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of the connectivity and efficiency of ecological networks according to (1) the characteristics of the wetland area distribution, which varies by season, and (2) dispersal models (threshold distance, exponential kernel, and heavy-tailed movement). The results indicate that hydrologically sensitive small wetlands were often the primary elements that characterize wetland area distribution. Consequently, during dry seasons, the corresponding ecological network topology, measured by mean degree, network efficiency, and clustering coefficient decreased in all dispersal models we tested. We also found that while the correlation of hubs between dispersal models was strong, the levels of network vulnerability, evaluated by removing those hubs, were different, with the heavy-tailed model showing the highest vulnerability. Moreover, we observed the possibility of regime shift in ecological networks when a chronic, high dryness induced significant reduction of large wetlands. Our network modeling approach based on hydrologic systems will provide a new decision-making process and perspectives for conservation and restoration planning including the conditions regarding climate change.

AB  - The Hyrcanian forest in northern Iran is threatened by human use and encroachment and has suffered degradation in some areas. The forest has been declared a World Heritage Site and management in the region is shifting from timber production to conservation. There is considerable interest in developing a greater understanding of these diverse forest communities to inform forest management and multiple use plans to maintain the diversity and resilience of these forests. The Hyrcanian forest is characterized by a complex topography of catenas ranging up mountain slopes. Topographic gradients greatly influence microhabitat conditions which in turn impact tree distribution. To date there has been limited research on the impacts of this diverse topography on the spatial distribution of tree species and tree diameters in Hyrcanian forests. Such information is necessary to better understand the regional traits of tree diameters in these natural mixed temperate forests before forest management occurs. We examined the influence of the area's catena topography on the spatial pattern of tree species and on species stand structure in terms of tree diameter distribution. To quantify these dynamics, we conducted a complete enumeration inventory of all trees with dbh >12 cm within a 7.947 ha study area that included three C-shaped (concave) and three V-shaped (convex) catenas. Geostatistical variogram analysis and Clark and Evans aggregation index were utilized to study the spatial distribution of tree diameters. Beech, alder, hornbeam, linden and Persian maple exhibited clustered patterns, and sour cherry, ash, and oak exhibited random patterns. Geostatistical analysis clearly revealed the substantial influence of catena topography on the diameter distributions of alder and linden, more subtle influence on the diameter distributions of beech, and a possible influence on Persian maple, providing valuable insight into stand structure over neighborhood-based indices alone. Alder and linden both exhibited strong spatial structure in their diameter distributions (56% and 86%, respectively) where their diameter was strongly correlated with trees within 108 m and 83 m, respectively, sharing more similar diameters to each other than trees beyond that distance. Beech, maple, and hornbeam exhibited very weak if any spatial structure over short distances. These findings can be used to support the alignment of forest management practices in managed Hyrcanian forests with goals of protecting and maintaining biodiversity and sustainable forest ecosystems, and to inform geospatial modeling of species diameter distributions in areas where a complete stem-map is not feasible.

AB  - Nearshore areas represent important habitats for many species, at least for part of their life cycle. Therefore, modeling and mapping nearshore habitats is essential for natural resource management and conservation, such as determining potential impacts to marine populations and their habitats from human activities and identifying conservation measures. Although fish survey and habitat data are uncommon for nearshore areas, two regional databases, the Nearshore Fish Atlas of Alaska (NFA) and ShoreZone, provide a rare opportunity to evaluate nearshore habitats for Alaska's shallow, nearshore fish assemblages. In the present study, we used the NFA and ShoreZone databases in a practical approach to model and map Alaska nearshore fish habitats. Specifically, we fitted generalized additive models (GAMs) to NFA and ShoreZone data to map the spatial patterns of probability of encounter and density of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) early juveniles in the northern southeastern Alaska (NSEA) area and walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) early juveniles in Prince William Sound (PWS). The density of Pacific cod early juveniles was found to be high in all of the western part of the NSEA area, particularly around Port Alexander. The density hotspots of walleye pollock early juveniles were found to be located in the northern and southernmost parts of PWS. Data inventories and modeling and mapping Alaska nearshore fish habitats provide valuable information to manage marine resources and human activities (e.g., to identify the main nursery areas of commercially important species along the Alaska coastline), and allow for other important ecological and ecosystem issues to be addressed (e.g., producing marine protected area planning scenarios to protect forage fishes used by large marine predators). The NFA and ShoreZone are valuable resources, and our efforts to leverage them to model and map nearshore fish habitats establishes a reference for similar efforts throughout Alaska's regions and beyond.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) provide realistic scenarios to explain the influence of bioclimatic variables on plant pathogen distribution. Diplodia sapinea is most harmful to plantations of both exotic and native pine species in Italy, causing economic consequences expecially to edible seed production. In this study, we developed maximum entropy models for D. sapinea in Italy to reach the following goals: (i) to carry out the pathogen's first geographical distribution analysis in Italy and determine which eco-geographical variables (EGVs) may influence its outbreaks; (ii) to detect the effect of climate change on the potential occurrence of disease outbreaks by 2050 and 2070. We used Maxent ver. 3.4.0 to develop SDMs. We used six global climate models (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, GISS-E2-R, MIR005, HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-LR) for two representative concentration pathways (4.5 and 8.5) and two time projections (2050 and 2070) to detect future climate projections of D. sapinea. The most important EGVs influencing outbreaks were land cover, altitude, mean temperature of driest and wettest quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter, precipitation seasonality and minimum temperature of coldest month. The distribution of D. sapinea mostly expanded in central and southern Italy and shifted in altitude upwards on average by ca. 93m a.s.l. Moreover the fungus expanded the range where disease outbreaks may be recorded in response to an increase in the mean temperature of wettest and driest quarter by ca. 1.9 degrees C and 5.8 degrees C, respectively in all climate change scenarios. Precipitation of wettest quarter did not differ between current and any of future models. Under different climate change scenarios D. sapinea's disease outbreaks will be likely to affect larger areas of pine forests in the country, probably causing heavy effects on the dynamics and evolution of these stands or perhaps constraining their survival.

AB  - With more people living in urban areas, cities are playing an increasingly important role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining the connection between people and nature. Yet, in order for conservation efforts in urban areas to be effective, information on how to sustain native species in these areas is needed. Few studies have attempted to collect long-term monitoring data on bird populations in urban areas, perhaps due to the high investment in time and manpower required. The Tucson Bird Count (TBC) is a program based on repeated, systematic volunteer bird surveys that represents a novel approach to collecting city-wide data and monitoring urban birds. Since the TBC's inception in 2001, volunteers have successfully monitored birds at approximately 1,000 sites throughout the Tucson, Arizona, metropolitan area. Data collected through the TBC have already been used in research studies, planning strategies, and to inform local conservation initiatives. Here we explore how TBC data can be used to assess relationships between species distribution and habitat features, focusing in particular on Abert's Towhee (Pipilo aberti). In addition, we compare the two TBC programs, an annual citywide survey and a quarterly survey of specific sites of birding interest. This comparison highlights the importance of isolated habitat islands to the persistence of some species in urban Tucson. We review results from the TBC and the local Christmas Bird Count, finding both considerable overlap between the two counts and unique information contributed by each program to our understanding of the area's avifauna. Finally, we discuss the ability of the TBC to serve as a model for other urban bird monitoring programs and its value in the establishment of a global network of such programs.

AB  - Mugger crocodile is a keystone species of slow flowing fresh water ecosystem. Few studies regarding status and distribution of Vulnerable Mugger have been conducted in Nepal. However, studies on ecology and other aspects of the species are limited. The goal of this study was to determine the Mugger crocodile's population status, habitat occupancy, and conservation threats in the Ghodaghodi lake complex, located in the western lowlands of Nepal. A detailed survey was conducted on 18 lakes of the lake complex in February, 2021. The population status of the Mugger was surveyed by walking along the entire boundary line of each lake. For habitat survey, perimeter of all the lakes of the complex was divided into the number of stations spaced at 500 m intervals. Habitat factors associated with the presence and absence of the Mugger were analyzed using Generalized Linear Model under binary logistic regression and likelihood ratio test was performed to test predictors for statistical significance. During the survey, 26 muggers were recorded. The probability of sighting Mugger in the lake complex was significantly differ by distance to settlement, distance to river, and human disturbances, among the nine habitat variables examined. Similarly, habitat modification and illegal fishing were ranked as most severe threats to Mugger crocodile in the lake complex. The concerned authorities, responsible for managing the lake complex shall pay attention on controlling the major identified threats like habitat modification, illegal fishing, unmanaged infrastructure development, and pollution in the lake complex in order to support future conservation of Vulnerable Mugger population in the area. Furthermore, a detailed and extensive study is suggested to investigate the movement of Muggers between different lakes of the complex as well as from Ghodaghodi lake complex to the nearby rivers during breeding season in order to support effective planning and execution of habitat management activities of this Vulnerable species.

AB  - Remote sensing has made important contributions to biodiversity conservation planning through the measurement of deforestation rates, habitat fragmentation, habitat degradation, and isolation of protected areas in human altered landscapes. Progress in using remote sensing together with field data for the development of robust habitat suitability models has been more modest. In this paper, we present a habitat suitability model developed by relating field data on habitat characteristics and habitat selection of a medium-sized primate (redtail monkey, Cercopithecus ascanius) with a small home range (in contrast to many studies that focus on large-bodied, wide-ranging animals) to satellite-derived data, for predicting animal occurrence. We examined the relative performance of two high-resolution satellite sensors (2.5 m resolution Quickbird and 30 m resolution Landsat ETM+) in capturing patterns of habitat selection by redtail monkeys in Kibale National Park. Overall, our analyses suggest that a model combining data from both the Quickbird and ETM+ sensors predicts monkey presence-absence best, and that, individually, ETM+ data are better predictors than Quickbird data. Moreover, model fit was best at larger scales (ETM+ 120 m, 150 m and 240 m pixels). These results have important implications for future habitat modeling, biodiversity analyses and conservation studies given Landsat's temporal and spatial resolutions, long history of use, relatively well-developed methods for processing and analysis, and relatively low cost in comparison with many higher resolution sensors.

AB  - Natural and human-mediated population structure of European grayling Thymallus thymallus was assessed in primarily Austrian reaches of the Danube River catchment. Data on phylogeographic structure based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were combined with variation found across 13 microsatellite loci to assess introgression stemming from stocking activities. Populations north of the Alps generally showed no signs of long-term introgression from allochthonous stocks, although one population comprised two distinct genotypic groups, one of which may stem from recently stocked material. South of the Alps, levels of introgression with stocks from the north were extensive and only one of six populations is believed to represent a reference state. Allelic diversity and expected heterozygosity were positively correlated with mtDNA admixture supporting more recent introgression and that there is little or no reproductive barrier between these two major lineages north and south of the Alps. A third unrelated mtDNA lineage is described from the Lafnitz, a tributary of the Raab drainage. The high lineage diversity in the upper Austrian Danube is not concordant with an existing model of T. thymallus evolutionarily significant units in Europe. Caveats in naming such units or following a strict hierarchical conservation unit structure for broadly distributed species with complex phylogeographic distributions stretching over various jurisdictions are discussed. The necessity of using both phylogeographic and population genetic approaches in evaluating the history and conservation value of populations in a conservation context is additionally highlighted.

AB  - Low-intensity livestock grazing is a widespread management tool in order to maintain habitat diversity in mountain pasture-woodlands for nature conservation purposes. Historical photographs indicate that forest disturbance significantly contributed to forest-grassland mosaic pattern formation. Disturbance grazer interactions are however poorly understood and the effects of logging or windthrow are rarely considered in management plans. Moreover, disturbance-grazer interactions are crucial for the maintenance of open habitats in the upcoming "rewilding" approach of nature conservation.
   We aimed to understand the effects of forest gap creation by the breakdown of senile trees or by single-tree cutting and of large forest openings by windthrow or logging on mosaic pattern formation in pasture-woodlands that were grazed by cattle and dominated by tree species with distinct regeneration ecology (Picea abies vs. Fagus sylvatica).
   We used the process-based model of pasture-woodland vegetation dynamics WoodPaM and newly implemented a forest disturbance routine. We simulated disturbance and grazing scenarios in an artificial mountain landscape and analyzed mosaic patterns with landscape metrics.
   We found that grazing in absence of disturbance promoted simply structured mosaics that were preconditioned by topography. Only large-scale forest disturbance disrupted this pattern and maintained the historical heterogeneous distribution of grassland communities across all habitat conditions (especially species-rich mountain grasslands on poor soil). This prerequisite is stronger in pasture-woodlands where the ecology of the dominant tree species promotes forest-grassland segregation (F. sylvatica in our case) and less in naturally thin-canopy mountain forest close to the tree line (P. abies). In wilderness areas, the very low density of grazers may limit the maintenance of open habitats regardless disturbance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Patagonian Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem supports high levels of biodiversity and endemism and is one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world. Despite the important role marine predators play in structuring the ecosystems, areas of high diversity where multiple predators congregate remains poorly known on the Patagonian Shelf. Here, we used biotelemetry and biologging tags to track the movements of six seabird species and three pinniped species breeding at the Falkland Islands. Using Generalized Additive Models, we then modelled these animals' use of space as functions of dynamic and static environmental indices that described their habitat. Based on these models, we mapped the predicted distribution of animals from both sampled and unsampled colonies and thereby identified areas where multiple species were likely to overlap at sea. Maximum foraging trip distance ranged from 79 to 1,325 km. However, most of the 1,891 foraging trips by 686 animals were restricted to the Patagonian Shelf and shelf slope, which highlighted a preference for these habitats. Of the seven candidate explanatory covariates used to predict distribution, distance from the colony was retained in models for all species and negatively affected the probability of occurrence. Predicted overlap among species was highest on the Patagonian Shelf around the Falkland Islands and the Burdwood Bank. The predicted area of overlap is consistent with areas that are also important habitat for marine predators migrating from distant breeding locations. Our findings provide comprehensive multi-species predictions for some of the largest marine predator populations on the Patagonian Shelf, which will contribute to future marine spatial planning initiatives. Crucially, our findings highlight that spatially explicit conservation measures are likely to benefit multiple species, while threats are likely to impact multiple species.

AB  - Research Highlights: Rare, or sparsely distributed, species drive the floristic diversity of upland, terra firme and seasonally flooded forests in the central Jurua-a remote and hitherto floristically poorly known area in the Brazilian Amazon. Background and Objectives: Floristic inventories are critical for modelling and understanding the role of Amazonian forests in climate regulation, for sustainable management of forest resources and efficient conservation planning. Yet, detailed information about the often complex spatial distributions of many Amazonian woody plants is limited. Here, we provide information about forest structure and species composition from a remote terra firme forest and an adjacent floodplain forest in the western Brazilian Amazon. More specifically, we ask (1) how floristically different are the terra firme and floodplain forests? and (2) how variable is species composition within the same forest type? Materials and Methods: Between September 2016 and October 2017, we inventoried 97 plots (each 0.1 ha; 100 x 10 m) placed at least 800 m apart, with 46 plots in terra firme forest and 51 in seasonally flooded forest. We included all trees, hemi-epiphytes and palms with diameter at breast height (dbh) > 10 cm and woody lianas > 5 cm dbh. We examine forest structure, family- and species-level floristic composition and species diversity within and between forest types using family and species importance values, rarefaction curves and dissimilarity matrices. Results: Terra firme forest and seasonally flooded forest woody plant communities differ both in structure and species composition, which was highly variable within forest types. Many species were shared between terra firme and seasonally flooded forests, but most species were forest type-specific. Whereas species richness was greatest in the terra firme forest, floodplain species richness was among the highest regionally.

AB  - The loss of species diversity due to habitat fragmentation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the impacts of habitat fragmentation on functional diversity remains relatively poorly understood. We conducted bird functional diversity studies on a set of 41 recently isolated land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We analysed differences in bird species richness and a recently developed suite of complementary functional diversity indices (FRic, volume of functional space occupied; FEve, evenness of abundance distribution in the functional trait space; FDiv, divergence in the distribution of abundance in the trait volume) across different gradients (island area and isolation). We found no correlations between FRic and FEve or FEve and FDiv, but negative correlations between FRic and FDiv. As predicted, island area accounted for most of the variation in bird species richness, whereas isolation explained most of the variation in species evenness (decreasing species evenness with increasing isolation). Functional diversity appears to be more strongly influenced by habitat filtering as opposed to limiting similarity. More specifically, across all islands, both FRic and FEve were significantly lower than expected for randomly assembled communities, but FDiv showed no clear patterns. FRic increased with island area, FEve decreased with island area and FDiv showed no clear patterns. Our finding that FEve decreases with island area at TIL may indicate low functional stability on such islands, and as such large islands and habitat patches may deserve extra attention and/or protection. These results help to demonstrate the importance of considering the effects of fragmentation on functional diversity in habitat management and reserve design plans.

AB  - Climate change may impose extreme conditions which potentially affect species' distributions, leading to spatio-temporal variation in biodiversity and ecosystem services patterns. Here we compared current climate conditions to future climate scenarios projected to 2050 to assess potential changes in the spatio-temporal patterns of the taxonomic and functional diversities of the woody species of the Restinga vegetation in Brazil. We generated Ecological Niche Models (ENM) for 796 woody plant species from which we estimated the spatio-temporal changes of beta diversity components, the community-weighted means (CWM) of selected traits and functional diversity indices. The pessimistic scenario indicated an overall threefold increase in woody plant species loss compared to the optimistic scenario, whereas at regional scales, species loss may reach percentages as high as 19%. Conversely, beta diversity may increase in the future, in which the turnover component had a greater contribution than nestedness. The CWM projection emphasized contrasts among traits and ecoregions, with an increase in most analysed traits (stem wood density, seed length and fruit length) and a decrease in one of them (maximum plant height). Functional divergence and richness may decrease in future, while functional evenness may increase. Our study highlighted important potential changes in the distribution of biodiversity that could lead to biotic homogenization in the Restinga vegetation and calls for the inclusion of this marginalized vegetation in plans for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.

AB  - Measurements of primary productivity and its heterogeneity based on satellite images can provide useful estimates of species richness and distribution patterns. However, species richness at a given site may depend not only on local habitat quality and productivity but also on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. In this study we investigated whether the predictions of species richness of plant families in northern boreal landscape in Finland can be improved by incorporating greenness information from the surrounding landscape, as derived from remotely sensed data (mean, maximum, standard deviation and range values of NDVI derived from Landsat ETM), into local greenness models. Using plant species richness data of 28 plant families from 440 grid cells of 25 ha in size, generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted into three different sets of explanatory variables: (1) local greenness only, (2) landscape greenness only, and (3) combined local and landscape greenness. The derived richness-greenness relationships were mainly unimodal or positively increasing but varied between different plant families, and depended also on whether greenness was measured as mean or maximum greenness. Incorporation of landscape level greenness variables improved significantly both the explanatory power and cross-validation statistics of the models including only local greenness variables. Landscape greenness information derived from remote sensing data integrated with local information has thus the potentiality to improve predictive assessments of species richness over extensive and inaccessible areas, especially in high-latitude landscapes. Overall, the significant relationship between plants and surrounding landscape quality detected here suggests that landscape factors should be considered in preserving species richness of boreal environments, as well as in conservation planning for biodiversity in other environments.

AB  - Noise is a globally pervasive pollutant that can be detrimental to a range of animal species, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. As a result, concern about the impacts and expanding footprint of anthropogenic noise is increasing along with interest in approaches for how to mitigate its negative effects. A variety of modeling tools have been developed to quantify the spatial distribution and intensity of noise across landscapes, but these tools are under-utilized in landscape planning and noise mitigation. Here, we apply the Sound Mapping Tools toolbox to evaluate mitigation approaches to reduce the anthropogenic noise footprint of gas development, summer all-terrain vehicle recreation, and winter snowmobile use. Sound Mapping Tools uses models of the physics of noise propagation to convert measured source levels to landscape predictions of relevant sound levels. We found that relatively minor changes to the location of noise-producing activities could dramatically reduce the extent and intensity of noise in focal areas, indicating that site planning can be a cost-effective approach to noise mitigation. In addition, our snowmobile results, which focus on a specific frequency band important to the focal species, are consistent with previous research demonstrating that source noise level reductions are an effective means to reduce noise footprints. We recommend the use of quantitative, spatially-explicit maps of expected noise levels that include alternative options for noise source placement. These maps can be used to guide management decisions, allow for species-specific insights, and to reduce noise impacts on animals and ecosystems.

AB  - Livestock are a major human-induced threat to wildlife worldwide, especially in forest landscapes where livestock degrade the food and habitat of forest-dwelling wildlife. However, few empirical studies on this topic have been conducted at fine spatiotemporal scales that are crucial for wildlife-livestock interactions, in particular those involving multiple sympatric wildlife species under policy changes. Here, we demonstrate wildlife-livestock interactions through examining the interactions of several sympatric, threatened wildlife species with livestock in Wolong Nature Reserve, China, using data collected from infrared camera traps, DNA analysis of panda fecal samples and panda distribution predictive modeling along with habitat predictors. Camera trapping revealed an increase in livestock after the government implemented an incentive policy to encourage livestock production midway through the study. Three species (giant panda, red panda, and golden snub-nosed monkey) were displaced as more livestock encroached on forest habitat. In contrast, the detection rate of sambar deer was not affected by livestock encroachment, but sambar shifted the timing of visiting water sources (streams) to dusk (when livestock disturbance and other human activities were lower). The number of giant pandas detected via DNA testing of feces was relatively stable, but panda distribution modeling showed that pandas occurred across a wider area after disturbance. Our research shows that with increased livestock, different wildlife species may respond in different ways, which is likely associated with their biological traits (e.g., life history strategy and diet). Our study underscores the need for careful livestock policy making and planning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The predictive modeling of plant species distribution has wide applications in vegetation studies. This study attempts to assess three modeling approaches to predict the plant distribution in the dry (precipitation 128-275 mm) mountainous (altitude 1129-2260 m a.s.l.) scrub vegetation on the example of the rangelands of northeastern Semnan, Iran. The vegetation of the study area belongs to the communities of Artemisia, Astralagus, Eurotia and other scrub species. The main objective of this study is to compare the predictive ability of three habitat models, and to find the most effective environmental factors for predicting the plant species occurrence. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), Logistic Regression (LR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were chosen to model the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation communities. Plant density and cover, soil texture, available moisture, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter, lime, gravel and gypsum contents and topography (elevation, slope and aspect) are those variables that have been sampled using the randomized systematic method. Within each vegetation type, the samples were collected using 15 quadrates placed at an interval of 50 m along three 750 m transects. As a necessary step, the maps of all factors affecting the predictive capability of the models were generated. The results showed that the predictive models using the LR and ANN methods are more suitable to predict the distribution of individual species. In opposite, the CCA method is more suitable to predict the distribution of the all studied species together. Using the finalized models, maps of individual species (for different species) or for all the species were generated in the GIS environment. To evaluate the predictive ability of the models, the accuracy of the predicted maps was compared against real-world vegetation maps using the Kappa statistic. The Kappa (kappa) statistic was also used to evaluate the adequacy of vegetation mapping. The comparison between the vegetation cover of a map generated using the CCA application and its corresponding actual map showed a good agreement (i.e. kappa = 0.58). The results also revealed that maps generated using the LR and ANN models for Astragalus spp., Halocnemum strobilaceum, Zygophyllum eurypterum and Seidlitzia rosmarinus species have a high accordance with their corresponding actual maps of the study area. Due to the high level of adaptability of Artemisia sieberi, allowing this specie to grow in most parts of the study area with relatively different habitat conditions, a predictive model for this species could not be fixed. In such cases, a set of predictive models may be used to formulate the environment-vegetation relationship. Finally, the predictive ability of the LR and ANN models for mapping Astragalus spp. was determined as kappa = 0.86 and kappa = 0.91 respectively, implying a very good agreement between predictions and observations.
   It is concluded that the combination of modelling of the local species distribution constitutes a promising future research area, which has the potentiality to enhance assessments and conservation planning of vegetation (like rangelands) based on predictive species models.

AB  - Amphibian populations are declining globally. In this scenario, detailed information on their ecology is crucial to determine the status and extinction risk of their populations and, therefore, better plan conservation activities. The Valcheta frog Pleurodema somuncurense is a Critically Endangered species, which is endemic to the Valcheta Stream, Patagonia, Argentina. We assessed the status of this species at the metapopulation level, which we consider is a key step in planning management activities. We conducted visual encounter surveys from 2013 to 2019 to determine the distribution range of each local population of the Valcheta frog. During 2015, we also applied a capture-recapture survey to estimate the density and apparent survival of 1 local population. We used POPAN models for density estimation and the classic model of Cormack-Jolly-Seber to estimate apparent survival, using snout-vent length as a covariate. The metapopulation of the Valcheta frog is composed of 9 isolated local populations: 7 extant and 2 extinct. The extant populations have population sizes ranging from 243 to 4516 individuals. The small size of the smaller local populations makes their long-term viability in isolation unlikely. We found a positive correlation between the apparent survival and the snout-vent length of individuals. Our results showed that management strategies should be aimed at ensuring the long-term survival of this species, with a focus on the recovery of extinct populations, the restoration of disturbed habitats and the improvement of connectivity between local populations.

AB  - Overlap between wildlife living spaces and human activity spaces represents one of the main causes of human-wildlife conflict. It is therefore necessary to identify and adjust the spatial distribution of conflicts because climate change will modify the ranges and locations of species. The MaxEnt model was used to simulate the distribution of wildlife living spaces under current and future climatic conditions (RCP4.5 scenario) based on species distribution data and environmental data from the Three-River Source Region. Furthermore, the logistic-cellular automata model was used to simulate the changes in human activity spaces (construction land and arable land) by 2050. Areas of overlap between wildlife living spaces and human activity spaces were determined by overlay analysis. Then, the areas of construction and arable land that would conflict with wildlife were redistributed outside highly suitable wildlife living spaces. In addition, ecological corridors connecting current and future living spaces were planned for the migration of certain species in response to climate change based on the minimum cumulative resistance model. The results showed that the areas of highly suitable wildlife living spaces will decrease under the influence of climate change if global warming occurs. In the future, the area of overlap between highly suitable wildlife living spaces and construction land will be 125 km(2), and that between highly suitable wildlife living spaces and arable land will be 340 km(2). The redistribution of these areas will cause human activity spaces to become more concentrated. Moreover, 110 ecological corridors should be constructed across roads in the Three-River Source Region.

AB  - Plant invasion has been widely recognized as an agent of global change that has the potential to have severe impacts under climate change. The challenges posed by invasive alien plant species (IAPS) on biodiversity and ecosystem stability is growing and not adequately studied, especially in developing countries. Defining climate suitability for multiple invasive plants establishment is important for early and strategic interventions to control and manage plant invasions. We modeled priority IAPS in Sri Lanka to identify the areas of greatest climatic suitability for their establishment and observed how these areas could be altered under projected climate change. We used Maximum Entropy method to model 14 nationally significant IAPS under representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5 for 2050 and 2070. The combined climate suitability map produced by summing up climatic suitability of 14 IAPS was further classified into five classes in ArcMap as very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. South and west parts of Sri Lanka are projected to have potentially higher climatic suitability for a larger number of IAPS. We observed suitable area changes (gains and losses) in all five classes of which two were significant enough to make an overall negative impact i.e., (i) contraction of the very low class and (ii) expansion of the moderate class. Both these changes trigger the potential risk from IAPS in Sri Lanka in the future.

AB  - Invasive plants are a concern in many forest ecosystems because they can impact tree regeneration and recruitment, alter hydrology, and degrade wildlife habitats. Management efforts are generally planned locally, based on the severity of the infestation, species involved, and characteristics of the forest stand. A broad, landscape-level context can provide additional information and help with planning efforts but is often lacking. In this study, we estimated landscape-level priorities for the management of five invasive forest plants in Minnesota. We used a multi-criteria decision analysis approach to integrate plant distribution models and data with geographic information about areas of conservation concern, recreational areas, and the economic benefits of treatment. The results varied across Ecological Classification System provinces and Minnesota native plant community classes. Four of the five invasive plants considered demonstrated an abundance of Medium- and High-priority areas for management in the Eastern Broadleaf Forest province of Minnesota. The average priority was generally lower in the Prairie Parklands and Tallgrass Aspen Parklands provinces, with Rhamnus cathartica as the only species demonstrating Medium or higher priorities in the latter. The mean priorities were Medium or higher for R. cathartica and Frangula alnus in mesic hardwood community types across the state, in addition to several fire-dependent systems. The priority distribution was most limited for Rosa multiflora, where the only Medium or higher priority results were found in a mesic hardwood system in the southeastern corner of the state. The results presented here highlight broad-scale patterns that can provide a synoptic overview of invasive plant priorities at the landscape scale.

AB  - Empirical and theoretical studies suggest that marine species respond to ocean warming by shifting ranges poleward and/or into deeper depths. However, future distributional patterns of deep-sea organisms, which comprise the largest ecosystem of Earth, remain poorly known. We explore potential horizontal range shifts of benthic shallow-water and deep-sea Crustacea due to climatic changes within the remainder of the century, and discuss the results in light of species-specific traits related to invasiveness. Using a maximum entropy approach, we estimated the direction and magnitude of distributional shifts for 94 species belonging to 12 orders of benthic marine crustaceans, projected to the years 2050 and 2100. Distance, direction, and species richness shifts between climate zones were estimated conservatively, by considering only areas suitable, non-extrapolative, and adjacent to the currently known distributions. Our hypothesis is that species will present poleward range-shifts, based on results of previous studies. Results reveal idiosyncratic and species-specific responses, with prevailing poleward shifts and a decline of species richness at mid-latitudes, while more frequent shifts between temperate to polar regions were recovered. Shallow-water species are expected to shift longer distances than deep-sea species. Net gain of suitability is slightly higher than the net loss for shallow-water species, while for deep-sea species, the net loss is higher than the gain in all scenarios. Our estimates can be viewed as a set of hypotheses for future analytical and empirical studies, and will be useful in planning and executing strategic interventions and developing conservation strategies.

AB  - Background Pleistocene climate fluctuations have strongly modified species genetic diversity and distributions. The Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) has been recognized as a critically endangered animal due to heavy poaching and trafficking. However, the effect of Pleistocene climate fluctuations on the genetic diversity and spatial distribution of the Chinese pangolin remains largely unknown. Here, we combined whole genome sequencing data, analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes, and a large amount of occurrence data from field surveys to infer the ancestral demographic history and predict the past spatial dynamics of the Chinese pangolin in Guangdong Province, China. Results Our results indicated that there were two subpopulations, which showed similar trends of population size change in response to past climatic changes. We estimated a peak effective population size (N-e) during the last interglacial (LIG), followed by a marked decrease (similar to 0.5 to fivefold change) until the last glacial maximum (LGM) and a rebound to a small peak population size during the Mid-Holocene (MH). The estimated time of the separation event between two subpopulations was approximately 3,000-2,500 years ago (ka). We estimated that the distribution of suitable areas shrank by 14.4% from the LIG to LGM, followed by an expansion of 31.4% from the LGM to MH and has been stable since then. In addition, we identified an elevational shift and suitable area decreased significantly during the LGM, but that the geographic extent of suitable areas in the western region increased from the LIG to present. The eastern region of Guangdong Province had the highest habitat suitability across all the climate scenarios. Conclusions Our results suggested that Pleistocene climate fluctuations played an important role in shaping patterns of genetic diversity and spatial distribution, and that human stressors likely contributed to the recent divergence of two Chinese pangolin subpopulations sampled here. We argue that a key protected area should be established in the eastern region of Guangdong Province. As such, this study provides a more thorough understanding of the impacts of Pleistocene climate fluctuations impacts on a mammalian species in southern China and suggests more robust management and conservation plans for this Critically Endangered species of special interest.

AB  - Questions: The objectives of this study were to clarify the extent to which environmental factors and geographical distance account for tropical floristic composition, and propose a methodology for delimiting the boundaries of floristic types based on species similarity.
   Location: The Panama Canal watershed.
   Methods: To assess which factors (climate, topography, geology and geographical distance) account for floristic composition, we performed Mantel tests on distance matrices and partitioned variation in species composition using canonical analysis. We used a permutation-based regression model computed on distance matrices and a hierarchical clustering of the tree composition to construct a predictive map of forest types of the Panama Canal Watershed.
   Results: We found that spatial variation alone explained 22-27% of species variation, while the fraction of species variation explained by environmental variables was smaller (10-12%); 13-19% of the variation was accounted for by the joint effect of environmental variation and geographic distance. The similarity-based map emphasizes the principal division in tree flora between the drier Pacific side and the wetter Caribbean slopes.
   Conclusions: The distribution of Panamanian tree species appears to be primarily determined by dispersal limitation, then by environmental heterogeneity. 'Environmental segregation' processes do play an important role. Maps of broad-scale vegetation patterns based on thorough tree inventories can be used in conservation planning in the tropics.

AB  - It has been widely argued that habitat fragmentation is bad for (meta)population persistence and that a high level of fragmentation is a similarly undesirable characteristic for a reserve network. However, modelling the effects of fragmentation for many species is very difficult due to high data demands and uncertainty concerning its effect on particular species. Hence, several reserve selection methods employ qualitative heuristics such as boundary length penalties that aggregate reserve network structures. This aggregation usually comes at a cost because low quality habitats will be included for the sake of increased connectivity. Here a biologically justified method for designing aggregated reserve networks based on a technique called distribution smoothing is investigated. As with the boundary length penalty, its use incurs an apparent biological cost. However, taking a step further, potential negative effects of fragmentation on individual species are evaluated using a decision-theoretic uncertainty analysis approach. This analysis shows that the aggregated reserve network (based on smoothed distributions) is likely to be biologically more valuable than a more fragmented one (based on habitat model predictions). The method is illustrated with a reserve design case study in the Hunter Valley of south-eastern Australia. The uncertainty analysis method, based on information-gap decision theory, provides a systematic framework for making robust decisions under severe uncertainty, making it particularly well adapted to reserve design problems.

AB  - Changes in climate projected for the 21st century are expected to trigger widespread and pervasive biotic impacts. Forecasting these changes and their implications for ecosystem services is a major research goal. Much of the research on biotic responses to climate change has focused on either projected shifts in individual species distributions or changes in biome distributions. Here, we introduce a novel application of multinomial logistic regression as a powerful approach to model vegetation distributions and potential responses to 21st century climate change. We modeled the distribution of 22 major vegetation types, most defined by a single dominant woody species, across the San Francisco Bay Area. Predictor variables included climate and topographic variables. The novel aspect of our model is the output: a vector of relative probabilities for each vegetation type in each location within the study domain. The model was then projected for 54 future climate scenarios, spanning a representative range of temperature and precipitation projections from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles. We found that sensitivity of vegetation to climate change is highly heterogeneous across the region. Surprisingly, sensitivity to climate change is higher closer to the coast, on lower insolation, north-facing slopes and in areas of higher precipitation. While such sites may provide refugia for mesic and cool-adapted vegetation in the face of a warming climate, the model suggests they will still be highly dynamic and relatively sensitive to climate-driven vegetation transitions. The greater sensitivity of moist and low insolation sites is an unexpected outcome that challenges views on the location and stability of climate refugia. Projections provide a foundation for conservation planning and land management, and highlight the need for a greater understanding of the mechanisms and time scales of potential climate-driven vegetation transitions.

AB  - Modeling of the spatial distribution of tree species based on survey data has recently been applied to conservation planning. Numerous methods have been developed for building species habitat suitability models. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of Pleiades satellite data for modeling tree species diversity of Hyrcanian forests in northern Iran (Mazandaran Province). One-hundred sample plots were established over an area of 2,600 ha and surveyed for tree diversity, and the Simpson's index (D), Shannon's index (H') and the reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D) were calculated for each plot. Spectral variables and several parameters derived by texture analysis were obtained from multispectral images of the study area and used as predictors of tree diversity of sample plots. Two different methods, including generalized additive models (GAMs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), were used for modeling. The results revealed a fairly good prediction of plot tree diversity obtained using the developed models (adj-R-2 = 0.542-0.731). Shannon's H' and Simpson's 1/D indices were more accurately predicted using GAM-based methods, while MARS models were more suitable for predicting Simpson's D. We concluded that Pleiades satellite data can be conveniently used for estimating, assessing and monitoring tree species diversity in the mixed hardwood Hyrcanian forest of northern Iran.

AB  - Question Forest ecosystems are the most important global repositories of terrestrial biodiversity. The mixed temperate forests in northeastern China constitute one of the most biodiverse temperate regions globally and provide nearly one-third of China's wood supply. We ask what are the spatial patterns and potential drivers of tree species diversity in mixed temperate forests.
   Location Temperate, mixed forests of northeastern China.
   Methods Using a large set of ground-source forest inventory data (FIN) and geospatial covariates derived from published raster layers, we compared different machine-learning and statistical models to study spatial patterns of tree species diversity and their underpinning drivers.
   Results The spatial distribution of tree species diversity (species richness and evenness) varied greatly across northeastern China. Tree species diversity varied most with climatic (annual precipitation and annual mean temperature), topographic (elevation and slope), and anthropogenic factors. Anthropogenic factors affected tree species evenness (importance value = 13%) more than tree species richness (importance value = 9%). Based on these relationships, we mapped spatial patterns of tree diversity throughout the region at a 1 km x 1 km resolution.
   Conclusions Our findings shed light on the processes behind community assembly and biodiversity patterns in mixed temperate forests in northeastern China, and provide a benchmark for future assessment of biodiversity. Our high-resolution tree species diversity maps can be useful to landowners and land management agencies in their decision-making processes about sustainable forest management, biodiversity conservation, and forest restoration - a priority task outlined by the recently implemented 2050 China National Forest Management Plan.

AB  - The fisher is warranted for protection under the Endangered Species Act in the western United States and, as such, it is especially important that conservation and management actions are based on sound scientific information. We developed a landscape-scale suitability model for interior northern California to predict the probability of detecting fishers and to identify areas of important fisher habitat. Previous models have been extrapolated to this region, but our model was developed from the results of strategically planned detection surveys within the study area. We used generalized additive modeling to create a model that best distinguished detection (n = 55) from non-detection (n = 90) locations on the basis of environmental covariates. Four models were averaged to create a final model including the following variables: Amount of Dense Forest, Percent Hardwood, Medium & Large Trees, Structurally Complex Forest, Adjusted Elevation, Insolation Index and Predicted Abundance of Mammalian Prey. This model was well calibrated and correctly classified fisher detections 83.6% of the time and absences (non-detections) 70.0%. Independent test data were classified less well; 76.2% and 53.0%, respectively, perhaps a result of differences in the spatial and temporal characteristics of the data used to build versus test the model. The model is the first comprehensive portrayal of the distribution and configuration of habitat suitability in this region and provides managers a tool to monitor habitat change over time and to plan vegetation treatments. It also represents an example for the development of similar models for dispersal-limited mammals with large area needs, as well as other species associated with late-successional forests in northern California.

AB  - Aim Maintaining connectivity is critical for long-term persistence of wild carnivores in landscapes fragmented due to anthropogenic activity. We examined spatial genetic structure and the impact of landscape features on genetic structure in four widespread species-jungle cat (Felis chaus), leopard (Panthera pardus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) and tiger (Panthera tigris). Location Our study was carried out in the central Indian landscape, a stronghold in terms of distribution and abundance of large mammals. The landscape comprises fragmented forests embedded in a heterogeneous matrix of multiple land use types. Methods Microsatellite data from non-invasively sampled individuals (90 jungle cats, 82 leopards, 104 sloth bears and 117 tigers) were used to investigate genetic differentiation. Impact of landscape features on genetic structure was inferred using a multimodel landscape resistance optimization approach. Results All four study species revealed significant isolation by distance (IBD). The correlation between genetic and geographic distance was significant only over a short distance for jungle cat, followed by longer distances for sloth bear, leopard and tiger. Overall, human footprint had a high negative impact on gene flow in tigers, followed by leopards, sloth bears and the least on jungle cats. Individual landscape variables-land use, human population density, density of linear features and roads-impacted the study species differently. Although land use was found to be an important variable explaining genetic structure for all four species, the amount of variation explained, and the optimum spatial resolution and the resistance values of different land use classes varied. Main conclusions As expected from theory, but rarely demonstrated using empirical data, the pattern of spatial autocorrelation of genetic variation scaled with dispersal ability and density of the study species. Landscape genetic analyses revealed species-specific impact of landscape features and provided insights into interactions between species biology and landscape structure. Our results emphasize the need for incorporating functional connectivity data from multiple species for landscape-level conservation planning.

AB  - Though one of the most vulnerable terrestrial ecosystems, wetlands provide multiple ecosystem services, most notably storing carbon. It is now widely recognized that climate change could have a large impact on high-latitude wetlands. A key question is how climate change will affect the distribution pattern of wetland plant communities, and to what extent the transitions among different wetland plant communities respond to regional warming? To answer this question, we estimated the total SOC storage with 139 soil profiles in the Xing'anling Mountains and performed ensemble species distribution modelling for 11 dominant wetland plant communities by using numerous vegetation plots. Results show that 4.5-23.8% of the high-latitude wetlands in the study area would be lost following widespread thawing of permafrost under different climate warming scenarios by the end of this century. The total wetland SOC in the Xing'anling Mountains is estimated to be 1.58 Pg, about 25.5-29.3% of the total of China's wetlands, however, predicted wetland loss could put 5.4-20.5% (0.08-0.32 Pg C) of the total SOC storage at risk of instability. Our results also predicted a significant northward migration of southern Deyeuxia angustifolia communities driven by future climate changes. This wetland succession could profoundly reduce future carbon sequestration capacity of wetlands in the study area. The findings presented here are helpful for both current reserve management and future conservation planning of wetlands in the study area.

AB  - 1. Expert opinion is frequently called upon by natural resource and conservation professionals to aid decision making. Where species are difficult or expensive to monitor, expert knowledge often serves as the foundation for habitat suitability models and resulting maps. Despite the long history and widespread use of expert-based models, there has been little recognition or assessment of uncertainty in predictions.
   2. Across British Columbia, Canada, expert-based habitat suitability models help guide resource planning and development. We used Monte Carlo simulations to identify the most sensitive parameters in a wildlife habitat ratings model, the precision of ratings for a number of ecosystem units, and variation in the total area of high-quality habitats due to uncertainty in expert opinion.
   3. The greatest uncertainty in habitat ratings resulted from simulations conducted using a uniform distribution and a standard deviation calculated from the range of possible scores for the model attributes. For most ecological units, the mean score, following 1000 simulations, varied considerably from the reported value. When applied across the study area, assumed variation in expert opinion resulted in dramatic decreases in the geographical area of high- (-85%) and moderately high-quality habitats (-68%). The majority of habitat polygons could vary by up to one class (85%) with smaller percentages varying by up to two classes (9%) or retaining their original rank (7%). Our model was based on only four parameters, but no variable consistently accounted for the majority of uncertainty across the study area.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We illustrated the power of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to improve or assess the reliability of predictive species distribution models. Results from our case study suggest that even simple expert-based predictive models can be sensitive to variation in opinion. The magnitude of uncertainty that is tolerable to decision making, however, will vary depending on the application of the model. When presented as error bounds for individual predictions or maps of uncertainty across landscapes, estimates of uncertainty allow managers and conservation professionals to determine if the model and input data reliably support their particular decision-making process.

AB  - Avian species persistence in a forest patch is strongly related to the degree of isolation and size of a forest patch and the vegetation structure within a patch and its matrix are important predictors of bird habitat suitability. A combination of space-borne optical (Landsat), ALOS-PALSAR (radar), and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data was used for assessing variation in forest structure across forest patches that had undergone different levels of forest degradation in a logged forest-agricultural landscape in Southern Laos. The efficacy of different remote sensing (RS) data sources in distinguishing forest patches that had different seizes, configurations, and vegetation structure was examined. These data were found to be sensitive to the varying levels of degradation of the different patch categories. Additionally, the role of local scale forest structure variables (characterized using the different RS data and patch area) and landscape variables (characterized by distance from different forest patches) in influencing habitat preferences of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red listed birds found in the study area was examined. A machine learning algorithm, MaxEnt, was used in conjunction with these data and field collected geographical locations of the avian species to identify the factors influencing habitat preference of the different bird species and their suitable habitats. Results show that distance from different forest patches played a more important role in influencing habitat suitability for the different avian species than local scale factors related to vegetation structure and health. In addition to distance from forest patches, LiDAR-derived forest structure and Landsat-derived spectral variables were important determinants of avian habitat preference. The models derived using MaxEnt were used to create an overall habitat suitability map (HSM) which mapped the most suitable habitat patches for sustaining all the avian species. This work also provides insight that retention of forest patches, including degraded and isolated forest patches in addition to large contiguous forest patches, can facilitate bird species retention within tropical agricultural landscapes. It also demonstrates the effective use of RS data in distinguishing between forests that have undergone varying levels of degradation and identifying the habitat preferences of different bird species. Practical conservation management planning endeavors can use such data for both landscape scale monitoring and habitat mapping.

AB  - Several studies have compared the performances of exact algorithms (integer programming) and heuristic methods in the solution of conservation resource allocation problems, with the conclusion that exact methods are always preferable. Here, I summarize a potentially major deficiency in how the relationship between exact and heuristic methods has been presented: the above comparisons have all been done using relatively simple (linear) maximum coverage or minimum set models that are by definition solvable using integer programming. In contrast, heuristic or meta-heuristic algorithms can be applied to less simplified nonlinear and/or stochastic problems. The focus of this study is two kinds of suboptimality, first-stage suboptimality caused by model simplification and second-stage suboptimality caused by inexact solution. Evidence from comparisons between integer programming and heuristic solution methods suggests a suboptimality level of around 3%-10% for well-chosen heuristics, much depending on the problem and data. There is also largely anecdotal evidence from a few studies that have evaluated results from simplified conservation resource allocation problems using more complicated (nonlinear) models. These studies have found that dropping components such as habitat loss rates or connectivity effects from the model can lead to suboptimality from 5% to 50%. Consequently, I suggest that more attention should be given to two topics, first, how the performance of a conservation plan should be evaluated, and second, what are the consequences of simplifying the ideal conservation resource allocation model? Factors that may lead to relatively complicated problem formulations include connectivity and evaluation of long-term persistence, stochastic habitat loss and availability, species interactions, and distributions that shift due to climate change.

AB  - There is a growing awareness of the need to integrate climate and biodiversity policies. As forests play an important role in mitigating biodiversity loss and climate change, numerous countries have established goals and are managing their forests to achieve them. However, forest management measures and land prioritization may differ depending on the target chosen, leading to conflicts. This research aims to seek optimized national afforestation plans in the Republic of Korea by assessing trade-offs between plant biodiversity persistence and carbon stocks. To this end, afforestation scenarios were spatially established based on the national forest man-agement plans, with a target of 5800 ha expansion by 2022. Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling (GDM) and Global Forest Model (G4M) were applied to the selected afforestable regions to obtain scenarios that maximize biodiversity and carbon, respectively. Furthermore, another afforestation scenario that considers both objectives equally, was proposed using spatial simulated annealing (SSA) optimization algorithm to mitigate trade-offs. The constructed scenarios were compared, both spatially and quantitatively. As a result, the maximization scenarios were found to have few overlapping areas, with both scenarios resulting in ~50% trade-offs. These findings reveal that there is no universal solution and different management strategies are needed to enhance biodiversity persistence and carbon stocks. Thus, to strike a balance among the various goals, forest management requires a compromise solution to minimize trade-offs. Our national-scale assessment can help to guide future planning of national forest management with the consideration of the joint goals of biodiversity and carbon enhancement.

AB  - Spatially explicit models of animal abundance are a critical tool to inform conservation planning and management. However, they require the availability of spatially diffuse environmental predictors of abundance, which may be challenging, especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats. This is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-layered and species-rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots. We developed an approach that calibrates remote-sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used as a predictor of primate density based on published models. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to relate 9.8-ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics extracted from Landsat 8 imagery. We tested the potential of this approach for spatial inference of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus monkey, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors of abundance. The best GLM had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area. Our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements. Results show the potential of using open-access and global remote-sensing data to derive an important predictor of-animal abundance in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density. This approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance of abundance modeling for informing conservation. This is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns of abundance, in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions, such as improving forest protection, may need to be focused on priority areas.

AB  - Aim
   We investigate patterns of phylogenetic diversity in relation to species diversity for European birds, mammals and amphibians to evaluate their congruence and highlight areas of particular evolutionary history. We estimate the extent to which the European network of protected areas (PAs) network retains interesting evolutionary history areas for the three groups separately and simultaneously.
   Location
   Europe
   Methods
   Phylogenetic (QE(PD)) and species diversity (SD) were estimated using the Rao's quadratic entropy at 10 ' resolution. We determined the regional relationship between QE(PD) and SD for each taxa with a spatial regression model and used the tails of the residuals (QE(RES)) distribution to identify areas of higher and lower QE(PD) than predicted. Spatial congruence of biodiversity between groups was assessed with Pearson correlation coefficient. A simple classification scheme allowed building a convergence map where a convergent pixel equalled to a QE(RES) value of the same sign for the three groups. This convergence map was overlaid to the current PAs network to estimate the level of protection in convergent pixels and compared it to a null expectation built on 1000 randomization of PAs over the landscape.
   Results
   QE(RES) patterns across vertebrates show a strong spatial mismatch highlighting different evolutionary histories. Convergent areas represent only 2.7% of the Western Palearctic, with only 8.4% of these areas being covered by the current PAs network while a random distribution would retain 10.4% of them. QE(RES) are unequally represented within PAs: areas with higher QE(PD) than predicted are better covered than expected, while low QE(PD) areas are undersampled.
   Main conclusions
   Patterns of diversity strongly diverge between groups of vertebrates in Europe. Although Europe has the world's most extensive PAs network, evolutionary history of terrestrial vertebrates is unequally protected. The challenge is now to reconcile effective conservation planning with a contemporary view of biodiversity integrating multiple facets.

AB  - The IUCN considers the stony coral Dendrogyra cylindrus as vulnerable. However, there is insufficient information on its population structure and dynamics, conservation status, or extinction risk and population decreases have been inferred from observations of habitat degradation. In 2002 and 2012, surveys using manta tows, circular plots and satellite images were performed in Old Providence and Santa Catalina Islands (Seaflower Biosphere Reserve) to determine changes in the condition and structure of a local population of D. cylindrus and its habitat. Size-frequency histograms were asymmetric and leptokurtic, showing positive distribution induced by colony fragmentation, which is indicative of reef degradation. Signs of degradation were more evident in 2012, when partial mortality of living tissue in the parent colony yielded 96.6% of the asexually produced fragments. Most of the fragments were from larger colonies (>= 115 cm), which exhibited the highest partial and total mortality (>50%). Three of the four benthic habitats used by the species in 2002 were seen in 2012, but with reduced areas. The results suggest that the reduction of living tissue, the dominance of colonies produced asexually, and reduced size of fragments limit population growth and species viability in an unfavorable and changing habitat within this marine protected area (MPA) of the southwestern Caribbean. In the west of the reef complex of Old Providence, a synergy of multiple stressors could cause the habitat degradation and the fragmentation of colonies, limiting the potential recovery of the species and therefore the ability to create a healthy, genetically diverse and resilient population. Thus, these stressors must be minimized to prevent local extinction. Monitoring the population trends and recording sexual recruitment continues to be vital to understand the larvae's habitat selection and determine whether these habitats are suitable for the survival of coral recruits. Other stressors to be monitored include anchor damage, diseases and bleaching. We recommend the MPA management program to include specific plans of conservation, recovery and restoration for coral reef builders species like D. cylindrus.

AB  - Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus) is a species of special concern and is currently considered a candidate species under Endangered Species Act. Careful management is therefore required to ensure that suitable habitat is maintained, particularly because much of the species' current distribution is faced with exurban development pressures. We assessed hierarchical nest site selection patterns of Gunnison sage-grouse inhabiting the western portion of the Gunnison Basin, Colorado, USA, at multiple spatial scales, using logistic regression-based resource selection functions. Models were selected using Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) and predictive surfaces were generated using model averaged relative probabilities. Landscape-scale factors that had the most influence on nest site selection included the proportion of sagebrush cover >5%, mean productivity, and density of 2 wheel-drive roads. The landscape-scale predictive surface captured 97% of known Gunnison sage-grouse nests within the top 5 of 10 prediction bins, implicating 57% of the basin as crucial nesting habitat. Crucial habitat identified by the landscape model was used to define the extent for patch-scale modeling efforts. Patch-scale variables that had the greatest influence on nest site selection were the proportion of big sagebrush cover >10%, distance to residential development, distance to high volume paved roads, and mean productivity. This model accurately predicted independent nest locations. The unique hierarchical structure of our models more accurately captures the nested nature of habitat selection, and allowed for increased discrimination within larger landscapes of suitable habitat. We extrapolated the landscape-scale model to the entire Gunnison Basin because of conservation concerns for this species. We believe this predictive surface is a valuable tool which can be incorporated into land use and conservation planning as well the assessment of future land-use scenarios.

AB  - The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon (YTGC) region is one of China's vital gene banks of mountain biological species resources. It is also an experimental site for biologists worldwide to study how organisms differentiate in the exceptional environment of the plateau. Evaluating the importance of the ecological value and identifying extremely important regions to national parks to implement the strictest conservation is significant to protecting and preserving global biodiversity. YTGC as the study area, and a comprehensive evaluation model conformed to ecological value attributes was established: (i) evaluation of ecosystem service function, including water retention, soil and water conservation and biodiversity maintenance; (ii) evaluation of ecological vulnerability, including soil erosion and geological disasters; (iii) evaluation of ecological conservation, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), Global 200 Ecoregions (G200), Biodiversity Hotspots (BH), Endemic Bird Areas (EBAs) and Priority Areas for Biodiversity Conservation in China (PABCC). Identifying as extremely important, important, and general important regions, then mosaicked with the maximum value. The results show: first, the extremely important regions of ecosystem service are about 30,242.90 km2 (45.64%), distributed in most regions flowing southwest along the Yarlung Zangbo River. Second, the ecological vulnerability regions are about 26,561.65 km2 (40.06%), concentrated and contiguously distributed in the valley regions along the Yarlung Zangbo River and the high-altitude glacier-covered regions. Third, the extremely important regions for ecological conservation are mainly distributed in Milin County (39.86%) and Medog County (36.33%), which also presents a clustered distribution in the highly high mountains with apparent differentiation along the Yarlung Zangbo River valley in Milin County and the vertical natural belt centered on the Namjagbarwa and the Galabai Leifeng. Finally, we proposed that the integrated extremely important regions of ecological value should be divided into national parks for strict conservation; at the same time, it is also a reference for considering the construction of biodiversity conservation corridors when roads pass through the extremely important regions. This study presents a reliable and integrative method for effectively identifying conservation priority areas at small-medium scales, which can be applied to other PAs planning and management.

AB  - The beech forests in the Cantabrian Range occur at the southwestern limit of the distribution of the species and are very important for wildlife and biodiversity in the region. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of drought events over the next few decades in southwestern Europe, and establishing how this will alter the distribution, abundance and productivity of beech is fundamental for biodiversity conservation and management. In this study, we used spatially continuous environmental variables to develop spatial distribution and site-productivity models for beech forests in the Cantabrian Range and to project these models to different climate change scenarios. Two raster-based models of resolution 250 m were constructed to identify suitable habitat (species distribution model) and to estimate site index (productivity model) for beech in the Cantabrian Range. Of the 23 variables retained in the spatial distribution model, climate, soil and terrain were the most important (explaining respectively 51.2%, 34.2% and 10.1% of the variation). The productivity model retained only three variables (percentage of silt in soil, mean diurnal range of temperature and plan curvature of the terrain) but was able to explain 54% of the total variation. Future projections based on two emission scenarios suggest that suitable habitat will be drastically reduced by 2070 (loss of 40-90% of the area for the moderate and pessimistic scenarios, respectively). However, the projections do not imply current population removal rather it can be probably interpreted in less favorable conditions for seedling establishment, higher mortality rates and a reduction in local density of populations. Productivity projections for suitable habitat suggest a large increase in the average site index (from current 15.19 to 18.18 m) in the moderate scenario and an increase of only 34 cm in the pessimistic scenario. The study findings provide basic information for conservation biology and could be used by decision-makers to develop and implement actions for mitigating the impact of climate change on beech forests.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are being established across all marine regions but their validity for the conservation of highly mobile marine vertebrates has been questioned. We tested the hypothesis that French coastal MPAs primarily designed for coastal and benthic biota are also beneficial for the conservation of a pelagic seabird, the Vulnerable yelkouan shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan), an endemic species to the Mediterranean Sea. We used a vast spectrum of electronic devices (GPS, temperature-depth-recorders, satellite transmitters and geolocators) and stable isotopic analyses to study the year-round movements and the trophic status of yelkouan shearwaters from the Hyeres archipelago (France). In addition we conducted large-scale ship and aircrafts observation surveys to investigate spatio-temporal density patterns of shearwaters (genus Puffinus) in the western Mediterranean Sea. This extensive investigation permitted the first comprehensive study of the at-sea ecology of yelkouan shearwaters showing strikingly coastal habits, partial migration, unsuspected diving capabilities (max dive depth of 30 m), and a broad diet ranging from zooplankton to small pelagic fish. Importantly, 31% of yelkouan shearwaters GPS positions associated with foraging, 38% of diving positions, and 27% of resting positions were within the three French MPAs during the breeding season. These high scores confirmed by year-round distribution derived from GLS, PTTs, at-sea and aerial observations, validated our hypothesis of the major importance of coastal MPAs for the conservation of yelkouan shearwater.

   Models predicting the spatial distribution of animals are increasingly used in wildlife management and conservation planning. There is growing recognition that common methods of evaluating species distribution model (SDM) accuracy, as a global overall value of predictive ability, could be enhanced by spatially evaluating the model thereby identifying local areas of relative predictive strength and weakness. Current methods of spatial SDM model assessment focus on applying local measures of spatial autocorrelation to SDM residuals, which require quantitative model outputs. However, SDM outputs are often probabilistic (relative probability of species occurrence) or categorical (species present or absent). The goal of this paper was to develop a new method, using a conditional randomization technique, which can be applied to directly spatially evaluate probabilistic and categorical SDMs.
   Location
   Eastern slopes, Rocky Mountains, Alberta, Canada.
   Methods
   We used predictions from seasonal grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) resource selection functions (RSF) models to demonstrate our spatial evaluation technique. Local test statistics computed from bear telemetry locations were used to identify areas where bears were located more frequently than predicted. We evaluated the spatial pattern of model inaccuracies using a measure of spatial autocorrelation, local Moran's I.
   Results
   We found the model to have non-stationary patterns in accuracy, with clusters of inaccuracies located in central habitat areas. Model inaccuracies varied seasonally, with the summer model performing the best and the least error in areas with high RSF values. The landscape characteristics associated with model inaccuracies were examined, and possible factors contributing to RSF error were identified.
   Main conclusions
   The presented method complements existing spatial approaches to model error assessment as it can be used with probabilistic and categorical model output, which is typical for SDMs. We recommend that SDM accuracy assessments be done spatially and resulting accuracy maps included in model metadata.

TI  - Ecological correlates of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) density in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Understanding the ecological factors that drive animal density patterns in time and space is key to devising effective conservation strategies. In Tanzania, most chimpanzees (similar to 75%) live outside national parks where human activities threaten their habitat's integrity and connectivity. Mahale Mountains National Park (MMNP), therefore, is a critical area for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the region due to its location and protective status. Yet, despite its importance and long history of chimpanzee research (>50 years), a park-wide census of the species has never been conducted. The park is categorized as a savanna-woodland mosaic, interspersed with riparian forest, wooded grassland, and bamboo thicket. This heterogeneous landscape offers an excellent opportunity to assess the ecological characteristics associated with chimpanzee density, a topic still disputed, which could improve conservation plans that protect crucial chimpanzee habitat outside the park. We examined the influence of fine-scale vegetative characteristics and topographical features on chimpanzee nest density, modeling nest counts using hierarchical distance sampling. We counted 335 nests in forest and woodland habitats across 102 transects in 13 survey sites. Nests were disproportionately found more in or near evergreen forests, on steep slopes, and in feeding tree species. We calculated chimpanzee density in MMNP to be 0.23 ind/km(2), although density varied substantially among sites (0.09-3.43 ind/km(2)). Density was associated with factors related to the availability of food and nesting trees, with topographic heterogeneity and the total basal area of feeding tree species identified as significant positive predictors. Species-rich habitats and floristic diversity likely play a principal role in shaping chimpanzee density within a predominately open landscape with low food abundance. Our results provide valuable baseline data for future monitoring efforts in MMNP and enhance our understanding of this endangered species' density and distribution across Tanzania.

AB  - Habitat models serve three main purposes: First, to predict species occurrences on the basis of abiotic and biotic variables, second to improve the understanding of species-habitat relationships and third, to quantify habitat requirements. The use of statistical models to predict the likely occurrence or distribution of species based on relevant variables is becoming an increasingly important tool in conservation planning and wildlife management. This article aims to provide an overview of the current status of development and application of statistical methodologies for analysing the species-environment association, with a clear emphasis on aquatic habitat. It describes the main types of univariate and multivariate techniques available for analysis of species-environment association, and specifically focuses on the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the available statistical methods to estimate habitat suitability. A second objective of this article is to propose new approaches using existing statistical methods. A wide array of habitat statistical models has been developed to analyse habitat-species relationship. Generally, physical habitat is dependent on more than one variable (e.g. depth, velocity, substrate, cover) and several suitability indices must be combined to define a composite index. Multivariate approaches are more appropriate for the analysis of aquatic habitat as they inherently consider the interrelation and correlation structure of the environmental variables. Ordinary multiple linear regression and logistic regression are popular methods often used for modelling of species and their relationships with environment. Ridge regression and Principal component regression are particularly useful when the independent variables are highly correlated. More recent regression modelling paradigms like generalized linear models (GLMs) present advantages in dealing with non-normal environmental variables. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and artificial neural networks are better suited for analysis of non-linear relationships between species distribution and environmental variables. The fuzzy logic approach presents advantages in dealing with uncertainties that often exist in habitat modelling. Appropriate methods for analysis of multi-species data are also presented. Finally, the few existing comparative studies for predictive modelling are reviewed, and advantages and disadvantages of different methods are discussed. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Global climate change (GCC) is one of the most critical threats to biodiversity. We assessed how it might disrupt the spatio-temporal diversity dimensions of avifauna associated with endangered Neotropical seasonally dry forests (NSDF). We used ecological niche modeling estimating the geographic distributions of 151 highly vulnerable bird species (including swifts, hummingbirds, woodpeckers, and parrots) under current and future climate projections (2050s and 2070s). Then, using traditional metrics of beta-diversity for Sorensen's index, we assessed how GCC could drive alterations in both alpha and beta taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional (through birdsong frequencies and acoustic diversity) diversity for bird assemblages across the distribution of NSDF and within current protected areas. Likewise, we estimated the relationship between the expected changes in diversity dimensions with elevation, annual temperature, and precipitation seasonality across the NSDF distribution. Under GCC, we observed a general reduction for spatial taxonomic-richness of birds across the NSDF (-7.24 +/- 6.69 spp. [2050s] and - 9.40 +/- 7.58 spp. [2070s]), which also implies a general reduction for alpha phylogenetic and functional (except for the acoustic space) diversities by grid-cell. We also observed changes in the potential composition of communities (increasing, on average, the dissimilarity between sites) through space and time. Our results also suggest a biotic heterogenization for NSDF bird assemblages and that protected areas are not exempt from suffering such changes in biodiversity organization. Changes in spatio-temporal diversities were related to high temperatures and low rainfall across lowlands. Our results could inform new land-use planning and beta diversity conservation efforts in NSDF.

AB  - P>1. Emerging infectious diseases can have serious consequences for wildlife populations, ecosystem structure and biodiversity. Predicting the spatial patterns and potential impacts of diseases in free-ranging wildlife are therefore important for planning, prioritizing and implementing research and management actions.
   2. We developed spatial models of environmental suitability (ES) for infection with the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the most significant disease affecting vertebrate biodiversity on record, amphibian chytridiomycosis. We applied relatively newly developed methods for modelling ES (Maxent) to the first comprehensive, continent-wide data base (comprising > 10000 observations) on the occurrence of infection with this pathogen and employed novel methodologies to deal with common but rarely addressed sources of model uncertainty.
   3. We used ES to (i) predict the minimum potential geographic distribution of infection with B. dendrobatidis in Australia and (ii) test the hypothesis that ES for B. dendrobatidis should help explain patterns of amphibian decline given its theoretical and empirical link with organism abundance (intensity of infection), a known determinant of disease severity.
   4. We show that (i) infection with B. dendrobatidis has probably reached its broad geographic limits in Australia under current climatic conditions but that smaller areas of invasion potential remain, (ii) areas of high predicted ES for B. dendrobatidis accurately reflect areas where population declines due to severe chytridiomycosis have occurred and (iii) that a host-specific metric of ES for B. dendrobatidis (ES for Bd(species)) is the strongest predictor of decline in Australian amphibians at a continental scale yet discovered.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide quantitative information that helps to explain both the spatial distribution and potential effects (risk) of amphibian infection with B. dendrobatidis at the population level. Given scarce conservation resources, our results can be used immediately in Australia and our methods applied elsewhere to prioritize species, regions and actions in the struggle to limit further biodiversity loss.

AB  - The Mediterranean population of Cuviefs beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), a deep-diving cetacean, is genetically distinct from the Atlantic, and subject to a number of conservation threats, in particular underwater noise. It is also cryptic at the surface and relatively rare, so obtain robust knowledge on distribution and abundance presents unique challenges. Here we use multiplatform and multiyear survey data to analyse the distribution and abundance of this species across the Mediterranean Sea. We use a novel approach combining heterogeneous data gathered with different methods to obtain a single density index for the region. A total of 594,996 km of survey effort and 507 sightings of Cuvier's beaked whales, from 1990 to 2016, were pooled together from 24 different sources. Data were divided into twelve major groups according to platform height, speed and sea state. Both availability bias and effective strip width were calculated from the sightings with available perpendicular distance data. This was extrapolated to the rest of the sightings for each of the twelve groups. Habitat preference models were fitted into a GAM framework using counts of groups as a response variable with the effective searched area as an offset. Depth, coefficient of variation of depth, longitude and marine regions (as defined by the International Hydrographic Organization) were identified as important predictors. Predicted abundance of groups per grid cell were multiplied by mean group size to obtain a prediction of the abundance of animals. A total abundance of 5799 (CV = 24.0%) animals was estimated for the whole Mediterranean basin. The Alboran Sea, Ligurian Sea, Hellenic Trench, southem Adriatic Sea and eastern Ionian Sea were identified as being the main hot spots in the region. It is important to urge that the relevant stakeholders incorporate this information in the planning and execution of high risk activities in these high-risk areas.

AB  - Background: Understanding how landscape factors, including suites of geographic and environmental variables, and both historical and contemporary ecological and evolutionary processes shape the distribution of genetic diversity is a primary goal of landscape and conservation genetics and may be particularly consequential for species involved in ecological restoration. In this study, we examine the factors that shape the distribution of genetic variation in a leguminous shrub (Caragana microphylla) important for restoration efforts on the Mongolian Plateau in China. This region houses several major bioclimatic gradients, and C. microphylla is an important restoration species because it stabilizes soils and prevents advancing desertification on the Inner Mongolia Plateau caused by ongoing climate change.
   Results: We assembled an expansive genomic dataset, consisting of 22 microsatellite loci, four cpDNA regions, and 5788 genome-wide SNPs from ten populations of C. microphylla. We then applied ecological niche modelling and linear and non-linear regression techniques to investigate the historical and contemporary forces that explain patterns of genetic diversity and population structure in C. microphylla on the Inner Mongolia Plateau. We found strong evidence that both geographic and environmental heterogeneity contribute to genetic differentiation and that the spatial distribution of genetic diversity in C. microphylla appears to result partly from the presence of a glacial refugium at the southwestern edge of its current range.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that geographic, environmental, and historical factors have all contributed to spatial genetic variation in this ecologically important species. These results should guide restoration plans to sustain genetic diversity during plant translocations.

AB  - Evaluating bird population trends requires baseline data. In, North America the earliest population data available are those from the late 1960s. Forest conditions in the northern Great Lake states (U.S.A.), however, have undergone succession since the region was originally cut over around the turn of the twentieth century, and it is expected that bird populations have undergone concomitant change. We propose pre-Euro-American settlement as an alternative baseline for assessing changes in bird populations. We evaluated the amount, quality, and distribution of breeding bird habitat during the mid-1800s and early 1990s for three forest birds. the Pine Warbler (Dendroica pinus), Blackburnian Warbler (D. fusca), and Black-throated Green Warbler (D. virens). We constructed models of bird and habitat relationships based on literature review and regional data sets of bird abundance and applied these models to widely available vegetation data. Original public-land survey records represented historical habitat conditions, and a combination of forest inventory and national land-cover data represented current conditions. We assessed model robustness by comparing current habitat distribution to actual breeding bird locations from the Wisconsin Breeding Bird Atlas. The model showed little change in the overall amount of Pine Warbler habitat, whereas both the Blackburnian Warber and the Black-throated Green Warbler have experienced substantial habitat losses. For the species we examined, habitat quality has degraded since presettlement and the spatial distribution of habitat shifted among ecoregions, with range expansion accompanying forest incursion into previously open habitats or The replacement of native forests with pine plantations. Sources of habitat loss and degradation include loss of conifers and loss of large trees. Using widely available data sources in a habitat suitability model framework, our method provides a long-term analysis of change in bird habitat and a presettlement baseline for assessing current conservation priority.

AB  - Aim Assessments of biodiversity are an essential requirement of conservation management planning. Species distributional modelling is a popular approach to quantifying biodiversity whereby occurrence data are related to environmental covariates. An important confounding factor that is often overlooked in the development of such models is uncertainty due to imperfect detection. Here, I demonstrate how an analytical approach that accounts for the bias due to imperfect detection can be applied retrospectively to an existing biodiversity survey data set to produce more realistic estimates of species distributions and unbiased covariate relationships.
   Location Pilbara biogeographic region, Australia.
   Methods As a component of the Pilbara survey, presence/absence (i.e. undetected) data on small ground-dwelling mammals were collected. I applied a multiseason occupancy modelling approach to six of the most common species encountered during this survey. Detection and occupancy rates, as well as extinction and colonization probabilities, were determined, and the influence of covariates on these parameters was examined using the multi-model inference approach.
   Results Detection probabilities for all six species were considerably lower than 1.0 and varied across time and species. Naive estimates of occupancy underestimated occupancy rates corrected for species detectability by up to 45%. Seasonal variation in occupancy status was attributed to changes in detection for two of the focal species, while reproductive events explained variation in occupancy in three others. Covariates describing the substrate strongly influenced site occupancy for most of the species modelled. A comparison of the occupancy model with a generalized linear model, assuming perfect detection, showed that the effects of the covariates were underestimated in the latter model.
   Main conclusions The application of the multiseason occupancy modelling approach to the Pilbara mammal data set demonstrated a powerful framework for examining changes in site occupancy, as well as local colonization and extinction rates of species which are not confounded by variable species detection rates.

AB  - Loss and fragmentation of habitat can disrupt genetic exchange between populations, which is reflected in changes to the genetic structure of populations. The Grey-crowned Babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis) is a cooperatively breeding woodland bird, once common and widespread in south-eastern Australia. The species has suffered population declines of >90% across its southern distribution as a result of loss and fragmentation of habitat. We investigated patterns of genetic diversity and population structure of Grey-crowned Babblers in fragmented habitats at the southernmost extent of its range. We sampled blood from 135 individual Babblers from 39 groups stratified into six subpopulations in three regions. Genotypic data were used to estimate genetic diversity, population substructure, local relatedness and dispersal patterns. Individuals showed high heterozygosity within regions, and varying numbers of private alleles among regions suggested differences in levels of connectivity between regions. Four genetic clusters revealed population substructure consistent with treeless landscapes acting as strong barriers to gene flow. In contrast to previous studies, we identified a male-biased dispersal pattern and significant isolation-by-distance patterns for females at fine spatial scales. We recommend that conservation plans for this species incorporate opportunities to increase and enhance corridor areas to facilitate genetic exchange among subpopulations.

AB  - Background To facilitate climatic change adaptation, landscape and conservation managers require understanding of spatio-temporal patterns of expansion of potential dominant species. Studying past expansions of canopy-dominant trees can contribute such understanding. Aims Test hypotheses about expansions of dominants using as a model the mid-Holocene expansion of forests dominated by Pinus sylvestris in the Scottish Highlands. Methods Pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating of Holocene sediments of a larger basin and several small hollows were performed in three landscapes along a north-south transect. A larger basin records expansion timing at landscape scale, whilst small hollows evidence within-landscape spatio-temporal patterns. Results Vegetation existing prior to the expansion of pinewoods influenced landscape-scale spatio-temporal expansion patterns of P. sylvestris. Open vegetation generally was invaded earlier and/or to a greater extent; invasion was often later, or did not occur, where woodland with a substantial temperate broadleaved tree and shrub component (e.g. Corylus avellana, Quercus spp.) was present. Most small hollows, not just those where pinewoods became locally established, recorded vegetation change during the expansion. Some present landscape-scale forest composition patterns were established at that time. Conclusions Studying past expansions of dominants provides evidence relevant to planning conservation and landscape management to facilitate ecological adaptation as species adjust their distributions and abundances in response to climatic change.

AB  - The Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus, is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, including Namibia, Botswana and Angola. The species was transferred from CITES Appendix I to Appendix II in 2004, although it is recognized as peripherally endangered in Namibia due to diminishing habitat availability primarily from human encroachment. In 2013, a species management plan was approved in Namibia to assess the management of the Namibian Nile crocodile populations. During 2012, an aerial survey was conducted to provide an estimate of Nile crocodile population numbers. A recently developed N-mixture model for estimation of abundance and spatial variation was used. Detection probability correlated to animal size and environmental covariates. Our data also suggest that small crocodiles are easier to detect during the spring. The abundance for different size classes was influenced by river complexity (vegetation, depth, channels) and the distribution of human settlements. An estimated 806 individuals were counted along the 352 km Namibian portion of the Kunene River system with a conservative estimate of 562 crocodiles regardless of size. The parameter estimates generated by the analysis suggested that the class-structured model can produce reliable estimates of total abundance and of local abundance for this section in the Kunene River system.

AB  - Spatial reserve design concerns the planning of biological reserves for conservation. Typical reserve selection formulations operate on a large set of landscape elements, which could be grid cells or irregular sites, and selection algorithms aim to select the set of sites that achieves biodiversity target levels with minimum cost. This study presents a completely different optimization approach to reserve design. The reserve selection problem can be considerably simplified given the reasonable assumptions that: (i) maximum reserve cost is known; (ii) the approximate number of new reserves to be established is known; (iii) individual reserves need to be spatially contiguous. Further assuming the ability to construct a set of reserves in an efficient and close to optimal manner around designated reserve locations, the reserve selection problem can be turned into a search for a single interior point and area for each reserve. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated for a data set of seven indicator species living in an conservation priority area in Southern Australia consisting of ca 73,000 selection units, with up to 10,000 cells chosen for inclusion in a reserve network. Requirements (ii) and (iii) above make interior point search computationally very efficient, allowing use with landscapes in the order of millions of elements. The method could also be used with non-linear species distribution models. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Snow leopards are distributed across the mountains of 12 countries spread across 1.8 million km(2) in Central and South Asia. Previous efforts to map snow leopard distributions have relied on expert opinions and modelling of presence-only data. Expert opinion is subjective and its reliability is difficult to assess, while analyses of presence-only data have tended to ignore the imperfect detectability of this elusive species. The study was conducted to prepare the first ever probabilistic distribution map of snow leopards across Mongolia addressing the challenge of imperfect detection. Location We conducted sign-based occupancy surveys across 1,017 grid-cells covering 406,800 km(2) of Mongolia's potential snow leopard range. Methods Using a candidate model set of 31 ecologically meaningful models that used six site and seven sampling covariates, we estimate the probability of sites being used by snow leopards across the entire country. Results Occupancy probability increased with greater terrain ruggedness, with lower values of vegetation indices, with less forest cover, and were highest at intermediate altitudes. Detection probability was higher for segments walked on foot, and for those in more rugged terrain. Our results showed broad agreement with maps developed using expert opinion and presence-only data but also highlighted important differences, for example in northern areas of Mongolia deemed largely unfavourable by previous expert opinion and presence-only analyses. Main conclusions This study reports the first national-level occupancy survey of snow leopards in Mongolia and highlights methodological opportunities that can be taken to scale and support national-level conservation planning. Our assessments indicated that <12% of its entire land mass, and 42% of the potential snow leopard habitat in Mongolia has a high (>0.5) probability of being used by snow leopards. We emphasize the utility of occupancy modelling, which jointly models detection and site use, in achieving these goals.

AB  - Natal dispersal is a process that is critical in the spatial dynamics of populations, including population spread recolonization, and gene flow. It is a central focus of conservation issues for many vertebrate species. Using data for 77 bird and 68 mammal species we tested whether median and maximum natal dispersal distances were correlated with body mass, diet type, social system, taxonomic family, and migratory status. Body mass and diet type were found to predict both median and maximum natal dispersal distances in mammals: large species dispersed farther than small ones, and carnivorous species dispersed farther than herbivores and omnivores. Similar relationships occurred for carnivorous bird species, but not for herbivorous or omnivorous ones. Natal dispersal distances in birds or mammals were not significantly related to broad categories of social systems. Only in birds were factors such as taxonomic relatedness and migratory status correlated with natal dispersal, and then only for maximum distances. Summary properties of dispersal processes appeared to be derived from interactions among behavioral and morphological characteristics of species and from their linkages to the dynamics of resource availability in landscapes.
   In all the species we examined, most dispersers moved relatively short distances, and long-distance dispersal was uncommon. On the basis of these findings, we fit an empirical model based on the negative exponential distribution for calculating minimum probabilities that animals disperse particular distances from their natal areas. This model, coupled with knowledge of a species' body mass and diet type, can be used to conservatively predict dispersal distances for different species and examine possible consequences of large-scale habitat alterations on connectedness between populations. Taken together, our results can provide managers with the means to identify species vulnerable to landscape-level habitat changes such as forest fragmentation. In addition, our dispersal models can be used to predict which species in a community are likely to be the most vulnerable to loss of connectedness and allow managers to test the merits of alternative habitat conservation plans.

AB  - Maps of potential habitat distribution are needed for regional population models of rare species, but reliable information from ground surveys is not always available. Existing data sources from disciplines other than ecological research often are underused. In this article, we discuss the development of a geographic information system (GIS) model that predicts potential habitats from ecosystem information contained in the US soil classification and soil survey. Soil classification and survey were used in the GIS model in an earlier study on the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge Reservation, Tennessee, to predict threatened calcareous habitats. The model predicts potential habitats from the combination of (a) soil taxon as an indication of long-term ecosystem processes; (b) geologic parent material; and (c) slope class. Satellite imagery was added to indicate current successional state. In this study, we rested the model's predictive ability by using data from the Cedar Creek Slope Glades Preserve at the 44,000-ha US Department of Defense Fort Knox Military Reservation, Kentucky. We then used the model to predict occurrences of potential suitable habitat on the remainder of the Fort Knox reservation, including heavily impacted ordnance and tank training areas that are unsafe for public access; The soil component of the model also was applied to a 1.2 x 10(6)-km(2) region of the US, by using the US Department of Agriculture-National Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO) combined with official soil series descriptions. Soil taxa from the USDA-NRCS Soil Taxonomy were demonstrated to be associated with threatened calcareous habitats of rare plant species. These soil taxa were lithic mollisols (rendolls and udolls; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) rendzinas and chernozems) and alfisols (udalfs; FAO luvisols). The combined soil/geology/slope GIS approach has potential for prediction of rare ecosystems with narrow edaphic constraints. The approach would be useful in long-term planning for conservation management and restoration, especially where intensive ground surveys are expensive and/or impractical and where disturbance history obscures patterns of historical distribution.

AB  - As climatic conditions shift in coming decades, persistence of many populations will depend on their ability to colonize habitat newly suitable for their climatic requirements. Opportunities for such range shifts may be limited unless areas that facilitate dispersal under climate change are identified and protected from land uses that impede movement. While many climate adaptation strategies focus on identifying refugia, this study is the first to characterize areas which merit protection for their role in promoting climate connectivity at a continental extent. We identified climate connectivity areas across North America by delineating paths between current climate types and their future analogs that avoided nonanalogous climates, and used centrality metrics to rank the contribution of each location to facilitating dispersal across the landscape. The distribution of connectivity areas was influenced by climatic and topographic factors at multiple spatial scales. Results were robust to uncertainty in the magnitude of future climate change arising from differing emissions scenarios and general circulation models, but sensitive to analysis extent and assumptions concerning dispersal behavior and maximum dispersal distance. Paths were funneled along north-south trending passes and valley systems and away from areas of novel and disappearing climates. Climate connectivity areas, where many potential dispersal paths overlapped, were distinct from refugia and thus poorly captured by many existing conservation strategies. Existing protected areas with high connectivity values were found in southern Mexico, the southwestern US, and western and arctic Canada and Alaska. Ecoregions within the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Great Plains, eastern temperate forests, high Arctic, and western Canadian Cordillera hold important climate connectivity areas which merit increased conservation focus due to anthropogenic pressures or current low levels of protection. Our coarse-filter climate-type-based results complement and contextualize species-specific analyses and add a missing dimension to climate adaptation planning by identifying landscape features which promote connectivity among refugia.

AB  - With climate change, terrestrial fauna in riparian floodplain ecosystems must adapt to a predicted increase in frequency and magnitude of fluvial perturbations. Seasonal migration to seek refuge from floodwaters represents a central adaptation strategy, but may entail risky navigation of anthropogenic spaces in heterogeneous landscapes. Here, we demonstrate the opportunities and constraints large-bodied mammalian herbivores face during an adaptive response of obligatory flood-driven refuge migration, across a human-dominated environment. Our study system, centred around a productive protected area--Kaziranga National Park in Assam, Northeast India-on the floodplains of the Brahmaputra River, is home to an abundance of large herbivores that undertake seasonal migrations in response to floods. We contrast species distribution data during a major flood event with those from the dry season to illustrate season-specific movement and space use decisions of large herbivores ranging in body mass from the 3000-kg Asian elephant Elephas maximus to the 20-kg muntjac Muntiacus muntjak. In the dry season, most large herbivores--a majority of which are endangered and threatened by anthropogenic pressures--avoided areas with a strong human footprint, while preferring spaces with high land-use diversity. During the floods, such species were pushed out of inundated habitats within the protected area, and they chose tomove through woodlands and areas under bamboo cover on private lands, as they migrated to forested refugia on higher ground. Our results showhowseasonal environmental constraints shaped by floods determine the internal motivation of animals to risk traversing a human-dominated space to seek refuge, which contextually defines how animals view and navigate the landscape. Such insights underscore the importance of dynamic and adaptive planning, and participatory conservation efforts, to facilitate connectivity in the changing environment and climate of the present Anthropocene.

AB  - Tropical savannas are an important reservoir of global biodiversity. Australia's extensive savannas, although still largely intact, are experiencing substantial declines in terrestrial biodiversity due to a variety of interrelated effects of altered fire regimes, grazing and increases in invasive species. These disturbance processes are spatially variable, combine to increase landscape to local-scale landscape heterogeneity, but rarely result in well-defined patch boundaries. We quantified the importance of this heterogeneity for native reptile and small mammal species in a tropical savanna landscape of Queensland, Australia. We used high resolution remote sensing imagery (IKONOS) to map habitat pattern at a 4 m spatial resolution and at variable extents. We found that landscapes dominated by grass or bare ground had low reptile and small mammal diversity, while landscapes with a heterogeneous mix of grass, bare ground and trees had high species diversity and relative abundance of most species. Landscape heterogeneity may increase reptile and small mammal species richness by: (i) increasing the variety and abundance of foraging resources such as seeds and invertebrates; (ii) providing cover from predators and high summer temperatures; and (iii) increasing functional connectivity and dispersal success. The importance of these resources and processes varies among individual species and at different spatial scales, reiterating the need to consider habitat requirements of multiple species in landscape management and conservation planning.

AB  - Cities are human ecosystems. Understanding human ecology is important for designing and planning the built environment. The ability to respond to changes and adapt actions in a positive way helps determine the health of cities. Recently, many studies have highlighted the great potential of photographic data shared on the Flickr platform for the analysis of environmental perceptions in landscape and urban planning. Other research works used panoramic images from the Google Street View (GSV) web service to extract urban quality data. Although other researches have used social media to characterize human habitat from an emotional point of view, there is still a lack of knowledge of the correlation between environmental and physical variables of the city and visual perception, especially at a scale suitable for urban planning and design. In ecology, the environmental suitability of a territory for a given biological community is studied through species distribution models (SDM). In this work we have adopted the state of the art of SDM (the ensemble approach) to develop a methodology transferable to cities with different sizes and characteristics that uses data deriving from many sources available on a global scale: social media platform, Google internet services, shared geographical information, remote sensing and geomorphological data. The result of our application in the city of Livorno offers important information on the most significant variables for the conservation, planning and design of urban public spaces at the project scale. However, further research developments will be needed to test the model in cities of different sizes and geographic locations, integrate the model with other social media, other databases and with traditional surveys and improve the quality of indicators that can be derived from information shared on the Internet.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify the main environmental covariates related to the abundance of 17 cetacean species/groups in the western North Atlantic Ocean based on generalized additive models, to establish a current habitat suitability baseline, and to estimate abundance that incorporates habitat characteristics. Habitat models were developed from dedicated sighting survey data collected by NOAA-Northeast and Southeast Fisheries Science Centers during July 2010 to August 2013. A group of 7 static physiographic characteristics and 9 dynamic environmental covariates were included in the models. For the small cetacean models, the explained deviance ranged from 16% to 69%. For the large whale models, the explained deviance ranged from 32% to 52.5%. Latitude, sea surface temperature, bottom temperature, primary productivity and distance to the coast were the most common covariates included and their individual contribution to the deviance explained ranged from 5.9% to 18.5%. The habitat-density models were used to produce seasonal average abundance estimates and habitat suitability maps that provided a good correspondence with observed sighting locations and historical sightings for each species in the study area. Thus, these models, maps and abundance estimates established a current habitat characterization of cetacean species in these waters and have the potential to be used to support management decisions and conservation measures in a marine spatial planning context.

AB  - Seasonal changes in connectivity routes among larval fish assemblages in the northern Gulf of California were studied with connectivity matrices from particle-tracking with a 3D baroclinic numerical model. Results show strong seasonality in connectivity routes among assemblages according to the seasonal circulation phases. In summer (cyclonic phase), when circulation is dominated by the central cyclonic eddy and the northwestward coastal current on the mainland shelf, particle retention among assemblages after 30 days is high (> 55%), and particle dispersion toward the Southern Gulf is low (< 17%). Thus recruitment of most fish species must occur near their spawning areas: in June, coastal-demersal species such as Gobulus crescentalis and Etropus crossotus, and in August, coastal-epipelagic species such as Opisthonema libertate and species of the genus Anchoa. In winter (anticyclonic phase), when the coastal current is southeastward, particle retention among assemblages is low (< 35%), and particle dispersion toward the southern gulf is high (> 54%). Therefore, recruitment may occur away from the spawning locations, as suggested by the wide distribution of Engraulis mordax (coastal-epipelagic) and Benthosema panamense (mesopelagic). Seasonal changes in connectivity routes show that ocean dynamics must be considered in management and conservation plans for marine ecosystems.

AB  - The survey conducted under the Ancient Meadows and Pastures project represents a new approach in nature conservation in Sweden, where natural and cultural heritage values were inventoried and analysed in an integrated holistic approach between 1985 and 1497. The model for the survey, developed jointly by researchers and planners, is composed of four steps: methodological development of data collection; national survey and regional ranking; national analysis; and applications. This paper describes the conceptual model, the methodological development and national analysis. The method development is composed of strategic selection of criteria for natural and cultural values, development of classification systems, development of techniques for aerial photo interpretation, methods for fieldwork and description, evaluation and ranking. The data collection is based on interpretation in stereo pairs of colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs with selection of potentially valuable meadows and pastures which are inventoried and checked in the field for cultural-historical nature types, cultural elements, vegetation types and selected indicator species of vascular plants. They are also described from a holistic landscape ecological perspective, integrating the cultural and biological components within the entire landscape and, finally, ranked for nature conservation into four classes. The evaluation emphasises botanical values together with long-term continuity in landuse and management, underpinned with cultural components. The national analysis showed that nearly 200,000 ha of ancient meadows and pastures are well managed and of high value. They are distributed among more than 17,000 objects and 22 cultural-historical nature types. Most were pastures (98%). The result is not only increased knowledge of the distribution of ancient meadows and pastures and a high number of well-managed pasture landscapes throughout Sweden, but also a change in attitude among farmers, towards more positive attitudes to nature conservation and biodiversity and understanding of the cultural landscape. This project has had an important influence, because if is used in regional nature conservation work, has formed the principal basis of several thousands of management agreements with farmers, is used in policy work in the national nature protection plan and in the biodiversity action plan. The database also provides a good foundation for research in cultural landscapes, biodiversity and landscape ecology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study was conducted at Korang river, Islamabad to determine soil and vegetation associations and affiliations. Herbaceous flora and soil samples were collected randomly by using 1 x 1 square meters quadrate. For each plant in quadrate visual cover estimation was noted. Twenty one species belonging to 14 families were identified. CCA (Canonical Correspondence Analysis) was applied in order to find out the strength and relation between environment and plant species. The results exhibited that pH and copper strongly affected the abundance of Cannabis sativa while profusion of Cynodon dactylon was influenced by moisture content. CCA functioned on water quality parameters indicated that sulphate and TSS were the major holding factors promoting the growth of Cannabis sativa. T-value biplots were created for each environmental parameter to assess whether the relation was positive or negative with variables. GLM was also taken into account to value the relation between response and predictors in a way that Cannabis sativa tolerated adverse environmental conditions in the current study. Partial ordination was used that gave variation partitioning of plant species against every parameter. The survey of edaphic factors and vegetation structure along Korang river was helpful for not only improving and mending the present condition of river but also for planning and conservation of plant species diversity.

AB  - The consequences of Quaternary climatic fluctuations on plant evolutionary history have been well documented in North America and Europe but have been far less studied in the Neotropical region. Diversification patterns in South American grasslands have been neglected, especially in the Pampas. In this study, we applied an ensemble-modeling framework and a bioregionalization method to test the hypothesis that Petunia axillaris subspecies responded differently to past climate changes in the South American grasslands. Scenarios for the future were projected to better understand the consequences of climatic shifts on the species' survival. Our results revealed that each subspecies is currently distributed in different bioregions and displays substantial geographic separation as a consequence of past climate oscillations. The projected future scenarios suggest that all subspecies would be affected by habitat fragmentation. This could influence the genetic structuring among P. axillaris populations, as the diversity of grasslands species depends on the genetic characteristics of the remaining populations over the fragmented regions. These results reinforce the importance of considering intraspecific diversity when planning conservation efforts in grasslands in southern South America.

AB  - Macadamia jansenii is endemic to south-east Queensland, Australia, and is currently known from a single population 180 km north of the nearest wild population of its congener, the edible Macadamia integrifolia. A recently developed Macadamia recovery plan identified that this population was under significant threat and recommended a reintroduction program to safeguard against chance extinction of the single wild population. This study undertook demographic population census surveys, genetic analysis, habitat analysis and niche modelling to determine the potential long-term viability for the species, and to guide search and reintroduction programs. We expanded the known population size of the species to similar to 60 individuals (1 m and taller) spread over a 900-m distance along a single creek clumped into three subpopulations. There was moderate genetic diversity in the species and the subpopulations showed little genetic differentiation. We developed a potential habitat model combining abiotic variables and vegetation associations, and mapped areas of potentially suitable habitat for M. jansenii within its local area. These maps are being used to target searches for other populations and to guide the location of introduction populations.

KW  - BEHAVIOR
AB  - Our ecological knowledge base is extensive, but the motivations for research are many and varied, leading to unequal species representation and coverage. As this evidence is used to support a wide range of conservation, management and policy actions, it is important that gaps and biases are identified and understood. In this paper we detail a method for quantifying research effort and impact at the individual species level, and go on to investigate the factors that best explain between-species differences in outputs. We do this using British breeding birds as a case study, producing a ranked list of species based on two scientific publication metrics: total number of papers (a measure of research quantity) and h-index (a measure of the number of highly cited papers on a topic - an indication of research quality). Widespread, populous species which are native, resident and in receipt of biodiversity action plans produced significantly higher publication metrics. Guild was also significant, birds of prey the most studied group, with pigeons and doves the least studied. The model outputs for both metrics were very similar, suggesting that, at least in this example, research quantity and quality were highly correlated. The results highlight three key gaps in the evidence base, with fewer citations and publications relating to migrant breeders, introduced species and species which have experienced contractions in distribution. We suggest that the use of publication metrics in this way provides a novel approach to understanding the scale and drivers of both research quantity and impact at a species level and could be widely applied, both taxonomically and geographically.

AB  - In the present study, five loci (mitochondrial and nuclear) were sequenced to determine the genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history of populations of the yellowtail snapper, Ocyurus chrysurus, found along the coast of the western South Atlantic. O. chrysurus is a lutjanid species that is commonly associated with coral reefs and exhibits an ample geographic distribution, and it can therefore be considered a good model for the investigation of phylogeographic patterns and genetic connectivity in marine environments. The results reflected a marked congruence between the mitochondrial and nuclear markers as well as intense gene flow among the analyzed populations, which represent a single genetic stock along the entire coast of Brazil between the states of Para and Espirito Santo. Our data also showed high levels of genetic diversity in the species (mainly mtDNA), as well a major historic population expansion, which most likely coincided with the sea level oscillations at the end of the Pleistocene. In addition, this species is intensively exploited by commercial fisheries, and data on the genetic structure of its populations will be essential for the development of effective conservation and management plans.

AB  - Land degradation, competition with livestock, infrastructure development, and climate change have reduced habitat availability and reduced population connectivity for many wildlife species. Large herbivores are particularly vulnerable, and approximately 90 % of global large herbivore diversity is in Africa. The endangered Grevy's zebra illustrates the decline and fragmentation of large mammalian herbivore populations, with exten-sive population loss across their range in northern Kenya and Ethiopia. A better understanding of the factors influencing population connectivity and movement patterns of Grevy's zebra, highlighted in national strategies, offers valuable insights for other threatened species.Using location and movement data for Grevy's zebra from GPS collars deployed between 2010 and 2017, seasonally-explicit landscape resistance was modelled as a function of water availability, vegetation, cattle density, topography and proximity to roads and settlements. Maximum entropy models identified habitat suit-ability during wet and dry seasons respectively. Population connectivity analyses using least-cost paths and circuit theory determined landscape resistance to movement and highlighted linkage pathways. Movement was modelled over a range of distances, using GPS data.Grevy's zebra reliance on water was confirmed, with an apparent trade-off between habitat suitability and proximity to people. Connectivity models highlighted potentially isolated populations, with reduced seasonal connectivity being most apparent between north to south distribution areas. These results can inform sustainable land management planning in northern Kenya and offer support for Grevy's zebra conservation actions. These results also provide insights that can be applied to other large herbivores occurring in this region and in arid or degraded environments elsewhere.

AB  - Although the fragmentation of the natural landscape of coastal southern California, USA, is accelerating, large-scale assessments of regional connectivity are lacking. Because of their large area requirements and long dispersal movements, mammalian carnivores can be effective focal species to use when evaluating landscape-level connectivity. Our goat was to make an initial assessment of the extent of landscape-level connectivity in coastal southern California using mountain lions (Fells concolor [Linnaeus]) and bobcats (Fells rufus [Shreber]) as focal species. We first characterized habitat preferences for mountain lions and bobcats from previously derived habitat relationship models for these species; the resulting maps provided a coarse view of habitat preferences for use at regional scales. We then constructed GIS models to evaluate the disturbance impact of roadways and development, major determinants of carnivore distribution and abundance in the south coast region. Finally, we combined the habitat relationship models with the disturbance impact models to characterize habitat connectivity for mountain lions and bobcats in the ecoregion. Habitat connectivity in the ecoregion appeared higher for bobcats than for mountain lions due in part to higher habitat suitability for bobcats in coastal lowland areas. Our models suggest that much of the key carnivore habitat in the coastal southern California is at risk; over 80% of high suitability habitat and over 90% of medium suitability habitat for carnivores is found in the least protected land management classes. Overall, these models allow for (1) identification of core habitat blocks for carnivores and key landscape connections between core areas, (2) evaluation of the level of protection of these areas, and (3) a regional framework within which to develop and coordinate local management and conservation plans.

AB  - The use of statistical models to predict the likely occurrence or distribution of species is becoming an increasingly important tool in conservation planning and wildlife management. Evaluating the predictive performance of models using independent data is a vital step in model development. Such evaluation assists in determining the suitability of a model for specific applications, facilitates comparative assessment of competing models and modelling techniques, and identities aspects of a model most in need of improvement. The predictive performance of habitat models developed using logistic regression needs to be evaluated in terms of two components: reliability or calibration (the agreement between predicted probabilities of occurrence and observed proportions of sites occupied), and discrimination capacity (the ability of a model to correctly distinguish between occupied and unoccupied sites). Lack of reliability can be attributed to two systematic sources, calibration bias and spread. Techniques are described for evaluating both of these sources of error. The discrimination capacity of logistic regression models is often measured by cross-classifying observations and predictions in a two-by-two table, and calculating indices of classification performance. However, this approach relies on the essentially arbitrary choice of a threshold probability to determine whether or not a site is predicted to be occupied. An alternative approach is described which measures discrimination capacity in terms of the area under a relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve relating relative proportions of correctly and incorrectly classified predictions over a wide and continuous range of threshold levels. Wider application of the techniques promoted in this paper could greatly improve understanding of the usefulness, and potential limitations, of habitat models developed for use in conservation planning and wildlife management.

AB  - The loss and modification of freshwater ecosystems has led to high rates of imperilment for freshwater species. The Giant Gartersnake (Thamnophis gigas) is among the species that have suffered declines in abundance and spatial distribution and is currently listed as a threatened species by the U.S. government and the State of California. Conservation and management of populations of T. gigas are hampered by a lack of information on its demography. Without estimates of demographic parameters, the status of the population is difficult to characterize, and identifying the parameters to target in management planning is problematic. We used capture-recapture data from two populations in the Great Central Valley of California to estimate annual survival probability. We also evaluated hypothesized causes of variation in survival probability among individuals and among years. Model-selection results for the population in the American Basin indicated that females have a higher survival probability than males and that survival probability and the amount of precipitation between 15 April and 15 May in a year are negatively correlated. Associations with other weather covariates were also supported, but the evidence was weaker. For the population in the Natomas Basin, the model-selection results indicated a positive association between survival probability and the body size of an individual (snout-to-vent length). There was also evidence that females have higher survival probabilities than males, but the support for this effect was weaker. This work fills gaps in our understanding of the demography of T. gigas by providing estimates of survival probability for males and age classes for which estimates were previously not available.

AB  - We present a novel method for calculating the opportunity costs to fishers from their displacement by the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). We used a fishing community in Kubulau District, Fiji to demonstrate this method. We modelled opportunity costs as a function of food fish abundance and probability of catch, based on gear type and market value of species. Count models (including Poisson, negative binomial and two zero-inflated models) were used to predict spatial abundance of preferred target fish species and were validated against field surveys. A profit model was used to investigate the effect of restricted access to transport on costs to fishers. Spatial distributions of fish within the three most frequently sighted food fish families (Acanthuridae, Lutjanidae, Scaridae) varied, with greatest densities of Lutjanidae and Acanthuridae on barrier forereefs and greatest densities of Scaridae on submerged reefs. Modelled opportunity cost indicated that highest costs to fishers arise from restricting access to the barrier forereefs. We included our opportunity cost model in Marxan, a decision support tool used for MPA design, to examine potential MPA configurations for Kubulau District, Fiji Islands. We identified optimum areas for protection in Kubulau with: (a) the current MPA network locked in place; and (b) a clean-slate approach. Our method of modelling opportunity cost gives an unbiased estimate for multiple gear types in a marine environment and can be applied to other regions using existing species data.

AB  - Spatial patterns and associations of plant species are important for revealing how species interact with each other and with the environment, and hence have important implications for the understanding of species interaction and underlying ecological processes with apparent patterns in temperate desert vegetation. In this paper, the function g (r) was used to characterize the spatial patterns and associations of four dominant woody species in three 1-ha desert plant plots in the desert-oasis ecotone of South Junggar Basin, NW China. The complete spatial randomness null model showed four species exhibited significant aggregations at small scales (<20 m). Anabasis aphylla and Nitraria roborowskii, Haloxylon ammodendron and Reaumuria songarica were spatially positive associations at small scales with the independent null model, while A. aphylla and H. ammodendron, A. aphylla and R. songarica, R. songarica and N. roborowskii species pairs exhibited negative associations at small or moderate scales (20-60 m) in our study. The random labeling null model showed that dead standing plants of A. aphylla were largely determined by the combined effects of intra-and interspecific competition. In addition, the results also indicated that the two main factors of habitat heterogeneity and sandy desertification play important roles in determining spatial distribution patterns and associations of woody species in the desert-oasis ecotone of South Junggar Basin. Thus, the differences of species features in spatial patterns and associations should be paid more attention when planning afforestation and developing conservation strategies.

AB  - Balancing agricultural needs with the need to protect biodiverse environments presents a challenge to forestry management. An imbalance in resource production and ecosystem regulation often leads to degradation or deforestation such as when excessive cultivation damages forest biodiversity. Lack of information on geospatial biodiversity may hamper forest ecosystems. In particular, this may be an issue in areas where there is a strong need to reassign land to food production. It is essential to identify and protect those parts of the forest that are key to its preservation. This paper presents a strategy for choosing suitable areas for agricultural management based on a geospatial variation of Shannon's vegetation diversity index (SHDI). This index offers a method for selecting areas with low levels of biodiversity and carbon stock accumulation ability, thereby reducing the negative environmental impact of converting forest land to agricultural use. The natural forest ecosystem of the controversial 1997 Ex-Mega Rice Project (EMRP) in Indonesia is used as an example. Results showed that the geospatial pattern of biodiversity can be accurately derived using kriging analysis and then effectively applied to the delineation of agricultural production areas using an ecological threshold of SHDI. A prediction model that integrates a number of species and families and average annual rainfall was developed by principal component regression (PCR) to obtain a geospatial distribution map of biodiversity. Species richness was found to be an appropriate indicator of SHDI and able to assist in the identification of areas for agricultural use and natural forest management.

AB  - We review results and implications from recent wildlife studies that followed from the 1997 Tongass Land Management Plan (TLMP) and identify information needs and directions for research, development, and application. Sustained population viability of wildlife species was identified as a major issue in the TLMP planning process. Several species were identified as management indicator species, and research was conducted to determine their potential sensitivity to forest management. Southeastern Alaska was found to be a region with an especially high degree of endemism in its small mammal fauna, principally because of the combination of its archipelago geography combined with highly dynamic glacial history. Two species of endemic small mammals selected for demographic study, however, appeared to be less dependent on old-growth forests than had been suspected at the time TLMP was written: the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) because of relatively high suitability of noncommercial, low-volume, mixed-conifer forest; and the southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) because of relatively high suitability of precommercially thinned young-growth forest. The northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) was found to be problematic for "management indicator" status because of logistical difficulties involved in monitoring this relatively rare, highly mobile species that frequently changes nest sites. Sampling protocols were developed for marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus), although murrelet populations do not appear to be in trouble on the Tongass. The conservation strategy of TLMP for American marten (Martes americana) appeared to be sound on Chichagof Island where marten have been studied intensively, but implications for the rest of southeastern Alaska were unclear without further work. Studies of the Alexander Archipelago wolf (Canis lupus ligoni) indicated that population density of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and road access (to wolf hunters) were the predominant factors affecting wolf productivity and mortality, respectively. Finally, studies of bird community response to timber-harvest alternatives to clearcutting indicated that although creation of forest "edge" may increase nest predation rates, the actual response depends on a broad array of factors and is highly variable. We suggest that research, development, and application focus on plant and animal communities and management of vegetation to achieve specific objectives for wildlife habitat. We suggest that such efforts emphasize silviculture of second-growth forests, understanding old-growth reserves, distribution of endemic small mammals, and alternatives to clearcutting. Models for evaluating black-tailed deer habitat and populations are needed for subsistence-hunting management, and some work needs to be directed at interactions between tourism and selected wildlife species.

AB  - Alpine and subalpine ecosystems support many endemic species. These ecosystems are increasingly under threat from human-induced disturbances such as habitat loss and fragmentation as a consequence of ski resort development and expansion. However, limited peer-reviewed research has investigated the impacts of ski-related disturbances on wildlife, particularly on reptiles. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted reptile surveys to determine the patterns of reptile distribution and abundance in Australian ski resorts. Then, using a factorial experimental design, we investigated 1) the influence of temperature and predation in driving observed distributions and 2) how a common ski resort management practice - mowing of modified ski slopes - affected thermal regimes and rates of predation of reptiles on ski runs. We found that the removal of vegetation structural complexity through mowing resulted in significantly higher rates of predation on plasticine models, as well as significantly altered thermal regimes. Crucially, mown ski runs had higher maximum ground temperatures that frequently exceeded the recorded critical maximum body temperatures of the target species of lizards. Thus, mowing has the potential to render these areas unsuitable for thermoregulatory purposes for a large proportion of the potential activity period of reptiles. Together, modifications of the thermal environment and elevated rates of predation appear to explain the avoidance of ski runs by reptiles. To facilitate the persistence of reptiles in disturbed subalpine environments, management plans must focus on implementing strategies that reduce the impact of human activities that alter temperature regimes and predation rates on lizards.Synthesis and Applications. We suggest that the retention of structural complexity on ski runs (e.g. through the cessation of mowing during peak reptile activity periods) and/or revegetation with native plant communities will concurrently provide refuge from predators and buffer against extreme temperatures, making ski runs more hospitable to reptiles. Based on our findings, we emphasize that effective management strategies targeting subalpine biodiversity conservation require an understanding of the drivers that determine species distributions in these landscapes.

AB  - Restoring native habitats in heavily cleared and fragmented areas such as agricultural landscapes is important to maintain and increase remaining native floral and faunal communities. Identifying priority vegetation types for restoration - as well as the parcels of land where this restoration could take place at a landscape scale - may assist in strategically protecting these biodiversity assets. To prioritise the restoration of terrestrial habitats around an ecologically and culturally significant Ramsar-listed wetland in South Australia, we used the spatial prioritisation tool Marxan. Originally designed for prioritising the protection of reserve areas, Marxan can also be used to identify parcels of land for restoration purposes. We tested how Marxan prioritised the restoration of four distinct vegetation types around the Coorong and Lower Lakes region of South Australia using the inverse of habitat remnancy as a cost and soil type and distance to ecologically significant bird species as a conservation feature. By prioritising restoration activities around certain landscape features, such as remnant areas, our results indicate that we would be able to strategically restore parcels of native habitat that would maximise biodiversity outcomes. This study highlights the need for robust input data, such as priority vegetation types and bird species associated with these habitats, to ensure informative modelling outputs. It also suggests that other measures, such as the cost of different land types, should be included in future restoration planning. Finally, we illustrate how prioritisation tools such as Marxan can be used by natural resource managers to restore areas within fragmented agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The impacts of invasive house miceMus musculushave received increasing attention on islands where mice are the only invasive rodent species. On Gough Island, the impact of mice on seabirds has increased over the past decade, but the current population status of the Critically Endangered Gough FinchRowettia goughensisis uncertain. Based on nest monitoring at high elevation sites in 2009 (n= 37) and 2018 (n= 45), we found mean nest survival of 55% in both years and a fecundity of 1.31 +/- 0.69 fledglings per pair in 2018. Density estimates from territory mapping in 2009 and 2018 were similar to past estimates and indicated little change in upland habitat. Density estimates from line transect distance sampling surveys around the island from 2018 to 2020 revealed higher densities in moorland (55.4 birds/km(2)) and wet heath (29.5 birds/km(2)) habitats, compared to coastal tussock (10.9 birds/km(2)) and lowland fern bush habitat (2.6 birds/km(2)). Extrapolating these habitat-specific densities across the island indicates a global population of Gough Finches in 2020 of 1917 individuals (95% CI: 1550-2500). Future population surveys using the same design could detect population changes of 40% or more. Our population estimate provides an important baseline for future monitoring following the planned eradication of house mice from Gough Island in 2021. However, we highlight that greater monitoring effort may be needed to increase the power to detect smaller population changes after an invasive species eradication.

AB  - Throughout the Mediterranean region, vegetation dynamics are affected by human activities which are either 'stresses' or 'disturbances', depending on their frequency, intensity and spatial distribution. To minimize or reduce anthropogenic degradation caused by land use and other disturbances, it is necessary to understand and predict the various responses of plant communities to disturbances. In particular, detailed but integrative approaches are required to assimilate large databases on vegetation and to make them directly useful for managers and restorers.
   We describe two case studies undertaken to evaluate the effects of logging or overgrazing on plant species diversity in pine forests of southern France and steppe ecosystems of southern Tunisia. Both studies employed the same methodology to identify plant functional traits (morphological, life history and regeneration traits) associated with community response to disturbance. The results of these analyses allowed us to develop state and transition models that could be used to plan and predict ecosystem trajectories, assess ongoing degradation processes and monitor community and ecosystem responses to management and restoration practices. We discuss the relevance and the use of plant functional types (PFTs) as tools for ecosystem management and planning and for monitoring restoration in southern Europe, northern Africa and elsewhere. Using this approach it is possible to improve management strategies for the conservation, restoration and sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and of ecosystems.

AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most pervasive agents of contemporary landscape change globally. Rapid land use change and competing land uses pose multiple challenges for biodiversity conservation, particularly in periurban fringe areas where suburban development encroaches into natural habitats. The quenda (Isoodon fusci-venter) is one of the very few ground-dwelling critical weight range mammals to persist in the peri-urban fringe of the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We investigated the genetic connectivity of 42 populations of quenda across the Greater Perth metropolitan region using microsatellites and generalised dissimilarity modelling to evaluate the impact of landscape elements on functional connectivity. Spatially-explicit Bayesian cluster analysis indicated quenda exhibit significant population structure across the Perth region, which, at the broadest scale, was associated with hydrological and topographical features. Inter-population genetic connectivity was facilitated by the presence of native vegetation, particularly low vegetation (< 1.4 m height) that is the species' preferred habitat. Surprisingly, measures of urbanisation were not significant predictors of gene flow, potentially as quenda show some characteristics of urban utilizers. Given the rapid pace of development in the region, knowledge on the distribution and population structure of quenda, and understanding the processes that contribute to them, provides a basis for a landscape conservation approach to urban planning. Retention of suitable habitat that facilitates persistence of this important mammal is critical.

AB  - Models for predicting marine mammal habitat are increasingly being developed to help answer questions about species' ecology, conservation, and management. Over the past 10 yr, the models and analyses presented at the Habitat Modelling Workshops of the Biennial Conference on the Biology of Marine Mammals have shown tremendous development in their breadth and complexity. At the 18th Biennial, held in Quebec City, Canada, in 2009 we noticed a change in how these models were presented. Instead of a focus on methods and model development, many researchers presented models highlighting ecological insights or management applications. We recognised this as a watershed moment for our discipline, the time when we started paying more attention to what our models were telling us than how to build them. To celebrate this progress, we invited researchers from the global marine mammal community to submit articles to this Theme Section of Endangered Species Research describing work that included not only advanced model development, but also emphasised ecological interpretation or management relevance. The resulting collection of articles highlights the leading science in marine mammal habitat modelling, and provides some important indications of how, as a community, we must continue to refine our methods to move beyond correlations towards understanding the processes that interact to create marine mammal habitat. While there will no doubt be future challenges to over-come, the articles in this collection raise the standard for marine mammal habitat modelling, and herald the transition from learning how to model, to using our models as a heuristic tool to support ecological understanding and marine spatial planning.

AB  - Natal dispersal promotes inter-population linkage, and is key to spatial distribution of populations. Degradation of suitable landscape structures beyond the specific threshold of an individual's ability to disperse can therefore lead to disruption of functional landscape connectivity and impact metapopulation function. Because it ignores behavioral responses of individuals, structural connectivity is easier to assess than functional connectivity and is often used as a surrogate for landscape connectivity modeling. However using structural resource selection models as surrogate for modeling functional connectivity through dispersal could be erroneous. We tested how well a second-order resource selection function (RSF) models (structural connectivity), based on GPS telemetry data from resident adult leopard (Panthera pardus L.), could predict subadult habitat use during dispersal (functional connectivity). We created eight non-exclusive subsets of the subadult data based on differing definitions of dispersal to assess the predictive ability of our adult-based RSF model extrapolated over a broader landscape. Dispersing leopards used habitats in accordance with adult selection patterns, regardless of the definition of dispersal considered. We demonstrate that, for a wide-ranging apex carnivore, functional connectivity through natal dispersal corresponds to structural connectivity as modeled by a second-order RSF. Mapping of the adult-based habitat classes provides direct visualization of the potential linkages between populations, without the need to model paths between a priori starting and destination points. The use of such landscape scale RSFs may provide insight into predicting suitable dispersal habitat peninsulas in human-dominated landscapes where mitigation of human-wildlife conflict should be focused. We recommend the use of second-order RSFs for landscape conservation planning and propose a similar approach to the conservation of other wide-ranging large carnivore species where landscape-scale resource selection data already exist.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation has been generally regarded detrimental to the persistence of many species, especially those with limited dispersal abilities. Yet, when exactly habitat elements become functionally disconnected very much depends on the dispersal ability of a species in combination with the landscape's composition in which it occurs. Surprisingly, for many small and ground-walking generalists knowledge at what spatial scale and to what extent landscape structure affects dispersal is very scarce. Because it is flightless, the bush cricket Pholidoptera griseoaptera may be regarded susceptible to fragmentation. We applied habitat occupancy surveys, population genetic analyses and movement modelling to investigate the performance of P. griseoaptera in an agricultural mosaic landscape with suitable habitat patches of varying size and isolation. Despite its presumed dispersal limitation we could show that P. griseoaptera occupied the majority of suitable habitats, including small and isolated patches, showed a very low and non-significant genetic differentiation (F (ST) = 0.0072) and, in the model, managed to colonize around 73% of all suitable habitat patches within one generation under weak and strong landscape-effect scenarios. We conclude that P. griseoaptera possesses the behavioural attributes (frequent inter-patch dispersal) necessary to persist in this landscape characterized by a patchy distribution of habitat elements. Yet, sound recommendations to landscape planning and conservation require more research to determine whether this represents a general behaviour of the species or a behavioural adaptation to this particular landscape.

AB  - The tri-spine horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus, is a threatened species that inhabits coastal areas from South to East Asia. A Conservation management system is urgently required for managing its nursery habitats, i.e., intertidal flats, especially in Japan. Habitat suitability maps are useful in drafting conservation plans; however, they have rarely been prepared for juvenile T. tridentatus. In this study, we examined the possibility of constructing robust habitat suitability models (HSMs) for juveniles based on topographical data acquired using unmanned aerial vehicles and the Structure from Motion (UAV-SfM) technique. The distribution data of the juveniles in the Tsuyazaki and Imazu intertidal flats from 2017 to 2019 were determined. The data were divided into a training dataset for HSM construction and three test datasets for model evaluation. High accuracy digital surface models were built for each region using the UAV-SfM technique. Normalized elevation was assessed by converting the topographical models that consider the tidal range in each region, and the slope was calculated based on these models. Using the training data, HSMs of the juveniles were constructed with normalized elevation and slope as the predictor variables. The HSMs were evaluated using the test data. The results showed that HSMs exhibited acceptable discrimination performance for each region. Habitat suitability maps were built for the juveniles in each region, and the suitable areas were estimated to be approximately 6.1 ha of the total 19.5 ha in Tuyazaki, and 3.7 ha of the total 7.9 ha area in Imazu. In conclusion, our findings support the usefulness of the UAV-SfM technique in constructing HSMs for juvenile T. tridentatus. The monitoring of suitable habitat areas for the juveniles using the UAV-SfM technique is expected to reduce survey costs, as it can be conducted with fewer investigators over vast intertidal zones within a short period of time.

AB  - Chimaeras such as Chimaera monstrosa and Hydrolagus mirabilis are commonly found in commercial bycatch of deep-sea fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic. Very little information exists on their life history, ecology or behaviour. Segregation of populations by sex and/or age classes has been demonstrated in several elasmobranchs, but whether segregation occurs in chimaeras, and if so what mechanisms are involved, remains unknown. This study investigates the distribution and sexual segregation of four species of chimaera (C. monstrosa, H. mirabilis, C. opalescens n. sp. and Harriotta raleighana) in relation to sex, size (maturity) class, bottom depth, and latitude. Data were obtained from annual trawl surveys undertaken by Marine Scotland, Aberdeen, from 1998-2009, at 400-2000 m in the Northeast Atlantic (55-598N 5-118W). A factorial General Linear Model (GLM) with planned contrasts indicated complex patterns of age-and sex-related segregation. All adult males and females were sexually segregated by depth: in all four species investigated females occurred at greater depths than males. Potential birthing grounds were identified for H. mirabilis. Latitudinal spatial segregation was not evident in relation to sex or maturity stage. The patterns of segregation reported here suggest a potential for differential exploitation of the sexes by spatially focused fisheries.

AB  - Lontra longicaudis is a top predator of freshwater systems currently categorized as 'data deficient' by the IUCN. Thus far, no genetic studies have been carried out in Argentina. Using 8 microsatellite loci, we analysed the genetic diversity and individual relatedness in a population located at the Lower Delta of Parana River, Argentina. Our data, together with available genetic information for other populations and habitat suitability data obtained from species distribution models previously published, were used to test whether genetic diversity, inbreeding, and parentage coefficients are related to habitat suitability both at landscape and at regional scale. Our results show that the levels of heterozygosity found in the Lower Delta are lowest reported to date. A low overall degree of relatedness between otter dyads was found. However, almost 20% showed relatedness values higher than 0.25, suggesting local reproduction. Finally, we found a positive association between habitat quality and levels of heterozygosity, both at landscape and regional scale, suggesting that in highly suitable habitats, the otters are genetically more variable. Our study constitutes the first one on the genetics of L. longicaudis in Argentina and provides baseline information for the development of conservation plans for the Lower Parana River Delta population.

AB  - Few ecological studies have explored landscape suitability using the gradient concept of landscape structure for wildlife species. Identification of conditions influencing the landscape ecology of endangered species allows for development of more robust recovery strategies. Our objectives were to (i) identify the range of landscape metrics (i.e., mean patch area; patch and edge densities; percent land cover; shape, aggregation, and largest patch indices) associated with woody vegetation used by ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), and (ii) quantify the potential distribution of suitable woody cover for ocelots across southern Texas. We used the gradient concept of landscape structure and the theory of slack combined with GPS telemetry data from 10 ocelots. Spatial distribution of high suitable woody cover is comprised of large patches, with low shape-index values (1.07-2.25), patch (27.21-72.50 patches/100 ha), and edge (0-191.50 m/ha) densities. High suitability landscape structure for ocelots occurs in 45.27% of woody cover in southern Texas. Our study demonstrates a new approach for measuring landscape suitability for ocelots in southern Texas. The range of landscape values identified that there are more large woody patches containing the spatial structure used by ocelots than previously suspected, which will aid in evaluating recovery and road planning efforts.

AB  - An understanding of patterns of climatic niche evolution has important implications for ecological and evolutionary theory and conservation planning. However, despite considerable testing, niche evolution studies continue to focus on clade-wide, homogeneous patterns, without considering the potentially complex dynamics (i.e. phylogenetic non-stationarity) along the evolutionary history of a clade. Here, we examine the dynamics of climatic niche evolution in vipers and discuss its implication for their current patterns of diversity and distribution. We use comparative phylogenetic methods and global-scale datasets, including 210 viper species with phylogenetic and climatic data. We find that climatic niche evolution in Viperidae shows an overall pattern of phylogenetic conservatism, but with different dynamics depending on the niche feature (niche breadth or niche position) and the evolutionary history of particular lineages within the family, thus resulting in phylogenetic non-stationarity. Indeed, we find several shifts in niche breadth evolution that were probably influenced by the main geological and environmental changes experienced during the evolutionary history of the family. These results highlight the importance of considering complex patterns of climatic niche evolution and their role in shaping patterns of diversity and distribution.

AB  - Clonal plants provide a challenge to ecological management and restoration programs. Clonal plants frequently occur as few genets over large spatial scales and may persist for hundreds of years. Hence population structures, effective population sizes and breeding systems of clonal plants are not well understood or managed at scales applicable to non-clonal species. This is a critical issue because clonality is a common trait including among threatened plants and more studies into the management requirements of clonal plant species are required. We investigate the impact of reducing the population size of a highly clonal species and how these impacts can be minimized.Persoonia hindiihas a restricted distribution in forested ridges on Newnes Plateau west of Sydney, Australia. We collated data and surveyed populations, undertook assessments of reproductive patterns (flowering; pollination; fruit set and fall), and modelled pollen dispersal among genets. We relate this assessment to planning approaches uninformed by genet structure and reproductive patterns. Small sites likely function as discrete populations, each with low numbers of genets. Genet diversity at this site scale is important as it is associated with increased fruit set. Loss of plants from populations poses a significant risk to population level fitness if genet diversity is reduced. There is an urgent need for more biologically informed approaches for the management of clonal plant species.

AB  - Population connectivity and spatial distribution are fundamentally related to ecology, evolution and behaviour. Here, we combined powerful genetic analysis with simulations of particle dispersal in a high-resolution ocean circulation model to investigate the distribution of green turtles foraging at the remote Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, central Pacific. We analysed mitochondrial sequences from turtles (n = 349) collected there over 5 years (2008-2012). Genetic analysis assigned natal origins almost exclusively (approx. 97%) to the West Central and South Central Pacific combined Regional Management Units. Further, our modelling results indicated that turtles could potentially drift from rookeries to Palmyra Atoll via surface currents along a near-Equatorial swathe traversing the Pacific. Comparing findings from genetics and modelling highlighted the complex impacts of ocean currents and behaviour on natal origins. Although the Palmyra feeding ground was highly differentiated genetically from others in the Indo-Pacific, there was no significant differentiation among years, sexes or stage-classes at the Refuge. Understanding the distribution of this foraging population advances knowledge of green turtles and contributes to effective conservation planning for this threatened species.

AB  - The South Sandwich Islands (SSI) are a chain of volcanic islands located to the east of the Scotia Sea, approximately 700 km south-east of South Georgia. To date, knowledge of the SSI benthic environment remains limited. In this context, the Blue Belt Programme conducted a scientific survey in the SSI Marine Protected Area (MPA) during February/March 2019 to examine the biodiversity and distribution of benthic communities and their potential vulnerability to licensed longline research fisheries. Here we report results from analysis of multibeam echosounder (MBES) data and drop camera imagery data collected in selected locations around the SSI. A total of eight vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) indicator morphotaxa were mapped along the slopes of the SSI, showing a substantial variation in taxon composition and frequency of occurrence, both along bathymetric and latitudinal gradients. Our results suggest that VME indicator taxa are mostly restricted to waters shallower than 700 m. As such, based on our present understanding of the region's benthic environment the MPA, as currently established, offers effective protection for the majority of the VME indicator taxa.

AB  - Precise measures of population abundance and trend are needed for species conservation; these are most difficult to obtain for rare and rapidly changing populations. We compare uncertainty in densities estimated from spatio-temporal models with that from standard design-based methods. Spatio-temporal models allow us to target priority areas where, and at times when, a population may most benefit. Generalised additive models were fitted to a 31-year time series of point-transect surveys of an endangered Hawaiian forest bird, the Hawai'i 'akepaLoxops coccineus. This allowed us to estimate bird densities over space and time. We used two methods to quantify uncertainty in density estimates from the spatio-temporal model: the delta method (which assumes independence between detection and distribution parameters) and a variance propagation method. With the delta method we observed a 52% decrease in the width of the design-based 95% confidence interval (CI), while we observed a 37% decrease in CI width when propagating the variance. We mapped bird densities as they changed across space and time, allowing managers to evaluate management actions. Integrating detection function modelling with spatio-temporal modelling exploits survey data more efficiently by producing finer-grained abundance estimates than are possible with design-based methods as well as producing more precise abundance estimates. Model-based approaches require switching from making assumptions about the survey design to assumptions about bird distribution. Such a switch warrants consideration. In this case the model-based approach benefits conservation planning through improved management efficiency and reduced costs by taking into account both spatial shifts and temporal changes in population abundance and distribution.

AB  - As increasingly large extents of the global oceans are being managed through spatial measures, it is important to identify area characteristics underlying network distributions. Studies discerning spatial patterns in marine management have disproportionately focused on global networks. This paper instead considers the single country context of Japan to illuminate within-country drivers of area-based conservation and fishery management. A dataset containing potentially relevant socioeconomic, environmental, and fisheries factors was assembled and used to model prefecture-level counts of marine protected areas (MPAs) and territorial use rights for fisheries (TURFs) throughout Japan's waters. Several factors were found to significantly influence the number of TURFs in a particular area, whereas MPA patterns of use remain largely unexplained. TURFs are frequently noted as more suitable for managing fisheries of low mobility species and our analysis finds greater use of TURFs in areas that rely heavily on benthic catch. The number of trading ports was also found to be positively related to TURF distributions, suggesting economic infrastructure may influence the use of this fisheries management tool. In-line with global analyses, MPA patterns of use were not found to be significantly related to any of the potential explanatory variables after correcting for the number of statistical comparisons that were carried out. Differences in our ability to model the use of TURFs and MPAs may arise due to the narrower objectives associated with the former (e.g., income, employment) in comparison to the often broad and varied goals that motivate use of the latter.

AB  - The Plio-Pleistocene refugia hypothesis recently gained support in explaining Brazilian Atlantic Forest megadiversity from combined analyses of species paleodistributions and genetic diversity. Here we examine genetic differentiation and historical distributions in the Rhinella crucifer group of toads, endemic to and widely distributed within this biome. We analyzed sequences of mitochondrial (control region, ND1, and ND2) and nuclear (beta-crystallin and rhodopsin) DNA markers from 65 individuals representing five species. We found deep structure across the range at mitochondrial markers; genetic diversity is geographically structured in four main haplotype clades with the oldest divergence, dated to the Pliocene, between the southernmost populations and other regions of the species' range. Remaining populations are distributed in haplotype clades that may have diverged throughout the Pleistocene. Our paleoecological distribution models support a scenario of habitat fragmentation associated with glacial cycling, but we found limited congruence of phylogeographic patterns with the refugia. We found that some genetic breaks geographically coincide with putative barriers associated to neotectonic activity, but finer-scale sampling will be necessary to test the relative importance of distinct isolation mechanisms. Overall, the data refute the recently proposed hypothesis of a southern Holocene colonization of the Atlantic Forest from northern refugia, suggesting instead persistence of forested habitats in the south. Our unexpected results underscore the need to consider distinct organismal histories in planning biome-level conservation. We discuss species correspondence to clades recovered in our phylogenetic analyses. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Populations of the European wildcat (Felis silvestris) are only slowly recovering in Central Europe after a severe decline in the last centuries and require specific conservation plans in many areas. However, detailed information on wildcat occurrence and habitat requirements is still scarce and controversial. We present a fine-scale habitat selection model for wildcats based on detailed species and land use information and evaluate its accuracy to predict habitat distribution in new areas. We analysed habitat use within home ranges using single locations of 12 radio-tracked individuals from south western Germany. Several competing models were fitted and compared using generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) and information-theoretic approaches. Radio-tracking data of 9 and 10 wildcats from two distant areas were used to evaluate the models. The selected model predicted habitat associated to close distance to forest, watercourses and meadows and a critical distance to villages, single houses and roads. To predict area suitable for home ranges we superimposed rules derived from home range attributes at a higher level of selection. Predictions from the combination of the fine-scale habitat model and home range rules matched well with more than 2000 wildcat observations of southwestern Germany. We discuss the application of the model in wildcat conservation for finding potential reintroduction sites, identifying small isolated populations and aiding in the evaluation of the needs of mitigation and compensation within the scope of the European Habitats Directive.

AB  - Our goal was to build a geographic information system (GIS) tool to enhance modeling and hypothesis testing relevant to watersheds and fish fauna of the Red and Sabine Rivers in the southeastern United States. Species of concern were identified from wildlife action plans and Web sites. Spatial distributions of fish species and mercury in fillets were delineated using data from states. Public georeferenced data were obtained on land cover, soil type, forest canopy, impervious surfaces, wastewater facilities and 303(d) impaired waters. Overlay maps highlighted patterns across 8-digit hydrologic unit codes (HUCs). Bossier City, Louisiana and Beaumont, Texas areas displayed impervious surfaces over 10% and 303(d) waters per HUC were 20% and 8%, respectively. Because bowfin (Amia calva) (n?=?299) and bass (Micropterus spp.) (n?=?1493) occurred in up to 44% of HUCs and fillets contained elemental mercury concentrations across ranges monitored, they were appropriate indicators of bioavailable mercury. Of the total fish number showing >0.5?ppm, 81% of records were derived from bowfin and bass, and stepwise multiple linear regressions indicated fish with mercury at these concentrations correlated with environmental variables. Detrended correspondence analysis showed total species occurrence and environmental relationships significant, where 81.6% of the variability in fish occurrence was explained by impervious surface, land cover other than canopy or impervious surface (such as wetlands and agricultural area) and canopy (forest type). Two-way indicator species analysis delineated species co-occurrence in HUCs (14 groups) and similarity of species composition (nine groups). Results identified three HUC groupings as potential targets for managerial interest. Quality control concerns for GIS development included site name data and priority rankings of critical fish species. This tool can be used to support modeling and trend analyses for several purposes, such as those relevant for developing and reporting on water quality standards and critical habitat assessments.

AB  - Knowledge of species' geographic distributions is critical for understanding and forecasting population dynamics, responses to environmental change, biodiversity patterns, and conservation planning. While many suggestive correlative occurrence models have been used to these ends, progress lies in understanding the underlying population biology that generates patterns of range dynamics. Here, we show how to use a limited quantity of demographic data to produce demographic distribution models (DDMs) using integral projection models for size-structured populations. By modeling survival, growth, and fecundity using regression, integral projection models can interpolate across missing size data and environmental conditions to compensate for limited data. To accommodate the uncertainty associated with limited data and model assumptions, we use Bayesian models to propagate uncertainty through all stages of model development to predictions. DDMs have a number of strengths: 1) DDMs allow a mechanistic understanding of spatial occurrence patterns; 2) DDMs can predict spatial and temporal variation in local population dynamics; 3) DDMs can facilitate extrapolation under altered environmental conditions because one can evaluate the consequences for individual vital rates. To illustrate these features, we construct DDMs for an overstory perennial shrub in the Proteaceae family in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. We find that the species' population growth rate is limited most strongly by adult survival throughout the range and by individual growth in higher rainfall regions. While the models predict higher population growth rates in the core of the range under projected climates for 2050, they also suggest that the species faces a threat along arid range margins from the interaction of more frequent fire and drying climate. The results (and uncertainties) are helpful for prioritizing additional sampling of particular demographic parameters along these gradients to iteratively refine projections. In the appendices, we provide fully functional R code to perform all analyses.

AB  - Understanding the effects of landscape composition and configuration, climate, and topography on bird diversity is necessary to identify distribution drivers, potential impacts of land use changes, and future conservation strategies. We surveyed bird communities in a study area located in the Central Alps (Autonomous Province of South Tyrol, northeast Italy), by means of point counts and investigated taxonomic and functional diversity at two spatial scales along gradients of land use/land cover (LULC) intensity and elevation. We also explored how environmental variables influence bird traits and red-list categories. Models combining drivers of different types were highly supported, pointing towards synergetic effects of different types of environmental variables on bird communities. The model containing only LULC compositional variables was the most supported one among the single-group models: LULC composition plays a crucial role in shaping local biodiversity and hence bird communities, even across broad landscape gradients. Particularly relevant were wetlands, open habitats, agricultural mosaics made up of small habitat patches and settlements, ecotonal and structural elements in agricultural settings, and continuous forests. To conserve bird diversity in the Alps, planning and management practices promoting and maintaining small fields, structural elements, and a mosaic of different LULC types should be supported, while preserving continuous forests at the same time. Additionally, pastures, extensively used meadows, and wetlands are key to conservation. These strategies might mitigate the impacts of global change on bird diversity in the Alps and in other European mountain areas.

AB  - Edge effects of native forest fragmentation have been well studied, but there are few studies of open-ground habitats fragmented by plantation forests. We measure forestry edge effects on open-ground breeding birds, following one of Europe's biggest and most controversial land-use transformations. The Flow Country' of northern Scotland is one of the world's greatest expanses of blanket bog. It became fragmented by conifer forests planted in the late 20th century, and these now adjoin open peatlands protected under European conservation legislation. Detrimental edge effects on breeding birds were anticipated, but not apparent shortly after planting. Using survey data collected in 2003-2006, and logistic regression modelling, we tested whether breeding distributions of three wader species of international conservation concern, dunlin, European golden plover and common greenshank, were influenced by distance to forest edge, controlling for habitat and topography. All three species were more likely to occupy flatter, more exposed ground close to bog pools and were influenced by peatland vegetation structure. There was an additive and adverse effect of proximity to forest edge for dunlin and European golden plover, but not common greenshank. This effect was strongest within 700m of forest edges. We used these results to predict which areas should benefit most from removal of adjacent forestry and so guide maintenance and restoration of the bird interests of the protected areas.Synthesis and applications. Edge effects of mature forestry on dunlin and golden plover are apparent over several hundred metres and are now being used to guide forest planning in northern Scotland. The scale of edge effect is broadly consistent with other avian studies in open-ground habitats across Eurasia and North America, so buffer zones of this order are consistent with possible impacts of plantation forestry on open-ground habitats of bird conservation interest. Given renewed interest in conifer afforestation as a climate change mitigation measure, an improved understanding of edge effects and the mechanisms through which they operate is vital to managing plantation forestry in ways that maintain open-ground landscapes of high conservation value.

AB  - The global redistribution of biodiversity will intensify in the coming decades of climate change, making projections of species range shifts and of associated genetic losses important components of conservation planning. Highly-structured marine species, notably brown seaweeds, often harbor unique genetic variation at warmer low-latitude rear edges and thus are of particular concern. Here, a combination of Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) and molecular data is used to forecast the potential near-future impacts of climate change for a warm-temperate, canopy forming seaweed, Bifurcaria bifurcata. ENMs for B. bifurcata were developed using marine and terrestrial climatic variables, and its range projected for 2040-50 and 2090-2100 under two greenhouse emission scenarios. Geographical patterns of genetic diversity were assessed by screening 18 populations spawning the entire distribution for two organelle genes and 6 microsatellite markers. The southern limit of B. bifurcata was predicted to shift northwards to central Morocco by the mid-century. By 2090-2100, depending on the emission scenario, it could either retreat further north to western Iberia or be relocated back to Western Sahara. At the opposing margin, B. bifurcata was predicted to expand its range to Scotland or even Norway. Microsatellite diversity and endemism were highest in Morocco, where a unique and very restricted lineage was also identified. Our results imply that B. bifurcata will maintain a relatively broad latitudinal distribution. Although its persistence is not threatened, the predicted extirpation of a unique southern lineage or even the entire Moroccan diversity hotspot will erase a rich evolutionary legacy and shrink global diversity to current (low) European levels. NW Africa and similarly understudied southern regions should receive added attention if expected range changes and diversity loss of warm-temperate species is not to occur unnoticed.

AB  - The tropical rain forests of Central Africa contain high levels of species diversity. Paleovegetation or bio-diversity patterns suggested successive contraction/expansion phases on this rain forest cover during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Consequently, the hypothesis of the existence of refugia e.g. habitat stability that harbored populations during adverse climatic periods has been proposed. Understory species are tightly associated to forest cover and consequently are ideal markers of forest dynamics. Here, we used two central African rain forest understory species of the palm genus, Podococcus, to assess the role of past climate variation on their distribution and genetic diversity. Species distribution modeling in the present and at the LGM was used to estimate areas of climatic stability. Genetic diversity and phylogeography were estimated by sequencing near complete plastomes for over 120 individuals. Areas of climatic stability were mainly located in mountainous areas like the Monts de Cristal and Monts Doudou in Gabon, but also lowland coastal forests in southeast Cameroon and northeast Gabon. Genetic diversity analyses shows a clear North-South structure of genetic diversity within one species. This divide was estimated to have originated some 500,000 years ago. We show that, in Central Africa, high and unique genetic diversity is strongly correlated with inferred areas of climatic stability since the LGM. Our results further highlight the importance of coastal lowland rain forests in Central Africa as harboring not only high species diversity but also important high levels of unique genetic diversity. In the context of strong human pressure on coastal land use and destruction, such unique diversity hotspots need to be considered in future conservation planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mauka-to-makai (mountain to sea in the Hawaiian language) hydrologic connectivity - commonly referred to as ridge-to-reef - directly affects biogeochemical processes and socioecological functions across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. The supply of freshwater to estuarine and nearshore environments in a ridge-to-reef system supports the food, water, and habitats utilized by marine fauna. In addition, the ecosystem services derived from this land-to-sea connectivity support social and cultural practices (hereafter referred to as sociocultural) including fishing, aquaculture, wetland agriculture, religious ceremonies, and recreational activities. To effectively guide island resource management, a better understanding of the linkages from ridge-to-reef across natural and social usages is critical, particularly in the context of climate change, with anticipated increasing temperature and shifting precipitation patterns. The objective of this study was to identify spatial linkages that promote multiple and diverse uses, following the ridge-to-reef concept, at an island-wide scale to identify regions of high conservation importance for aquatic resources. We selected the Island of Maui as a study representative of many Pacific islands. Diverse datasets, including agricultural lands within watersheds, wetland locations, presence of stream species, indicators of freshwater input from streams, coral cover, nearshore fish biomass, sociocultural data such as fishpond locations, wetland taro cultivation, beach recreation use, and lastly the dynamically downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase (CMIP5) future climate projections scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 & 8.5) were used to examine the spatial linkages through hydrological connectivity from land to the sea. Zonation spatial planning software was used to prioritize areas of high management and conservation value and to help inform aquatic resources management. The resulting prioritized areas included many minimally disturbed watersheds in east Maui and western nearshore and coastal zones that are adjacent to diverse coral reefs. These results are driven by the importance of fish biomass and coral reef distribution as well as traditional wetland taro cultivation and coastal access points for recreation. These results underline the importance of examining ridge-to-reef systems for aquatic resource management and including important social and cultural values in resource management upon planning adaptation strategies for climate change. Improving our understanding of diverse natural and socio-cultural influences on habitat conditions and their values in these areas provides an opportunity to strategically plan future management and conservation actions.

AB  - Application of instream habitat models such as the Mesohabitat Simulation Model (MesoHABSIM) is becoming increasingly popular. Such models can predict alteration to a river physical habitat caused by hydropower operation or river training. They are a tool for water management planning, especially in terms of requirements of the Water Framework Directive. Therefore, model verification studies, which investigate the accuracy and reliability of the results generated, are essential. An electrofishing survey was conducted in September 2014 on the Stura di Demonte River located in north-western Italy. One hundred and sixteen bullheadCottus gobio L.were captured in 80 pre-exposed area electrofishing (PAE) grids. Observations of bullhead distribution in various habitats were used to validate MesoHABSIM model predictions created with inductive and deductive habitat suitability indices. The inductive statistical models used electrofishing data obtained from multiple mountainous streams, analyzed with logistic regression. The deductive approach was based on conditional habitat suitability criteria (CHSC) derived from expert knowledge and information gathered from the literature about species behaviour and habitat use. The results of model comparison and validation show that although the inductive models are more precise and reflect site- and species-specific characteristics, the CHSC model provides quite similar results. We propose to use inductive models for detailed planning of measures that could potentially impair riverine ecosystems at a local scale, since the CHSC model provides general information about habitat suitability and use of such models is advised in pre-development or generic scale studies. However, the CHSC model can be further calibrated with localized electrofishing data at a lower cost than development of an inductive model.

AB  - Empirical habitat selection models aid managers by predicting distribution patterns, but recent critiques urge a fuller, application of available methods. We used a suite of habitat modelling techniques to identify factors influencing the distribution of brown-headed cow-birds (Molothrus ater), a brood parasite capable of causing population declines in some host species. We used data on cowbird occurrence in the Southern Gulf Islands, Canada, to estimate the influence of landscape features on cowbird distribution beginning with a set of a priori models based on literature. Best models were also constructed using stepwise logistic and autologistic regression, and using only widely available data, and these models and their predictive maps were then evaluated. Cowbirds were predicted by proximity to potential feeding areas and landscape context. The best logistic model included landcover, cattle, and distance to urban area and agriculture. Model performance was improved by autologistic regression, and models restricted to widely available data were only slightly poorer. All models were robust to internal validation using bootstrapping and when compared to an independent empirical dataset of parasitism rates of a host on 12 sites monitored for up to 8 years. Our predictive maps for cowbirds should help land managers make spatial predictions about cowbird impact on particular hosts, as well as evaluate land-use decisions that could influence cowbird abundance and host fitness. We evaluated several approaches to habitat modelling of interest to conservationists and make suggestions for future studies when spatial predictions are likely to affect decisions in conservation and land use planning.

AB  - The global population of domestic dogs is estimated at 900 million, making them the world's most abundant carnivore. Southeast Asia is considered extremely vulnerable to wildlife declines linked to free-ranging dogs, yet few studies report specific cases of dog-wildlife interactions in this region. To overcome this lack of data, the perceived risk to bird and mammal species from free-ranging domestic dogs was modelled using Bayesian networks considering the life history traits of each individual species. The spatial distribution of perceived risk across Southeast Asia was then modelled using a Bayesian network incorporating landscape and demographic characteristics. The number of species considered as high perceived risk in the region was over five times that previously reported. Overall, 11% of bird species and 10% of mammal species were classified as at high perceived risk from free-ranging domestic dogs and eight of these species were listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered by the IUCN Redlist. Furthermore, 50% of mainland Southeast Asia was predicted to be of high perceived risk from free-ranging domestic dogs with only 9% of the region considered as low perceived risk. When empirical data is lacking on IUCN Redlist assessments, incorporation of single threat models can provide missing information critical for accurate evaluation. It is recommended that species are re-evaluated considering domestic dogs as a threat and that this study be used as a template to assist in the development of species action plans and to define key areas where dog management needs to be considered. Management practices should be culturally appropriate and overall promote responsible pet ownership.

AB  - Understanding factors that influence and predict grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) distribution and abundance is fundamental to their conservation. In southeast British Columbia, Canada, we applied DNA hair-trap sampling (1) to evaluate relationships of grizzly bear detections with landscape variables of habitat and human activity, and (2) to model the spatial distribution and abundance of grizzly bears. During 1996-1998, we sampled grizzly bear occurrence across 5,496 km(2) at sites distributed according to grid cells. We compared 244 combinations of sampling sites and sessions where grizzly bears were detected (determined by nDNA analyses) to 845 site-sessions where they were not. We tested for differences in 30 terrain, vegetation, land cover, and human influence variables at 3 spatial scales. Grizzly bears more often were detected in landscapes of relatively high elevation, steep slope, rugged terrain, and low human access and linear disturbance densities. These landscapes also were comprised of more avalanche chutes, alpine tundra, barren surfaces, burned forests, and less young and logged forests. Relationships with forest productivity and some overstory species were positive at broader scales, while associations with forest overstory and productivity were negative at the finest scale. At the finest scale, the strong negative association with very young, logged forests and with increasing values of the Landsat-derived green vegetation index became positive when analyzed in a multivariate context. For multivariate analyses, we considered 2 variables together with 11 principal components that describe ecological gradients among 4 variable groupings. We applied multiple logistic regression and used AIC to rank and weight competing subset models. We derived coefficients for interpretation and prediction using multi-model inference. The resulting function was highly predictive, which we confirmed against an independent dataset. We transformed the output using a multi-annual population estimate for the sampling area, and we applied the resulting grizzly bear density and distribution model across our greater study area as a strategic-level planning tool. We discuss conservation applications and design considerations of this DNA-based approach for grizzly bears and other forest-dwelling species.

AB  - Mammalian carnivores are particularly relevant for ecosystem functioning, but for many Neotropical species, dietary information is scarce or unevenly sampled across their distribution. Understanding the influence of predator-prey body mass relationships on species' diets offers an opportunity to predict the interactions taking place in real food webs and estimate the most likely interactions to take place in undersampled areas. We compiled quantitative data on the diets of 12 Neotropical species of Carnivora from 99 studies and investigated the performance of statistical models in estimating their dietary patterns using predator-prey body mass ratios as predictors. We fitted models at three levels: order; non-felids and felids; predator species. The consumption patterns of prey species were highly variable according to the body mass of predators, but we found a general consistency across species, with prey consumed more frequently usually having less than 5% of the body mass of the predator. Although our analysis suggests an overall pattern on the relationship between the body mass of predators and their prey, the predictive power of the model increased considerably when considering predator group (felid and non-felid) or species. This highlights that accounting for the variation in resource-use patterns between species improves the predictability of interaction patterns. Models using predator-prey body mass ratios as predictors can be useful to infer trophic interactions, providing a baseline estimation of the relative frequency of consumption of different prey by predators. This information is essential to plan and assess the outcomes of conservation initiatives aimed at maintaining predators and prey populations, ecosystem health, and prevention of human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - The Southern Ground-Hornbill Bucorvus leadbeateri (SGH) is regarded as Vulnerable globally and Endangered in South Africa as a result of losing close to 70% of its range and 50% of its historic population in the country. One of the conservation tools being used to address this issue and restore the population to its historic range is reintroductions. The aim of this study was to identify and prioritise probable reintroduction sites in the Mopane Bioregion and the Limpopo and Mpumalanga sections of the Lowveld Bioregion of South Africa (all in the Savanna Biome), by using a niche-based modelling technique (Maxent) combined with GIS analyses. Suitable SGH habitat was determined for farms in the study area and evaluated for the absence of mappable threats. Three priority areas were identified for reintroductions. These areas are in a near-natural state, offer sufficient habitat, are free of mappable threats and are close to formally protected areas. Field surveys of these three priority areas are needed next to validate their suitability for reintroduction purposes. This is the first spatially explicit reintroduction plan for the SGH that has been developed and will contribute to conservationists' efforts to conserve the SGH.

AB  - Global change is expected to impact on the distribution and abundance of forests. Spain represents the southwestern limit of distribution for several types of deciduous forests and, as part of the Mediterranean Basin, it has all the characteristics to be affected by climate change. This study analyses the effects of climate change on habitat suitability and vulnerability in four categories of deciduous forests: Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Leibl., Quercus robur L. and Betula celtiberica Rothm. and Vasc. The approach combines an ensemble platform for species distribution models (SDMs) using three algorithms applied to four global circulation models (GCMs) driven by two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Bioclimatic, biogeographic, soil and topographic variables were taken into consideration as predictors to build 320 single distribution models. Ensemble-forecasting models were then produced for each forest category and RCPs by computing a consensus of single-model projections. The adapted proposal of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was also applied to deal with the uncertainty and notify the likelihood of the outcomes . The results revealed generalized losses in habitat suitability compared to current conditions for all the forest categories, which were more drastic for the RCP 8.5 emission pathway. Exceptions worth noting are forests of Fagus sylvatica (likelihood 25%-50%) and Quercus robur (likelihood 75%-100%) in the Orocantabrian biogeographic subprovince, and Quercus petraea formations in the Cantabrian Atlantic subprovince (likelihood 25%50%). Betula celtiberica would suffer the largest losses of habitat suitability under the climate change scenarios analysed. The vulnerability analysis confirmed that the deciduous formations least affected by climate change in future will be the Orocantabrian forests, while the Pyrenean and Oroiberian communities are the most vulnerable. The models developed in this study provide decision-makers with basic information and a useful tool for designing plans for the conservation and management of these forests in order to mitigate the impact of climate change. The study also highlights the importance and usefulness of conducting analyses at the biogeographic level, since the effects of climate change may be different and require management and conservation policies at local level.

AB  - Collisions between aircraft and birds, so-called "bird strikes," can result in serious damage to aircraft and even in the loss of lives. Information about the distribution of birds in the air and on the ground can be used to reduce the risk of bird strikes and their impact on operations en route and in and around air fields. Although a wealth of bird distribution and density data is collected by numerous organizations, these data are not readily available nor interpretable by aviation. This paper presents two national efforts, one in the Netherlands and one in the United States, to develop bird avoidance nodels for aviation. These models integrate data and expert knowledge on bird distributions and migratory behavior to provide hazard maps in the form of GIS-enabled Web services. Both models are in operational use for flight planning and flight alteration and for airfield and airfield vicinity management. These models and their presentation on the Internet are examples of the type of service that would be very useful in other fields interested in species distribution and movement information, such as conservation, disease transmission and prevention, or assessment and mitigation of anthropogenic risks to nature. We expect that developments in cyber-technology, a transition toward an open source philosophy, and higher demand for accessible biological data will result in an increase in the number of biological information systems available on the Internet.

AB  - Methods to quantify the vulnerability of species to extinction are typically limited by the availability of species-specific input data pertaining to life-history characteristics and population dynamics. This lack of data hampers global biodiversity assessments and conservation planning. Here, we developed a new framework that systematically quantifies extinction risk based on allometric relationships between various wildlife demographic parameters and body size. These allometric relationships have a solid theoretical and ecological foundation. Extinction risk indicators included are (1) the probability of extinction, (2) the mean time to extinction, and (3) the critical patch size. We applied our framework to assess the global extinction vulnerability of terrestrial carnivorous and non-carnivorous birds and mammals. Irrespective of the indicator used, large-bodied species were found to be more vulnerable to extinction than their smaller counterparts. The patterns with body size were confirmed for all species groups by a comparison with IUCN data on the proportion of extant threatened species: the models correctly predicted a multimodal distribution with body size for carnivorous birds and a monotonic distribution for mammals and non-carnivorous birds. Carnivorous mammals were found to have higher extinction risks than non-carnivores, while birds were more prone to extinction than mammals. These results are explained by the allometric relationships, predicting the vulnerable species groups to have lower intrinsic population growth rates, smaller population sizes, lower carrying capacities, or larger dispersal distances, which, in turn, increase the importance of losses due to environmental stochastic effects and dispersal activities. Our study is the first to integrate population viability analysis and allometry into a novel, process-based framework that is able to quantify extinction risk of a large number of species without requiring data-intensive, species-specific information. The framework facilitates the estimation of extinction vulnerabilities of data-deficient species. It may be applied to forecast extinction vulnerability in response to a changing environment, by incorporating quantitative relationships between wildlife demographic parameters and environmental drivers like habitat alteration, climate change, or hunting.

AB  - Conservation and management measures for large mobile sharks are more effective when information on migratory patterns and environmental cues are known. In the absence of long-term monitoring data or tracking programs, available information is based on occasional catch or sighting records from a variety of sources, usually constrained in space and time. This study demonstrates the utility of developing temporally explicit habitat suitability (HS) models to infer the migratory pattern of large mobile sharks. Bimonthly presence-only HS models (MaxEnt algorithm) were developed for the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) in the southwest Atlantic based on an exhaustive collection of data records and ecologically relevant predictors. The six final models showed good predictive power and were evaluated with independent data. A migratory pattern characterized by two main displacements was inferred from the models. We show that HS models can be applied as a no-cost, desk-based alternative to infer broadscale movements of large mobile sharks. This methodology is relevant as an important first step toward informing management plans in data-poor and financially limited regions or regions under urgent conservation need.

AB  - Connectivity of marine populations and ecosystems is crucial to maintaining and enhancing their structure, distribution, persistence, resilience and productivity. Artificial hard substrate, such as that associated with oil and gas platforms, provides settlement opportunities for species adapted to hard substrates in areas of soft sediment. The contribution of artificial hard substrate and the consequences of its removal (e.g. through decommissioning) to marine connectivity is not clear, yet such information is vital to inform marine spatial planning and future policy decisions on the use and protection of marine resources. This study demonstrates the application of a social network analysis approach to quantify and describe the ecological connectivity, informed by particle tracking model outputs, of hard substrate marine communities in the North Sea. Through comparison of networks with and without artificial hard substrate, and based on hypothetical decommissioning scenarios, this study provides insight into the contribution of artificial hard substrate, and the consequence of decommissioning, to the structure and function of marine community connectivity. This study highlights that artificial hard substrate, despite providing only a small proportion of the total area of hard substrate, increases the geographic extent and connectivity of the hard substrate network, bridging gaps, thereby providing 'stepping stones' between otherwise disconnected areas of natural hard substrate. Compared to the baseline scenario, a decommissioning scenario with full removal of oil and gas platforms results in a nearly 60% reduction in connectivity. Such reduction in connectivity may have negative implications for species' distribution, gene flow and resilience following disturbance or exploitation of marine hard substrate communities. Synthesis and applications. Social network analysis can provide valuable insight into connectivity between marine communities and enable the evaluation of impacts associated with changes to the marine environment. Providing standardized, transparent and robust outputs, such a tool is useful to facilitate understanding across different disciplines, including marine science, marine spatial planning and marine policy. Social network analysis therefore has great potential to address current knowledge gaps with respect to marine connectivity and crucially facilitate assessment of the impacts of changes in offshore substrate as part of the marine spatial planning process, thereby informing policy and marine management decisions.

AB  - Most studies on habitat selection among animals are conducted at local scales, whereas reliable determination of species requirements at larger spatial scales can be problematic. We used data available for NATURA 2000 sites to determine the habitat requirements of two relatively widespread and common species-pine marten Martes martes and stone marten Martes foina-in Southern Europe. Using presence-absence data, we applied statistical models at two spatial scales. At the local scale (within the dispersal distances of the species), sites occupied by martens were compared with unoccupied sites using buffers of different sizes, whereas at the regional scale, unoccupied sites were selected randomly. To adjust for spatial autocorrelation of data, penalised quasi-likelihood approximations were used. Both species of martens demonstrated preferences for areas with higher proportions of forest cover and steeper terrain. At the local, but not at the regional, scale, pine martens occurred at lower elevations, whilst stone martens occurred at higher elevations. We found that climatic variables (mean temperature, precipitation) had no significant effect on the presence of the martens. The results of our analyses generally confirmed findings of previous studies on habitat selection of both marten species in Southern Europe. This demonstrates the utility of data collected for NATURA 2000 sites for use in various analyses such as conservation planning and evaluating the impact of climate change on the distribution of animal species.

AB  - Size and distribution of wild populations are key elements in determining their conservation status, especially for vulnerable and elusive species. Therefore, choosing the proper monitoring method is fundamental to estimate population indices and consequently address conservation actions. In this study we worked in Rakhine State, Myanmar applying and comparing two occupancy-based sampling methods to evaluate Sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) presence: camera traps and sign survey (line transects). Moreover, to apply occupancy models it is necessary to establish length (time or space) of sampling occasions, therefore for both methodologies we tested four different sampling intensities to explore if results are affected by different temporal or spatial replicates. Both occupancy and detectability values varied between the two methods: we found lower values from camera traps analysis with no differences between different sampling occasions/segment lengths. Sign survey showed higher values for both parameters but changes in spatial segment lengths (line transects) affect occupancy estimates. Overall camera traps represent a more appropriate tool to study Sun bears in tropical forest habitats found in our study area. Our results provide useful information to plan an efficient monitoring scheme for bears in tropical forests.

AB  - Increasing pace of urbanization is the leading cause of decline in natural areas and associated biodiversity in developing countries. Bird richness is considered as a key indicator of urban environment quality. We investigated the relationship between satellite image derived landscape variables and field surveyed bird counts to predict bird richness in a rapidly urbanizing city in Western Himalayan foothills of India. Predictor variables derived from remotely sensed data comprised of vegetation productivity, landscape metrics and topography. We found that bird richness in this low density residential urban environment was positively related to greenness, elevation, and the degree of contrast between neighbourhood patches, while it was negatively related to patch densities. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) explained about 90% variability in bird richness distribution. Results indicated high bird species richness in elevated remnant vegetation patches and green spaces compared to low lying "core" settlement areas. The study urges to consider conservation and protection of green cover spaces in urban areas through effective landscape and urban planning.

AB  - Proposed offshore wind energy development on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf has brought attention to the need for baseline studies of the distribution and abundance of marine birds. We compiled line transect data from 15 shipboard surveys (June 2012-April 2014), along with associated remotely sensed habitat data, in the lower Mid-Atlantic Bight off the coast of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, USA. We implemented a recently developed hierarchical community distance sampling model to estimate the seasonal abundance of 40 observed marine bird species. Treating each season separately, we included six oceanographic parameters to estimate seabird abundance: three static (distance to shore, slope, sediment grain size) and three dynamic covariates (sea surface temperature [SST], salinity, primary productivity). We expected that avian bottom-feeders would respond primarily to static covariates that characterize seafloor variability, and that surface-feeders would respond more to dynamic covariates that quantify surface productivity. We compared the variation in species-specific and community-level responses to these habitat features, including for rare species, and we predicted species abundance across the study area. While several protected species used the study area in summer during their breeding season, estimated abundance and observed diversity were highest for nonbreeding species in winter. Distance to shore was the most common significant predictor of abundance, and thus useful in estimating the potential exposure of marine birds to offshore development. In many cases, our expectations based on feeding ecology were confirmed, such as in the first winter season, when bottom-feeders associated significantly with the three static covariates (distance to shore, slope, and sediment grain size), and surface-feeders associated significantly with two dynamic covariates (SST, primary productivity). However, other cases revealed significant relationships between static covariates and surface-feeders (e.g., distance to shore) and between dynamic covariates and bottom-feeders (e.g., primary productivity during that same winter). More generally, we found wide interannual, seasonal, and interspecies variation in habitat relationships with abundance. These results show the importance of quantifying detection and determining the ecological drivers of a community's distribution and abundance, within and among species, for evaluating the potential exposure of marine birds to offshore development.

AB  - The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) is a flagship species of the boreal forest ecosystem in northeastern China and Russia Far East. During the past century, the tiger population has declined sharply from more than 3000 to fewer than 600 individuals, and its habitat has become much smaller and greatly fragmented. Poaching, habitat degradation, habitat loss, and habitat fragmentation have been widely recognized as the primary causes for the observed population decline. Using a population viability analysis tool (RAMAS/GIS), we simulated the effects of poaching, habitat degradation, habitat loss, and habitat fragmentation on the population dynamics and extinction risk of the Amur tiger, and then explored the relative effectiveness of three conservation strategies involving improving habitat quality and establishing movement corridors in China and Russia. A series of controlled simulation experiments were performed based on the current spatial distribution of habitat and field-observed vital rates. Our results showed that the Amur tiger population could be viable for the next 100 years if the current habitat area and quality were well-maintained, with poaching strictly prohibited of the tigers and their main prey species. Poaching and habitat degradation (mainly prey scarcity) had the largest negative impacts on the tiger population persistence. While the effect of habitat loss was also substantial, habitat fragmentation per se had less influence on the long-term fate of the tiger population. However, to sustain the subpopulations in both Russia and China would take much greater conservation efforts. The viability of the Chinese population of tigers would rely heavily on its connectivity with the largest patch on the other side of the border. Improving the habitat quality of small patches only or increasing habitat connectivity through movement corridors alone would not be enough to guarantee the long-term population persistence of the Amur tiger in both Russia and China. The only conservation strategy that allowed for long-term persistence of tigers in both countries required both the improvement of habitat quality and the establishment of a transnational reserve network. Our study provides new insights into the metapopulation dynamics and persistence of the Amur tiger, which should be useful in landscape and conservation planning for protecting the biggest cat species in the world.

AB  - Collisions between wildlife and vehicles represent the main conflict between infrastructures and ecosystems. Road mortality is the largest single cause of death for many vertebrates, representing a growing phenomenon of remarkable dimension. Most studies in road ecology investigated spatial roadkill patterns, showing that roadkill probability is often higher near optimal habitat for a large amount of species. Landscape connectivity has been less often considered in roadkill research, and only few studies considered habitat suitability and landscape connectivity at the same time. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relative importance of habitat suitability and landscape connectivity in determining roadkill risk for a habitat-generalist carnivore, namely, the Eurasian badger in the Abruzzo region (Central Italy). We collected occurrence data of living individuals from camera trapping and roadkill data of through a Citizen Science initiative. We used the occurrence data to produce a habitat suitability model (HSM) and a landscape connectivity model (LCM). Both HSM and LCM were then used as predictors in combination with road characteristics to fit a roadkill risk model. We found that landscape connectivity was more important than habitat suitability in determining roadkill risk for the Eurasian badger. Overall, the density of regional roads was the most important variable. Our finding highlighted how important is to consider landscape connectivity in planning mitigation measures aimed to preserve habitat-generalist species.

AB  - In Western Europe, habitat loss and landscape fragmentation has led to significant population decline in various animal groups, including amphibians. The extinction of the last natural populations of the yellow-bellied toad in Belgium, Luxembourg and several regions of southern and western France suggests a widespread decline. By using site-occupancy models and adding covariates corresponding to the human-influenced features of the landscape, we tried to identify the relative effects of different land-use types on the species' distribution pattern in a man-made environment (the Alsatian Rhine floodplain in France). We recorded presence-absence data in 150 forest sample plots (300 x 300 m) and then modeled species distribution while taking into account detection errors in the field. Land-use was recorded on two spatial scales: within the forest sample plots and in a 1500 m radius buffer area around the forest plots. In the forest plots, toad occurrence was negatively correlated with loss of forest cover to agricultural land. In contrast, occurrence is positively correlated with the density of human-made rutted dirt paths and tracks, which provide semi-natural breeding sites. In the 1500 m radius buffer zones around forest plots, toad occurrence was negatively correlated with the density of urbanization and road networks. These results can be used to plan conservation strategies for amphibians in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Spatial management planning for vulnerable marine ecosystems (VME) across broad areas of un-sampled seafloor requires detailed predictions of species distribution. We utilised two habitat suitability modelling techniques, boosted regression trees (BRT) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt), to create potential distribution maps for 11 VME indicator taxa in the New Zealand area and adjacent seas. New bathymetry data were combined with existing environmental, chemical and physical data to produce a set of 45 predictor variables describing conditions at the seafloor. Nine of these variables were selected for use in the models based on low covariance and high explanatory power. Historical biological survey data were used to provide models with absence data (BRT) or target-group background data (MaxEnt). Model agreement was high, with each model predicting similar areas of suitable habitat both in the vicinity of known VME indicator taxa presence locations as well as across broad regions of un-sampled seafloor. Model performance measures, including cross-validation testing against sets of spatially independent data, did not clearly indicate a preferred modelling method across all taxa. Previous habitat suitability modelling efforts have rarely accounted for model precision, and in this study we used a bootstrap re sampling technique to produce model uncertainty maps to accompany each habitat suitability map. Because of the similar performance of BRT and MaxEnt methods in this study, we conclude that the best approach to incorporating the results into decision-support tools for spatial conservation planning is to average predictions and uncertainty from both.

AB  - Bracken in Great Britain has expanded as a result of changing management practices over the last few centuries, A recent survey, the Countryside Survey 1990, which included a sample-based field survey and a satellite census, the Land Cover Map of Great Britain, offered the potential for the first time to provide estimates of areal extent and geographic distribution of this plant in Great Britain, In practice, the field survey provided good estimates for bracken cover though with substantial error terms, For a variety of reasons, satellite image classification proved unsuccessful in recording the national extent of this species, Using the field survey, current trends in bracken cover have been examined; a net reduction in cover has occurred in the last two decades, though this conceals a considerable increase in some areas as well as loss from others, The distribution of bracken detected by the field survey has been used in conjunction with information on current and planned farming policies and models of bracken growth which predict the impacts of climate change, to identify areas where there is an increased risk of bracken dominance in the future, The merits and drawbacks of the approaches used, and the alternatives, are discussed.

AB  - Grassland birds are among the most imperiled groups of birds in North America. Unfortunately, little is known about the location of regional concentrations of these birds, thus regional or statewide conservation efforts may be inappropriately applied, reducing their effectiveness. We identified environmental covariates associated with the abundance of five grassland birds in the upper midwestern United States (Bobolink [Dolichonyx oryzivorus], Grasshopper Sparrow [Ammodramus savannarum?], Henslow's Sparrow [A. henslowii], Sedge Wren [Cistothorus platensis], and Upland Sandpiper [Bartramia longicauda]) with a hierarchical spatial count model fitted with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are well suited to this task because they are able to incorporate effects associated with autocorrelated counts and nuisance effects associated with years and observers, and the resulting models can be used to map predicted abundance at a landscape scale. Environmental covariates were derived from five suites of variables: landscape composition, landscape configuration, terrain heterogeneity and physiognomy, climate, and human influence. The final models largely conformed to our a priori expectations. Bobolinks and Henslow's Sparrows were strongly sensitive to grassland patch area. All of the species except Henslow's Sparrows exhibited substantial negative relations with forest composition, often at multiple spatial scales. Climate was found to be important for all species, and was the most important factor influencing abundance of Grasshopper Sparrows. After mapping predicted abundance, we found no obvious correspondence in the regional patterns of the five species. Thus, no clearly defined areas exist within the upper midwestern United States where management plans can be developed for a whole suite of grassland birds. Instead, a larger, region-wide initiative setting different goals for different species is recommended.

AB  - In developing countries, the protection of biodiversity and ecosystemservices (ES) rests on the hands of millions ofsmall landowners that coexistwith large properties, in a reality of highly unequal land distribution. Guiding the effective allocation of ES-based incentives in such contexts requires researchers and practitioners to tackle a largely overlooked question: for a given targeted area, will single large farms or several small ones provide the most ES supply? The answer to this question has important implications for conservation planning and rural development alike, which transcend efficiency to involve equity issues. We address this question by proposing and testing ES supply-area relations (ESSARs) around three basic hypothesized models, characterized by constant (model 1), increasing (model 2), and decreasing increments (model 3) of ES supply per unit of area or ES "productivity". Data to explore ESSARs came from 3384 private landholdings located in southern Chile ranging from 0.5 ha to over 30,000 ha and indicators of four ES (forage, timber, recreation opportunities, and water supply). Forage provision best fit model 3, which suggests that targeting several small farms to provide this ES should be a preferred choice, as compared to a single large farm. Timber provision best fit model 2, suggesting that in this case targeting a single large farm would be a more effective choice. Recreation opportunities best fit model 1, which indicates that several small or a single large farmof a comparable size would be equally effective in delivering this ES. Water provision fitmodel 1 ormodel 2 depending on the study site. The results corroborate that ES provision is not independent fromproperty area and therefore understanding ESSARs is a necessary condition for setting conservation incentives that are both efficient (deliver the highest conservation outcome at the least cost) and fair for landowners.

AB  - Local knowledge regarding the movements and space-use of large carnivores can inform species' management, conservation planning, and strategies for reducing human-wildlife conflict. However, because issues regarding large carnivores can be controversial, obtaining such information may be difficult and therefore lacking in many places. Such is the case for mountain lions (Puma concolor) in West Texas, where most of the land is privately owned. Therefore, we sought to better understand movements and home ranges of mountain lions in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas. We GPS collared 24 mountain lions (15 females, 9 males) between 2011 and 2017. We inspected variograms to distinguish dispersers from residents then we estimated movement metrics and home ranges using continuous-time movement models and autocorrelated kernel density estimation. Using generalized linear mixed models, we tested for seasonal differences in all movement and home range metrics. Of three subadults that dispersed, one had data appropriate for speed estimation; she exhibited faster speeds while dispersing than while exhibiting philopatric movements. Compared to adult resident males, adult resident females moved with slower average speeds (females: 11.82 +/- 0.43 km/day; males: 20.36 +/- 2.86 km/day), exhibited similar directional persistence in movement (females: 0.95 +/- 0.14 h; males: 1.12 +/- 0.21 h), crossed their home ranges in similar times (females: 5.76 +/- 0.98 days; males: 7.07 +/- 1.34 days), and used smaller home ranges than males (females: 283.83 +/- 37.50 km2: males: 1077.95 +/- 219.30 km2). Adults moved with slowest speeds in the cold-dry season; there were no seasonal effects on other estimates. Each individual's successive seasonal home ranges were highly overlapped (0.95 +/- 0.01). The mountain lions did not expand, contract, or shift their home ranges seasonally, which may be due to ample prey-availability and limited seasonal-shifts in prey distribution. Mountain lions used areas larger than most local ranches and tended to move across the landscape quickly. Together, our results indicate that mountain lions do not typically stay on one property for long which may have implications for conservation planning and species management.

AB  - Context The role of agricultural landscapes in biodiversity conservation is an emerging topic in a world experiencing a worrying decrease of species richness. Farm systems may either decrease or increase biological diversity, depending on land-use intensities and management.
   Objectives We present an intermediate disturbance-complexity model (IDC) of cultural landscapes aimed at assessing how different levels of anthropogenic disturbance on ecosystems affect the capacity to host biodiversity depending on the land matrix heterogeneity. It is applied to the Mallorca Island, amidst the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot.
   Methods The model uses the disturbance exerted when farmers alter the Net Primary Production through land-use change as well as when they remove a share of it (HANPP), together with Shannon-Wiener index (H') of land-cover diversity. The model is tested with a twofold-scalar experimental design (1:50,000 and 1:5000) of a set of landscape units along three time points (1956, 1989, 2011). Species richness of breeding and wintering birds, taken as a biodiversity proxy, is used in an exploratory factor analysis.
   Results The results clearly show that when intermediate levels of HANPP are performed within intermediate levels of complexity (H') in landscape patterns, like agro-forest mosaics, great bird species richness and high socio-ecological resilience can be maintained. Yet, these complex-heterogeneous landscapes are currently vanishing due to industrial farm intensification, rural abandonment and urban sprawl.
   Conclusions The results make apparent the usefulness of transferring the concept of intermediate disturbance-complexity interplay to cultural landscapes. Our spatial-explicit IDC model can be used as a tool for strategic environmental assessment of land-use planning.

AB  - Limited funds mean that conservation organisations must prioritise between regions in order to preserve as much biodiversity as possible. Biodiversity hotspots are one of the key strategies used to identify such priorities; however, they do not reveal how resources should be distributed. Identifying optimal returns for conservation investment requires the resource allocation problem to be properly formulated within a sound mathematical framework. A range of techniques can then be used in order to find an optimal solution.
   A number of important factors must be incorporated into the resource allocation problem if we are to accurately model the process of making of conservation investments; including the biodiversity values of a region, threats to the biodiversity in that region, investment costs, the current state (amount of area reserved and lost) of the regions of interest, future uncertainty, and the likelihood of investment success. The probability of a successful investment in particular, can be severely affected by various political and economic factors, but has not been accounted for in previous work. Explicitly incorporating the possibility that conservation efforts may fail allows the effects of such uncertainty on the behaviour of the optimal investment strategy to be evaluated. This knowledge can then be used to inform future investments.
   Each region is considered as being made up of a number of homogenous land parcels, each of which can be reserved, available for reservation, or lost to development. We use number of endemic species as a measure of regional biodiversity value, which avoids the need to consider species overlap between regions. The number of endemics protected with increasing investment in a region is modelled using the species area curve. We use the binomial distribution to model the probabilities of parcel loss due to development and investment uncertainty factors.
   We treat conservation resource allocation as a dynamic and ongoing process. The method of stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) is used to determine how to optimally allocate conservation resources between biodiversity hotspots. The resultant solution is used to evaluate the performance of a number of simple heuristics: with and without consideration given to the likelihood of investment success.
   We performed a sensitivity analysis on the outcomes of each of the SDP and heuristic approaches in order to properly assess the effects of including investment uncertainty over a range of parameter values. Investment uncertainty was varied against each of the two main factors of interest in the resource allocation problem: regional biodiversity value and threat level. The cost of investing in a region is also important but was not explicitly examined in the analysis.
   Our results show that the optimal solution responds to the likelihood of investment success, with the outcome a complicated trade-off between the likely relative benefits of investing in different regions and the corresponding relative risks of investing in those regions. Due to the complex nature of this problem, the heuristic methods are unable to approximate the behaviour of the optimal solution, but can still provide a reasonable outcome. Heuristics accounting for investment uncertainty generally outperformed those that didn't, which suggests that future conservation action should take into account the likelihood of investment success when prioritising the allocation of conservation resources between regions.

AB  - Biological invasions are not only a major threat to biodiversity, they also have major impacts on local economies and agricultural production systems. Once established, the connection of local populations into metapopulation networks facilitates dispersal at landscape scales, generating spatial dynamics that can impact the outcome of pest-management actions. Much planning goes into landscape-scale invasive species management. However, effective management requires knowledge on the interplay between metapopulation network topology and management actions. We address this knowledge gap using simulation models to explore the effectiveness of two common management strategies, applied across different extents and according to different rules for selecting target localities in metapopulations with different network topologies. These management actions are: (i) general population reduction, and (ii) reduction of an obligate resource. The reduction of an obligate resource was generally more efficient than population reduction for depleting populations at landscape scales. However, the way in which local populations are selected for management is important when the topology of the metapopulation is heterogeneous in terms of the distribution of connections among local populations. We tested these broad findings using real-world scenarios of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) infesting agricultural landscapes in Western Australia. Although management strategies targeting central populations were more effective in simulated heterogeneous metapopulation structures, no difference was observed in real-world metapopulation structures that are highly homogeneous. In large metapopulations with high proximity and connectivity of neighbouring populations, different spatial management strategies yield similar outcomes. Directly considering spatial attributes in pest-management actions will be most important for metapopulation networks with heterogeneously distributed links. Our modelling framework provides a simple approach for identifying the best possible management strategy for invasive species based on metapopulation structure and control capacity. This information can be used by managers trying to devise efficient landscape-oriented management strategies for invasive species and can also generate insights for conservation purposes.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between the spatial distribution of forest vegetation and influencing factors provides valuable information to decision-makers in land planning, for the sustainable development of forests and efficient monitoring of environmental and ecological issues. This paper aims to understand the effect of topographic factors and lithology on forest cover distribution around Bin El Ouidane dam in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, using remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), field observation, and statistical analysis. The forest vegetation was quantified by calculating the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) from Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The NDVI was classified according to the density of forest vegetation into four levels: bare soil, low density of forest cover, moderate density of forest cover, and high density of forest cover. The correlation analysis between NDVI, interpreted as forest densities and topographic parameters (elevation, slope, and aspect), derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), showed that elevation has the most significant positive correlation with forest density, with r = 0.563 and a p-value less than 0.05. Additionally, moderate and high densities of forest vegetation are optimal in the terrain aspect of the South-East and North-West, respectively. However, the NDVI variation cannot be interpreted only by altitude and terrain aspect. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification has been used to map and to separate the forest vegetation types. The statistical results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the altitude is the most important topographic factor affecting the distribution of forest species. The analysis of frequency histograms revealed that Holm oaks are increasing at high altitudes, and are more abundant in the North-West, while the Thuya species prefer moderate altitudes and are more abundant in the South-East-facing aspects. In our study area, the Holm oak develops on limestone formations. On the contrary, Thuya does not thrive in lithological conditions, and is found with a decreasing level of predominance on limestones, marls-limestones, and sandstones, respectively. The conclusion of the study shows that a combination of topographic factors and lithological conditions affects the spatial distribution of forest vegetation. The adaptation of the forest species to specific topography and lithological conditions should be considered for forest management. It can be helpful in selecting potential sites for reforestation of these species, for conservation of the natural resources, including water and soil.

AB  - A thorough reconstruction of historical processes is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms shaping patterns of genetic diversity. Indeed, past and current conditions influencing effective population size have important evolutionary implications for the efficacy of selection, increased accumulation of deleterious mutations, and loss of adaptive potential. Here, we gather extensive genome-wide data that represent the extant diversity of the Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to address two objectives. We demonstrate that a single glacial refugium is the source of most of the present-day genetic diversity, with detectable inputs from a putative secondary micro-refugium. We found statistical support for a scenario whereby ancestral populations located south of the ice sheets expanded recently, swamping out most of the diversity from other putative micro-refugia. Demographic inferences revealed that genetic diversity was also affected by linked selection in large parts of the genome. Moreover, we demonstrate that the recent demographic history of this species generated regional differences in the load of deleterious mutations among populations, a finding that mirrors recent results from human populations and provides increased support for models of expansion load. We propose that insights from these historical inferences should be better integrated in conservation planning of wild organisms, which currently focuses largely on neutral genetic diversity and local adaptation, with the role of potentially maladaptive variation being generally ignored.
   Author summary Reconstruction of a species' past demographic history from genetic data can highlight historical factors that have shaped the distribution of genetic diversity along its genome and its geographic range. Here, we combine genotyping-by-sequencing with demographic modelling to address these issues in the Coho salmon, a Pacific salmon of conservation concern in some parts of its range, notably in the south. Our demographic reconstructions reveal a linear decrease in genetic diversity toward the north of the species range, supporting the hypothesis of a northern route of postglacial recolonization from a single major southern refugium. As predicted by theory, we also observed a higher proportion of deleterious mutations in the most distant populations from this refugium. Beyond this general pattern, among-site variation in the proportion of deleterious mutations is consistent with different local trends in effective population sizes. Our results highlight the potential importance of understanding historical factors that have shaped geographic patterns of the distribution of deleterious mutations in order to implement effective management programs for the conservation of wild populations. Such fundamental knowledge of human historical demography is now having major impacts on health sciences, and we argue it is time to integrate such approaches in conservation science as well.

AB  - Knowledge on genetic structure is key to understand species connectivity patterns and to define the spatiotemporal scales over which conservation management plans should be designed and implemented. The distribution of genetic diversity (within and among populations) greatly influences species ability to cope and adapt to environmental changes, ultimately determining their long-term resilience to ecological disturbances. Yet, the drivers shaping connectivity and structure in marine fish populations remain elusive, as are the effects of fishing activities on genetic subdivision. To investigate these questions, we conducted a meta-analysis and compiled genetic differentiation data (F-ST/Phi(ST) estimates) for more than 170 fish species from over 200 published studies globally distributed. We modeled the effects of multiple life-history traits, distance metrics, and methodological factors on observed population differentiation indices and specifically tested whether any signal arising from different exposure to fishing exploitation could be detected. Although the myriad of variables shaping genetic structure makes it challenging to isolate the influence of single drivers, results showed a significant correlation between commercial importance and genetic structure, with widespread lower population differentiation in commercially exploited species. Moreover, models indicate that variables commonly used as proxy for connectivity, such as larval pelagic duration, might be insufficient, and suggest that deep-sea species may disperse further. Overall, these results contribute to the growing body of knowledge on marine genetic connectivity and suggest a potential effect of commercial fisheries on the homogenization of genetic diversity, highlighting the need for additional research focused on dispersal ecology to ensure long-term sustainability of exploited marine species.

AB  - Only about 300 individuals of the Cross River gorilla (CRG; Gorilla gorilla diehli) survive today. The subspecies is endemic to approximately 12-14 sites at the Cameroon-Nigeria border, and is critically endangered. To understand survival prospects of the CRG at Mawambi Hills, Cameroon, a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) distribution model was used to predict the distribution of gorillas. Overall, 24% of the study area was predicted to be suitable for gorillas. The most important predictors of gorilla distribution were elevation as a surrogate for accessibility (52.4%), distance to nearby villages which represents proximity to anthropogenic disturbance (22.7%), and slope steepness as a proxy for security (19.4%). Gorillas mainly occupied slopes of steep hills and avoided areas of human disturbance. To evaluate the spatial relationship between gorilla distribution and human activities, the predicted habitat suitability map was overlaid with a kernel density map of human activities. A positive correlation was found between locations of human activity and suitable habitat for gorillas (r = 0.5). This suggests that anthropogenic pressures in previously unused forest areas are increasing as a result of resource depletion at lower altitudes, consequently putting the gorillas at greater risk. Conservation management plans that seek to reduce human encroachment into habitats preferred by gorillas such as steep hills will probably contribute to gorilla survival. Copyright (c) 2013 S.

AB  - Essential to any model, conservation or management plan are measures of the distribution and abundance of a species. Countless methods for estimating these parameters exist, making it essential to assess the limitations and biases associated with a particular sampling protocol. Here, we compare between 2 methods commonly used to survey nearshore fish assemblages. Although most commonly employed, underwater visual census (UVC) may yield biased estimates of abundance depending on the strength of a fish's behavioural response (i.e. avoidance, attraction) to the presence of divers. Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) techniques have shown promise in overcoming some of the limitations of UVC, but are unable to provide an absolute measure of density in turbulent environments. We compare the abilities of these 2 methods to survey the nearshore rocky reef ichthyofauna of Southeast Australia. We found that relative to BRUV, UVC recorded more individuals (in terms of all species, herbivores, cryptic species, and most territorial species), higher richness at both the species and family level, and higher biodiversity as measured using the Shannon Index. These findings remain even when the data were adjusted for differences in sampling effort. In contrast, BRUV recorded proportionally more mobile predators, and a more taxonomically distinct population, though only when taxonomic evenness was not taken into account. Twenty species were unique to UVC and 17 species unique to BRUV. Considering this, studies aimed at cataloguing diversity should apply multiple methods, However, when logistical or financial constraints limit biodiversity studies to only 1 method, UVC will likely provide a more complete estimate of temperate reef fish diversity than BRUV.

AB  - The salamander plague, caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytriurn salamandrivorans (Bsal), is one of the most devastating amphibian diseases, currently threatening the entire Western Palearctic caudate diversity with extinction. Apparently of Asian origin and recently introduced into Europe, Bsal is known from currently ca. 80 sites in the wild in four European countries. Germany is the Bsal `hotspot; with more than half (N = 50) of all known European records to date. We here present data based on > 8,500 caudate specimens sampled for Bsal mainly via skin swabbing and quantitative real time PCR (> 3,300 since 2019). Within regions of Bsal occurrence similar to 6-7% of the studied caudates were Bsal-positive. The oldest known European record of the pathogen is from this country (2004), but a massive Bsal dispersal has only been recognized within the last five years with 17 new Bsal sites since 2019 alone. Currently, Bsal is spreading within the northern and the southern Eifel and - since 2017 - the Ruhr District. Most recently, the pathogen was for the first time detected in southern Germany (Bavaria) and a further range expansion is expected. A new species distribution model (SDM) of Bsal based on > 100 native and invasive records predicts suitable areas in most parts of Germany. Bsal affects all five caudate species known from these regions and has catastrophic effects on the European fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra). All affected populations in Germany (as well as Belgium and The Netherlands) have dramatically declined. While some may have become extinct due to the salamander plague, in most Bsal-positive sites European fire salamanders can still be recorded at low numbers (at least via systematic larval surveys), and at least one population seems to have recovered as currently Bsal detection remains negative. Little is known about the effect of Bsal on newts, and both prevalence and individual infection load can vary greatly over time, even within one population. However, the situation of the northern crested newt (Triturus cristatus) is alarming, as this species also undergoes declines due to Bsal invasions at some sites. Although some anurans are suggested as potential Bsal reservoirs and transmitters, we detected Bsal in only one individual of the common frog (Rana temporaria) out of 365 anurans of various species tested. Co-infection of Bsal with the related chytrid taxon Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is known from three taxa (S. salamandra, T cristatus, khihyosaura alpestris) and at four sites. 1 he alarming data from Bsal in Germany call for immediate conservation action at all levels, including ex situ conservation. We therefore strongly support the establishment and implementation of a national Bsal Action Plan.

AB  - Urbanisation development influences surrounding landscape processes, which are reflected by landscape structural patterns. Forest areas are often regarded as a spatial reserve for present and future urbanisation needs, while at the same time they often represent the last remnant of natural environment. In the present research we analysed (1) the change in forest cover in the area of suburban forests of Ljubljana between 1975 and 2012, (2) the connectivity and conservation buffers as one of the foundations for the assessment of biodiversity functions. Between 1975 and 2012, all the forests with important cores were subject to clearings for settlement- and agricultural purposes, but clearing usually did not extend beyond forest edges. The real fragmentation occurred during the construction of the highway beltline.
   In the area of Ljubljana, connectivity changes and connectivity loss in two different time periods are presented by a spatial model based on the Graph Theory which can also be used in spatial planning.
   Due to the high percentage of forest cover and the favourable distribution of forest patches and cores around the city of Ljubljana, no connection is currently in danger; the weakest link is stretching from the centre of Ljubljana towards the southeast.
   In the process of evaluating the biodiversity of urban forests, it will be necessary to add connectivity among forest cores as an important index while evaluating the favourable conditions of different habitat types. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Apex mesocarnivores can have a large influence on the functioning of plant and animal communities. Such effects can be more pronounced in relatively depauperate island ecosystems, especially in the context of a legacy of landscape change and introduced species. One such ecosystem is Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada, where a long history of introduced species and forest harvesting has greatly influenced the composition of the plant and animal communities. Most notably, Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis), an introduced and unchecked invasive species, has interacted with forest harvesting to greatly change the understory structure and composition of those temperate rainforests. Little is known of the habitat ecology of Pacific marten (Martes caurina), the small-bodied apex predator on those islands. We used camera traps to monitor the distribution and habitat ecology of marten across 2 winters. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to test 14 a priori hypotheses represented by statistical models formulated at two spatial scales (100 and 1000 m), with four categories of explanatory factors: sampling bias, forest structure, topography, and human disturbance. Relationships between detections and covariates from the top models revealed that at the 100-m scale, marten were more likely to use habitat that was closer to streams and marine shorelines and that contained a small area of forest harvesting. Marten detections were associated with habitat containing some component of forest edge and road, suggesting foraging behavior adapted to invasive deer, an important source of carrion for marten during winter. The broad use of habitats by Pacific marten suggests that intraguild competition and predation might occur with several species at risk including the endemic Haida ermine (Mustela ermine haidarum). Those two species would likely overlap in diet and distribution when co-occurring across low-elevation coastal habitats. Conservation planning on Haida Gwaii should consider measures that decrease the potential for competition or predation between marten and species at risk.

AB  - The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus M.) local population off west Istria in the North-eastern Adriatic has received no prior study of abundance and distribution despite the habitat's relevance for the preservation of this key species in the marine ecosystem. The research area comprises part of the NATURA 2000 network which was predominantly established here for these dolphins. Official data regarding the local population's status in the region are currently marked as deficient. Thus, the aim of the present study was to provide the first population data for the area. Boat-based survey work was carried out from April to September 2012-2015 using a mark-recapture photo-identification method. Prior to this period a random data collection was used to study distribution, since 2001, to cover the area of 927 km(2) lying between Umag to lighthouse Albane in the south. 143 bottlenose dolphins were photo-identified to date with the average group size of 9.27 +/- 6.53 animals. Several abundance models were used, from which the Markovian robust model proved the best fit and predicted between 47-142 dolphins along the west Istria coast. A few individuals were also identified in Slovenia, indicating a bigger home range along the 98 km length of the studied area. There is an indication of a regular year round presence of dolphins. The west Istria coast constitutes an important feeding and breeding ground. The region should develop a sustainable plan to manage those human activities negatively impacting the dolphins. Therefore the present study is of relevance for the implementation of management directives for their conservation.

AB  - Animal movement characteristics are not species-specific traits, but rather individual features that respond to various selective pressures. To understand patterns of animal movements, it is especially important to explore how they are affected by differences in landscape and habitat configuration. This paper presents an analysis of the movement patterns of a species of conservation concern in Northwest Amazon, the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), in relation to landscape elements identified as resource concentration areas (palm stands and natural salt licks). We identify the structure of the movement behavior of a sub-adult male lowland tapir using Behavioral Change Point Analysis (BCPA) and a set of metrics capturing velocity and variance. We also estimate this tapir's Utilization Distribution (UD) using the dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model (dBBMM) in order to better understand its trajectories and space-use patterns. Our results provide insights about this animal's movement, making it possible to differentiate between foraging behaviors, characterized by long trips and selective resource use, and explorative behaviors, characterized by short displacements and a notable decrease in the usage of resource areas and its trajectories. The high influence of landscape elements on movement characteristics suggest that tapirs may perceive the Amazonian forest as heterogeneous rather than homogeneous mosaics. Therefore, the study of movement characteristics proves to be useful for the development of future studies and conservation plans. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Factors affecting site microclimate are important for the maintenance of populations, particularly during stochastic weather events. The federally endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis Nabokov) has faced population declines throughout its range, most recently in 2012 following a severe drought throughout the Great Lakes region. This research builds upon previous work to understand what microclimate and biotic factors predict L. m. samuelis site occupancy. To gain an understanding of what habitat characteristics are conducive to L. m. samuelis survival during severe stochastic weather events, previously occupied sites were compared with currently occupied and restored sites in Allegan State Game Area, Michigan and the Oak Openings region of Ohio using variables significant in a predictive model. The heat load variable accounted for 64-67% of the variation in the model alone while individual biotic variables accounted for < 5% of the model variation individually. The density of flowering lupine, ant entrance densities and heat load were higher in occupied sites while formerly occupied sites had higher woody stem density and canopy cover. These data show that site microclimate and factors affecting L. m. samuelis larval growth and reproduction affect distribution and persistence in stochastic environments. These findings can be incorporated in habitat management plans to create climate resilient refugia for current populations and increase the probability of reintroduction success in restored areas.

AB  - The decline of marine biodiversity can negatively affect the ocean's resilience, goods and services. Consequently, the identification and protection of biodiversity hotspots is often a priority in marine spatial planning. Marine protected areas (MPAs) can also be designated as fisheries management tools to promote sustainable fisheries. However, the integration of these 2 objectives is still the cause of much debate, and is challenging to achieve in a simple, straightforward manner. In this study, generalised additive models of (1) various biodiversity indices and (2) an intrinsic vulnerability index of fishes to fishing were applied to produce predictive maps to identify hotspots of biodiversity and fisheries vulnerability, respectively, and combined hotspots of both parameters for shallow coastal fish assemblages surrounding 2 islands in the Azores archipelago, northeast Atlantic Ocean. Individually, hotspots of biodiversity and vulnerability covered up to half of the study area and were quantitatively well represented in the existing MPA network. Although similar levels of representativeness were found for shared hotspots, more importantly, they were substantially smaller, highlighting the importance of their complete protection to ensure the ecological functioning of multi-objective MPAs. This case study demonstrates a novel use of a fish vulnerability index in support of marine spatial planning. It can be combined with biodiversity patterns that alone may not represent well the areas of higher need for conservation. MPA design and adaptive management processes may use this straightforward approach to identify hotspots within larger areas of high conservation value, especially in data-limited situations that may benefit from predictive modelling.

AB  - Understanding patterns of species diversity along an altitudinal gradient is the major topic of much biogeographical and ecological research. The aim of this study was to explore how richness and density of orchid species and subspecies in terms of different categories of underground organ systems and pollination systems vary along an altitudinal gradient in the central Balkans. The altitudinal gradient of the study area was divided into 21 100-m vertical intervals. Data were analyzed using both non-linear and linear regressions with three data sets (total orchids, orchids of forest habitats, orchids of non-forest habitats) in the case of species richness and three data sets (total orchids-total area, forest orchids-forest area, and orchids of non-forest habitats-non-forest area) in the case of species density. The results showed a hump-shaped pattern of orchid richness and density, peaking at 900-1,000 m. The richness and density of orchids of forest habitats are generally slightly greater than the richness and density of orchids of non-forest habitats in lowland areas, whereas the orchids of herbaceous vegetation types dominating at high altitudes. Tuberous orchids dominate in low and mid-altitude areas, orchids with palmately lobed and fusiform tubers ("intermediate orchids") dominate at high altitudes, while rhizomatous orchids are predominate in mid-altitude forest stands. Both deceptive and self-pollinated orchids show a unimodal trend with a peak at mid-altitude areas. This study underlines the importance of low and mid-altitude areas for the survival of deceptive orchids and the importance of mid- and high-altitude areas for the survival of rewarding orchids. In addition, forest habitats at mid-altitudes have been shown to be crucial for the survival of self-pollinated orchids. The results suggest that the altitudinal patterns of orchid richness and density in the central Balkans are determined by mechanisms related to land area size and habitat cover, partially confirming the species-area relationship (SAR) hypothesis. This study contributes significantly to a better understanding of the potential impacts of habitat changes on orchid diversity, thereby facilitating more effective conservation planning.

AB  - Orchids are under continuous threat from many factors, especially human-sourced. Estimating the emerging threat factors linked to habitat losses is very important to understand the effects on biodiversity and to design protection strategies and protected areas. Field assessments and modelling were performed with the aim of determining areas where orchids may spread and to reveal priority areas to create a protection plan. Additionally, the aim was to contribute to development of protection strategies for taxa under threat. This study was performed in the Black Sea region located in the north of Turkey. A total of 40 taxa belonging to 15 Orchidaceae genera were collected. The field assessment process used topographic parameters and threat factors. Habitats where orchids are most commonly distributed comprise open areas, meadows, pastures, and forests. Additionally, the density of orchids was determined to be highest at altitudes from 400 to 1600 m. The highest risk factors for taxa in the region include grazing and trampling. Based on these results, suitable habitats were modelled and mapped according to the observed habitat requirements. The determined suitable habitats will represent the preliminary targets for ex situ protection programs where required. The maps revealed here are important for labeling areas with an estimated orchid density and for protection of these areas if necessary. Our field observations were compatible with the obtained maps. Additionally, we consider these maps to be very important in terms of determining areas where taxa will be spread in preliminary field studies.

AB  - The Pantepui region of the Guyana Shield of Northern South America harbors a unique biota. It is characterized by high local species endemism, especially applicable to its table mountain-like outcrops, the tepuis. For this region, also known as the 'Lost World', different hypotheses have been proposed to explain its Biogeography. We suggest that the amphibian and reptile communities' suit well as target group to study the hypotheses since these vertebrates are relatively well documented through comprehensive species lists and are less mobile than other terrestrial vertebrates. However, records for the majority of endemic amphibian and reptile species naturally numbered only a few. We hence used extant dimensions of the vegetation zones associated to amphibians and reptiles. By running maximum entropy-based Climate Envelope Distribution Models (CEDM), these were projected to climatic scenarios as suggested for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000 years BP). Our results promote the Cool Climate hypothesis for diversity and distribution of amphibians and reptile communities in the Pantepui region, in which species' geographic ranges were displaced followed by speciation along with the climate change during glacial-interglacial Quaternary cycles. Moreover, we studied the impact of expected future anthropogenic global warming on these vegetation zones. Climate change scenarios used, consider demographic, politico-economic, social and technological futures at different degrees with either more or less environmentally conscious, regionalized solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability. For the 'Lost World', our CEDM results demonstrated a strong impact of climate change to vegetation zones resulting in a considerable decrease during future anthropogenic global warming in terms of habitat suitability. For amphibians and reptiles this may mean habitat loss and decline or extinction. However, nothing is known about specific climatic niche breadths (which may be great due to survival under climatic conditions with considerable daily change) or the possibility to adapt over generations (which may be unlikely due to the rapid warming expected) of Pantepui amphibians and reptiles. Further studies and monitoring efforts are necessary towards a better understanding of the problem and to develop conservation action plans.

AB  - Resource managers increasingly use habitat suitability map products to inform risk management and policy decisions. Modeling habitat suitability of data-poor species over large areas requires careful attention to assumptions and limitations. Resulting habitat suitability maps can harbor uncertainties from data collection and modeling processes; yet these limitations are not always transparent to resource managers, who increasingly rely on maps for spatial planning and risk assessment purposes. Interpretation of habitat suitability maps can be improved by visually communicating model uncertainty and data foundations. We applied Bayesian networks (BNs) to a small, marine dataset to model the probability of occurrence (PO) of benthic macrofauna. We also used BNs to create maps displaying model parameter uncertainty and data limitations. We developed BN models for three macrofauna species: a marine gastropod, Aystris gausapata, a marine bivalve, Axinopsida serricata, and a marine worm, Sternaspis fossor. We produced three map products from the BN models of each species: (1) a habitat suitability map of the PO projected from regional predictor variables; (2) an uncertainty map, displaying statistical variance of model predictions of occurrence probability; and (3) an experience map, displaying the empirical basis for PO predictions (equivalent sample size). Map results showed occurrence probability to be high and widespread for Ax. serricata, low to moderate and more limited to deeper offshore areas for Ay. gausapata, and low to high in shallow sandy regions and deeper silty regions, respectively, for S. fossor. The uncertainty and experience maps for each species helped identify regions to prioritize for future sampling. Our results are the first to show that BNs can effectively model habitat suitability of benthic macrofauna, and our detailed methods can be applied to a variety of taxa and systems. Visually describing statistical model uncertainty and equivalent sample size in map format improves interpretation of habitat suitability map predictions and supports place-based risk management of marine management.

AB  - Urban rivers and lakes, in combination with nearby green spaces, provide important habitat for urban birds, but few urban studies have focused on forest and water birds simultaneously along an urban intensity gradient. In this study, we randomly chose 39 rivers and lakes along an urban gradient of Beijing to examine bird community parameters in relation to aquatic and terrestrial habitat conditions, aquatic life data, and water quality data. We selected models with the AICc (corrected Akaike information criterion) method, bivariate linear or generalized linear regressions, and structural equation modeling to determine distribution patterns of avian communities along an urban gradient and bird-environment relationships. We found that both forest and water bird species and individuals peaked at intermediate urbanization intensities, especially for abundance of both forest and water bird and water bird species richness and abundance. We suggest that the differences in the strength of response to urbanization and the similarities in the gradient distribution pattern between forest and water birds should receive more attention in future urbanization gradient studies. Significant correlation ship between species richness of resident water birds, fish foragers, and insectivore-frugivores, abundance of insectivores, insectivore-frugivores (negative), and granivores (positive) and impervious surface proportion within 1-km radius buffer of sampled sites became more evident after coverage of artificial surfaces exceeded a 50% threshold. Regressions showed that distance from the urban center, number of islands in waterbody, and proportion of gross or unarmored shoreline length were significantly and positively related to species richness and abundance of both forest and water birds. The availability of unarmored shoreline is a critical pathway through which urbanization detrimentally impacts avian diversity. Our results demonstrate how the urban intensity gradient affects the relative availability of food resources and habitat, which could provide practical applications for urban landscape planning and avian biodiversity conservation in urban areas.

AB  - Informed conservation management of marine mammals requires an understanding of population size and habitat preferences. In Australia, such data are needed for the assessment and mitigation of anthropogenic impacts, including fisheries interactions, coastal zone developments, oil and gas exploration and mining activities. Here, we present large-scale estimates of abundance, density and habitat preferences of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) over an area of 42,438km(2) within two gulfs of South Australia. Using double-observer platform aerial surveys over four strata and mark-recapture distance sampling analyses, we estimated 3,493 (CV= 0.21; 95%CI = 2,327-5,244) dolphins in summer/autumn, and 3,213 (CV= 0.20; 95%CI = 2,151-4,801) in winter/spring of 2011. Bottlenose dolphin abundance and density was higher in gulf waters across both seasons (0.09-0.24 dolphins/km(2)) compared to adjacent shelf waters (0.004-0.04 dolphins/km(2)). The high densities of bottlenose dolphins in the two gulfs highlight the importance of these gulfs as a habitat for the species. Habitat modelling associated bottlenose dolphins with shallow waters, flat seafloor topography, and higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in summer/autumn and lower SSTs in winter/spring. Spatial predictions showed high dolphin densities in northern and coastal gulf sections. Distributional data should inform management strategies, marine park planning and environmental assessments of potential anthropogenic threats to this protected species.

AB  - 1. The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway.
   2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species' selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area.
   3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40% of the study area, although only 1.5% could hold all four large carnivores together.
   4. Synthesis and applications. A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges for conservation biology is providing solutions for endangered species in modern landscapes, usually with deficient biological information on how species respond to landscape disturbances. These limitations are severe in developing countries where the lack of resources restricts the potential for basic ecological research. One way in which this limitation has been mitigated is with the use of individual-based spatially explicit population models (SEPMs). We developed a SEPM for the endangered huemul deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) of southern Chile. The goal was to project the population trajectories under three different development scenarios (present conditions, increased livestock density and hydroelectric dams) in southern Chile, identifying key demographic variables associated to landscape features. The model simulated weekly movements, age and general status of all individuals in the population and the landscape in which they lived during a 40-year period. Age-dependent and landscape-related mortality probabilities were applied. Four population sizes and three spatial aggregation patterns were used as initial conditions. Although the model was very sensitive to age-dependent mortality rate, individual landscape perception scale and initial population size and location, the general trend was that of a positive population growth. Livestock and dam scenarios had minimal impacts on population dynamics. Most simulations starting with 100 individuals resulted in extinctions and disaggregated initial location of individuals produced slow rates of population growth, suggesting the existence of a population viability threshold. Our results suggest that the huemul population in the Aysen region has the potential to recover only if limiting factors are kept under control and they highlight the urgency of conducting studies aimed at estimating total population size and distribution together with survival data to improve the conservation plans for this endangered species.

AB  - Aim To identify the relationships between volunteer bird survey effort and motivations in order to prioritize investment in future surveying activities. Location South-west Western Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot. Methods We developed nine hypotheses for volunteer motivations to predict the probability of a bird survey being undertaken anywhere in the landscape using data from the New Atlas of Australian Birds. We then established three goals for surveying in the study region: (1) equal representation of surveys across the landscape, (2) surveys stratified by habitat type and (3) representation of surveys in protected areas. We developed a function to estimate the benefit of investing in professional surveys, given the probability of a volunteer survey taking place and the survey goal, and calculated the cost of meeting a surveying goal with and without accounting for the probability of cells not being surveyed by volunteers. Results A model combining the location of protected areas, location of previous records of threatened species and habitat diversity was the strongest predictor of the probability of a volunteer bird survey being conducted. Each surveying goal resulted in different areas being prioritized for future surveying, indicating the importance of setting clear objectives before undertaking broad-scale monitoring or surveying activities. If our primary goal is stratified protected area representation in surveys, there are huge cost savings if only protected areas with a 70% predicted probability of not being surveyed by volunteers are selected for professional surveys. Main conclusions Professional sampling in survey gaps is required to reduce bias in volunteer-collected datasets. Using models of volunteer behaviour, we can identify areas unlikely to be surveyed. If these areas are important for the project objective, then we can either provide incentives for volunteers or carry out professional surveying. These analyses are best carried out before data collection commences.

AB  - Understanding the responses of individual plant species along different edaphic gradients is a key question in ecology, with implications to community assembly, functioning of forest ecosystems, niche theory and conservation planning. In tropical rain forests, responses to soil nutrients have been described only for a handful of species. Even abundant and conspicuous components of the forest, such as the palms (Arecaceae), remain largely unknown in this respect.
   We inventoried all palm species and analysed soil chemistry in 96 sites across western Amazonia to (i) assess the relative importance of some micronutrients vs. macronutrients as drivers of patterns in palm species composition, (ii) model the response shapes of 61 palm taxa and of canopy vs. understorey palms along gradients of selected soil nutrients, (iii) determine if the response shapes of conspecific palm varieties differ in relation to the most important observed soil nutrient and (iv) assess if the rank order of the most abundant canopy species changes along edaphic gradients.
   Patterns in palm species composition were best explained by Mehlich-III extractable exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg) and phosphorus (P), with the different palm species clearly separating along the soil cation concentration gradient. All 61 palm taxa exhibited statistical responses along soil nutrient gradients. Response shapes in relation to exchangeable bases varied among bimodal skewed (51% of species), unimodal skewed (47%) and monotonic (2%).
   There were no significant differences between canopy vs. understorey species in their mean response shapes to the exchangeable bases, but canopy species had significantly higher mean optimum value for soil P and greater mean niche width along the Ca, K, Mg, P and boron (B) gradients. Varieties of the same species of Bactris, Desmoncus and Geonoma generally had different response shapes and different optima for the exchangeable bases.
   Synthesis. Among the soil variables we studied, macronutrients (especially exchangeable bases and P) emerged as more important than micronutrients in predicting species abundances in palm communities of western Amazonian non-inundated forests. Non-Gaussian responses were predominant, conspecific palm varieties exhibited different response types, and the rank order of dominance of canopy palms varied along the gradients of exchangeable bases and P. Together, these findings advance niche theory about palms and may be used for generating better predictive models of palm species distributions and for experimental studies that search for the physiological mechanisms underlying inter- and infra-specific trade-offs along edaphic gradients.

AB  - Over the last decades, many wild goose populations have increased significantly and are now causing conflicts with socioeconomic and biological interests. To mitigate impacts of rapid population increases, population control by increasing harvest has been attempted. In this study we seek to guide the design of a regional autumn goose hunting organisation in agricultural landscapes by identifying areas suitable for hunting, which have high probability of occurrence of pinkfooted geese Anser brachyrhynchus and/or a short return time by geese to fields subject to hunting. To identify areas suitable for hunting in Nord-Trondelag County, mid-Norway, we used species distributions models (SDMs), a broadly accepted tool in conservation planning for spatial refuge organisation. The prediction was that the highest probability of goose occurrence exists for large fields, away from small roads and near water bodies serving as safe roosting sites. Additionally, return time was predicted to be shortest for large fields near roosting sites and away from big roads. A combined map of goose occurrence and return time showed similar prediction for high goose occurrence and short return time; hence areas most suitable for hunting are large fields, close to roost sites and away from roads. If hunters and landowners are willing to coordinate goose hunting at a landscape level, they can use the prediction maps as guidance, with the likely benefit that they collectively can shoot more geese. Such local and regional organisation can become a powerful tool in the harvest management of geese.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) trained on presence-only data are frequently used in ecological research and conservation planning. However, users of SDM software are faced with a variety of options, and it is not always obvious how selecting one option over another will affect model performance. Working with MaxEnt software and with tree fern presence data from New Zealand, we assessed whether (a) choosing to correct for geographical sampling bias and (b) using complex environmental response curves have strong effects on goodness of fit. SDMs were trained on tree fern data, obtained from an online biodiversity data portal, with two sources that differed in size and geographical sampling bias: a small, widely-distributed set of herbarium specimens and a large, spatially clustered set of ecological survey records. We attempted to correct for geographical sampling bias by incorporating sampling bias grids in the SDMs, created from all georeferenced vascular plants in the datasets, and explored model complexity issues by fitting a wide variety of environmental response curves (known as "feature types" in MaxEnt). In each case, goodness of fit was assessed by comparing predicted range maps with tree fern presences and absences using an independent national dataset to validate the SDMs. We found that correcting for geographical sampling bias led to major improvements in goodness of fit, but did not entirely resolve the problem: predictions made with clustered ecological data were inferior to those made with the herbarium dataset, even after sampling bias correction. We also found that the choice of feature type had negligible effects on predictive performance, indicating that simple feature types may be sufficient once sampling bias is accounted for. Our study emphasizes the importance of reducing geographical sampling bias, where possible, in datasets used to train SDMs, and the effectiveness and essentialness of sampling bias correction within MaxEnt.

AB  - Aims: Identify factors that are responsible for the presence and distribution of black-bellied sandgrouse in the nature park of 'Vale do Guadiana' so that management actions can be undertaken.
   Localization: Southern Portugal.
   Methods: Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests and Bailey's tests was used to analyse the preferences among biotopes, while logistic regression analysis was utilized to obtain an explanation model for species distributions during breeding and non-breeding seasons. Variables considered in the analysis included presence or absence of cattle; ground vegetation coverage, height and vertical density; tree density; bush coverage; slope exposition; stone coverage and number of stones; wind direction; habitat; soil capacity; distance to roads, drinking places and villages; and altitude. .
   Results: The results of biotope selection indicated that sandgrouses preferred fields of leguminous plants during both breeding and non-breeding periods and tillage during the breeding period. Montado and fallows older than two years were avoided during the non-breeding season. Cereal fields were used according to their availability. Besides not significantly, fallows were highly used. For the explanation model, six variables that explain the species distribution during the breeding season were selected: cattle presence, stony ground and distance to secondary roads had a positive effect, while vegetation cover, stone cover and distance to the drinking places had a negative effect. During the non-breeding period, the model was not adjusted to validation sample.
   Conclusions: It was found that the most important biotopes are leguminous cultivations and fallows with extensive pastures. Grazing can have either a positive or a negative effect on these fields, depending on cattle density. Besides the number of small dams, drinking places are still a limiting factor for this species. Dispersion of settlements and roads is also negative to sandgrouse distribution. Finally conservation implications, namely management actions such as an enlargement of leguminous fields, cattle grazing control and modifications of Territory Management Plans, are discussed.

AB  - The interactions between animals and their environment vary across species, regions, but also with gender. Sex-specific relations between individuals and the ecosystem may entail different behavioral choices and be expressed through different patterns of habitat use. Regardless, only rarely sex-specific traits are addressed in ecological modeling approaches. The European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) is a species of conservation concern in Europe, with a highly fragmented and declining distribution across most of its range. We assessed sex-specific habitat selection patterns for the European wildcat, at the landscape and home range levels, across its Iberian biogeographic distribution using a multipopulation approach. We developed resource selection functions in a use-availability framework using radio-telemetry data from five wildcat populations. At the landscape level, we observed that, while both genders preferentially established home ranges in areas close to broadleaf forests and far from humanized areas, females selected mid-range elevation areas with some topographic complexity, whereas males used lowland areas. At the home range level, both females and males selected areas dominated by scrublands or broadleaf forests, but habitat features were less important at this level. The strength of association to habitat features was higher for females at both spatial levels, suggesting a tendency to select habitats with higher quality that can grant them enhanced access to shelter and feeding resources. Based on our results, we hypothesize that sex-biased behavioral patterns may contribute to the resilience of wildcats' genetic integrity through influencing the directionality of hybridization with domestic cats. Our study provides information about European wildcats' habitat use in an Iberian context, relevant for the implementation of conservation plans, and highlights the ecological relevance of considering sex-related differences in environmental preferences.

AB  - The rapidly changing climate makes humans realize that there is a critical need to incorporate climate change adaptation into conservation planning. Whether the wintering habitats of Great Bustards (Otis tarda dybowskii), a globally endangered migratory subspecies whose population is approximately 1,500-2,200 individuals in China, would be still suitable in a changing climate environment, and where this could be found, is an important protection issue. In this study, we selected the most suitable species distribution model for bustards using climate envelopes from four machine learning models, combining two modelling approaches (TreeNet and Random Forest) with two sets of variables (correlated variables removed or not). We used common evaluation methods area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS) as well as independent test data to identify the most suitable model. As often found elsewhere, we found Random Forest with all environmental variables outperformed in all assessment methods. When we projected the best model to the latest IPCC-CMIP5 climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 in three Global Circulation Models (GCMs)), and averaged the project results of the three models, we found that suitable wintering habitats in the current bustard distribution would increase during the 21st century. The Northeast Plain and the south of North China were projected to become two major wintering areas for bustards. However, the models suggest that some currently suitable habitats will experience a reduction, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Basin. Although our results suggested that suitable habitats in China would widen with climate change, greater efforts should be undertaken to assess and mitigate unstudied human disturbance, such as pollution, hunting, agricultural development, infrastructure construction, habitat fragmentation, and oil and mine exploitation. All of these are negatively and intensely linked with global change.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) constitute the most common class of models across ecology, evolution and conservation. The advent of ready-to-use software packages and increasing availability of digital geoinformation have considerably assisted the application of SDMs in the past decade, greatly enabling their broader use for informing conservation and management, and for quantifying impacts from global change. However, models must be fit for purpose, with all important aspects of their development and applications properly considered. Despite the widespread use of SDMs, standardisation and documentation of modelling protocols remain limited, which makes it hard to assess whether development steps are appropriate for end use. To address these issues, we propose a standard protocol for reporting SDMs, with an emphasis on describing how a study's objective is achieved through a series of modeling decisions. We call this the ODMAP (Overview, Data, Model, Assessment and Prediction) protocol, as its components reflect the main steps involved in building SDMs and other empirically-based biodiversity models. The ODMAP protocol serves two main purposes. First, it provides a checklist for authors, detailing key steps for model building and analyses, and thus represents a quick guide and generic workflow for modern SDMs. Second, it introduces a structured format for documenting and communicating the models, ensuring transparency and reproducibility, facilitating peer review and expert evaluation of model quality, as well as meta-analyses. We detail all elements of ODMAP, and explain how it can be used for different model objectives and applications, and how it complements efforts to store associated metadata and define modelling standards. We illustrate its utility by revisiting nine previously published case studies, and provide an interactive web-based application to facilitate its use. We plan to advance ODMAP by encouraging its further refinement and adoption by the scientific community.

AB  - Context. Assessing the viability of animal populations in the wild is difficult or impossible, primarily because of limited data. However, there is an urgent need to develop methods for estimating population sizes and improving the viability of target species.
   Aims. To define suitable habitat for sambar (Cervus unicolor), banteng (Bos javanicus), gaur (Bos gaurus), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and tiger (Panthera tigris) in the Western Forest Complex, Thailand, and to assess their current status as well as estimate how the landscape needs to be managed to maintain viable populations.
   Methods. The present paper demonstrates a method for combining a rapid ecological assessment, landscape indices, GIS-based wildlife-habitat models, and knowledge of minimum viable population sizes to guide landscape-management decisions and improve conservation outcomes through habitat restoration.
   Key results. The current viabilities for gaur and elephant are fair, whereas they are poor for tiger and banteng. However, landscape quality outside the current distributions was relatively intact for all species, ranging from moderate to high levels of connectivity. In addition, the population viability for sambar is very good under the current and desired conditions.
   Conclusions. If managers in this complex wish to upgrade the viabilities of gaur, elephant, tiger and banteng within the next 10 years, park rangers and stakeholders should aim to increase the amount of usable habitat by similar to 2170 km(2) or 17% of existing suitable habitats. The key strategies are to reduce human pressures, enhance ungulate habitats and increase connectivity of suitable habitats outside the current distributions.
   Implications. The present paper provides a particularly useful method for managers and forest-policy planners for assessing and managing habitat suitability for target wildlife and their population viability in protected-area networks where knowledge of the demographic attributes (e.g. birth and death rates) of wildlife populations are too limited to perform population viability analysis.

AB  - Conflicts of interest between resource extraction and conservation are widespread, and negotiating such conflicts, or trade-offs, is a key issue for ecosystem managers. One such trade-off is resource competition between fisheries and marine top predators. Managing this trade-off has so far been difficult due to a lack of knowledge regarding the amount and distribution of prey required by top predators.
   Here, we develop a framework that can be used to address this gap: a bio-energetic model linking top predator breeding biology and foraging ecology with forage fish ecology and fisheries management.
   We apply the framework to a Baltic Sea colony of common guillemots Uria aalge and razorbills Alca torda, two seabird species sensitive to local prey depletion, and show that densities of forage fish (sprat Sprattus sprattus and herring Clupea harengus) corresponding to the current fisheries management target B-MSY are sufficient for successful breeding. A previously proposed fisheries management target for conserving seabirds, 1/3 of historical maximum prey biomass (B-1/3), was also sufficient.
   However, the results highlight the importance of maintaining sufficient prey densities in the vicinity of the colony, suggesting that fine-scale spatial fisheries management is necessary to maintain high seabird breeding success.
   Despite foraging on the same prey, razorbills could breed successfully at lower prey densities than guillemots but needed higher densities for self-maintenance, emphasizing the importance of considering species-specific traits when determining sustainable forage fish densities for top predators.
   Synthesis and applications. Our bio-energetic modelling framework provides spatially explicit top predator conservation targets that can be readily integrated with current fisheries management. The framework can be combined with existing management approaches such as dynamic ocean management, marine spatial planning and management strategy evaluation to inform ecosystem-based management of marine resources.

AB  - Once one of the most abundant raptors in the world, the White-rumped Vulture (Gyps bengalensis) has faced a drastic population decline across its global range for the past three decades. In India, the main cause of this decline has been the accidental ingestion of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac through livestock carcasses. However, some breeding populations still survive in the forested landscapes of India's Western Ghats. But these populations have also been facing several anthropogenic threats recently, and now show a declining population trend. The two possible conservation strategies for G. bengalensis are to ban diclofenac and develop further captive breeding and reintroduction programs. In this context, we modelled potential reintroduction sites for the species in the Western Ghats by considering its key habitat features and ecological niche models to maximise the likelihood of its long-term regional persistence. Models were developed for current and future climate change scenarios using nesting and foraging occurrence records. Our models predict climatically stable habitats under three climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5) for three future time periods (2030s, 2050s, and 2080s). The primary determinants of nest-site selection by G. bengalensis evaluated using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) revealed a preference for larger trees closer to water sources. Based on our findings, we suggest possible reintroduction sites in the southern Western Ghats that are climatically stable in the future time periods. Our approach can encourage policymakers to prioritize sites for future species management in the wild. The key results and its implications on conservation of G. bengalensis populations within the Western Ghats hotspot are further discussed in detail.

AB  - Effective conservation requires an understanding not only of contemporary vegetation distributions in the landscape, but also cognizance of vegetation transitions over time with the goal of maintaining persistence of all states within the landscape. Using a state and transition model framework, we investigated temporal transitions over 31years in species composition among five upland swamp vegetation communities in southeastern Australia. We applied fuzzy clustering to document transitions across communities; evaluated the resilience and resistance of communities to change; and explored the relationship between ecosystem states and major environmental factors posited to structure the system. We also evaluated the predictive ability of an established vegetation dynamics model. We found that community composition remained stable or underwent reversible or directional transitions depending on the vegetation type. Wetter communities (Ti-tree thicket and Cyperoid heath) were more stable (i.e., resistant) while drier communities showed a greater propensity to transition (i.e., had lower resistance) under the observed disturbance regime (low variance fire intervals). The resilience of drier communities differed under this regime, with Banksia thicket showing reversible compositional change, while Restioid heath and Sedgeland showed directional change. In accord with an established conceptual model, we found that communities were distributed along a hydrological gradient. In addition, vegetation structure, along with light penetration to ground level, differentiated communities. However, internal dynamics of drier communities were complex: differences in fire regime (penultimate fire interval in 2014 and number of fires since 1965) were unable to predict differences in community membership among sites. Aspects of the fire regime are expected to be more important predictors if fire intervals vary more strongly among sites in the future. Fuzzy clustering of compositional data allows managers to track community transitions over time and facilitates planned interventions for conservation purposes.

AB  - Within the semiarid regions of New South Wales, Australia, the endangered southern bell frog (Litoria raniformis) occupies a landscape that is characterised by unpredictable rainfall and periodic flooding. Limited knowledge of the movement and habitat-occupancy patterns of this species in response to flood events has hampered conservation efforts. We used radio-tracking to assess changes in movement patterns and habitat occupancy of L. raniformis (n = 40) over three different periods (November, January and April/May) that coincided with the flooding, full capacity and subsequent drying of waterbodies within an irrigation landscape. We assessed (1) the use of permanent and ephemeral habitats in response to flooding and drying and (2) distances moved, turning angles and dispersion of frogs during wetland flooding, full capacity and drying. Individuals remained in permanent waterbodies in November but had abandoned these areas in favour of flooded ephemeral waterbodies by January. As the ephemeral waterbodies dried, radio-tracked individuals moved back into permanent waterbodies. The movement patterns of radio-tracked individuals were significantly different in the three radio-tracking periods, but did not differ significantly between sexes. Individuals moved significantly greater distances over 24 h, in straighter lines and movements were more dispersed while they occupied ephemeral waterbodies during January than when they occupied permanent waterbodies during November and April/May. Local weather conditions did not influence movement patterns when all three tracking periods were modelled together using a single linear stepwise regression. The dynamic distribution of habitat patches over space and time, combined with changing patterns of resource utilisation and movement of L. raniformis, highlights the importance of incorporating both permanent and ephemeral habitat patches into conservation plans. Reductions in flood frequency and extent of ephemeral wetlands due to modified flooding regimes have the capacity to limit dispersal of this species, even when permanent waterbodies remain unchanged.

AB  - Species distribution models are an important component of natural-resource conservation planning efforts. Independent, external evaluation of their accuracy is important before they are used in management contexts. We evaluated the classification accuracy of two species distribution models designed to predict the distribution of pygmy rabbit Brachylagus idahoensis habitat in southwestern Wyoming, USA. The Nature Conservancy model was deductive and based on published information and expert opinion, whereas the Wyoming Natural Diversity Database model was statistically derived using historical observation data. We randomly selected 187 evaluation survey points throughout southwestern Wyoming in areas predicted to be habitat and areas predicted to be nonhabitat for each model. The Nature Conservancy model correctly classified 39 of 77 (50.6%) unoccupied evaluation plots and 65 of 88 (73.9%) occupied plots for an overall classification success of 63.3%. The Wyoming Natural Diversity Database model correctly classified 53 of 95 (55.8%) unoccupied plots and 59 of 88 (67.0%) occupied plots for an overall classification success of 61.2%. Based on 95% asymptotic confidence intervals, classification success of the two models did not differ. The models jointly classified 10.8% of the area as habitat and 47.4% of the area as nonhabitat, but were discordant in classifying the remaining 41.9% of the area. To evaluate how anthropogenic development affected model predictive success, we surveyed 120 additional plots among three density levels of gas-field road networks. Classification success declined sharply for both models as road-density level increased beyond 5 km of roads per km-squared area. Both models were more effective at predicting habitat than nonhabitat in relatively undeveloped areas, and neither was effective at accounting for the effects of gas-energy-development road networks. Resource managers who wish to know the amount of pygmy rabbit habitat present in an area or wanting to direct gas-drilling efforts away from pygmy rabbit habitat may want to consider both models in an ensemble manner, where more confidence is placed in mapped areas (i.e., pixels) for which both models agree than for areas where there is model disagreement.

AB  - Marine spatial planning relies on detailed spatial information of marine areas to ensure effective conservation of species. To enhance our understanding of marine habitat use by the highly pelagic Bermuda petrel Pterodroma cahow, we deployed GPS tags on 6 chick-rearing adults in April 2019 and constructed a habitat suitability model using locations classified as foraging to explore functional responses to a selection of marine environmental variables. We defined 15 trips for 5 individuals, ranging from 1-6 trips per bird, that included both short and long foraging excursions indicative of a dual foraging strategy that optimizes chick feeding and self maintenance. The maximum distance birds flew from Bermuda during foraging trips ranged from 61 to 2513 km (total trip lengths: 186-14 051 km). Behaviourally deduced foraging habitat was best predicted at shorter distances from the colony, under warmer sea surface temperature, greater sea surface height, and in deeper water compared to transiting locations; our model results indicated that suitable foraging habitat exists beyond the core home range of the population, as far north as the highly productive Gulf Stream frontal system, and within the territorial waters of both the USA and Canada. Our results are crucial to inform management decisions and international conservation efforts by better identifying potential threats encountered at sea by this globally rare seabird and highlighting jurisdictions potentially responsible for mitigating those threats.

AB  - The coastline of Northern Sonora is dominated by hypersaline estuaries and vast rocky intertidal zones that are intermittently covered by the extreme tides characteristic of the Northern Gulf of California. Research on the spatial-temporal distribution of flora and fauna in wetland, sandy-muddy bottoms, the pelagic zone, subtidal rocky reefs and an offshore island offer an in depth characterization of the region's habitats and allow the definition of a unique biological Corridor for the coastal zone between Punta Borrascoso and Puerto Lobos, Sonora. Trophic studies and coupled oceanographic-biological models validated by larval dispersal and population genetic studies on commercial species highlight the connectivity between marine and coastal habitats and support the Corridor as a distinct management unit, especially for fisheries. Patterns of human use along the coast (fisheries, tourism and coastal development) have been documented and currently stakeholders in six communities are engaged in fisheries monitoring and management. The wealth of information available on this Corridor supports an ecosystem-based approach for fisheries management. The traditional hurdles to successful implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management can be overcome for the coastal fisheries of the Penasco Corridor by defining essential habitats for important target species, identifying trophic interactions, involving fishers and coastal communities in spatial planning and decision-making, and creating a positive incentive system.

AB  - Raptor and corvid electrocutions cause continental conservation concerns for breeding, migrating, and wintering birds. Although concerns are widespread, mitigation is implemented primarily at local scales of individual electric utilities. By not considering landscape-scale patterns, conservation strategies may fail to focus mitigation where efforts are needed most. To enable resource managers to consider electrocution risk at larger scales, we developed a regional model of distribution power pole (pole) density in a grid of 1-km(2) cells throughout Colorado and Wyoming. To do so, we obtained data on pole locations from a sample of electric utilities covering 31% of Colorado and Wyoming, and developed a predictive model of poles throughout the remainder of the 2 states. Pole density was influenced by road lengths, number of oil and gas wells, slope, development, and land cover. Poles were densest in areas with high road lengths, high numbers of wells, and relatively flat terrain, and in areas developed for agriculture or human residences. When model predictions are viewed together with species-specific habitat maps, locations where high pole densities overlap habitat suggest areas where mitigating electrocution risk could be prioritized. Communication between resource managers and local utilities could then clarify the poles that caused the highest risk to raptors from electrocution. Thus, the model provides a framework for systematic spatial prioritization in support of regional conservation planning to minimize electrocution of raptors and corvids.

AB  - The construction of predictive models of species distribution for conservation and regional planning can be facilitated by automatic procedures employed for the selection and transformation of predictors. It has been claimed, however, that empirical predictive models benefit from the inclusion of expert opinion at different stages of the model-building process. This is a time-consuming task that is limited by the availability of experts and difficult to standardize. Automated procedures for predictor selection based on statistical criteria are faster and easier to integrate into a geographic information system and may render highly explanatory models that fit the data with which they were built. But these models do not necessarily predict independent observations well and cannot be used to extrapolate to other areas. On the contrary, supervised models may include more frequently causal relationships, and therefore may more accurately predict new observations and extrapolate better to other areas. We built predictive models for the presence/absence of 10 bird species in two areas of Andalusia (southwestern Spain) to compare three different procedures for predictor selection ranging from a completely unsupervised to a fully supervised method. We evaluated models in three ways: (1) with the same data used to build the models, (2) with a different evaluation data set, and (3) with data from a different geographic area. The increase in the degree of expert input during model construction resulted in a significant decrease of model predictive ability when evaluated with an independent data set, and did not improve the predictive ability of the model when transferred to a new area. Unsupervised models had a greater tendency to overfit the building data, but this did not negatively affect model predictive ability or transferability to a new area. Incorporating expert opinion in the model-building process neither rendered better models as measured by their predictive ability nor resulted in models that were better suited to other regions. Therefore, unsupervised fitting procedures seem to be an adequate and cost-effective way to proceed when the aim is to generate potential distribution maps of species in a regional context.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to primate populations globally. The Endangered golden monkey Cercopithecus mitis kandti is only found in two small forest fragments: the Virunga massif in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Gishwati Forest in Rwanda. Little is known about the abundance and distribution of this subspecies, or threats to its survival. During 2007-2018, we collected data along 893.7 km of line transects and 354.2 km of recce trails in Volcanoes National Park and in Gishwati-Mukura National Park to estimate golden monkey density and examine any threats. In Volcanoes National Park, golden monkeys were found almost exclusively in the bamboo zone, and in Gishwati-Mukura National Park they occurred only in the remnant tropical montane Gishwati Forest. In Volcanoes National Park, density was estimated to be 7.89 (95% CI: 3.85-16.19), 5.41 (2.64-11.08), and 5.47 (3.68-8.14) groups per km(2) in 2007, 2011 and 2017-2018, respectively. This corresponds to a total of 4,331 individuals (95% CI: 2,723-5,938) in 2007, 4,487 (2,903-6,071) in 2011 and 4,626 (4,165-5,088) in 2017-2018. In Gishwati Forest, group density averaged 1.98 (95% CI: 1.27-3.16) per km(2), corresponding to 172 (95% CI: 154-190) individuals in 2017-2018. Survey results from Volcanoes National Park suggest that the golden monkey population has been stable during 2007-2018. Limited habitat, illegal activities such as harvesting of bamboo and firewood, and the presence of feral dogs, threaten the golden monkey in Rwanda and require continued monitoring. The development of a conservation action plan is a priority to protect this species.

AB  - Perhaps no subject is more intriguing and complex than climate change and its effects on ecosystems and their biological communities. Changes in precipitation and snowmelt patterns, sea level rise, increased intensity of storms and wet-weather events, thawing permafrost, changes in vegetation and wildlife composition and distribution, and other effects present significant policy and land management challenges. Scientific modeling and analyses demonstrate that the effects of a changing climate are complex, with high variability over time, space, and species, including effects on benthic organisms. The variable effects of a changing climate complicate decision making, rendering scenario planning, adaptive management, and other management learning tools increasingly important. The very complexity of effects presents particularly difficult challenges for policy makers and resource managers because the available science often is highly uncertain. Thus, other decision support tools are needed to help managers anticipate and respond to local and regional conditions. Effective policy and management require relevant science to inform decision making. Key needs include more assessments of ecosystem and species trends and their possible linkage to climate change and a better understanding of the interplay of multiple variables, how different management regimes might affect ecosystems and species survival, and how to apply risk management tools and adaptive management to resource issues.

AB  - Wild predators are targeted if they are perceived to affect game species or domestic animals. Over the last century, the direct persecution of birds of prey and mammalian carnivores has led to their widespread decline, even local extirpations. Many such cases involved the illegal use of poisoned bait. We used 1,305 detected poisoning events and 59 biophysical variables to construct a distribution model of illegal poisoning throughout Andalusia, southern Spain. We chose this region because the largest number of poisoning events recorded in Spain were detected in Andalusia during the period 19902005. Our results showed greater incidence of poisoning was correlated with areas of high predator richness and high wild rabbit hunting yields. Thus, we hypothesize that wildlife managers should be able to estimate current and potential poisoning areas using frequency of poisoning events data. Managers can then focus control within those areas identified as conflict zones and establish surveillance schemes that prevent the loss of wildlife within the targeted areas.

AB  - Glacial refugia considerably shaped the phylogeographical structure of species and may influence intra-specific morphological, genetic, and adaptive differentiation. However, the impact of the Quaternary ice ages on the phylogeographical structure of North American temperate mammalian species is not well-studied. Here, we surveyed similar to 1600 individuals of the widely distributed woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) using mtDNA control region sequences to investigate if glacial refugia contributed to the phylogeographical structure in this subspecies. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction, a median-joining network, and mismatch distributions supported postglacial expansions of woodland caribou from three glacial refugia dating back to 13544-22005 years. These three lineages consisted almost exclusively of woodland caribou mtDNA haplotypes, indicating that phylogeographical structure was mainly shaped by postglacial expansions. The putative centres of these lineages are geographically separated; indicating disconnected glacial refugia in the Rocky Mountains, east of the Mississippi, and the Appalachian Mountains. This is in congruence with the fossil record that caribou were distributed in these areas during the Pleistocene. Our results suggest that the last glacial maximum substantially shaped the phylogeographical structure of this large mammalian North American species that will be affected by climatic change. Therefore, the presented results will be essential for future conservation planning in woodland caribou.

AB  - Understanding how environmental characteristics affect biodiversity patterns, from individual species to communities of species, is critical for mitigating effects of global change. A central goal for conservation planning and monitoring is the ability to accurately predict the occurrence of species communities and how these communities change over space and time. This in turn leads to a challenging and long-standing problem in the field of computer science - how to perform accurate multi-label classification with hundreds of labels? The key challenge of this problem is its exponential-sized output space with regards to the number of labels to be predicted. Therefore, it is essential to facilitate the learning process by exploiting correlations (or dependency) among labels. Previous methods mostly focus on modelling the correlation on label pairs; however, complex relations between real-world objects often go beyond second order. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-label classification, High-order Tie-in Variational Autoencoder (HOT-VAE), which performs adaptive high-order label correlation learning. We experimentally verify that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on a bird distribution dataset on both conventional F1 scores and a variety of ecological metrics. To show our method is general, we also perform empirical analysis on seven other public real-world datasets in several application domains, and Hot-VAE exhibits superior performance to previous methods.

AB  - Bonelli's eagle (Hieraaetus fasciatus) is an endangered bird of prey that is suffering a rapid decline in most of its distribution range in Europe. The aim of this study is to identify suitable areas used by juvenile eagles during their dispersal phase, Knowing the location of these target areas will help to plan adequate conservation programs to reduce the high juvenile mortality rates this species is suffering presently. The combined use of radio-telemetry for identifying core areas, Generalised Linear Models (G.L.M.) for producing predictive mathematical models and Geographic Information Systems (G.I.S.) for transferring predictive models into digital cartography predict well the presence of juvenile Bonelli's eagles in dispersal areas. We built three different Generalised Lineal Models using topography, land-use/land-cover and human disturbance as explanatory variables. Our sample units were I I settlement areas used by juvenile eagles during dispersal and I I other areas within available habitat generated at random. Settlement areas were identified as the core areas used by radio-tagged eagles monitored during their first years of life, Immature eagles preferred habitats with greater percentages of pasture within the circular sampling area. Topographic features showed that the most intensively used areas by immature birds were generally steeper southeast-facing slopes. Settlement areas were also situated farther from villages and roads than expected. The land-use model performed well classifying correctly 85.9% of cases validated using a data-splitting strategy. The topographic model also performed well, classifying correctly 81.39% of cases validated by the same methodology, Predictive cartography showed suitable dispersal areas within potential juvenile distribution ranges that enable more efficient design of special conservation programmes.

AB  - Mycteroperca bonaci (black grouper) is one of the most sought species of grouper along its entire distribution, being a prime target for demersal line fisheries because of its high commercial value. Nonetheless, because of population declines the species is considered near threatened according to the IUCN red list. The present study aimed to determine the population parameters of M. bonaci, including growth, reproduction and mortality, and thus contributes to measures towards its conservation and management in the southwestern Atlantic. The sampling area is in the North Brazil Shelf, off Maranhao State, an area of intense fisheries development and yet poorly known. The large continental shelf harbours unique coral reef formations and has been declared an ecologically or biologically significant marine area (EBSA). Sampling on landing sites was carried out monthly between May 2017 and January 2019. A total of 137 black grouper specimens were sampled from commercial landings of artisanal fisheries. The size of the specimens ranged from 44 to 157 cm, and the weight varied from 0.976 to 54 kg. The length-weight was established: log(TW) = -11.26 + 3.01log(TL). Histological analysis of the gonads confirmed only the presence of female individuals, and the occurrence of individuals in the sexual transition was not recorded. Higher GSI values and higher frequency of spawning capable staged individuals occurred during the months of June to August, indicating spawning peaks. The estimated age of sexual maturity A50 for females was 4.62 years (x_$$ \underset{\_}{x} $$ 93 cm-TL). The growth parameters for the Von Bertalanffy model were TL infinity (cm): 185.5, k: 0.04, t(0) (year): -4.75 (t(0) not fixed) and TL infinity (cm): 141, k: 0.11 (t(0) = 0 fixed). The total estimated mortality rate (Z) according to catch length presented a Z value = 0.11, and the natural mortality was M = 0.04 year(-1). This is the first study on the age and growth of M. bonaci in the SWA, a region where the species is considered as endangered according to Brazil's red list regional assessment. Only females were present in the samples, results that suggest either differential capturability of sexes because of distinct patterns of behaviour or distribution or an effect of selective mortality upon larger and older individuals, as the species is described as a protogynous hermaphrodite. This indicates the need to closely manage this population to avoid collapses. Recovery plans that have been planned by the Brazilian government but not yet implemented for the species must be put into practice to avoid progressive decline as fisheries target more remote areas.

AB  - Boosted Regression Trees. Excellent for data-poor spatial management but hard to use
   Marine resource managers and scientists often advocate spatial approaches to manage data-poor species. Existing spatial prediction and management techniques are either insufficiently robust, struggle with sparse input data, or make suboptimal use of multiple explanatory variables. Boosted Regression Trees feature excellent performance and are well suited to modelling the distribution of data-limited species, but are extremely complicated and time-consuming to learn and use, hindering access for a wide potential user base and therefore limiting uptake and usage.
   BRTs automated and simplified for accessible general use with rich feature set
   We have built a software suite in R which integrates pre-existing functions with new tailor-made functions to automate the processing and predictive mapping of species abundance data: by automating and greatly simplifying Boosted Regression Tree spatial modelling, the gbm. auto R package suite makes this powerful statistical modelling technique more accessible to potential users in the ecological and modelling communities. The package and its documentation allow the user to generate maps of predicted abundance, visualise the representativeness of those abundance maps and to plot the relative influence of explanatory variables and their relationship to the response variables. Databases of the processed model objects and a report explaining all the steps taken within the model are also generated. The package includes a previously unavailable Decision Support Tool which combines estimated escapement biomass (the percentage of an exploited population which must be retained each year to conserve it) with the predicted abundance maps to generate maps showing the location and size of habitat that should be protected to conserve the target stocks (candidate MPAs), based on stakeholder priorities, such as the minimisation of fishing effort displacement.
   Gbm.auto for management in various settings
   By bridging the gap between advanced statistical methods for species distribution modelling and conservation science, management and policy, these tools can allow improved spatial abundance predictions, and therefore better management, decision-making, and conservation. Although this package was built to support spatial management of a data-limited marine elasmobranch fishery, it should be equally applicable to spatial abundance modelling, area protection, and stakeholder engagement in various scenarios.

AB  - Although water is essential for photosynthetic activation in lichens, rates of vapor uptake and activation in humid air, which likely influence their niche preferences and distribution ranges, are insufficiently known. This study simultaneously quantifies rehydration kinetics and PSII reactivation in sympatric, yet morphologically and functionally distinct cephalolichens (Lobaria amplissima, Lobaria pulmonaria, Lobaria virens). High-temporal resolution monitoring of rehydrating thalli by automatic weighing combined with chlorophyll fluorescence imaging of maximal PSII efficiency (FV/FM) was applied to determine species-specific rates of vapor uptake and photosynthetic activation. The thin and loosely attached growth form of L. pulmonaria rehydrates and reactivates faster in humid air than the thick L. amplissima, with L. virens in between. This flexible hydration strategy is consistent with L. pulmonaria's wide geographical distribution stretching from rainforests to continental forests. By contrast, the thick and resupinate L. amplissima reactivates slowly in humid air but stores much water when provided in abundance. This prolongs active periods after rain, which could represent an advantage where abundant rain and stem flow alternates with long-lasting drying. Understanding links between morphological traits and functional responses, and their ecological implications for species at risk, is crucial to conservation planning and for modelling populations under various climate scenarios.

AB  - The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is a cryptic and rare big cat inhabiting Asia's remote and harsh elevated areas. Its population has decreased across the globe for various reasons, including human-snow leopard conflicts (HSCs). Understanding the snow leopard's distribution range and habitat interactions with human/livestock is essential for understanding the ecological context in which HSCs occur and thus gives insights into how to mitigate HSCs. In this study, a MaxEnt model predicted the snow leopard's potential distribution and analyzed the land use/cover to determine the habitat interactions of snow leopards with human/livestock in Karakoram-Pamir, northern Pakistan. The results indicated an excellent model performance for predicting the species' potential distribution. The variables with higher contributions to the model were the mean diurnal temperature range (51.7%), annual temperature range (18.5%), aspect (14.2%), and land cover (6.9%). The model predicted approximately 10% of the study area as a highly suitable habitat for snow leopards. Appropriate areas included those at an altitude ranging from 2721 to 4825 m, with a mean elevation of 3796.9 +/- 432 m, overlapping between suitable snow leopard habitats and human presence. The human encroachment (human settlements and agriculture) in suitable snow leopard habitat increased by 115% between 2008 and 2018. Increasing encroachment and a clear overlap between snow leopard suitable habitat and human activities, signs of growing competition between wildlife and human/livestock for limited rangeland resources, may have contributed to increasing HSCs. A sound land use plan is needed to minimize overlaps between suitable snow leopard habitat and human presence to mitigate HSCs in the long run.

AB  - Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) in central Nepal is known for its rich biodiversity and the landscape is expected to provide corridors for species range shift in response to climate change. Environmental assessments have identified biological invasions and other anthropogenic activities as major threats to the biodiversity in the CHAL. One of the rapidly spreading Invasive Alien Plant species (IAPs) in the CHAL is Parthenium hysterophorus L., a neotropical invasive weed of global significance. This study aimed to investigate the current and future projected suitable habitat of P. hysterophorus in the CHAL using MaxEnt modelling in three "Representative Concentration Pathways" (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) corresponding to different greenhouse gases emission trajectories for the year 2050 and 2070. A total of 288 species occurrence points, six bioclimatic variables - mean diurnal range, isothermality, annual precipitation, precipitation of driest month, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of driest quarter and two topographic variables (aspect and slope) were selected for MaxEnt modelling. Potential range shift in terms of increase or decline in the suitable habitat areas under the projected scenarios were calculated. Slope and annual precipitation were the most important variables that explained the current distribution of P. hysterophorus. Twenty percent of the total area of CHAL was predicted to be suitable habitat for the growth of P. hysterophorus in the current climatic condition. Highest gain in the suitable habitat of this noxious weed was found under RCP 4.5 scenario in 2050 and 2070, whereas there will be a loss in the suitable habitat under RCP 8.5 scenario in 2050 and 2070. Out of four physiographic regions present in CHAL, three regions - Siwalik, Middle Mountain and High Mountain have suitable habitat for P. hysterophorus under current climatic condition. The mountainous region is likely to be affected more than the Siwalik region by further spread of P. hysterophorus in the future under low (RCP 2.6) to medium (RCP 4.5) emission scenarios. The suitable habitat for this weed is likely to increase in the protected areas of mountain regions (Langtang National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area and Manaslu Conservation Area) in the future. The results have revealed a risk of spreading P. hysterophorus from present localities to non-invaded areas in the current and future climatic condition. Such risk needs to be considered by decision makers and resource managers while planning for effective management of this weed to reduce its ecological and economic impacts in the CHAL.

AB  - The Bale Mountains of Ethiopia contain the largest contiguous area of alpine habitat in Africa. The region provides critical water resources and other essential environmental services to highland communities, endemic wildlife, and millions of downstream people in East Africa. Increasing land use change has created concern over degradation to headwater wetlands and potential impacts on hydrologic regimes. Baseline understanding of wetland dynamics is lacking, however, and little is known about their function in the regional hydrologic system. We used remote sensing, machine learning, and field surveys to map the distribution of Afroalpine wetlands in the Bale Mountains. We developed a wetland typology based on hydrogeomorphic characteristics and a conceptual model of surface-groundwater flow. Our results show that wetland extent more than doubles between wet and dry seasons and that only 4 percent of the Afroalpine zone is saturated year-round. We also found evidence of a hydrologic continuum based on volcanic and glacial legacies, with wetlands at elevations above approximately 3,800 m asl likely to be ephemeral and wetlands at lower elevations tending to be perennial. Further interpretation suggests that local geology is a principal control on wetland distribution and hydrologic attenuation in the Bale Mountains. This lays the foundation for further research into surface-groundwater connectivity, climate change impacts, and conservation planning. Key Words: Afroalpine, Ethiopian highlands, HGM classification, mountain water tower, tropical alpine.

TI  - The distribution of the dwarf succulent genus Conophytum NEBr. (Aizoaceae) in southern Africa
T2  - BOTHALIA
LA  - English
KW  - BIODIVERSITY
AB  - Background: The dwarf succulent genus Conophytum N.E.Br. is one of the most species rich in the Aizoceae. The genus is most closely associated with a region of high floral endemism and biodiversity, the Succulent Karoo biome in south-western Africa.
   Objectives: To examine the distribution of Conophytum in south-western Namibia and in the Northern and Western Cape Provinces of South Africa.
   Method: A database comprising 2798 locality records representing all known species and subspecies of the genus Conophytum has been constructed.
   Results: The genus is primarily restricted to the arid winter-rainfall region of the Northern and Western Cape Provinces of South Africa and south-western Namibia, within the Greater Cape Floristic Region. Whilst taxa are found across all the main biomes in the region (the Succulent Karoo, Nama Karoo, Desert and Fynbos biomes), 94% of Conophytum taxa are found only in the Succulent Karoo biome and predominantly (88% of taxa) within South Africa. Endemism within specific bioregions is a feature of the genus and similar to 60% of taxa are endemic to the Succulent Karoo. Approximately 28% of all taxa could be considered point endemics. Whilst the genus has a relatively wide geographical range, we identify a pronounced centre of endemism in the southern Richtersveld.
   Conclusion: The genus Conophytum can be used as a good botanical model for studying patterns of diversity and speciation in the Succulent Karoo biome, the effects of climate change on dwarf succulents, and for informing conservation planning efforts.

AB  - Spatially-explicit population models allow a link between demography and the landscape. We developed a spatially-explicit simulation model for the red-cockaded woodpecker, Picoides borealis, an endangered and territorial cooperative breeder endemic to the southeastern United States. This kind of model is especially appropriate for this species because it can incorporate the spatial constraints on dispersal of helpers, and because territory locations are predictable. The model combines demographic data from a long-term study with a description of the spatial location of territories. Sensitivity analysis of demographic parameters revealed that population stability was most sensitive to changes in female breeder mortality, mortality of female dispersers and the number of fledglings produced per brood. Population behavior was insensitive to initial stage distribution; reducing the initial number of birds by one-half had a negligible effect. Most importantly, we found that the spatial distribution of territories had as strong an effect on response to demographic stochasticity as territory number. Populations were stable when territories were highly aggregated, with as few as 49 territories. When territories were highly dispersed, more than 169 territories were required to achieve stability. Model results indicate the importance of considering the spatial distribution of territories in management plans, and suggest that this approach is worthy of further development.

AB  - In order to assess the effects of climate change in temperate rainforest plants in southern South America in terms of habitat size, representation in protected areas, considering also if the expected impacts are similar for dominant trees and understory plant species, we used niche modeling constrained by species migration on 118 plant species, considering two groups of dominant trees and two groups of understory ferns. Representation in protected areas included Chilean national protected areas, private protected areas, and priority areas planned for future reserves, with two thresholds for minimum representation at the country level: 10% and 17%. With a 10% representation threshold, national protected areas currently represent only 50% of the assessed species. Private reserves are important since they increase up to 66% the species representation level. Besides, 97% of the evaluated species may achieve the minimum representation target only if the proposed priority areas were included. With the climate change scenario representation levels slightly increase to 53%, 69%, and 99%, respectively, to the categories previously mentioned. Thus, the current location of all the representation categories is useful for overcoming climate change by 2050. Climate change impacts on habitat size and representation of dominant trees in protected areas are not applicable to understory plants, highlighting the importance of assessing these effects with a larger number of species. Although climate change will modify the habitat size of plant species in South American temperate rainforests, it will have no significant impact in terms of the number of species adequately represented in Chile, where the implementation of the proposed reserves is vital to accomplish the present and future minimum representation. Our results also show the importance of using migration dispersal constraints to develop more realistic future habitat maps from climate change predictions.

AB  - Woodpeckers are often focal species for informing management of recently burned forests. Snags generated by wildfire provide key nesting and foraging resources for woodpeckers, and nest cavities excavated by woodpeckers are subsequently used by many other species. Habitat suitability models applicable in newly burned forest are important management tools for identifying areas likely to be used by nesting woodpeckers. Here we present and test predictive models for mapping woodpecker nest-site habitat across wildfire locations that can be used to inform post-fire planning and salvage logging decisions. From 2009 to 2016, we monitored 313 nest sites of 4 species-Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Hairy Woodpecker (Dryobates villosus), White-headed Woodpecker (D. albolarvatus), and Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus)-from 3 wildfires in the Northern Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascades 1-5 yr after fire. Using these data, we developed habitat suitability index models that compared nest vs. non-nest sites for each species using (1) exclusively remotely sensed covariates, and (2) combinations of remotely sensed and field-collected covariates. We emphasized predictive performance across wildfire locations when selecting models to retain generalizable habitat relationships useful for informing management in newly burned locations. We identified models for all 4 species with strong predictive performance across wildfire locations despite notable variation in conditions among locations, suggesting broad applicability to guide post-fire management in the Sierra Nevada region. Top models for nest-site selection underscored the importance of high burn severity at the local scale, lower burn severity at the 1-km scale, mid-sized nest-tree diameters, and nest trees with broken tops. Models restricted to remotely sensed covariates exhibited similar predictive performance as combination models and are valuable for mapping habitat across entire wildfire locations to help delineate project areas or habitat reserves. Combination models are especially relevant for design of silvicultural prescriptions.

AB  - Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is a vegetable with worldwide importance. Its wild or close related species are reservoirs of genes with potential use for the generation of varieties tolerant or resistant to specific biotic and abiotic factors. The objective was to determine the geographic distribution, ecological descriptors, and patterns of diversity and adaptation of 1296 accessions of native tomato from Mexico. An environmental information system was created with 21 climatic variables with a 1 km(2) spatial resolution. Using multivariate techniques (Principal Component Analysis, PCA; Cluster Analysis, CA) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the most relevant variables for accession distribution were identified, as well as the groups formed according to the environmental similarity among these. PCA determined that with the first three PCs (Principal Components), it is possible to explain 84.1% of the total variation. The most relevant information corresponded to seasonal variables of temperature and precipitation. CA revealed five statistically significant clusters. Ecological descriptors were determined and described by classifying accessions in Physiographic Provinces. Temperate climates were the most frequent among tomato accessions. Finally, the potential distribution was determined with the Maxent model with 10 replicates by cross-validation, identifying areas with a high probability of tomato presence. These results constitute a reliable source of useful information for planning accession sites collection and identifying accessions that are vulnerable or susceptible to conservation programs.

AB  - River floodplains are dynamic and fertile ecosystems where soil invertebrates such as earthworms can reach high population densities. Earthworms are an important food source for a wide range of organisms including species under conservation such as badgers. Flooding, however, reduces earthworrn numbers. Populations recover from cocoons that survive floods. If the period between two floods is too short such that cocoons cannot develop into reproductive adults, populations cannot sustain themselves. Both climate change and floodplain rehabilitation change the flooding frequency affecting earthworm populations.
   The present paper estimates the influence of climate change and floodplain rehabilitation on the viability of earthworm populations in a Dutch floodplain; the Afferdensche and Deestsche Waarden along the River Waal. This floodplain will be part of major river rehabilitation plans of the Dutch government. In those plans, the floodplain will experience the construction of a secondary channel and the removal of part of its minor embankment. To estimate the impact of these plans and climate change, we used a dataset of daily discharges for 1900-2003 for the River Rhine at the Dutch-German border. We perturbed this dataset to obtain two new datasets under climate change scenarios for 2050 and 2100. From the original and two projected datasets we derived the frequency distributions for the annual periods without inundations for the studied floodplain. We subsequently compared the duration of these inundation-free (dry) periods with the maturation age distribution for L. rilbellus as derived from a Dynamic Energy Budget model. This comparison yielded in which parts of our study area and under which climate conditions the populations would still be viable, be able to adapt or become extinct.
   The results show that climate change has almost no adverse effect on earthworm viability. This is because climate change reduces the flooding frequency during the earthworms growing season. Floodplain rehabilitation, on the other hand, reduces the part of the floodplain area where populations can sustain themselves. Before rehabilitation, only 12% of the floodplain area cannot sustain a viable earthworm population. After rehabilitation, this increases to 59%, 28% of which is due to more frequent flooding. Enhanced exposure to soil contaminants may further suppress earthworm viability. This could frustrate further nature development and the viability of earthworm-dependent species such as the badger (Meles meles) or little owl (Athene noctua vidalli species), which is an objective of the river rehabilitation plans in the Netherlands.

AB  - Climate change exposes benthic species populations in coastal ecosystems to a combination of different stressors (e.g., warming, acidification and eutrophication), threatening the sustainability of the ecological functions they provide. Thermal stress appears to be one of the strongest drivers impacting marine ecosystems, acting across a wide range of scales, from individual metabolic performances to geographic distribution of populations. Accounting for and integrating the response of species functional traits to thermal stress is therefore a necessary step in predicting how populations will respond to the warming expected in coming decades. Here, we developed an individual-based population model using a mechanistic formulation of metabolic processes within the framework of the dynamic energy budget theory. Through a large number of simulations, we assessed the sensitivity of population growth potential to thermal stress and food conditions based on a climate projection scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway; RCP8.5: no reduction of greenhouse gas emissions). We focused on three bivalve species with contrasting thermal tolerance ranges and distinct distribution ranges along 5,000km of coastline in the NE Atlantic: the Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas), and two mussel species: Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis. Our results suggest substantial and contrasting changes within species depending on local temperature and food concentration. Reproductive phenology appeared to be a core process driving the responses of the populations, and these patterns were closely related to species thermal tolerances. The nonlinear relationship we found between individual life-history traits and response at the population level emphasizes the need to consider the interactions resulting from upscaling across different levels of biological organisation. These results underline the importance of a process-based understanding of benthic population response to seawater warming, which will be necessary for forward planning of resource management and strategies for conservation and adaptation to environmental changes.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation necessitates not only preservation of single or multiple species but also the habitat as a whole along with its environment. Biological richness (BR) is a cumulative property of an ecological habitat and its surrounding environment, which has emerging implications in terms of management and planning. Six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to qualitatively stratify biological richness of forest vegetation in Subansiri district of Eastern Himalaya using customized software, Bio_CAP Higher biological richness was assigned to the habitats with (i) high species diversity, (ii) high degree of ecosystem uniqueness (EU), (iii) high economical value, (iv) complex terrain and (v) low disturbance level. This simple idea of integrated 'three-tier modeling approach' of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis; formed the basis of rapid assessment of biological richness.
   Satellite image interpretation using hybrid classification approach provided spatial distribution of vegetation types (corresponding to ecological habitats), with 89% accuracy. Landscape analysis was done using various quantitative indices that measured the heterogeneity and evaluated the patch characteristics. A methodology was developed for deriving relative adjacency weights from field data for calculation of juxtaposition of vegetation types. Biotic disturbance buffers (i.e., proximity zones around roads and human settlements) along with landscape parameters were combined to calculate disturbance index (DI), which in turn became an intermediate surrogate for BR assessment. Species diversity patterns along fragmentation and biotic disturbance gradients were adjudged to derive relative weights for DI computation. Species diversity (Shannon's index), ecosystem uniqueness (endemism status) and biodiversity value (BV) (total importance value (TIV)) were enumerated quantitatively that provided relative weights for BR computation. Terrain complexity (TC) was generated by calculating variance of the elevation image. Fifty-nine of total 764 species were found endemic to Eastern Himalaya with over all species endemism of 13 per ha. Shannon's index increased with decrease in fragmentation levels and increase of distance from sources of disturbance. BR index of the district was presented in five qualitative levels. Subtropical forests claim highest degree of biological richness as well as high disturbance index. This methodology has implications for rapid biodiversity assessment. Forest managers can use the DI and BR maps for gap analysis and prioritization of conservation activities viz., introduction of locale-specific species, thus protecting the forest habitats in situ.

AB  - Sudden oak death (SOD), a disease induced by the fungus-like pathogen Phytophthora ramorum, threatens to seriously reduce or eliminate several oak species endemic to the west coast of North America. We investigated how the disappearance of one of these species, coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), may affect populations of five resident oak-affiliated California birds - acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus), Nuttall's woodpecker (Picoides nuttallii), Hutton's vireo (Vireo huttoni), western scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica), and oak titmouse (Baeolophus inornatus) - using geocoded data from Audubon Christmas Bird Counts, North American Breeding Bird Surveys, and the California Gap Analysis. Capitalizing on observed relationships between the focal bird species and both oak species diversity and areal extent, we modeled relative bird abundance while assuming complete loss of Q. agrifolia and complete, partial, or no loss of oak habitat following a disease sweep. Post-SOD projections of bird populations occurring within the range of coast live oak were on average 25-68% smaller and 13-49% more variable relative to pre-SOD estimates. SOD effects were greatest for habitats with low initial oak species diversity. Climatic SOD models predicted that the disease stands to negatively impact populations of all five focal bird species throughout 20% of California's coast live oak habitats. This study provides the first spatially explicit insights into the potential effects of SOD on avian distribution and abundance. Results may be used to help prioritize conservation plans aimed at minimizing overall community level disturbances resulting from the disease. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Identifying and quantifying the extent to which landscape-level habitat variables drive the spatial distribution of individuals across a region can provide fundamental insights into a species ecology and be essential to wildlife management and conservation plans. Although the preferences for habitat resources and the resources themselves are not static over time, most research at large spatial scales does not consider seasonal effects nor quantify annual temporal variability in the spatial distribution of habitat resources. In this study, we used a machine learning (boosted regression trees [BRTs]) and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach to quantify seasonal habitat selection across three life stages (nest, late brood, and winter habitat) of sage-grouse and estimated annual stability across a 13-year dataset in south-central Wyoming. Generalized linear mixed models had high area under the curve (AUC) values, but were not as high as the BRT models that had mean AUC values of 0.86, 0.81, and 0.87 for nest, late brood, and winter habitat, respectively. Generalized linear mixed models and BRT result provided similar results, but because of the higher validation values of the BRT models, we assessed annual variation by predicting the BRT models across years. We found significant spatial trends in the distribution of nesting habitat, with general decreases in the relative probability of use across the core of the study area and corresponding increases in selection on the periphery. The primary temporally shifting variables for the nesting BRT models were development, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and topographic wetness, suggesting they were shifting out of preferable ranges for these variables as habitat suitability was decreased over the course of our study. Winter habitat appeared to have similar spatial changes in probability of selection, but these changes were likely related to changes in winter precipitation and snow depth, which were the primary contributors to the winter BRT models. The annual dynamics of habitat selection are seldom addressed in large-scale research but can have potentially dramatic influences on our identification of preferred habitats.

AB  - Planting eucalypt stands in the Iberian Peninsula is controversial. In Galicia (NW Spain) the area covered by eucalypts and the intensity of eucalypt timber harvesting are among the highest in Europe. In this region, management plans for forest resources are intended for relatively homogeneous territorial units, smaller than the province, called forest districts (ForDis). The status of eucalypt plantations in ForDis is usually assumed to be highly variable, although this has not yet been quantified. Within this framework, the present study aimed to integrate an existing Eucalyptus globulus distribution model for current conditions and two different climate change scenarios with current forest cover (including eucalypt plantations) to provide quantitative and spatiallyexplicit information for identifying ForDis where eucalypt plantations may become problematic. Four parameters (suitability, importance, potential expansion and fragmentation) comprising 13 related indicators were calculated for eucalypt plantations in each of the 19 ForDis in the region. The findings show that more than 44% of the afforested area is covered by eucalypts in the province of A Corun?a and in forest districts VI and XVIII (in Lugo and Pontevedra, respectively). A huge continuous patch of eucalypt, of more than 35,000 ha, was detected across two ForDis (I and VI). The potentially high ecological and financial risks associated with this vast area of monoculture would negatively affect the sustainability and multifunctionality of these forest ecosystems. Analysis of the expected suitability of areas for E. globulus in forthcoming climate change scenarios identified four inland ForDis (IX, X in Lugo, XVI in Pontevedra and XI in Ourense) where an important increase in cover by this species may occur if no action is taken. Moreover, these areas overlap with the large ongoing expansion already observed for the more productive and frost-resistant E. nitens. The findings also revealed edge-dominated native broadleaved forest patches in the habitat suitable for E. globulus in the provinces of A Corun?a and Lugo. Although the current level of occupancy of eucalypt within natural protected areas (NPAs) is moderate, the suitability of these areas for eucalypt plantations will increase in the predicted climate change scenario, possibly leading to aggravation of potential conflicts in these biodiversity hotspots. Regional forest agencies should therefore increase monitoring efforts to prevent further impacts on native forest and natural protected areas.
   The proposed quantitative indicators and methodology used are intended to be useful for forest planners and policy decision-makers in other regions where current and future conflicts related to exotic tree plantations are expected.

AB  - Bird species richness is highly dependent on the amount of energy available in an ecosystem, with more available energy supporting higher species richness. A good indicator for available energy is Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), which can be estimated from satellite data.
   Our question was how temporal dynamics in GPP affect bird species richness. Specifically, we evaluated the potential of the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) derived from MODIS GPP data together with environmental and climatic variables to explain annual patterns in bird richness across the conterminous United States. By focusing on annual DHIs, we expand on previous applications of multi-year composite DHIs, and could evaluate lag-effects between changes in GPP and species richness.
   We used 8-day GPP data from 2003 to 2013 to calculate annual DHIs, which capture three aspects of vegetation productivity: (1) annual cumulative productivity, (2) annual minimum productivity, and (3) annual seasonality expressed as the coefficient of variation in productivity. For each year from 2003 to 2013, we calculated total bird species richness and richness within six functional guilds, based on North American Breeding Bird Survey data.
   The DHIs alone explained up to 53% of the variation in annual bird richness within the different guilds (adjusted deviance-squared D-adj(2) = 0.20-0.52), and up to 75% of the variation (D-adj(2) = 0.28-0.75) when combined with other environmental and climatic variables. Annual DHIs had the highest explanatory power for habitat-based guilds, such as grassland (D-adj(2) = 0.67) and woodland breeding species (D-adj(2) = 0.75). We found some inter-annual variability in the explanatory power of annual DHIs, with a difference of 5-7 percentage points in explained variation among years in DHI-only models, and 3-7 points for models combining DHI, environmental and climatic variables. Our results using lagged year models did not deviate substantially from same-year annual models.
   We demonstrate the relevance of annual DHIs for biodiversity science, as effective predictors of temporal variation in species richness patterns. We suggest that the use of annual DHIs can improve conservation planning, by conveying the range of patterns of biodiversity response to global changes, over time.

AB  - Animal habitat selection is an important and expansive area of research in ecology. In particular, the study of habitat selection is critical in habitat prioritization efforts for species of conservation concern. Landscape planning for species is happening at ever-increasing extents because of the appreciation for the role of landscape-scale patterns in species persistence coupled to improved datasets for species and habitats, and the expanding and intensifying footprint of human land uses on the landscape. We present a large-scale collaborative effort to develop habitat selection models across large landscapes and multiple seasons for prioritizing habitat for a species of conservation concern. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus, hereafter sage-grouse) occur in western semi-arid landscapes in North America. Range-wide population declines of this species have been documented, and it is currently considered as warranted but precluded from listing under the United States Endangered Species Act. Wyoming is predicted to remain a stronghold for sage-grouse populations and contains approximately 37% of remaining birds. We compiled location data from 14 unique radiotelemetry studies (data collected 1994-2010) and habitat data from high-quality, biologically relevant, geographic information system (GIS) layers across Wyoming. We developed habitat selection models for greater sage-grouse across Wyoming for 3 distinct life stages: 1) nesting, 2) summer, and 3) winter. We developed patch and landscape models across 4 extents, producing statewide and regional (southwest, central, northeast) models for Wyoming. Habitat selection varied among regions and seasons, yet preferred habitat attributes generally matched the extensive literature on sage-grouse seasonal habitat requirements. Across seasons and regions, birds preferred areas with greater percentage sagebrush cover and avoided paved roads, agriculture, and forested areas. Birds consistently preferred areas with higher precipitation in the summer and avoided rugged terrain in the winter. Selection for sagebrush cover varied regionally with stronger selection in the Northeast region, likely because of limited availability, whereas avoidance of paved roads was fairly consistent across regions. We chose resource selection function (RSF) thresholds for each model set (seasonalxregional combination) that delineated important seasonal habitats for sage-grouse. Each model set showed good validation and discriminatory capabilities within study-site boundaries. We applied the nesting-season models to a novel area not included in model development. The percentage of independent nest locations that fell directly within identified important habitat was not overly impressive in the novel area (49%); however, including a 500-m buffer around important habitat captured 98% of independent nest locations within the novel area. We also used leks and associated peak male counts as a proxy for nesting habitat outside of the study sites used to develop the models. A 1.5-km buffer around the important nesting habitat boundaries included 77% of males counted at leks in Wyoming outside of the study sites. Data were not available to quantitatively test the performance of the summer and winter models outside our study sites. The collection of models presented here represents large-scale resource-management planning tools that are a significant advancement to previous tools in terms of spatial and temporal resolution.

TI  - Adapting the botanical landscape of Melbourne Gardens (Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria) in response to climate change
T2  - PLANT DIVERSITY
LA  - English
AB  - Botanic gardens around the world maintain collections of living plants for science, conservation, education, beauty and more. These collections change over time - in scope and content - but the predicted impacts of climate change will require a more strategic approach to the succession of plant species and their landscapes. Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria has recently published a ' Landscape Succession Strategy' for its Melbourne Gardens, a spectacular botanical landscape established in 1846. The strategy recognizes that with 1.6 million visitors each year, responsibility for a heritage-listed landscape and the need to care for a collection of 8500 plant species of conservation and scientific importance, planting and planning must take into account anticipated changes to rainfall and temperature. The trees we plant today must be suitable for the climate of the twenty-second century. Specifically, the Strategy sets out the steps needed over the next twenty years to transition the botanic garden to one resilient to the climate modelled for 2090. The document includes a range of practical measures and achievable (and at times somewhat aspirational) targets. Climate analogues will be used to identify places in Australia and elsewhere with conditions today similar to those predicted for Melbourne in 2090, to help select new species for the collection. Modelling of the natural and cultivated distribution of species will be used to help select suitable growth forms to replace existing species of high value or interest. Improved understanding of temperature gradients within the botanic garden, water holding capacity of soils and plant water use behaviour is already resulting in better targeted planting and irrigation. The goal is to retain a similar diversity of species but transition the collection so that by 2036 at least 75% of the species are suitable for the climate in 2090. Over the next few years we hope to provide 100% of irrigation water from sustainable water sources, and infrastructure will be improved to adapt to predicted higher temperatures and more climatic extremes. At all times there will be a strong focus on assisting the broader community in their response to climate change. Copyright (C) 2017 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera is a benthic organism sensitive to hydrological regime alterations and habitat degradation driven by excessive fine bed material deposit (FBMD). Both issues are potentially exacerbated by climate change. Understanding how climate change affects future mussel habitats and the dispersal among them (dependent on the brown trout as fish host) can support the planning of effective conservation actions. To project the impacts of climate change on the mussel, a semi-mechanistic modelling cascade was implemented for the Aist catchment in Austria (630 km(2)), including a hydrological model, a hydraulic model, Random Forest Models for FBMD accumulation risk and Species Distribution Models. Two climate change models (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) for two future horizons (2060 and 2090) were considered. A graph-based assessment of the structural connectivity was used to measure the probability of successful dispersal. Results show a reduction of peak discharge that cascades into a widespread reduction in shear stresses during high flow. The mussel's habitats, defined by hydraulics (i.e. patches with low shear stresses during high flow), are predicted to be stable over the simulated scenarios. The pressure of FBMDs over the delineated habitat patches is predicted to increase in the future due to the reduced stream transport capacity, reducing up to 25% of the available patches in 2090 for RCP 8.5. Consequently, the mussel's dispersal probability decreases to 44.3%-75.6% of the maximum theoretical value, with the highest drops for short dispersal distances, impacting metapopulation dynamics. Synthesis and applications. The widespread issue of fine sediment deposition in the streambed will be exacerbated for those catchments where climate change reduces the stream transport capacity. The impacts on the freshwater pearl mussel include habitat loss due to the formation of a new unsuitable substrate, and a decrease in the potential dispersal among the residual habitats. Thus, conservation plans that aim to protect the mussel in the future should focus on the mitigation of fine bed material deposits, prioritizing those subreaches that offer the highest potential for preserving connectivity among suitable habitats.

AB  - Climate change is projected to have significant effects on the distribution of species globally, but research into the implications in parts of Africa has been limited. Using species distribution modelling, this study models climate change-related risks to the terrestrial biodiversity (birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants) of Kenya's economically-important and ecologically diverse Tana River Basin. Large reductions in species richness are projected with just 2 degrees C warming (relative to preindustrial levels) with birds and plants seeing the greatest impact. Potential climate refugia for biodiversity are identified within the basin, but often overlap with areas already converted to agriculture or set aside for agricultural expansion, and the majority are outside protected areas. Similarly, some protected areas contain no projected refugia at higher levels of global warming, showing they may be insufficient to protect the basin's biodiversity as climate changes. However, risks to biodiversity are much smaller if the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 'well below 2 degrees C' warming, rather than 2 degrees C only, is met. The potential for refugia for plants and animals decreases strongly with warming. For example, 82% of the basin remaining climatically suitable for at least 75% of the plants currently present at 1.5 degrees C warming, as compared with 23% at 2 degrees C and 3% at 4.5 degrees C. This research provides the first assessment of the combined effects of development plans and climate change on biodiversity of the Tana River Basin, including identifying potential areas for restoration, and contributes to a greater understanding of biodiversity protection and adaptation options in Kenya.

AB  - Climate change is considered to be one of a principle reason for spread of invasive alien species. Thus, it is essential to examine potential invasion dynamics ofProsopis julifloraat continental scale under climate change scenario to better guide management of the invasive species. A consensus model derived from five models were used to examine the current and future (2050 and 2070) climatic suitability forP. julifloraunder two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in Africa. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the threshold-dependent true skill statistic (TSS) value of the models were 0.85 and 0.94, respectively, this put the models in the "very good" category. Results showed that temperature related variables were the main determinant factor accounting for 65.7% of the distribution ofP. juliflora. Under current climatic scenario, 75.6% of the continent was unsuitable forP. julifloraestablishment and invasion while 5.6% was highly suitable. The total suitable areas forP. julifloraunder RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 would increase by 2050 and 2070 compared to the current conditions. Meanwhile, a decrease in total unsuitable areas would be expected by 2050 and 2070 under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. This study has revealed that; the rates ofP. juliflorainvasion will expand further inland across Africa as climatic conditions become favourable. Negative environmental and economic impacts caused byP. juliflorawill be high if management measures are not earnestly taken. We recommend for a cross-border continental wide effort towards combatingP. julifloraexpansion to new areas, especially in countries predicted as frontiers of potential expansion.

AB  - We analyzed hydrology, geology and benthic species composition to determine benthic habitat distribution patterns in a geologically complex area of the Gulf of Finland, Northern Baltic Sea. The analysis included several datasets describing coastal influence and geodiversity at multiple spatial scales. Geodiversity in this context refers to variation and/or patchiness of benthic substrates and seabed features. Multivariate statistical methods including BEST and LINKTREE routines were used to identify correlative relationships between different ecological variables. Environmental variables (e.g. water depth, Secchi depth, salinity) were either measured by sampling and remote sensing methods or parameterized from geographic and oceanographic data. Benthic assemblages were assayed by both video recordings and zoobenthic sampling (benthic grabs). Statistical analyses identified correlations between benthic datasets and environmental variables, but correlation parameters were not consistent especially with respect to differing zoobenthic and video-based estimates of benthic diversity. The ratio of Secchi depth to water depth showed strong correlation with species distributions observed in video recordings (rho = 0.56) whereas variables describing broad-scale geodiversity and archipelago gradient (the abundance of islands, ratio of land and sea area) correlated with zoobenthic sample data (generally rho > 0.30). A model that included independent variables of Secchi depth and terrain roughness within a 20 km radius explained the greatest proportion of spatial variation in zoobenthic sample data (rho = 0.69). Secchi depth and roughness values were positively correlated with species richness. We designated nine benthic marine landscapes on the basis of these two variables. Linkage tree statistical analysis (LINKTREE) routine utilized zoobenthic sample data as these offered better regional coverage and therefore effectively tracked relationships with other environmental variables. The benthic marine landscapes found in topographically complex seabed areas possessed higher species diversity than flatter areas with fewer seabed features. Our results indicate that on broad spatial scales, geodiversity and archipelago gradient directly influence benthic assemblages by providing a range of different habitats. These factors also indirectly influence benthic assemblages by channeling water movement and thereby distributing hydrologic conditions. This study demonstrates that broad-scale geodiversity should be considered in regional and mesoscale habitat mapping, maritime spatial planning and conservation policies.

AB  - Legislation on the protection of biodiversity (e.g., European Union Habitat and Bird Directives) increasingly requires ecological impact assessment of human activities. However, knowledge and understanding of relevant ecological processes and species responses to different types of impact are often incomplete. In this paper we demonstrate with a case study how impact assessment can be carried out for situations where data are scarce but some expert knowledge is available. The case study involves two amphibian species, the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) and the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) in the nature reserve the Meinweg in the Netherlands, for which plans are being developed to reopen an old railway track called the Iron Rhine. We assess the effects of this railway track and its proposed alternatives (scenarios) on the metapopulation extinction time and the occupancy times of the patches for both species using a discrete-time stochastic metapopulation model. We quantify the model parameters using expert knowledge and extrapolated data. Because of our uncertainty about these parameter values, we perform a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. This yields an estimate of the probability distribution of the model predictions and insight into the contribution of each distinguished source of uncertainty to this probability distribution. We show that with a simple metapopulation model and an extensive uncertainty analysis it is possible to detect the least harmful scenario. The ranking of the different scenarios is consistent. Thus, uncertainty analysis can enhance the role of ecological impact assessment in decision making by making explicit to what extent incomplete knowledge affects predictions.

AB  - The assessment of conservation values and risks to habitat biological diversity and health is herein addressed based on the occurrence of threatened species within ecotype mosaics and incorporating metrics related to current human disturbances. This assessment is made within a view of biological integrity and ecosystem health. Within the Map of Italian Nature project, that started as a result of Italian national law n. 394/91, such assessments are currently applied to approximately 1.5 million hectares in order to establish new reserves and protected areas, based on their "natural values" and "fragility" at scales in which humans generally influence the condition of the landscape, to get a more representative network of regional biological diversity. Risk and value assessments, based on distribution of species and habitats most threatened with extinction and reduction, are made in reference to the coordination of information on the environment (CORINE) habitat mosaics. To this purpose, digital thematic maps are generated as geographic information systems (GIS) coverages in polygonal (vector) format from satellite, airborne, and observed distribution data of 1)existing land cover habitat types and biodiversity component distributions, and 2) different kinds of man-induced disturbance. Habitat fragility is estimated either as "potential," through a simple conceptual model relating fragility to sensitivity and human disturbance, or as "displayed," inferred from habitat loss. Habitat sensitivity is used to compare biological health within habitat types. The Map of Italian Nature project aims at identifying gaps in the existing reserve network, and is very akin to the gap analysis approach. Map of Italian Nature intends to protect landscape mosaics at the broader scale, based on gaps in protection and threats while including finer scale data on threatened species to make sure they do not fall through the cracks. Results for a pilot study area are presented and the relevance of the approach to biological health and integrity assessments is discussed.

AB  - A major challenge for small-scale fisheries management is high spatial variability in the demography and life history characteristics of target species. Implementation of local management actions that can reduce overfishing and maximize yields requires quantifying ecological heterogeneity at small spatial scales and is therefore limited by available resources and data. Collaborative fisheries research (CFR) is an effective means to collect essential fishery information at local scales, and to develop the social, technical, and logistical framework for fisheries management innovation. We used a CFR approach with fishing partners to collect and analyze geographically precise demographic information for grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger), a sedentary, nearshore species harvested in the live fish fishery on the West Coast of the USA. Data were used to estimate geographically distinct growth rates, ages, mortality, and length frequency distributions in two environmental subregions of the Santa Barbara Channel, CA, USA. Results indicated the existence of two subpopulations; one located in the relatively cold, high productivity western Channel, and another in the relatively warm, low productivity eastern Channel. We parameterized yield per recruit models, the results of which suggested nearly twice as much yield per recruit in the high productivity subregion relative to the low productivity subregion. The spatial distribution of fishing in the two environmental subregions demonstrated a similar pattern to the yield per recruit outputs with greater landings, effort, and catch per unit effort in the high productivity subregion relative to the low productivity subregion. Understanding how spatial variability in stock dynamics translates to variability in fishery yield and distribution of effort is important to developing management plans that maximize fishing opportunities and conservation benefits at local scales.

AB  - Intact forest landscapes (IFLs) are globally important for maintaining functional ecosystems. Ebo forest (similar to 1400 km(2)) in Cameroon is one of the largest remaining IFLs in the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forest ecoregion and harbours several IUCN Red-Listed threatened mammal species. We evaluated the status, trends, and distribution of mammals >= 0.5 kg in the Ebo forest over 12 years using guided recce and camera trap monitoring surveys, as well as local knowledge to inform future land use and conservation planning. Recce monitoring of six taxa (blue duiker Philantomba monticola, chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis, putty-nosed monkey Cercopithecus nictitans, medium sized duikers Cephalophus spp., and red river hog Potamochoerus porcus) showed that some are stable or increasing. Indeed, our recent camera trap data confirmed breeding Gorilla gorilla (western gorilla) and elephant. Distribution models for chimpanzees and elephants showed that their populations are concentrated in the centre of the forest, away from human pressure. Some other species, however, including red colobus Piliocolobus preussi, leopard Panthera pardus, African golden cat Caracal aurata, and forest buffalo Syncerus caffer nanus are either close to extirpation or have been extirpated within living memory. We conclude that the Ebo intact forest landscape retains an important mammal community, despite no formal legal protection. Ebo's future is uncertain, with two commercial logging concessions announced by Cameroon in 2020 and later suspended in response to national and international pressure. It is crucial to maintain Ebo's integrity to protect the biodiversity and function of this important part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forest ecoregion.

AB  - Small-toothed palm civet Arctogalidia trivirgata occurs widely across Borneo. Eighty-two spatially precise records were used to model its distribution on the island. While the model predicts some regions of low suitability, the scatter of records (mostly insufficiently spatially precise for use in the model) within them and the generally low relevant search effort make a conclusion of genuine low suitability of these areas premature. Modern surveys rely heavily upon ground-level camera-trapping, a technique demonstrably unsuited to this largely arboreal species, which is therefore often overlooked unless spotlighting or arboreal camera-trapping is undertaken. It is at least locally numerous in Borneo and occurs over a wide altitudinal range, well above the heavy deforestation of the lowlands. Its arboreal habits are likely to insulate it from trapping. Its use of monoculture plantations is unclear, but if it does not use these, its total Bornean population is likely to have declined roughly in proportion to the level of forest conversion in the last few decades. However, its survival on Singapore even a century after forest cover was reduced to small, degraded isolates indicates high adaptability to forest encroachment, provided some native forest survives, although such tolerance cannot yet be confirmed for Borneo. Even if oil palm, rubber and acacia plantations are unsuitable for small-toothed palm civet, current plans across Borneo for native forest retention through protected areas and low-impact logging appear sufficient to ensure its long-term survival.

AB  - Many animal species exhibit broad-scale latitudinal or longitudinal gradients in their response to biotic and abiotic components of their habitat. Although knowing the underlying mechanism of these patterns can be critical to the development of sound measures for the preservation or recovery of endangered species, few studies have yet identified which processes drive the existence of geographical gradients in habitat selection. Using extensive spatial data of broad latitudinal and longitudinal extent, we tested three hypotheses that could explain the presence of geographical gradients in landscape selection of the endangered boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) during winter in Eastern Canadian boreal forests: 1) climate-driven selection, which postulates that geographic gradients are surrogates for climatic gradients; 2) road-driven selection, which proposes that boreal caribou adjust their selection for certain habitat classes as a function of proximity to roads; and 3) an additive effect of both roads and climate. Our data strongly supported road-driven selection over climate influences. Thus, direct human alteration of landscapes drives boreal caribou distribution and should likely remain so until the climate changes sufficiently from present conditions. Boreal caribou avoided logged areas two-fold more strongly than burnt areas. Limiting the spread of road networks and accounting for the uneven impact of logging compared to wildfire should therefore be integral parts of any habitat management plan and conservation measures within the range of the endangered boreal caribou. The use of hierarchical spatial models allowed us to explore the distribution of spatially-structured errors in our models, which in turn provided valuable insights for generating alternative hypotheses about processes responsible for boreal caribou distribution.

AB  - Endangered yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) are central-place, benthic-diving foragers that search for prey in the productive marine areas off the coast of the South Island, New Zealand. Like other seabirds, they target specific, reliable areas of high prey abundance, which are often associated with oceanographic characteristics such as bathymetry, seafloor sediment type, and sea surface temperature. Employing GPS tracking data collected between 2003 and 2021, we created species distribution models using maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) to determine foraging space use and habitat suitability for yellow-eyed penguins across their entire South Island range and within five distinct subpopulations: Banks Peninsula, North Otago, Otago Peninsula, the Catlins, and Stewart Island. We quantified the importance of environmental variables for predicting foraging site selection during and outside the breeding season. Significant regional variation existed in predicted probability of penguin presence, and proximity to the nearest breeding area was a key predictor of suitable foraging habitat. When distance was not included in the models, dissolved oxygen concentration was the most important predictor in the overall South Island model and the North Otago, Otago Peninsula, and the Catlins subpopulation models, whereas water current speed and mean monthly turbidity were most important in Banks Peninsula and Stewart Island subpopulation models, respectively. Dynamic variables related to prey availability were often the most important variables in model predictions of the habitat selection of yellow-eyed penguins. Visualisations and findings from this study, particularly of the observed interactions between penguins and their marine habitat, can be used to direct conservation and resources during marine spatial planning and species management.

AB  - The abundance, distribution, and size of marine species are linked to temperature and nutrient regimes and are profoundly affected by humans through exploitation and climate change. Yet little is known about long-term historical links between ocean environmental changes and resource abundance to provide context for current and potential future trends and inform conservation and management. We synthesize >4000 years of climate and marine ecosystem dynamics in a Northwest Atlantic region currently undergoing rapid changes, the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf. This period spans the late Holocene cooling and recent warming and includes both Indigenous and European influence. We compare environmental records from instrumental, sedimentary, coral, and mollusk archives with ecological records from fossils, archaeological, historical, and modern data, and integrate future model projections of environmental and ecosystem changes. This multidisciplinary synthesis provides insight into multiple reference points and shifting baselines of environmental and ecosystem conditions, and projects a near-future departure from natural climate variability in 2028 for the Scotian Shelf and 2034 for the Gulf of Maine. Our work helps advancing integrative end-to-end modeling to improve the predictive capacity of ecosystem forecasts with climate change. Our results can be used to adjust marine conservation strategies and network planning and adapt ecosystem-based management with climate change.

AB  - Dispersal is one of the key mechanisms affecting the distribution of individuals, populations, and communities in nature. Despite advances in the study of single species, it has been notoriously difficult to account for dispersal in multispecies metacommunities, where it potentially has strong effects on community structure beyond those of local environmental conditions. Dispersal should thus be directly integrated in both basic and applied research by using proxies. Here, we review the use of proxies in the current metacommunity research, suggest new proxies, and discuss how proxies could be used in community modelling, particularly in freshwater systems. We suggest that while traditional proxies may still be useful, proxies formerly utilized in transport geography may provide useful novel insights into the structuring of biological communities in freshwater systems. We also suggest that understanding the utility of such proxies for dispersal in metacommunities is highly important for many applied fields such as freshwater bioassessment, conservation planning, and recolonization research in the context of restoration ecology. These research fields have often ignored spatial dynamics and focused mostly on local environmental conditions and changes therein. Yet, the conclusions of these applied studies may change considerably if dispersal is taken into account.

AB  - We developed a linked land-sea modeling framework based on remote sensing and empirical data, which couples sediment export and coral reef models at fine spatial resolution. This spatially-explicit (60 x 60 m) framework simultaneously tracks changes in multiple benthic and fish indicators as a function of land-use and climate change scenarios. We applied this framework in Kubulau District, Fiji, to investigate the effects of logging, agriculture expansion, and restoration on coral reef resilience. Under the deforestation scenario, models projected a 4.5-fold sediment increase (> 7,000 t. yr(-1)) coupled with a significant decrease in benthic habitat quality across 1,940 ha and a reef fish biomass loss of 60.6 t. Under the restoration scenario, models projected a small (< 30 t. yr(-1)) decrease in exported sediments, resulting in a significant increase in benthic habitat quality across 577 ha and a fish biomass gain of 5.7 t. The decrease in benthic habitat quality and loss of fish biomass were greater when combining climate change and deforestation scenarios. We evaluated where land-use change and bleaching scenarios would impact sediment runoff and downstream coral reefs to identify priority areas on land, where conservation or restoration could promote coral reef resilience in the face of climate change.

AB  - Assessing the relative vulnerability of species within an assemblage to extinction is crucial for conservation planning at the regional scale. Here, we quantify relative vulnerability to extinction, in terms of both resistance and resilience to environmental change, in an assemblage of tropical rainforest vertebrates.
   Wet Tropics Bioregion, north Queensland, Australia.
   We collated data on 163 vertebrates that occur in the Australian Wet Tropics, including 24 frogs, 33 reptiles, 19 mammals and 87 birds. We used the 'seven forms of rarity' model to assess relative vulnerability or resistance to environmental change. We then develop a new analogous eight-celled model to assess relative resilience, or potential to recover from environmental perturbation, based on reproductive output, potential for dispersal and climatic niche marginality.
   In the rarity model, our assemblage had more species very vulnerable and very resistant than expected by chance. There was a more even distribution of species over the categories in the resilience model. The three traits included in each model were not independent of each other; species that were widespread were also habitat generalists, while species with narrow geographical ranges tended to be locally abundant. In the resilience model, species with low reproductive output had a narrow climatic niche and also a low capacity to disperse. Frogs were the most vulnerable taxonomic group overall. The model categories were compared to current IUCN category of listed species, and the product of the two models was best correlated with IUCN listings.
   The models presented here offer an objective way to predict the resistance of a species to environmental change, and its capacity to recover from disturbance. The new resilience model has similar advantages to the rarity model, in that it uses simple information and is therefore useful for examining patterns in assemblages with many poorly known species.

AB  - Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) needs to incorporate spatial information on human impacts. As human activities and uses increase in marine and coastal waters around the world, pressures in ecosystems are also increasing, leading to multiple adverse effects on different species and habitats. The European Directive on MSP aims to achieve an integrated approach to marine governance, whilst securing and maintaining the healthy status of marine and coastal waters, in accordance with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The latter requires Member States to develop assessments not only on pressures and impacts, but also on the state of the marine environment and then take measures towards reaching a Good Environmental Status by 2020.
   The Portuguese Maritime Spatial Plan - Plano de Ordenamento do Espaco Matitimo (POEM) was developed between 2009 and 2012. In 2014 a law establishing the Basis for the Spatial Planning and Management of the National Maritime Space was enacted and in 2015 the framework for the elaboration of a new national Maritime Spatial Plan, named Situation Plan, was established. Portugal will face, in the next five years, the challenge of planning and managing its marine space, whilst promoting its sustainable use and protection.
   This study adapted a cumulative effects assessment model to understand how the impacts from multiple threats affect the marine and coastal ecosystems and, how this information can be used to improve the management process. Information was gathered on intensity and distribution of activities and uses for the Portuguese continental subdivision marine area, quantified and mapped their cumulative impacts in marine ecosystems, and overlapped with the POEM. Results show that impacts are spreading from the coast up to the Contiguous Zone. Higher scores appear in Transitional and Coastal Waters in the north (Viana do Castelo/Figueira da Foz), centre (Peniche/Settibal) and south (Lagos/Faro). In some areas with higher ranks, statutes of nature conservation are already in place, but potential activities may still occur on top of existing ones. This study shows that the adapted model is a helpful tool to clarify ocean planning, identify areas of potential conflicts among users and support the decision making process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Context. Developing a new tool for wide-scale rat eradication is necessary for significant biodiversity gains. Underlying beliefs linked to public opinion can help guide policy makers to understand public concern and inform an effective discourse.
   Aims. We investigated underlying beliefs linked to levels of support for a potentially disruptive tool, gene drive, compared with a traditional stepwise tool, aerial distribution of a new pest-specific toxin.
   Methods. Using the theory of planned behaviour, we surveyed (n = 1200) a representative sample of New Zealanders to assess the level of support for the tool related to attitude, normative and control beliefs.
   Key results. Attitude (e.g. gene drive is good/bad and gene drive is risky/safe) and two norms (e.g. people like me and people in my household) were key contributors to level of support for gene drive. Behavioural beliefs (if scientific evidence can prove it works, concern there are unknown consequences, a humane way to rid New Zealand of rats, and gene drive goes against natural way of life) were also significant. For aerial distribution of a new pest-specific toxin, the same attitudes and normative beliefs identified for gene drive also contributed significantly to the model. Four behavioural beliefs, namely, aerial delivery could affect areas outside the target zones, if there is scientific evidence, and it is impossible to make a pest-specific toxin that would not harm our native wildlife were also significant. The impact either tool may have on biodiversity was not significant in either model.
   Conclusions. Decision making about both gene drive (a disruptive technology) and aerial distribution of a pest-specific toxin (a stepwise technology) is primarily influenced by attitudes, with a few beliefs also influencing decision making. Novelty of the tool does not affect the underlying beliefs that are influencing levels of support.
   Implications. Public engagement that acknowledges and responds to these underlying beliefs, rather than a traditional campaign based on biodiversity and environmental gains, may be more effective at creating a constructive dialogue about if and how these tools should be used, and to avoid replicating the polarised debate about 1080.

AB  - Seabirds forage in a dynamic environment of heterogeneously distributed prey resources. Many seabird species use oceanographic features that promote prey aggregation, as a means of locating prey patches. The combination of tracking data, remote-sensing data and estimates of prey availability is useful in determining how seabirds locate prey. GPS tracks of foraging Cape gannets Morus capensis were collected across 3 breeding seasons and tested for inter-annual changes in home range size and foraging effort, and compared against the availability of their predominant prey (sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus) as determined from acoustic surveys. Biophysical features associated with foraging were compared to a random point dataset using a binomial general linear mixed model, while foraging distributions of Cape gannets were compared against the placement of marine protected areas (MPAs). The total home range of foraging Cape gannets, breeding at Bird Island, South Africa, propagated westwards over the 3 breeding seasons, which coincided with a concurrent westward contraction in the distribution of sardine and anchovy. Foraging effort showed an apparent increase in response to low prey densities and occurred mostly outside MPAs. Although gannets seemed to forage in relatively cold waters, biophysical features were generally unreliable predictors of gannet foraging distribution. The relationship between home range and prey distribution, coupled with recent declines in local prey availability, demonstrates the ability of gannets to track the distribution of their prey resources. However, the ephemeral and dynamic nature of these prey resources places a major constraint on conservation-based spatial planning involving Cape gannets.

AB  - Context Animal movements are inherently linked to landscape structure. Understanding this relationship for highly-mobile species requires documenting their responses to spatiotemporal variability of resources. To that end, characterizing movement behaviors and resource distributions using the principles of habitat connectivity facilitates coordinated landscape planning efforts within highly modified landscapes.
   Objectives and methods We tracked locations and movements for 156 dunlin (Calidris alpina) and 109 long-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus) overwintering in two regions with distinct water distributions in California's Central Valley. We then compared residency rates, functional connectivity to other regions, and associations between movement distances and average habitat availability and structural connectivity of habitat at multiple temporal and spatial scales.
   Results A widespread yet highly variable regional water distribution was associated with lower residency rates and substantially higher functional connectivity to nearby regions when compared to a stable regional water distribution characterized by a large, contiguous wetland complex. Longer movements were associated with decreasing average availability and spatial aggregation of surface water. Movement models suggested shorebirds primarily responded to habitat availability at smaller scales (< 10 km) and structural connectivity at larger scales (>= 10 km).
   Conclusions Differences in movement behaviors suggested that wintering shorebirds will avoid long distance movements and remain resident within a wetland region when possible. Conservation and management efforts should reliably flood individual wetlands and agricultural lands from November to April and prioritize locations that maximize structural wetland connectivity and limit spatiotemporal variability of surface water throughout the Central Valley.

AB  - Ongoing climate changes reportedly affect the potential distribution and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) of forest vegetation. The combined effects of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation on these features of forest vegetation are poorly understood. In this study, classification and regression tree (CART) models were used to predict the potential distribution and estimate the CSP of forest vegetation in Yunnan Province, Southwest China, under different simulation scenarios. The minimum temperature of the coldest month (TMW) was the main factor limiting the suitable habitat of all forest vegetation types except for warm-temperate coniferous (WTC) forests. When the temperature increased by 1 degrees C and the precipitation decreased by 20%, the potential distribution area of the 7 forest vegetation types decreased by 12.41% overall. The potential distribution of WTC forests was the least sensitive to temperature increases and precipitation decreases. The CSP of vegetation was higher (1187.69 TgC) under the constant temperature and 10% precipitation decrease scenario than the CSP of vegetation under the 2 degrees C temperature increase and constant precipitation scenario (647.24 TgC). Specifically, the highest CSP (1337.88 TgC) was observed under the 1 degrees C temperature increase and 10% precipitation decrease scenario, and the lowest (617.91 TgC) occurred under the constant temperature and 20% precipitation decrease scenario. In summary, the forest vegetation in Yunnan Province has a high CSP under climate change, and the combined effect of increased temperature and decreased precipitation can increase the CSP of forest vegetation in Yunnan Province. This finding is important for improving scientific decision making and policy planning.

AB  - Aim Accurate inventories of biota are typically restricted to few locations within an extensive region. Accordingly, effective planning must involve some form of surrogate measures coupled with spatial modelling. We conducted a simultaneous comparison of models of both species richness and the number of rare species using three types of surrogates (indicator species, vegetation composition and structure, and topoclimate) as predictors. We evaluated each type of surrogate alone and in combination with others.
   Location Data for our analyses were collected from 1996-2004 in three adjacent mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander and Nye counties, Nevada, USA), the Shoshone Mountains, Toiyabe Range and Toquima Range.
   Methods Data on species richness and species composition of butterflies and birds and measures of vegetation composition and structure were obtained in the field. Topoclimatic variables were derived by GIS from digital sources and satellite images. We used Poisson regression with Bayesian model averaging to predict species richness and the number of rare species. We compared the expected prediction success of all models on the basis of internal and external validation trials.
   Results Same-taxon indicator species were the most accurate predictors of species richness and of the number of rare species of butterflies and birds. Cross-taxon indicator species and topoclimate variables were reasonably accurate predictors of species richness of butterflies and birds and of the number of rare butterfly species. Although vegetation variables were more effective for predicting species richness and number of rare species of birds than of butterflies, they were the least accurate predictors overall.
   Main conclusions Although indicator species may provide the most accurate predictions of species richness, their practical value, like any surrogate measure, depends greatly on ecological considerations and land-use context. In general, the ability to predict numbers of rare species based on any set of candidate predictors was weaker than the ability to predict species richness, which may result from the high degree of stochasticity that often characterizes distributions of rare species. Our statistical approach for objective examination of different candidate predictors can help ensure that selection of species-richness surrogates in any system is scientifically reliable and cost-effective.

AB  - Understanding how interspecific variation in functional traits influences species' capacity to persist in fragments and use patches in fragmented landscapes is fundamental for the creation of effective conservation plans. This study uses phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate which functional traits of bat species are correlated with their vulnerability to fragmentation in a tropical landscape with low fragment-matrix contrast. Bats were captured over twoyears in eight forest fragments, nine control sites in continuous forest, and in the secondary forest matrix at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazon, Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that there is a significant relationship between species functional traits, environmental gradients (continuous forest and fragment interiors, edges and matrix) and patterns of species distribution using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models, as well as a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Mobility, body mass, wing morphology, and trophic level were the most important traits linked to fragmentation sensitivity based on the PGLS analysis, while body mass and trophic level emerged as the best predictors in the fourth-corner analysis. These last two traits were correlated with the loss of continuous forest characteristics, such as high-stature trees and forest cover. Many animalivorous bat species rarely persist in small fragments (<100ha) and in the secondary forest matrix, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit the smaller and phytophagous species.Synthesis and applications. Functional traits of species and environmental variables jointly predict local variation in patterns of bat occupancy and abundance in fragmented tropical landscapes. To minimize local extinctions, we recommend increasing habitat availability and enhancing structural and functional connectivity at the landscape scale through the creation, restoration and maintenance of corridors and stepping stones. These measures should be coupled with improving matrix quality by promoting secondary forest regeneration and persistence to effectively reduce fragment-matrix contrast.

AB  - The large uncertainty surrounding the future effects of sea-level rise and other aspects of climate change on tidal marsh ecosystems exacerbates the difficulty in planning effective conservation and restoration actions. We addressed these difficulties in the context of large-scale wetland restoration activities underway in the San Francisco Estuary (Suisun, San Pablo and San Francisco Bays). We used a boosted regression tree approach to project the future distribution and abundance of five marsh bird species (through 2110) in response to changes in habitat availability and suitability as a result of projected sea-level rise, salinity, and sediment availability in the Estuary. To bracket the uncertainty, we considered four future scenarios based on two sediment availability scenarios (high or low), which varied regionally, and two rates of sea-level rise (0.52 or 1.65 m/100 yr). We evaluated three approaches for using model results to inform the selection of potential restoration projects: (1) Use current conditions only to prioritize restoration. (2) Use a single future scenario (among the four referred to above) in combination with current conditions to select priority restoration projects. (3) Combine current conditions with all four future scenarios, while incorporating uncertainty among future scenarios into the selection of restoration projects. We found that simply using current conditions resulted in the poorest performing restoration projects selected in terms of providing habitat for tidal marsh birds in light of possible future scenarios. The most robust method for selecting restoration projects, the "combined" strategy, used projections from all future scenarios with a discounting of areas with high levels of variability among future scenarios. We show that uncertainty about future conditions can be incorporated in site prioritization algorithms and should motivate the selection of adaptation measures that are robust to uncertain future conditions. These results and data have been made available via an interactive decision support tool at www.prbo.org/sfbayslr.

AB  - Question: How can nearest-neighbour (NN) imputation be used to develop maps of multiple species and plant communities?
   Location: Western and central Oregon, USA, but methods are applicable anywhere.
   Methods: We demonstrate NN imputation by mapping woody plant communities for > 100 000 km(2) of diverse forests and woodlands. Species abundances on similar to 25 000 plots were related to spatial predictors (rasters) describing climate, topography, soil and geographic location using constrained ordination (CCA). Species data from the nearest plot in multi-dimensional CCA space were imputed to each map pixel. Maps of multiple individual species and community types were constructed from the single imputed surface. We computed a variety of diagnostics to characterize different qualities of the imputed (mapped) community data.
   Results: Community composition gradients were strongly associated with climate and elevation, and less so with topography and soil. Accuracy of the imputation model for presence/absence of 150 species varied widely (kappa 0.00 to 0.80). Omission error rates were higher than commission rates due to low species prevalence, and areal representation of species was only slightly inflated. A map of 78 community types was 41% correct and 78% fuzzy correct. Errors of omission and commission were balanced, and areal representation of both rare and abundant communities was accurate. Map accuracy may be lower for some species than with other methods, but areal representation of species and communities across large landscapes is preserved. Because imputed vegetation surfaces are developed for all species simultaneously, map units contain suites of species known to co-occur in nature. Maps of individual species, and of community types derived from them, will be internally consistent at map locations.
   Conclusions: NN imputation is a useful modelling approach where maps of multiple species and plant communities are needed, such as in natural resource management and conservation planning or models that project landscape change under alternative disturbance or climate scenarios. More research is needed to evaluate other ordination methods for NN imputation of plant communities.

AB  - The species richness-climate relationship is a significant concept in determining the richness patterns and predicting the cause of its distribution. The distribution range of species and climatic variables along elevation have been used in evaluating the elevational diversity gradients (EDG). However, the species richness of gymnosperms along elevation and its driving factors in large geographic areas are still unknown. Here, we aimed at evaluating the EDG of gymnosperms in the ecoregions of China. We divided the geographical region of China into 34 ecoregions and determine the richness pattern of gymnosperm taxa along elevation gradients. We demonstrated the richness patterns of the 237-gymnosperm (219 threatened, 112 endemic, 189 trees, and 48 shrubs) taxa, roughly distributed between 0 and 5,300 m (above sea level) in China. As possible determinants of richness patterns, annual mean temperature (TEMP), annual precipitation (PPT), potential evapotranspiration (PET), net primary productivity (SNPP), aridity index (AI), temperature seasonality (TS), and precipitation seasonality (PS) are the major predictor variables driving the EDG in plants. We used the species interpolation method to determine the species richness at each elevation band. To evaluate the richness pattern of gymnosperms in an ecoregion, generalized additive modeling and structural equation modeling were performed. The ecoregions in the southern part of China are rich in gymnosperm species, where three distinct richness patterns-(i) hump-shaped, (ii) monotonic increase, and (iii) monotonic decline-were noticed in China. All climatic variables have a significant effect on the richness pattern of gymnosperms; however, TEMP, SNPP, TS, and PS explained the highest deviance in diversity-rich ecoregions of China. Our results suggests that the highest number of gymnosperms species was found in the southwestern and Taiwan regions of China distributed at the 1,600- and 2,800-m elevation bands. These regions could be under severe stress in the near future due to expected changes in precipitation pattern and increase of temperature due to climate change. Thus, our study provided evidence of the species-climate relationship that can support the understanding of future conservation planning of gymnosperms.

AB  - For many years, the planning and management of terrestrial areas has been supported by a detailed knowledge of the distribution of habitats and their associated species. However, the detailed mapping of biological resources in extent coastal areas, such as the Norwegian coastal zone, is unrealistic due to its enormous coastline. Here, we present a useful and feasible approach and a set of simple, cost-effective methods which are suitable for providing a broad-scale overview of marine habitats and fish resources. This approach was developed in conjunction with a pioneer study conducted along the southern coast of the Skagerrak, where we combined knowledge gathered from local fishermen with scientific knowledge of important species and nature types to establish a coastal sea mapping program. GIS modeling tools were used in both the mapping program and to integrate local and scientific knowledge into digital maps made available to local area management. This multi-faceted approach, which combines local knowledge and scientific methods, provides valuable information with respect to marine biodiversity, and has been used extensively by local environmental management.

AB  - Knowledge of the factors influencing variation of nest abundance in cities is a major topic in urban ecology with important management and planning implications. In the present study, we aimed to investigate this issue with regards to white stork (WS) (Ciconia ciconia) in the capital of Morocco, Rabat. Here, we used data on a series of topographic, anthropogenic, and landscape variables to identify best predictors causing variation in the WS nest abundance by means of generalized linear models. Results revealed an increase in nest abundances with a weaker length of roads and greater non-built-up areas. Therefore, the less urbanized the areas of the city of Rabat are, the more attractive for nest establishment by storks they are. This information is of use to the Rabat urban environmental managers in order not only to (1) maintain this Ciconiidae species at manageable levels but also to (2) suitably manage this city taking into account the needs of storks. Reproducing this study in other Mediterranean urban areas would be relevant to find out if variation in nest abundances of this species depends on the same factors as those in Rabat.

AB  - Managers of forest wildlife populations make recurring management decisions based on incomplete knowledge of system states. For example, animal population estimates may ignore spatial structure that may influence population viability. We built a spatially-explicit model for a population of birds in a forested landscape. Rates of bird population growth within forest compartments and rates of bird dispersal among compartments were functions of stand age and basal area, compartment population size, and inter-compartment distance. Stand characteristics were imbedded in a dynamic model and assumed perfectly observable and under the complete control of managers. We constructed a genetic algorithm to search for the schedule and spatial distribution of silviculture to maximize total bird abundance at the end of a fixed planning horizon, under combinations of initial habitat and population distribution. We also found policies for a smaller set of population distributions that a manager may only presume to occur (e.g. birds equally distributed among stands), as when managers are only able to observe abundance and not spatial distribution. We investigated the effect of this loss of system resolution on optimality by examining differences in projected population sizes under the two types of policies. That is, we used the set of 'presumed-state' policies to project population size from each true initial system state, then we compared these to projections under the best policy for that state. For the planning horizon that we considered, loss in optimality was highly dependent on initial habitat state and on choice of presumed population distribution. Generally, loss in optimality and species extinction rate were both greater for habitat states that were initially poor than initially favorable. For some initial habitat states, population projections based on policies for presumed states often exceeded objective function values for known-state policies, suggesting that the genetic algorithm frequently fell short of finding bona fide optima.

AB  - Quantifying how human-modified landscapes shape the distribution of biodiversity is critical for developing effective conservation strategies. To address this, we evaluated three hypotheses (habitat area, habitat configuration and matrix heterogeneity hypotheses) that predict responses of biodiversity to landscape structure in human-modified landscapes. We compared characteristics of landscape structure that influence taxonomic (TD), functional (FD), and phylogenetic (PD) dimensions of biodiversity of breeding birds in temperate forests. Relationships between biodiversity and landscape structure were assessed at multiple spatial scales for 20 forest interior sites in northeastern USA. We assessed if relationships with landscape structure were consistent among dimensions and assemblages of different groups (residents, migrants and all birds). Relationships between dimensions of biodiversity and landscape structure were more prevalent for FD and PD than for TD. Forest amount and configuration were rarely associated with any dimensions of biodiversity. In contrast, the identity of the matrix and heterogeneity of the landscape were frequently associated with biodiversity, but relationships differed among groups of birds. For example, FD of all birds was associated positively with landscape diversity but FD of residents was associated negatively with landscape diversity, suggesting that landscape diversity surrounding forests may increase overall FD of birds but that not all groups of species respond similarly. Indeed, biodiversity of migrants was only weakly related to landscape structure. Differences among relationships to landscape structure for bird groups and spatial scales suggests that management plans should consider local decisions within a regional framework to balance potentially conflicting needs of species groups in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Understanding the role of climate changes and geography as drivers of population divergence and speciation is a long-standing goal of evolutionary biology and can inform conservation. In this study, we used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to evaluate genetic diversity, population structure, and infer demographic history of the endangered tree,Phoebe zhennanwhich is distributed around the Sichuan Basin. Genomic patterns revealed two distinct clusters, each largely confined to the West and East. Despite sympatry of the two genomic clusters at some sites, individuals show little or no evidence of genomic introgression. Demographic modeling supported an initial divergence time between the West and East lineages at similar to 15.08 Ma with further diversification within the West lineage at similar to 7.12 Ma. These times largely coincide with the two independent intensifications of the East Asian monsoon that were initiated during the middle (Langhian) and late Miocene (Messinian), respectively. These results suggest that the Miocene intensification phases of the East Asian monsoon played a pivotal role in shaping the current landscape-level patterns of genetic diversity withinP. zhennan, as has been found for the interspecific divergence of other subtropical Chinese plants. Based on isolation-by-distance and species distribution modeling, we hypothesize thatP. zhennanfollowed a ring diversification which was facilitated by the Sichuan Basin acting as barrier to gene flow. In situ and ex situ conservation management plans should consider the results obtained in this study to help secure the future of this beautiful and culturally significant endangered tree.

AB  - The Amazon forest covers 7.5 million km(2) in nine countries, hosts 25% of the global biodiversity and is a major contributor to the biogeochemical and climatic functioning of the Earth system. Despite its global importance, a regionalization of the Amazon tree flora is still lacking. Clear and data-driven delimitation of subregions is important for macroecological studies, to the identification of metacommunities and is a requisite for conservation planning.
   We aimed at identifying and mapping plant species subregions and investigated their relationships with environmental, historical and human correlates. We provide the first woody plant regionalization of the entire Amazon forest using a data-driven approach based on assemblage composition patterns.
   We compiled data on woody species composition from 301 assemblages based on species occurrences. We then used unconstrained ordination, interpolation and clustering techniques to identify and map discrete woody subregions. Hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted in order to investigate the relationships between the identified subregions. We used multinomial logistic regression model and deviance partitioning to investigate the influence of environmental, historical and human factors on subregions distribution.
   We identified 13 woody subregions in the entire Amazon forest. The hierarchical subregion classification showed a broad Andean-Cratonic east-west division. Variation in subregions was explained jointly by human factors and spatial structure followed by environmental factors and spatial structure combined.
   Synthesis. Our woody plant subregions differed from World Wildlife Fund ecoregions and physiognomic-based maps, highlighting the importance of basing regionalizations on taxon-specific groups and confirming that vegetation maps should not be used as proxies to plant diversity subregions. Our findings also confirm the need for multiple and extensive protected areas in the Amazon forest. The relevance of current climate factors in our study alerts to a profound impact that climate change could have on the spatial organization of the Amazon flora.

AB  - Using a case study of an isolated management unit of Sichuan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana), we assess the extent that climate change will impact the species' habitat distribution in the current period and projected into the 2050s. We identify refugia that could maintain the population under climate change and determine dispersal paths for movement of the population to future suitable habitats. Hubei Province, China. We identified climate refugia and potential movements by integrating bioclimatic models with circuit theory and least-cost model for the current period (1960-1990) and the 2050s (2041-2060). We coupled a maximum entropy algorithm to predict suitable habitat for the current and projected future periods. Suitable habitat areas that were identified during both time periods and that also satisfied home range and dispersal distance conditions were delineated as refugia. We mapped potential movements measured as current flow and linked current and future habitats using least-cost corridors. Our results indicate up to 1,119km(2) of currently suitable habitat within the study range. Based on our projections, a habitat loss of 67.2% due to climate change may occur by the 2050s, resulting in a reduced suitable habitat area of 406km(2) and very little new habitat. The refugia areas amounted to 286km(2) and were located in Shennongjia National Park and Badong Natural Reserve. Several connecting corridors between the current and future habitats, which are important for potential movements, were identified. Our assessment of the species predicted a trajectory of habitat loss following anticipated future climate change. We believe conservation efforts should focus on refugia and corridors when planning for future species management. This study will assist conservationists in determining high-priority regions for effective maintenance of the endangered population under climate change and will encourage increased habitat connectivity.

AB  - How robust is our assessment of impacts to ecosystems and species from a rapidly changing climate during the 21st century? We examine the challenges of uncertainty, complexity and constraints associated with applying climate projections to understanding future biological responses. This includes an evaluation of how to incorporate the uncertainty associated with different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and climate models, and constraints of spatiotemporal scales and resolution of climate data into impact assessments. We describe the challenges of identifying relevant climate metrics for biological impact assessments and evaluate the usefulness and limitations of different methodologies of applying climate change to both quantitative and qualitative assessments. We discuss the importance of incorporating extreme climate events and their stochastic tendencies in assessing ecological impacts and transformation, and provide recommendations for better integration of complex climate-ecological interactions at relevant spatiotemporal scales. We further recognize the compounding nature of uncertainty when accounting for our limited understanding of the interactions between climate and biological processes. Given the inherent complexity in ecological processes and their interactions with climate, we recommend integrating quantitative modeling with expert elicitation from diverse disciplines and experiential understanding of recent climate-driven ecological processes to develop a more robust understanding of ecological responses under different scenarios of future climate change. Inherently complex interactions between climate and biological systems also provide an opportunity to develop wide-ranging strategies that resource managers can employ to prepare for the future.

AB  - Sundarbans mangrove forest, the world's largest continuous mangrove forests expanding across India and Bangladesh, in recent times, is immensely threatened by degradation stress due to natural stressors and anthropogenic disturbances. The degradation across the 19 mangrove forests in Indian Sundarbans was evaluated by eight environmental criteria typical to mangrove ecosystem. In an attempt to find competent predictors for mangrove ecosystem degradation, key eco-physiological resilience trait complex specific for mangroves from 4922 individuals for physiological analyses with gene expression and 603 individuals for leaf tissue distributions from 16 mangroves and 15 associate species was assessed along the degradation gradient. The degradation data was apparently categorized into four and CDFA discriminates 97% of the eco-physiological resilience data into corresponding four groups. Predictive Bayesian regression models and mixed effects models indicate osmolyte accumulation and thickness of water storage tissue as primary predictors of each of the degradation criteria that appraise the degradation status of mangrove ecosystem. RDA analyses well represented response variables of degradation explained by explanatory resilience variables. We hypothesize that with the help of our predictive models the policy makers could trace even the cryptic process of mangrove degradation and save the respective forests in time by proposing appropriate action plans.

AB  - We developed predictive habitat models for a bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) population in the Peninsular Ranges of southern California, USA, using 2 Geographic Information System modeling techniques, Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP). We used >16,000 Global Positioning System locations from 34 animals in 5 subpopulations to develop and test ENFA and GARP models, and we then compared these models to each other and to the expert-based model presented in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's Recovery Plan for this population. Based on a suite of evaluation methods, we found both ENFA and GARP to provide useful predictions of habitat; however, models developed with GARP appeared to have higher predictive power. Habitat delineations resulting from GARP models were similar to the expert-based model, affirming that the expert-based model provided a useful delineation of bighorn sheep habitat in the Peninsular Ranges. In addition, all 3 models identified continuous bighorn sheep habitat from the northern to southern extent of our study area, indicating that the Recovery Plan's recommendation of maintaining habitat connectivity throughout the range is an appropriate goal.

AB  - Adaptive management (AM) is often cited as an innovative approach which could improve recovery plans for threatened species, yet real-world applications remain rare. Here, we describe an adaptive program for the reintroduction of a threatened amphibian in Italy. We used an adaptive approach to decide whether to use captive breeding, headstarting of tadpoles or direct translocation of eggs, with the aim of establishing a new population while minimizing the impact of harvesting from wild populations. We built a quantitative model of the system, articulated uncertainty around model parameters using probability distributions, and evaluated the benefit of learning using simulations. Following the results of simulations, we began by implementing all actions in parallel, monitoring survival of released individuals, and updating our priors using monitoring data in a Bayesian framework. Based on the updated knowledge, captive breeding and egg translocation were discontinued after the fast and second year, respectively. We found little impact of harvest on the source population, so headstarting and releases are ongoing after three years. Although survival has been lower than expected, it remains within the predicted range of possible outcomes. Our experience reinforces the potential of AM for amphibian conservation. Although AM could not guarantee success, it easily scaled to our small project, it increased our efficiency in monitoring and changing actions, and ensured a safe approach against possible negative impacts. We encourage managers of amphibian recovery programs worldwide to adopt AM by following the steps we illustrate. Disseminating the results of real-world applications is the best way to fill the current implementation gap.

AB  - Climate change and urbanization are among the most serious threats to amphibians, although little is known about their combined effects. We used a predictive spatial habitat suitability model to explore the potential impacts of climate change and urban development on the spotted marsh frog (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) on the urban-fringe of Melbourne, Australia. The CSIRO climate-change predictions for the region indicate likely temperature increases of 3 degrees C, and annual rainfall reductions of around 200 mm by the year 2070. Much of the study area overlaps a region that has been identified as one of the city's growth corridors. We used Bayesian logistic regression modelling to estimate current and future habitat suitability of pond sites in the Merri Creek catchment, exploring a range of best- to worst-case scenarios through the use of hydrological and urbanization models. Our predictions for 2070, even under a moderate climate-change scenario, suggest that the majority of ponds in the study area will be dry throughout much of the year. This has obvious implications for L. tasmaniensis, which is an aquatic breeding species. However, in the short term, urbanization is likely to have a more significant effect on the distribution of L. tasmaniensis in the Merri Creek catchment, particularly if development moves beyond the current urban growth boundary. The combined effects of climate change and urbanization could have a profound impact on the species, potentially causing it to disappear from within the study area. We provide recommendations for including such predictive models in urban planning and restoration activities to prepare for future conservation challenges.

AB  - phylin is a package for the r programming environment which offers different methods to spatially interpolate genetic information from phylogeographic data. These interpolations can be used to predict the spatial occurrence of different lineages within a phylogeny using a modified method of kriging, which allows the usage of a genetic distance matrix to derive a model of spatial dependence. phylin improves the available methods to generate interpolated surfaces from a phylogenetic trees by assessing the autocorrelation structure of the genetic information, interpolating the genetic data based on a statistical model, estimating the uncertainty of the predictions and identifying lineage occurrence and contact zones probability without projection of pairwise genetic distances into mid-points between sample locations. The package also includes methods to plot interpolation surfaces and provide summary tables from the generated data and models. We provide an example of the usefulness of this tool by inferring the spatial occurrence of distinct historical evolutionary lineages of the Lataste's viper (Vipera latastei Bosca, 1878) in the Iberian Peninsula and identifying potential contact areas. The maps of phylogenetic patterns obtained with these methods provide a spatial context to test hypotheses related to processes underlying the geographic distribution of genetic diversity and to inform conservation planning.

AB  - Productive and ecologically highly valuable ecosystems, macrotidal estuaries are also characterised by complex habitat and connectivity dynamics driven by tidal and freshwater influence. Organisms living in these constantly changing systems have to match their movement patterns to the shifting habitat mosaic using available windows of connectivity to access habitat patches of interest. This appears particularly important for the juvenile stages of many fish species colonising shallow and intertidal areas of the estuaries as summer nurseries. We apply tools from landscape ecology to investigate the estuarine habitat and connectivity dynamics on the example of juvenile seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). We test under which conditions spatio-temporal bottlenecks to estuarine nursery colonisation may emerge for this species in a human-modified estuary. Combining a hydrodynamic model of the Seine estuary with remote sensing data allows us to capture structural changes in habitat availability and connectivity at the estuarine scale and at a fine spatio-temporal resolution. With chronological least-cost modelling of successive tidal steps, we assess patterns of nursery accessibility and estimate tidal colonisation fronts for different mobility scenarios. We show that, at certain hydrological conditions, tidal water level variation causes local disruptions of habitat availability and connectivity, creating temporary bottlenecks for seabass juveniles' movement. Fish mobility appears determinant for their vulnerability to these connectivity disruptions. Our approach allows for quantitative assessment and visualisation of riverscape complexity related to tidal dynamics. It is applicable to other highly dynamic ecosystems, where the mobile nature of connectivity and habitats needs to be integrated into conservation and management planning.

AB  - The development of road networks over the years has caused serious damage to biodiversity. However, few studies have explored the impact of different road grades on ecological network connectivity, especially at multiple levels and at different dispersal distances. Here, we propose an analytical framework based on the integrated graph theory and the circuit theory method, in order to model the ecological network of virtual species, to evaluate connectivity at the landscape, patch, and corridor levels, and to identify the key patches and key corridors that contribute the most to the maintenance of connectivity. The empirical analysis in this study was performed on six scenarios, which were designed by successively integrating different road grades into the landscape. On this basis, the impact of different road grades on the connectivity, key patches, and key corridors in Wuhan, China, were explored. The results showed that: (1) High-grade roads have a significant impact on landscape-patch-corridor connectivity, while medium-grade roads have a similar degree of impact on patch-level connectivity as high-grade roads do. (2) Species with long dispersal ability (25 km) are susceptible to roads at the landscape and corridor levels; species with low and medium dispersal abilities (10, 15 and 20 km) are vulnerable to roads at the patch levels. (3) The importance of key patches and the resistance of key corridors are signifi-cantly increased by the influence of roads, while their spatial distribution changes slightly. This integrated framework contributes to an evaluation of the impacts of different grades road on ecological processes, so as to better provide targeted suggestions for biodiversity conservation and transportation planning.

AB  - Pinus tabulaeformis, as an endemic species in China, is one of the main tree species for afforestation. For rational cultivation planning and conservation, it is necessary to understand the geographical boundaries and the ecological characteristics of P. tabulaeformis, and to explore its priority afforestation areas. In this study, maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) was used to identify and prioritize suitable habitats of P. tabulaeformis, based on 13 climatic variables and GlobCover 2009 data. The results show that the MaxEnt model performs better than random prediction, with an average test area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.93 (0.91-0.94). Precipitation of wettest month (PWM), annual biotemperature (ABT), mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCM), annual mean temperature (AMT), precipitation of driest month (PDM), coldness index (CI), annual precipitation (AP), and mean temperature of the warmest month (MTWM) are identified as dominant variables which explain 94.6% of variability the geographical distribution of P. tabulaeformis. Climatic conditions of P. tabulaeformis in the core area of its distribution are as follows: PWM, 100-246 mm; ABT, 3.0-4.7 degrees C; MTCM, 20.2 to 1.1 degrees C; AMT, 2.9-14.7 degrees C; PDM, 2-11 mm; CI, 49.4-0 degrees C; AP, 431-1122 mm; and MTWM, 19.6-31.2 degrees C. The suitable areas for afforestation are 2.6 x 10(4) km(2) (patches with an area >1 km(2)), 1.6 x 10(4) km(2) (patches with an area >10 km(2)), and 1.2 x 10(4) km(2) (patches with an area >100 km(2)), which are mainly located in north Shaanxi, south Ningxia, and the middle of Gansu and Liaoning provinces with serious landscape fragmentation caused by human agricultural activities. Our simulation results can improve our understanding of the geographical and ecological characteristics of P. tabulaeformis and provide prediction of priority areas for afforestation of this species under current and future climate change scenarios in China.

AB  - Habitat degradation is the leading threat to US federally listed species, but monitoring changes in habitat extent, fragmentation or quality is not generally included in species recovery plans. Consecutive satellite images of the same area through time are commonly used to assess landscape changes, and image data are increasingly used to generate predictor variables for species-habitat models. A time series of satellite images has, however, rarely been used in conjunction with a species-habitat model to map changes in habitat extent or to predict wildlife-habitat dynamics through time. We used a time series of forest disturbance encompassing 16530km(2) of forestland in Maine to map and quantify change in forest types that influence probability of occurrence (POC) of the threatened Canada lynx Lynx canadensis. Integration with a predictive occurrence model developed from landscape conditions c. 2004 allowed us to retrospectively (1973-2004) assess changes at 2- to 4-year intervals, update predictions (2004-2010) and project the spatial distribution and extent of lynx foraging habitat over the next decade. Between 1975 and 1991, 40% of mature conifer forest in our study area was removed by stand-replacing harvests, coincident with the last regional outbreak of eastern spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.). As those areas regenerated between 1991 and 2010, POC increased dramatically as broad-scale habitat conditions for lynx's primary prey, snowshoe hare Lepus americanus, improved. Projections suggest that continued forest regrowth will provide new habitat over the next decade, but fragmentation will increase, and by 2022 the habitat distribution will shift southwards into areas where climate change or interspecific competition may limit lynx population expansion.Synthesis and applications. Conservation planning for vagile species that depend on ephemeral forest types, such as the Canada lynx in the north-eastern USA, requires habitat monitoring strategies that can adapt to changing landscape conditions. Although Maine's lynx population has increased since the 1990s, we recommend that continued monitoring of lynx habitat and population status is critical given habitat and climate uncertainty. We also recommend that habitat management efforts be targeted not only at areas currently occupied by lynx but also where habitat loss is expected to occur near-term from succession or in anticipation of the next budworm outbreak.

AB  - Habitat choice often entails trade-offs between food availability and predation risk. Understanding the distribution of individuals in space thus requires that both habitat characteristics and predation risk are considered simultaneously. Here, we studied the nest box use of two arboreal squirrels who share preferred habitat with their main predators. Nocturnal Ural owls (Strix uralensis) decreased occurrence of night-active flying squirrels (Pteromys volans) and diurnal goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) that of day-active red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris). Unexpectedly, the amount of preferred habitat had no effect on nest box use, but, surprisingly, both squirrel species seemed to benefit from close proximity to agricultural fields and red squirrels to urban areas. We found no evidence of trade-off between settling in a high-quality habitat and avoiding predators. However, the amount of poor-quality young pine forests was lower in occupied sites where goshawks were present, possibly indicating habitat specific predation on red squirrels. The results suggest that erecting nest boxes for Ural owls should be avoided in the vicinity of flying squirrel territories in order to conserve the near threatened flying squirrels. Our results also suggest that flying squirrels do not always need continuous old forests, and hence the currently insufficient conservation practices could be improved with reasonable increases in the areas left untouched around their nests. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of taking into account both habitat requirements and predation risk as well as their interactive effects when modeling the occupancy of threatened animal species and planning their conservation.

AB  - Spatial modeling over broad scales can potentially direct conservation efforts to areas with high species-specific abundances. We examined the performance of regional models for predicting bird abundance at spatial scales typically addressed in conservation planning. Specifically, we used point count data on wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) and blue-winged warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera) from 2 time periods (19951998 and 20062007) to evaluate the ability of regional models derived via Bayesian hierarchical techniques to predict bird abundance. We developed models for each species within Bird Conservation Region (BCR) 23 in the upper midwestern United States at 800-ha, 8,000-ha, and approximately 80,000-ha scales. We obtained count data from the Breeding Bird Survey and land cover data from the National Land Cover Dataset (1992). We evaluated predictions from the best models, as defined by an information-theoretic criterion, using point count data collected within an ecological subregion of BCR 23 at 131 count stations in the 1990s and again in 20062007. Competing (Deviance Information Criteria <5) blue-winged warbler models accounted for 67% of the variability and suggested positive associations with forest edge and proportion of forest at the 8,000-ha scale, and negative associations with forest patch area (800-ha) and wetness (800-ha and 80,000?ha). The regional model performed best for blue-winged warbler predicted abundances from point counts conducted in Iowa during 19951996 (rs?=?0.57; P?=?0.14), the survey period that most closely aligned with the time period of data used for regional model construction. Wood thrush models exhibited positive correlations with point count data for all survey areas and years combined (rs?=?0.58, P?=?0.001). In comparison, blue-winged warbler models performed worse as time increased between the point count surveys and vintage of the model building data (rs?=?0.03, P?=?0.92 for Iowa and rs?=?0.13, P?=?0.51 for all areas, 2006-2007), likely related to the ephemeral nature of their preferred early successional habitat. Species abundance and sensitivity to changing habitat conditions seems to be an important factor in determining the predictive ability of regional models. Hierarchical models can be a useful tool for concentrating efforts at the scale of management units and should be one of many tools used by land managers, but we caution that the utility of such models may decrease over time for species preferring relatively ephemeral habitats if model inputs are not updated accordingly.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts in cities are becoming increasingly common worldwide and are a challenge to urban biodiversity management and landscape planning. In comparison to compensatory management, which often focuses on addressing emergency conflicts, precautionary management allows decision-makers to better allocate limited resources on prioritized areas and initiate long-term actions in advance. However, precautionary approaches have rarely been developed or applied in biodiversity conservation. Since 2020, human-raccoon dog conflicts in Shanghai, one of the largest cities in the world, have tripled in reported number due to the rapid spread of the species in the city from 70 residential districts in 2020 to 249 residential districts in 2022. Here, we use ensemble and circuit modeling to predict suitable raccoon dog habitat and identify their potential dispersal pathways to aid the development of precautionary management strategies. We find that raccoon dog distribution is positively associated with several anthropogenic factors, including residential buildings and nighttime light, which could be signs that the species' foraging behavior has adapted to the urban environment. We find that raccoon dogs only occupy 10.1% of its suitable habitat, and thus there is a high potential for the expansion of the raccoon dog population and more frequent human-raccoon dog conflicts in the near future. We predict 60 potential dispersal pathways across Shanghai, seven of which cross densely human populated areas and are likely to trigger excessive conflicts. Based on our findings, we propose priority areas where precautionary management strategies, such as constraining stray animal feeding and wildlife-vehicle collision prevention, would potentially alleviate human-raccoon dog conflicts. We present the first study on the precautionary approach of human-wildlife conflict in China's major cities, and provide a practical example of how comprehensive modeling approaches can be used as the foundation of precautionary management in urban landscapes.

AB  - Spatial scale is critical for understanding and managing biological invasions. In providing direction to managing alien plant invasions, much emphasis is placed on collecting spatially explicit data. However, insufficient thought is often given to how the data are to be used, frequently resulting in the incompatibility of the data for different uses. This paper explores the role of spatial scale in interpreting, managing and monitoring alien plant invasions in a large protected area.
   Kruger National Park, South Africa.
   Using 27,000 spatially-explicit records of invasive alien plants for the Kruger National Park (> 20,000 km(2)) we assessed alien plant species richness per cell at nine different scales of resolution.
   When assessing the patterns of alien plants at the various scales of resolution, almost identical results are obtained when working at scales of quarter-degree grids and quaternary watersheds (the fourth level category in South Africa's river basin classification system). Likewise, insights gained from working at resolutions of 0.1-0.5 km and 1-5 km are similar. At a scale of 0.1 x 0.1 km cells, only 0.4% of the Kruger National Park is invaded, whereas > 90% of the park is invaded when mapped at the quarter-degree cell resolution.
   Selecting the appropriate scale of resolution is crucial when evaluating the distribution and abundance of alien plant invasions, understanding ecological processes, and operationalizing management applications and monitoring strategies. Quarter-degree grids and quaternary watersheds are most useful at a regional or national scale. Grid cells of 1 to 25 km(2) are generally useful for establishing priorities for and planning management interventions. Fine-scale data are useful for informing management in areas which are small in extent; they also provide the detail appropriate for assessing patterns and rates of invasion.

AB  - Fishery-independent surface density and abundance estimates for the swordfish were obtained through aerial surveys carried out over a large portion of the Central Mediterranean, implementing distance sampling methodologies. Both design- and model-based abundance and density showed an uneven occurrence of the species throughout the study area, with clusters of higher density occurring near converging fronts, strong thermoclines and/or underwater features. The surface abundance was estimated for the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals in the summer of 2009 (n=1152; 95%CI=669.0-1981.0; %CV=27.64), the Sea of Sardinia, the Pelagos Sanctuary and the Central Tyrrhenian Sea for the summer of 2010 (n=3401; 95% CI=2067.0-5596.0; %CV=25.51), and for the Southern. Tyrrhenian Sea during the winter months of 2010-2011 (n=1228; 95%CI=578-2605; %CV=38.59). The Mediterranean swordfish stock deserves special attention in light of the heavy fishing pressures. Furthermore, the unreliability of fishery-related data has, to date, hampered our ability to effectively inform long-term conservation in the Mediterranean Region. Considering that the European countries have committed to protect the resources and all the marine-related economic and social dynamics upon which they depend, the information presented here constitute useful data towards the international legal requirements under the Marine Strategy Framework Directory, the Common Fisheries Policy, the Habitats and Species Directive and the Directive on Maritime Spatial Planning, among the others.

AB  - Species' distributions are influenced by a combination of landscape variables and biotic interactions with other species, including people. Grizzly bears and black bears are sympatric, competing omnivores that also share habitats with human recreationists. By adapting models for multi-species occupancy analysis, we analyzed trail camera data from 192 trail camera locations in and around Jasper National Park, Canada to estimate grizzly bear and black bear occurrence and intensity of trail use. We documented (a) occurrence of grizzly bears and black bears relative to habitat variables (b) occurrence and intensity of use relative to competing bear species and motorised and non-motorised recreational activity, and (c) temporal overlap in activity patterns among the two bear species and recreationists. Grizzly bears were spatially separated from black bears, selecting higher elevations and locations farther from roads. Both species co-occurred with motorised and non-motorised recreation, however, grizzly bears reduced their intensity of use of sites with motorised recreation present. Black bears showed higher temporal activity overlap with recreational activity than grizzly bears, however differences in bear daily activity patterns between sites with and without motorised and non-motorised recreation were not significant. Reduced intensity of use by grizzly bears of sites where motorised recreation was present is a concern given off-road recreation is becoming increasingly popular in North America, and can negatively influence grizzly bear recovery by reducing foraging opportunities near or on trails. Camera traps and multi-species occurrence models offer non-invasive methods for identifying how habitat use by animals changes relative to sympatric species, including humans. These conclusions emphasise the need for integrated land-use planning, access management, and grizzly bear conservation efforts to consider the implications of continued access for motorised recreation in areas occupied by grizzly bears.

AB  - Only recently has the influence of landscape structure on habitat use been a research focus in wetland systems. During non-breeding periods when food can be locally limited, wetland spatial pattern across a landscape may be of great importance in determining wetland use. We studied the influence of landscape structure on abundances of wintering Dunlin (Calidris alpina) and Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) observed on wetlands in the agricultural Willamette Valley of Oregon, USA, during two winters (1999-2000, 2000-2001) of differing rainfall. We examined (1) shorebird use within a sample of 100 km(2) regions differing in landscape structure (hectares of shorebird habitat [wet, unvegetated]) and (2) use of sites differing in landscape context (area of shorebird habitat within a species-defined radius). For use of sites, we also assessed the influence of two local characteristics: percent of soil exposed and area of wet habitat. We analyzed data using linear regression and information-theoretic modeling. During the dry winter (2000-2001), Dunlin were attracted to regions with more wetland habitat and their abundances at sites increased with greater area of shorebird habitat within both the site and the surrounding landscape. In contrast, Dunlin abundances at sites were related to availability of habitat at only a local scale during the wet winter (1999-2000). Regional habitat availability was of little importance in predicting Killdeer distributions, and Killdeer site use appeared unrelated to habitat distributions at both landscape and local scales. Results suggest prioritizing sites for conservation that are located in areas with high wetland coverage.

AB  - More than half of the European population of the Barbary Partridge is in Sardinia; nonetheless, the researches concerning this species are very scarce, and its conservation status is not defined because of a deficiency of data. This research aimed to analyse the habitat selection and the factors affecting the abundance and the density of the Barbary Partridge in Sardinia. We used the data collected over 8 years (between 2004 and 2013) by spring call counts in 67 study sites spread on the whole island. We used GLMM to define the relationships between the environment (topography, land use, climate) both the occurrence and the abundance of the species. Moreover, we estimated population densities by distance sampling. The Barbary Partridge occurred in areas at low altitude with garrigue and pastures, avoiding woodlands and sparsely vegetated areas. We found a strong relationship between the occurrence probability and the climate, in particular, a positive relation with temperature and a negative effect of precipitation, especially in April-May, during brood rearing. Furthermore, dry crops positively affected the abundance of the species. We estimated a density of 14.1 partridges per km(2), similar to other known estimates. Our findings are important both because they increase the knowledge concerning this species, which is considered data deficient in Italy, and because they are useful to plan management actions aimed to maintain viable populations if necessary.

AB  - Vertebrates are a vital ecological component of Amazon forest biodiversity. Although vertebrates are a functionally important part of various ecosystem services they continue to be threatened by anthropogenic impacts throughout the Amazon. Here we use a standardized, regularly spaced arrangement of camera traps within 25km(2) to provide a baseline assessment of vertebrate species diversity in a sustainable use protected area in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We examined seasonal differences in the per species encounter rates (number of photos per camera trap and number of cameras with photos). Generalized linear models (GLMs) were then used to examine the influence of five variables (altitude, canopy cover, basal area, distance to nearest river and distance to nearest large river) on the number of photos per species and on functional groups. GLMs were also used to examine the relationships between large predators [Jaguar (Panthera onca) and Puma (Puma concolor)] and their prey. A total of 649 independent photos of 25 species were obtained from 1,800 camera trap days (900 each during wet and dry seasons). Only ungulates and rodents showed significant seasonal differences in the number of photos per camera. The number of photos differed between seasons for only three species (Mazama americana, Dasyprocta leporina and Myoprocta acouchy) all of which were photographed more (3 to 10 fold increase) during the wet season. Mazama americana was the only species where a significant difference was found in occupancy, with more photos in more cameras during the wet season. For most groups and species variation in the number of photos per camera was only explained weakly by the GLMs (deviance explained ranging from 10.3 to 54.4%). Terrestrial birds (Crax alector, Psophia crepitans and Tinamus major) and rodents (Cuniculus paca, Dasyprocta leporina and M. acouchy) were the notable exceptions, with our GLMs significantly explaining variation in the distribution of all species (deviance explained ranging from 21.0 to 54.5%). The group and species GLMs showed some novel ecological information from this relatively pristine area. We found no association between large cats and their potential prey. We also found that rodent and bird species were more often recorded closer to streams. As hunters gain access via rivers this finding suggests that there is currently little anthropogenic impact on the species. Our findings provide a standardized baseline for comparison with other sites and with which planned management and extractive activities can be evaluated.

AB  - This paper deals with the relation between legally protected biodiversity and riverine ecotopes and with the assessment of biodiversity values of the Middle Vistula river valley (Poland). Furthermore. it describes the effects of landscape change on spatial distribution of ecotope patches and biodiversity values in Kazimierski Landscape Park. Biodiversity values were calculated using BIO-SAFE, a model meant to quantify biodiversity and to value ecotopes based on legally protected species. Dissimilarity indices depict high uniqueness of ecotope types regarding their species assemblages (e.g., river dunes, banks and bars). The actual biodiversity values of the river valley in Kazimierski Landscape Park are high in comparison with floodplains of lowland rivers in Western Europe. GIS analyses of remotely sensed ecotope maps show remarkable differences in number, acreage and patchiness of ecotopes for the years 1953 and 2003. The total number of patches increased by almost 44%. Side channels and floodplain lakes became fragmented. The average and total surface area of bush, forest and arable land increased, but decreased for bare soil, pioneer vegetation and grassland. These landscape changes indicate natural vegetation succession, intensification of agriculture and progressive impacts of river regulation. The Vistula river valley still represents high biodiversity values for higher plants, birds, herpetofauna and fish. However, current landscape changes negatively affect potential values for protected and endangered species. Assessments with BIO-SAFE can help to balance biodiversity conservation, river management and landscape planning. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An understanding of risks to biodiversity is needed for planning action to slow current rates of decline and secure ecosystem services for future human use. Although the IUCN Red List criteria provide an effective assessment protocol for species, a standard global assessment of risks to higher levels of biodiversity is currently limited. In 2008, IUCN initiated development of risk assessment criteria to support a global Red List of ecosystems. We present a new conceptual model for ecosystem risk assessment founded on a synthesis of relevant ecological theories. To support the model, we review key elements of ecosystem definition and introduce the concept of ecosystem collapse, an analogue of species extinction. The model identifies four distributional and functional symptoms of ecosystem risk as a basis for assessment criteria: A) rates of decline in ecosystem distribution; B) restricted distributions with continuing declines or threats; C) rates of environmental (abiotic) degradation; and D) rates of disruption to biotic processes. A fifth criterion, E) quantitative estimates of the risk of ecosystem collapse, enables integrated assessment of multiple processes and provides a conceptual anchor for the other criteria. We present the theoretical rationale for the construction and interpretation of each criterion. The assessment protocol and threat categories mirror those of the IUCN Red List of species. A trial of the protocol on terrestrial, subterranean, freshwater and marine ecosystems from around the world shows that its concepts are workable and its outcomes are robust, that required data are available, and that results are consistent with assessments carried out by local experts and authorities. The new protocol provides a consistent, practical and theoretically grounded framework for establishing a systematic Red List of the world's ecosystems. This will complement the Red List of species and strengthen global capacity to report on and monitor the status of biodiversity

AB  - The quality and availability of resources influence the geographical distribution of species. Social species need safe places to rest, meet, exchange information and obtain thermoregulatory benefits, but those places may also serve other important functions that have been overlooked in research. We use a large soaring bird that roosts communally in cliffs, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), as a model species to elucidate whether roost locations serve as a refuge from adverse weather conditions (climatic refuge hypothesis, CRH), and/or from predators or anthropogenic disturbances (threats refuge hypothesis, TRH). The CRH predicts that communal roosts will face in the opposite direction from where storms originate, and will be located in climatically stable, low precipitation areas. The TRH predicts that communal roosts will be large, poorly accessible cliffs, located far from human-made constructions. We surveyed cliffs used as communal roosts by condors in northwestern Patagonia, and compared them with alternative non-roosting cliffs to test these predictions at local and regional scales. We conclude that communal roosting places provide refuge against climate and disturbances such as, for instance, the threats of predators (including humans). Thus, it is not only the benefits gained from being aggregated per se, but the characteristics of the place selected for roosting that may both be essential for the survival of the species. This should be considered in management and conservation plans given the current scenario of global climate change and the increase in environmental disturbances.

AB  - Multispecies wildlife monitoring across large geographical regions is important for effective conservation planning in response to expected impacts from climate change and land use. Unlike many species of birds, mammals, and amphibians which can be efficiently sampled using automated sensors including cameras and sound recorders, reptiles are often much more challenging to detect, in part because of their typically cryptic behavior and generally small body sizes. Although many lizard species are more active during the day which makes them easier to detect using visual encounter surveys, they may be unavailable for sampling during certain periods of the day or year due to their sensitivity to temperature. In recognition of these sampling challenges, we demonstrate application of a recent innovation in distance sampling that adjusts for temporary emigration between repeat survey visits. We used transect surveys to survey lizards at 229 sites throughout the Mojave Desert in California, USA, 2016. We estimated a total population size of 82 million (90% CI: 65-99 million) for the three most common species of lizards across this 66,830 km(2) ecoregion. We mapped how density at the 1-km(2) scale was predicted to vary with vegetation cover and human development. We validated these results against independent surveys from the southern portion of our study area. Our methods and results demonstrate how multispecies monitoring programs spanning arid ecoregions can better incorporate information about reptiles.

AB  - The Mediterranean Basin is frequently stricken by huge disasters, and it represents an important biodiversity hotspot. Designing a synthetic approach, which is user-friendly with a low cost, that aims to summarize the main climatic factors that determine vegetation geographical ranges is a strategic solution to plan forest restoration actions and quickly act in cases of urgency. Here, we propose an updated version of the Emberger Index, applied to Quercus suber, an emblematic species of many ecosystems in the Mediterranean. Our investigation couples the latest spatially continuous climatic data, a high-resolution distribution map, and modelling techniques. The results evidence the effective benefits of the updated process, with insights into the optimal climatic requirements of a species within its real spatial domain, including projections for the next decades and the detection of putative refugia. Those outputs were not possible before because of a lack of data covering a certain area. Cork oak revealed an excellent study case, able to highlight the potentiality of Emberger's approach, and understand the ecological amplitude and vulnerabilities of the target species. If genetic information is available, the Emberger Index can even be applied at the haplotype scale, thus benefitting the applied research. Such an index mirrors the optimal plasticity and physiologic characteristics of a species, supporting the decision makers in selecting the correct plants to use in future reforestation and restoration activities.

AB  - Static networks of nature reserves disregard the dynamics of species ranges in changing environments. In fact, climate warming has been shown to potentially drive endangered species out of reserves. Less attention has been paid to the related problem that a warmer climate may also foster the invasion of alien species into reserve networks. Here, we use niche-based predictive modelling to assess to which extent the Austrian Natura 2000 network and a number of habitat types of conservation value outside this network might be prone to climate warming driven changes in invasion risk by Robinia pseudacacia L., one of the most problematic alien plants in Europe.
   Results suggest that the area potentially invaded by R. pseudacacia will increase considerably under a warmer climate. Interestingly, invasion risk will grow at a higher than average rate for most of the studied habitat types but less than the national average in Natura 2000 sites. This result points to a potential bias in legal protection towards high mountain areas which largely will remain too cold for R. pseudacacia. In contrast, the selected habitat types are more frequent in montane or lower lying regions, where R. pseudacacia invasion risk will increase most pronouncedly.
   We conclude that management plans of nature reserves should incorporate global warming driven changes in invasion risk in a more explicit manner. In case of R. pseudacacia, reducing propagule pressure by avoiding purposeful plantation in the neighbourhood of reserves and endangered habitats is a simple but crucial measure to prevent further invasion under a warmer climate.

AB  - Large-scale construction activity associated with the enlargement of Abberton Reservoir in Essex, England was calculated, mapped and subsequently modelled to examine the effect of disturbance on four Special Protection Area designated dabbling waterfowl species, Anas strepera (Gadwall), A. clypeata (Shoveler), A. crecca (Teal) and A. penelope (Wigeon). The distribution of each species was compared with levels of construction disturbance and environmental variables using Hurdle Model analysis and spatial referencing.
   Numbers of all four species varied throughout the study period with significant increases observed across the reservoir during the four year construction period. Findings show that the most important environmental variable was shallow water with increases in this area of habitat as a result of planned enhancement measures being of particular benefit to Gadwall, Shoveler and Teal. Numbers of Wigeon were especially variable across the site during construction and were displaced from the Main Section during the most disturbing shoreline works, behaviour we attribute to the loss of suitable grazing habitat during the construction process.
   While results show some disturbance responses, maintenance of site integrity for all four species is attributed to the overall size of the reservoir complex (4.75 km(2)) and the phased construction programme which reduced the extent and impact of disturbance. Research presented here provides evidence for a sensitive and science based approach to better deliver conservation and development requirements. The monitoring prior to (2006-2009) and during the construction phase (2010-2013) has enabled the much needed, but often lacking, evidence-based reporting on construction disturbance effects and associated mitigation measures.

AB  - A current challenge of biodiversity and conservation is the estimation of the spatial extent of habitat types across broad territories. In the absence of fine-resolution maps, predictive modelling helps in assessing the spatial distribution of vegetation cover. However, such approaches are still uncommon in regional planning and management. Here, we present a framework for mapping the area of occupancy (AOO) of habitat types that allows highly suitable estimates at different scales. We model the potential AOO with abiotic variables related to topography and climate, resulting in broad AOO estimates that are subsequently downscaled to the local AOO with remote sensing. The combination of individual local AOO estimates allows the defining of the realized AOO, comprising locations with a high suitability and low uncertainty for each habitat. We applied this framework to mapping 24 protected habitat types of Natura 2000 sites in northern Spain.Local and realized AOO were highly accurate, with a 70% overall accuracy for the realized AOO. Remote sensing data, and especially LiDAR, were the most important predictors in habitat types related to forests and shrubs, followed by rock outcrops and pastures. Environmental variables were also relevant for specific habitats subject to abiotic constraints. The combination of ecological modelling with remote sensing offers multiple advantages over traditional field surveys and image interpretation, allowing the harmonization of habitat maps across large regions and through time. This is particularly useful for implementing conservation actions under Natura 2000 principles or assessing IUCN criteria for ecosystems.

AB  - Aim Modelling African great ape distribution has until now focused on current or past conditions, while future scenarios remain scarcely explored. Using an ensemble forecasting approach, we predicted changes in taxon-specific distribution under future scenarios of climate, land use and human populations for (1) areas outside protected areas (PAs) only (assuming complete management effectiveness of PAs), (2) the entire study region and (3) interspecies range overlap.
   Location Tropical Africa.
   Methods We compiled occurrence data (n = 5,203) on African apes from the IUCN A.P.E.S. database and extracted relevant climate-, habitat- and human-related predictors representing current and future (2050) conditions to predict taxon-specific range change under a best- and a worst-case scenario, using ensemble forecasting.
   Results The predictive performance of the models varied across taxa. Synergistic interactions between predictors are shaping African ape distribution, particularly human-related variables. On average across taxa, a range decline of 50% is expected outside PAs under the best scenario if no dispersal occurs (61% in worst scenario). Otherwise, an 85% range reduction is predicted to occur across study regions (94% worst). However, range gains are predicted outside PAs if dispersal occurs (52% best, 21% worst), with a slight increase in gains expected across study regions (66% best, 24% worst). Moreover, more than half of range losses and gains are predicted to occur outside PAs where interspecific ranges overlap.
   Main Conclusions Massive range decline is expected by 2050, but range gain is uncertain as African apes will not be able to occupy these new areas immediately due to their limited dispersal capacity, migration lag and ecological constraints. Given that most future range changes are predicted outside PAs, Africa's current PA network is likely to be insufficient for preserving suitable habitats and maintaining connected ape populations. Thus, conservation planners urgently need to integrate land use planning and climate change mitigation measures at all decision-making levels both in range countries and abroad.

AB  - The ability of larvae to move beyond the spatial range of adult migrations can be critical to the resilience of populations that aggregate to spawn. We reviewed the literature and unpublished information on larval transport modeling, reef fish spawning aggregations, and marine protected area (MPA) management to identify alternatives for Cuban spawning site conservation. Larval transport information is available at annual and decadal scales for eight Cuban sites for five species of snappers. Connectivity patterns were examined: (a) within Cuban regions, (b) among Cuban regions, and (c) among other countries. We compared this information with the distribution of protected areas relative to spawning sites, site management attributes, and potential alternatives. Of eight focal spawning sites, seven are in protected areas and one is proposed. Southeast and north-central Cuba had highest estimated within-region retention levels. Southwest and northwest sites exported relatively more larvae out-of-region. Southern regions produced larvae that reached Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Haiti. All northern regions can export larvae to the southern Bahamas. The regions and sites within are geomorphologically diverse with variable fishing and socio-economic attributes. Information on stock status and protected area efficacy is limited and field assessments of aggregation status are needed for multispecies spawning sites. Few management plans address spawning conservation or network connectivity opportunities for MPAs. An alternative is development of one or more regional workgroups of protected area specialists, fishery scientists, expert fishers, and other stakeholders. Temporal closures of fisheries before and during spawning season could also amplify effectiveness of current gear- and zoning-based management tools.

AB  - The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) is one of Africa's most endangered species and therefore classified as endangered by IUCN. Earlier distributions included most of Africa but currently the African wild dog only has populations larger than 300 individuals in three countries (Botswana, Tanzania and South Africa). In 1998, a plan was launched in South Africa to manage sub-populations of the African wild dog in several small, geographically isolated, conservation areas. This management program involved the reintroduction of wild dogs into suitable conservation areas and periodic translocations among them. We used the stochastic population simulation model VORTEX to evaluate the Limpopo Valley Conservancy in the north of South Africa, as a possible reintroduction site for African wild dogs. The simulations showed that the size of the initial population released only had a small effect on the population dynamics. However, when individuals were supplemented and harvested over a longer period the probability of persistence increased. Number of females breeding, male mortality, and carrying capacity were key factors in the population dynamics, but according to VORTEX the severity of natural catastrophes had the greatest influence on the extinction risk and inbreeding. We suggest that the reintroduction program may be successful, if areas are properly secured, the dogs are held in a boma before release, wild animals or at least a mix of wild and captive animals are used for the release and the animals are vaccinated against rabies. It is, however, essential to continue monitoring followed by modelling efforts to re-evaluate the success of the reintroduction program. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The populations of goitered gazelle suffered significant decline due to natural and anthropogenic factors over the last century. Investigating the effects of barriers on gene flow among the remaining populations is vital for conservation planning. Here we adopted a landscape genetics approach to evaluate the genetic structure of the goitered gazelle in Central Iran and the effects of landscape features on gene flow using 15 polymorphic microsatellite loci. Spatial autocorrelation, isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by resistance (IBR) models were used to elucidate the effects of landscape features on the genetic structure. Ecological modeling was used to construct landscape permeability and resistance map using 12 ecogeographical variables. Bayesian algorithms revealed three genetically homogeneous groups and restricted dispersal pattern in the six populations. The IBD and spatial autocorrelation revealed a pattern of decreasing relatedness with increasing distance. The distribution of potential habitats was strongly correlated with bioclimatic factors, vegetation type, and elevation. Resistance distances and graph theory were significantly related with variation in genetic structure, suggesting that gazelles are affected by landscape composition. The IBD showed greater impact on genetic structure than IBR. The Mantel and partial Mantel tests indicated low but non-significant effects of anthropogenic barriers on observed genetic structure. We concluded that a combination of geographic distance, landscape resistance, and anthropogenic factors are affecting the genetic structure and gene flow of populations. Future road construction might impede connectivity and gene exchange of populations. Conservation measures on this vulnerable species should consider some isolated population as separate management units.

AB  - Background: As the climate warms, many species of reptiles are at risk of habitat loss and ultimately extinction. Locations of suitable habitat in the past, present, and future were modeled for several lizard species using MaxEnt, incorporating climatic variables related to temperature and precipitation. In this study, we predict where there is currently suitable habitat for the genus Pogona and potential shifts in habitat suitability in the past and future.
   Methods: Georeferenced occurrence records were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, climate variables (describing temperature and precipitation) were obtained from WorldClim, and a vegetation index was obtained from AVHRR satellite data. Matching climate variables were downloaded for three different past time periods (mid-Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum, and Last Interglacial) and two different future projections representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6 and 8.5). MaxEnt produced accuracy metrics, response curves, and probability surfaces. For each species, parameters were adjusted for the best possible output that was biologically informative.
   Results: Model results predicted that in the past, there was little suitable habitat for P. henrylawsoni and P. microlepidota within the areas of their current range. Past areas of suitable habitat for P. barbata were predicted to be similar to the current prediction. Pogona minor and P. nullarbor were predicted to have had a more expansive range of suitable habitat in the past, which has reduced over time. P. vitticeps was predicted to have less suitable habitat in the past when examining the region of their known occurrence; however, there was predicted growth in suitable habitat in Western Australia. Both 2070 models predict a similar distribution of habitat; however, the model produced using the 2070 RCP 8.5 climate change projection showed a larger change, both in areas of suitable habitat gain and loss. In the future, P. henrylawsoni and P. microlepidota might gain suitable habitat, while the other four species could possibly suffer habitat loss.
   Discussion: Based on the model results, P. henrylawsoni and P. microlepidota had minimal areas of suitable habitat during the Last Glacial Maximum, possibly due to changes in tolerance or data/model limitations, especially since genetic analyses for these species suggest a much earlier emergence. The predicted late Quaternary habitat results for all species of Pogona are conservative and should be compared to the fossil record which is not possible at the moment due to the current inability to identify fossil Pogona to the species level. P. nullarbor and P. vitticeps future models predict substantial habitat loss. P. nullarbor could potentially be considered vulnerable in the present since it already has a restricted range, and a conservation plan may need to be considered.

AB  - Aim To determine whether life-history characters that affect population persistence (e.g. habit and life span) and those that influence reproductive success (e.g. sexual system and fruit type) are non-randomly correlated with extinction risk (i.e. threat category) in the Australian flora (c. 19,000 species, of which c. 14% is threatened). To identify patterns that present useful conservation directions. To understand patterns of extinction risk in the Australian flora at a broad scale.
   Location Continental Australia.
   Methods A country-wide exploration of four life-history characters in the Australian flora (n = 18,822 species) was undertaken using reference texts, expert opinion, herbarium records and field work. For each character and threat-category combination, a G-test (using a log-linear model) was performed to test the null hypothesis that the two factors were independent in their effects on count. A generalized linear model (GLM) with a logit link and binomial error distribution was constructed with the proportion of taxa in each extinction risk category as the response variable and the habit, sex and fruit-type characters as explanatory terms. In a separate approach, we investigated patterns across the threat categories of non-endangered extant, endangered, and extinct using a multinomial model. We examined whether or not species-poor genera were more likely to contain threatened or extinct species than species-rich genera. A GLM with a binomial error distribution and logit link function was constructed to obtain a weighted regression on the proportion of species listed as extinct or endangered within a genus versus the log of the size of the genus. We also used a supertree analysis and character tracing to investigate the role of phylogeny on extinction risk.
   Results We found that the Australian flora is primarily composed of bisexual shrubs with dry-dehiscent fruits. Dioecious breeding systems (separate female and male flowers on separate plants) in many floras are the predominant unisexual system, but in Australia there are unexpectedly high levels of monoecy (separate female and male flowers on the same plant). Within the extinct data set of 31 species we detected a significant departure from that expected for habit but not for life span, sexual system or fruit type. There are significantly fewer trees on the extinct list than expected. This may reflect the greater resilience of trees than of other growth habits to extinction processes as well as the observation time-frame. Within the endangered data set of 450 species we found significant differences in the representation of the observed characters from that expected within sex systems and fruit types. We show that, depending on the life form, unisexual breeding systems can be significantly and positively associated with endangered species compared with non-threatened species. For example, there are more monoecious species than expected by chance among the tree species listed as endangered but fewer among the herbaceous life forms. Threat category was found to be non-randomly clustered in some clades.
   Main conclusions Life-history characters in certain combinations are predictive of extinction risk. Phylogeny is also an important component of extinction risk. We suggest that specific life-history characters could be used for conservation planning and as an early warning sign for detecting vulnerability in lists of species.

AB  - Mammalian carnivores are increasingly the focus of reintroduction attempts in areas from which they have been extirpated by historic persecution. We used static and dynamic spatial models to evaluate whether a proposed wolf reintroduction to the southern Rocky Mountain region (U.S.A) would advance recovery by increasing species distribution beyond what might be expected through natural range expansion. We used multiple logistic regression to develop a resource-selection function relating wolf distribution in the Greater Yellowstone region with regional-scale habitat variables. We also used a spatially explicit population model to predict wolf distribution and viability at several potential reintroduction sites within the region under current conditions and under two contrasting predictions of future landscape change. Areas of the southern Rocky Mountains with resource-selection-function values similar to those of currently inhabited areas in Yellowstone could potentially support >1000 wolves, 40% within protected areas and 47% on unprotected public lands. The dynamic model predicted similar distribution under current conditions but suggested that development trends over 25 years may result in the loss of one of four potential regional subpopulations and increased isolation of the remaining areas. The reduction in carrying capacity due to landscape change ranged from 49% to 66%, depending on assumptions about road development on public lands. Although much of the wolf population occurs outside core protected areas, these areas remain the key to the persistence of subpopulations. Although the dynamic model's sensitivity to dispersal parameters made it difficult to predict the probability of natural recolonization from distant sources, it suggested that an active reintroduction to two sites within the region may be necessary to ensure low extinction probability. Social carnivores such as the wolf, which often require larger territories than solitary species of similar size, may be more vulnerable to environmental stochasticity and landscape fragmentation than their vagility and fecundity would suggest.

AB  - Tourism development is one of the main contemporary drivers of habitat loss and fragmentation within the Caribbean Islands biodiversity hotspot. In Saint Lucia, construction of a hotel and golf course within coastal dry forest is directly threatening the largest known subpopulation of the Endangered White-breasted Thrasher Ramphocinclus brachyurus. Understanding how the species is responding to ongoing landscape change and identifying priority sites for conservation are imperative for planning its long-term conservation. In this study, a four year White-breasted Thrasher monitoring dataset (2006-2009) and landscape-scale environmental variables were used to: a) identify, characterise and map spatio-temporal patterns of White-breasted Thrasher encounter rate (an abundance proxy) within and outside the tourist development site; b) determine landscape-scale environmental variables that influence such patterns, and c) produce an island-wide predictive map of potentially suitable habitat. Observed patterns in encounter rates within and outside the development site were consistent with thrashers being displaced from cleared areas of forest and crowding into intact forest patches to the north and west of the golf course. A year after the period of the most extensive habitat clearance, White-breasted Thrasher numbers declined markedly leading to a 55% reduction in encounter rate within the development site over the four years of the study. The habitat suitability model predicted that a range of sites outside of the known geographic range of the thrasher are potentially suitable, some of which merit further surveys for potentially undetected populations. Given these findings, it is vital that patches of suitable dry forest adjacent to the tourist development are protected and contiguous natural habitat inside the tourist development is preserved.

AB  - Climate change and human activities have caused dramatic impacts on biodiversity. Although a number of international agreements or initiatives have been launched to mitigate the biodiversity loss, the erosion of terrestrial biome habitats is inevitable. Consequently, the identification of potential suitable habitats under climate change and human disturbance has become an urgent task of biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to identify the current and potential future habitats of Asian elephants in South and Southeast Asia. We performed analyses for future projections with 17 scenarios using the present results as baseline. To optimize the modelling results, we delineated the core habitats by using the Core Mapper Tool and compared them with existing protected areas (PAs) through gap analysis. The results showed that the current total area of core habitats is 491,455 km(2) in size and will be reduced to 332,544 km(2) by 2090 under SSP585 (the shared socioeconomic pathway). The projection analysis under differential scenarios suggested that most of the core habitats in the current protected areas would remain stable and suitable for elephants in the future. However, the remaining 75.17% of the core habitats lay outside the current PAs, and finally we mapped approximately 219,545 km(2) of suitable habitats as priority protected areas in the future. Although our model did not perform well in some regions, our analyses and findings still could provide useful references to the planning of protected areas and conservation of Asian elephant.

AB  - Ecological and conservation research has provided a strong scientific underpinning to the modeling of ecosystem services (ESs) over space and time, by identifying the ecological processes and components of biodiversity (ecosystem service providers, functional traits) that drive ES supply. Despite this knowledge, efforts to map the distribution of ESs often rely on simple spatial surrogates that provide incomplete and non-mechanistic representations of the biophysical variables they are intended to proxy. However, alternative data sets are available that allow for more direct, spatially nuanced inputs to ES mapping efforts. Many spatially explicit, quantitative estimates of biophysical parameters are currently supported by remote sensing, with great relevance to ES mapping. Additional parameters that are not amenable to direct detection by remote sensing may be indirectly modeled with spatial environmental data layers. We review the capabilities of modern remote sensing for describing biodiversity, plant traits, vegetation condition, ecological processes, soil properties, and hydrological variables and highlight how these products may contribute to ES assessments. Because these products often provide more direct estimates of the ecological properties controlling ESs than the spatial proxies currently in use, they can support greater mechanistic realism in models of ESs. By drawing on the increasing range of remote sensing instruments and measurements, data sets appropriate to the estimation of a given ES can be selected or developed. In so doing, we anticipate rapid progress to the spatial characterization of ecosystem services, in turn supporting ecological conservation, management, and integrated land use planning.

AB  - Ecological distance-based spatial capture-recapture models (SCR) are a promising approach for simultaneously estimating animal density and connectivity, both of which affect spatial population processes and ultimately species persistence. We explored how SCR models can be integrated into reserve-design frameworks that explicitly acknowledge both the spatial distribution of individuals and their space use resulting from landscape structure. We formulated the design of wildlife reserves as a budget-constrained optimization problem and conducted a simulation to explore 3 different SCR-informed optimization objectives that prioritized different conservation goals by maximizing the number of protected individuals, reserve connectivity, and density-weighted connectivity. We also studied the effect on our 3 objectives of enforcing that the space-use requirements of individuals be met by the reserve for individuals to be considered conserved (referred to as home-range constraints). Maximizing local population density resulted in fragmented reserves that would likely not aid long-term population persistence, and maximizing the connectivity objective yielded reserves that protected the fewest individuals. However, maximizing density-weighted connectivity or preemptively imposing home-range constraints on reserve design yielded reserves of largely spatially compact sets of parcels covering high-density areas in the landscape with high functional connectivity between them. Our results quantify the extent to which reserve design is constrained by individual home-range requirements and highlight that accounting for individual space use in the objective and constraints can help in the design of reserves that balance abundance and connectivity in a biologically relevant manner.

AB  - The demands of a growing human population dictates that expansion of energy infrastructure, roads, and other development frequently takes place in native rangelands. Particularly, transmission lines and roads commonly divide rural landscapes and increase fragmentation. This has direct and indirect consequences on native wildlife that can be mitigated through thoughtful planning and proactive approaches to identifying areas of high conservation priority. We used nine years (2003-2011) of Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) lek locations totaling 870 unique leks sites in Kansas and seven geographic information system (GIS) layers describing land cover, topography, and anthropogenic structures to model habitat suitability across the state. The models obtained had low omission rates (<0.18) and high area under the curve scores (AUC>0.81), indicating high model performance and reliability of predicted habitat suitability for Greater Prairie-Chickens. We found that elevation was the most influential in predicting lek locations, contributing three times more predictive power than any other variable. However, models were improved by the addition of land cover and anthropogenic features (transmission lines, roads, and oil and gas structures). Overall, our analysis provides a hierarchal understanding of Greater Prairie-Chicken habitat suitability that is broadly based on geomorphological features followed by land cover suitability. We found that when land features and vegetation cover are suitable for Greater Prairie-Chickens, fragmentation by anthropogenic sources such as roadways and transmission lines are a concern. Therefore, it is our recommendation that future human development in Kansas avoid areas that our models identified as highly suitable for Greater Prairie-Chickens and focus development on land cover types that are of lower conservation concern.

AB  - AimProtected areas have become pivotal to the modern conservation planning toolbox, but a limited understanding of marine macroecology is hampering their efficient design and implementation in pelagic environments. We explored the respective contributions of environmental factors and human impacts in capturing the distribution of an assemblage of commercially valuable, large-bodied, open-water predators (tunas, marlins and mackerels).
   LocationWestern Australia.
   Time period1997-2006.
   Major taxa studiedPelagic fishes.
   MethodsWe compiled 10 years of commercial fishing records from the Sea Around Us Project and derived relative abundance indices from standardized catch rates while accounting for confounding effects of effort, year and gear type. We used these indices to map pelagic hotspots over a 0.5 degrees-resolution grid and built random forests to estimate the importance of 33 geophysical, oceanographic and anthropogenic predictors in explaining their locations. We additionally examined the spatial congruence between these hotspots and an extensive network of marine reserves and determined whether patterns of co-occurrence deviated from random expectations using null model simulations.
   ResultsFirst, we identified several pelagic hotspots off the coast of Western Australia. Second, geomorphometrics explained up to 50% of the variance in relative abundance of pelagic fishes, and submarine canyon presence ranked as the most influential variable in the North bioregion. Seafloor complexity, geodiversity, salinity, temperature variability, primary production, ocean energy, current regimes and human impacts were also identified as important predictors. Third, spatial overlap between hotspots and marine reserves was limited, with most high-abundance areas primarily found in zones where anthropogenic activities are subject to few regulations.
   Main conclusionsThis study reveals geomorphometrics as valuable indicators of the distribution of mobile fish species and highlights the relevance of harnessing static topography as a key element in any blueprint for ocean zoning and spatial management.

AB  - Many conservation actions are justified on the basis of managing biodiversity. Biodiversity, in terms of species richness, is largely the product of rare species. This is problematic because the intensity of sampling needed to characterize communities and patterns of rarity or to justify the use of surrogates has biased sampling in favor of space over time. However, environmental fluctuations interacting with community dynamics lead to temporal variations in where and when species occur, potentially affecting conservation planning by generating uncertainty about results of species distribution modeling (including range determinations), selection of surrogates for biodiversity, and the proportion of biodiversity composed of rare species. To have confidence in the evidence base for conservation actions, one must consider whether temporal replication is necessary to produce broad inferences. Using approximately 20 years of macrofaunal data from tidal flats in 2 harbors, we explored variation in the identity of rare, common, restricted range, and widespread species over time and space. Over time, rare taxa were more likely to increase in abundance or occurrence than to remain rare or disappear and to exhibit temporal patterns in their occurrence. Space-time congruency in ranges (i.e., spatially widespread taxa were also temporally widespread) was observed only where samples were collected across an environmental gradient. Fifteen percent of the taxa in both harbors changed over time from having spatially restricted ranges to having widespread ranges. Our findings suggest that rare species can provide stability against environmental change, because the majority of species were not random transients, but that selection of biodiversity surrogates requires temporal validation. Rarity needs to be considered both spatially and temporally, as species that occur randomly over time are likely to play a different role in ecosystem functioning than those exhibiting temporal structure (e.g., seasonality). Moreover, temporal structure offers the opportunity to place management and conservation activities within windows of maximum opportunity.
   El Papel del Tiempo y la Identidad de las Especies en los Patrones Espaciales de Riqueza de Especies y la Conservacion Muchas acciones de conservacion estan justificadas con base en el manejo de la biodiversidad. La biodiversidad, en terminos de la riqueza de especies, generalmente es producto de especies raras. Esto es problematico porque la intensidad del muestreo necesitado para caracterizar a las comunidades y los patrones de rareza o para justificar el uso de sustitutos tiene un muestreo sesgado a favor del espacio sobre el tiempo. Sin embargo, las fluctuaciones ambientales que interactuan con las dinamicas de las comunidades llevan a variaciones temporales en donde y cuando ocurren las especies, lo que afecta potencialmente a la planeacion de la conservacion al generar incertidumbre sobre los resultados del modelado de distribucion de especies (incluyendo las determinaciones de extension), seleccion de sustitutos para la biodiversidad y la proporcion de biodiversidad compuesta por especies raras. Para tener confianza en la base de evidencias para las acciones de conservacion, uno debe considerar si la replicacion temporal es necesaria para producir inferencias generalizadas. Utilizamos aproximadamente 20 anos de datos de macrofauna de los llanos de marea de dos puertos para explorar la variacion en la identidad de especies raras, comunes, de extension restringida y dispersadas a lo largo del tiempo y el espacio. A lo largo del tiempo, los taxones raros tuvieron mayor probabilidad de incrementar en abundancia u ocurrencia que de permanecer como raros o desaparecer y una mayor probabilidad de exhibir patrones temporales en su ocurrencia. Se observo congruencia espacio-tiempo en las extensiones (es decir, los taxones dispersados espacialmente tambien estuvieron dispersados temporalmente) solo cuando las muestras fueron colectadas a lo largo de un gradiente ambiental. El 15 % de los taxones en ambos puertos cambio con el tiempo de tener extensiones restringidas espacialmente a tener extensiones dispersadas. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que las especies raras pueden proporcionar estabilidad frente al cambio ambiental, ya que la mayoria de las especies no fueron errantes al azar, pero que la seleccion de sustitutos para la biodiversidad requiere validacion temporal. La rareza necesita ser considerada tanto espacial como temporalmente, ya que las especies que ocurren con el tiempo tienen probabilidad de tener un papel diferente en la funcion del ecosistema que aquellos que exhiben una estructura temporal (por ejemplo, estacionalidad). Ademas, la estructura temporal ofrece la oportunidad de colocar a las actividades de manejo y de conservacion dentro de las ventanas de maxima oportunidad. Resumen

AB  - Because of their remote location and lack of supporting infrastructure, large glacial rivers of southern Patagonia have remained free of dams. But this is bound to change: two dams proposed for the Santa Cruz River would supply 16% of Argentina's hydropower and five dams planned for the Pascua and Baker Rivers could supply over 20% of Chile's hydropower. In this paper, we project the losses of habitat and juvenile Oncorhynchus mykiss, a recreationally important species, following the construction of the two dams in the Santa Cruz River. We applied a two-stage fitting approach, using generalized additive models and generalized lineal models (GLMs) sequentially to describe habitat-species relationships based on data collected through an intensive field survey of fish and environmental variables along 310 km of river. A simplified GLM trout model based on wetted width, substrate size, and river kilometer was selected which represents the observed geographic distribution very well and with the lowest predictive error. Based on this model, we estimated that habitat supporting 86% of current juvenile trout production will be lost to flooding by the dams. Our data generate a rare opportunity to perform a dam impact assessment by comparison with potential post-dam conditions.

AB  - The local ecological footprinting tool (LEFT) uses globally available databases, modeling, and algorithms to remotely assess locally important ecological features across landscapes based on five criteria: biodiversity (beta-diversity), vulnerability (threatened species), fragmentation, connectivity, and resilience. This approach can be applied to terrestrial landscapes at a 300-m resolution within a given target area. Input is minimal (latitude and longitude) and output is a computer-generated report and series of maps that both individually and synthetically depict the relative value of each ecological criteria. A key question for any such tool, however, is how representative is the remotely obtained output compared to what is on the ground. Here, we present the results from comparing remotely- vs. field-generated outputs from the LEFT tool on two distinct study areas for beta-diversity and distribution of threatened species (vulnerability), the two fields computed by LEFT for which such an approach is feasible. The comparison method consists of a multivariate measure of similarity between two fields based on discrete wavelet transforms, and reveals consistent agreement across a wide range of spatial scales. These results suggest that remote assessment tools such as LEFT hold great potential for determining key ecological features across landscapes and for being utilized in preplanning biodiversity assessment tools.

AB  - American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) are small mammals that are abundantly distributed throughout North America. Urbanization in the Anthropocene is now a global process, and squirrels live in affected landscapes. This leads to squirrels adjusting to human developments. Not much is known about the distribution of squirrels and squirrel middens near humans, especially not in the subarctic and sub-urbanized regions. Although this species is hunted, there are no real publicly available distribution and abundance estimates nor management plans and bag limits for squirrels in Alaska or in the United States known by us, except the endangered Mt. Graham squirrel. In general, insufficient squirrel conservation research is carried out; they are underrepresented in research and its literature. To further the science-based management for such species, this study aims to generate the first digital open access workflow as a generic research template for small mammal work including the latest machine learning of open source and high-resolution LIDAR data in an Open Source Geographic Information System (QGIS) and ArcGIS. Machine learning has proven to be less modeler biased and improve accuracy of the analysis outcome, therefore it is the preferred approach. This template is designed to be rapid, simple, robust, generic and effective for being used by a global audience. As a unique showcase, here a squirrel midden survey was carried out for two years (2016 and 2017). These squirrel middens were detected in a research area of 45,5 hectares (0,455 km(2)) in downtown Fairbanks, interior boreal forest of Alaska, U.S. Transect distances were geo-referenced with a GPS and adjusted to the visual conditions to count all squirrel middens within the survey area. Different layers of proximity to humans and habitat characteristics were assembled using aerial imagery and LIDAR data (3D data needed for an arboreal species like the red squirrels) consisting of a 3 x 3 m resolution. The layer data was used to train a predictive distribution model for red squirrel middens with machine learning. The model showed the relative index of occurrence (RIO) in a map and identified canopy height, distance to trails, canopy density and the distance to a lake, together, as the strongest predictors for squirrel midden distribution whereas open landscape and disturbed areas are avoided. It is concluded that squirrels select for high and dense forests for middens while avoiding human disturbance. This study is able to present a machine learning template to easily and rapidly produce an accurate abundance prediction which can be used for management implications.

AB  - Population abundance estimates using predictive models are important for describing habitat use and responses to population-level impacts, evaluating conservation status of a species, and for establishing monitoring programs. The golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) is a neotropical migratory bird that was listed as federally endangered in 1990 because of threats related to loss and fragmentation of its woodland habitat. Since listing, abundance estimates for the species have mainly relied on localized population studies on public lands and qualitative-based methods. Our goal was to estimate breeding population size of male warblers using a predictive model based on metrics for patches of woodland habitat throughout the species' breeding range. We first conducted occupancy surveys to determine range-wide distribution. We then conducted standard point-count surveys on a subset of the initial sampling locations to estimate density of males. Mean observed patch-specific density was 0.23?males/ha (95% CI?=?0.1970.252, n?=?301). We modeled the relationship between patch-specific density of males and woodland patch characteristics (size and landscape composition) and predicted patch occupancy. The probability of patch occupancy, derived from a model that used patch size and landscape composition as predictor variables while addressing effects of spatial relatedness, best predicted patch-specific density. We predicted patch-specific densities as a function of occupancy probability and estimated abundance of male warblers across 63,616 woodland patches accounting for 1.678 million ha of potential warbler habitat. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, our approach yielded a range-wide male warbler population estimate of 263,339 (95% CI: 223,927302,620). Our results provide the first abundance estimate using habitat and count data from a sampling design focused on range-wide inference. Managers can use the resulting model as a tool to support conservation planning and guide recovery efforts. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The Craugastor podiciferus complex is a group of phenotypically polymorphic direct-developing frogs that inhabit the Talamancan highlands of Costa Rica and Panama. The montane distribution of this group creates natural allopatry among members and offers an excellent opportunity to explore geographic models of speciation. Using a multilocus approach, we obtained data from one nuclear (c-myc) and three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, and COI) gene regions from 40 individuals within the C. podiciferus complex. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed a basal split that placed samples from western Panama as sister to Costa Rican (CR) samples, corroborating a previous suggestion that the former lineage may represent an undescribed species. Within the CR clades we found six distinct haplogroups whose distributions largely corresponded to geographic features and included instances of sympatry. Divergence estimates were used to develop a preliminary evolutionary timeframe for the diversification of the C. podiciferus complex. Based on collective evidence, we hypothesize that movement of the CR haplogroups has occurred between currently isolated areas of suitable habitat via second order climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene. The levels of genetic differentiation within the C. podiciferus complex are remarkable given the relatively small geographic area (ca. 8000 km(2)) of occurrence. This diversity emphasizes the need for further study and taxonomic revision to aid in conservation planning for this complex which, like many amphibians, has experienced recent population declines.

AB  - Context Socioecological information should be properly employed in the process of spatial analysis, planning, and management in order to respond to complex and multidirectional biodiversity issues.
   Objectives We conducted this study to map socioecological hotspots, where landscapes of social significance and wildlife habitats overlap, show to what extent and how the spatial distribution of social values (SVs) of people toward their landscapes interact with wildlife habitats in socioecological hotspots, simulate the potential for habitat degradation as a result of human activities linked to SVs, identify strategic areas for landscape restoration in socioecological hotspots, where both environmental conditions and SVs support the persistence and colonization of wildlife, and detect specific areas, where SVs of people may be contradictive leading to land-use disputes.
   Methods We developed a model to show the potential for habitat degradation based on the spatial distribution of SVs associated with landscapes. We restricted our study to the Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB) and focused on habitats of five keystone mammal species to assess the validity of our model.
   Results Habitat loss, habitat subdivision, habitat dispersion, and habitat shrinkage can be four consequences of human activities for biodiversity in socioecological hotspots of the UMRB, however, the magnitude of impacts varies among landscapes and mammal species.
   Conclusion Spatially explicit models to properly map SVs in relation to wildlife habitats are still associated with some uncertainties and limitations, and therefore, require further development. Change in SVs and public attitudes toward land use is essential to avoid further biodiversity loss in this region.

AB  - In recent years, Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has gained broad political support and has evolved to become a new research topic in the area of sustainable urban development. The focus has been largely on green urban structures, such as parks and urban forest. The role and contribution of farmland has often been neglected. This work wants to scrutinise the potential of farmland's contribution to the basic conception of UGI, in particular, with regard to connectivity. It reports on three case studies from Southern Germany, in the peri-urban regions of the three largest and expanding cities of Bavaria: Munich, Nuremberg and Augsburg. The spatial analysis we used is transparent, simple and repeatable. It is transferable to any European urban area. We use habitat suitability modelling to map the potential spatial distribution of low-intensity farmland, with emphasis on grassland systems. Based on these potential distributions, landscape indicators are used to analyse structural connectivity. Structural connectivity is used as a surrogate for functional connectivity, which supports ecological and abiotic processes and functions, but on the other hand characterises functional social connectivity, with respect to the accessibility of recreation. The results of this study suggest that farmland bears a great potential to contribute to UGI. The immediate surroundings of the cities do not just offer spatial potential but can enhance connectivity significantly. Based on these results some recommendations have been formulated to enable a better appreciation of farmland and farmers as partners for effectively developing strategies for UGI planning and sustainable urban development.

AB  - The mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa) is notably the most primitive North American rodent with a restricted distribution in the Pacific Northwest based on its physiological limits to heat stress and water needs. The Point Arena subspecies (A. r. nigra) is federally listed as endangered and is 1 of 2 subspecies that have extremely small and disjunct distributions, putting the taxon at risk from habitat loss and warming global temperatures. We sought to understand their range-wide distribution, to predict the environmental features that best describe their occurrence, and to establish a foundation for monitoring their distribution. We randomly sampled the occurrence of Point Arena mountain beavers (PAMB) from the portion of their geographic range that was accessible (public lands plus private lands where permission was granted). We surveyed 127, 25-ha sample units for their distinctive burrows and estimated the probability of detecting burrows, if they were present, at >90% per visit. Using this information, we estimated occupancy across the accessible portion of the range to be 26.2%. Range-wide estimates of occupancy, combined with strategically selected locations where abundance and survival can be estimated noninvasively, may comprise a realistic monitoring program for this taxon. We also used the detection and nondetection locations to develop a habitat suitability model by relating these locations to remotely sensed predictors. We evaluated 53 a priori candidate habitat suitability models and the best-fitting model included gentle slopes, low terrain roughness indices, and the high density of rivers and streams. Selecting the probability value that best separated the sample units into suitable and nonsuitable habitat, we estimated a total of 70.5 km(2) of suitable habit, or approximately 40.4% of the original geographic range. New detections significantly expanded the known geographic range, moderating concerns about habitat loss, including that predicted by climate change. A substantial number of suitable areas were predicted to occur outside the current range. The identification of high suitability areas allows management agencies to prioritize areas for PAMB conservation planning, evaluate human impacts on habitat, and evaluate how a changing climate may affect distribution.

AB  - Theory predicts that the number of fish species increases with river size in natural free-flowing rivers, but the relationship is lost under intensive exploitation of water resources associated with dams and/or landscape developments. In this paper, we aim to identify orthomorphic issues that disrupt theoretical species patterns based on a multi-year, basin-wide assessment in the Danshuei River Watershed of Taiwan. We hypothesize that multiple human-induced modifications fragment habitat areas leading to decreases of local fish species richness. We integrally relate natural and anthropogenic influences on fish species richness by a multiple linear regression model that is driven by a combination of factors including river network structure controls, water quality alterations of habitat, and disruption of channel connectivity with major discontinuities in habitat caused by dams. We found that stream order is a major forcing factor representing natural influence on fish species richness. In addition to stream order, we identified dams, dissolved oxygen deficiency ( DO), and excessive total phosphorus (TP) as major anthropogenic influences on the richness of fish species. Our results showed that anthropogenic influences were operating at various spatial scales that inherently regulate the physical, chemical, and biological condition of fish habitats. Moreover, our probability-based risk assessment revealed causes of species richness reduction and opportunities for mitigation. Risks of species richness reduction caused by dams were determined by the position of dams and the contribution of tributaries in the drainage network. Risks associated with TP and DO were higher in human-activity-intensified downstream reaches. Our methodology provides a structural framework for assessing changes in basin-wide fish species richness under the mixed natural and human-modified river network and habitat conditions. Based on our analysis results, we recommend that a focus on landscape and riverine habitats and maintaining long-term monitoring programs are crucial for effective watershed management and river conservation plans.

AB  - Resources in the ocean are ephemeral, and effective management must therefore account for the dynamic spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystems and species of concern. We focus on the South Taranaki Bight (STB) of New Zealand, where upwelling generates productivity and prey to support an important foraging ground for blue whales that overlaps with anthropogenic pressure from industrial activities. We incorporate regional ecological knowledge of upwelling dynamics, physical-biological coupling and associated lags in models to forecast sea surface temperature (SST) and net primary productivity (NPP) with up to 3 weeks lead time. Forecasted environmental layers are then implemented in species distribution models to predict suitable blue whale habitat in the STB. Models were calibrated using data from the austral summers of 2009-2019, and ecological forecast skill was evaluated by predicting to withheld data. Boosted regression tree models skilfully forecasted SST (CV deviance explained = 0.969-0.970) and NPP (CV deviance explained = 0.738-0.824). The subsequent blue whale distribution forecast models had high predictive performance (AUC = 0.889), effectively forecasting suitable habitat on a daily scale with 1-3 weeks lead time. The spatial location and extent of forecasted blue whale habitat were variable, with the proportion of petroleum and mineral permit areas that overlapped with daily suitable habitat ranging from 0% to 70%. Hence, the STB and these forecast models are well-suited for dynamic management that could reduce anthropogenic threats to whales while decreasing regulatory burdens to industry users relative to a traditional static protected area. Synthesis and applications. We develop and test ecological forecast models that predict sea surface temperature, net primary productivity and blue whale suitable habitat up to 3 weeks in the future within New Zealand's South Taranaki Bight region. These forecasts of whale distribution can be effectively applied for dynamic spatial management due to model foundation on quantified links and lags between physical forcing and biological responses. A framework to operationalize these forecasts through a user-driven application is in development to proactively inform conservation management decisions. This framework is implemented through stakeholder engagement, allows flexibility based on management objectives, and is amenable to improvement as new knowledge and feedback are received.

AB  - Conservation and management of spatially structured populations is challenging because solutions must consider where individuals are located, but also differential individual space use as a result of landscape heterogeneity. A recent extension of spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models, the ecological distance model, uses spatial encounter histories of individuals (e.g., a record of where individuals are detected across space, often sequenced over multiple sampling occasions), to estimate the relationship between space use and characteristics of a landscape, allowing simultaneous estimation of both local densities of individuals across space and connectivity at the scale of individual movement. We developed two model-based estimators derived from the SCR ecological distance model to quantify connectivity over a continuous surface: (1) potential connectivity-a metric of the connectivity of areas based on resistance to individual movement; and (2) density-weighted connectivity (DWC)-potential connectivity weighted by estimated density. Estimates of potential connectivity and DWC can provide spatial representations of areas that are most important for the conservation of threatened species, or management of abundant populations (i.e., areas with high density and landscape connectivity), and thus generate predictions that have great potential to inform conservation and management actions. We used a simulation study with a stationary trap design across a range of landscape resistance scenarios to evaluate how well our model estimates resistance, potential connectivity, and DWC. Correlation between true and estimated potential connectivity was high, and there was positive correlation and high spatial accuracy between estimated DWC and true DWC. We applied our approach to data collected from a population of black bears in New York, and found that forested areas represented low levels of resistance for black bears. We demonstrate that formal inference about measures of landscape connectivity can be achieved from standard methods of studying animal populations which yield individual encounter history data such as camera trapping. Resulting biological parameters including resistance, potential connectivity, and DWC estimate the spatial distribution and connectivity of the population within a statistical framework, and we outline applications to many possible conservation and management problems.

AB  - Information on the spatial distribution of habitats and vulnerable species is important for conservation planning. In particular, detailed knowledge on connectivity of marine ecosystems in relation to depth and seafloor characteristics is crucial for any proposed conservation and management actions. Yet, the bulk of the seafloor remains under-sampled, unstudied and unmapped, thereby limiting our understanding of connections between shallow and deep-water communities. Recent studies on mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) have highlighted the Western Indian Ocean as a particularly understudied marine region. Here we utilise an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect in-situ temperature, oxygen concentration, bathymetry, acoustic backscatter and photographic data on benthic communities from shallow (<30 m) and mesophotic (30-150 m) depths at selected sites in the Greater Pemba Channel, Tanzania. Further, we use generalised additive models (GAMs) to determine useful predictors of substratum (hard and sand) and benthic community type (coral, turf algae, fleshy algae, fish). Our results revealed the presence of a complex seafloor characterised by pockmarks, steep slopes, submarine walls, and large boulders. Photographs confirmed the presence of MCE composed of corals, algae and fishes on the eastern margins of the Pemba Channel. The GAMs on the presence and absence of benthic community explained 35%-91% of the deviance in fish and fleshy algae assemblages, respectively. Key predictors of the distribution of hard substrata and the coral reef communities were depth, showing the upper boundary of MCEs present at 30-40 m, and seafloor slope that showed more occurrences on steep slopes. The upper 100 m of water column had stable temperatures (25-26 degrees C) and oxygen concentrations (220-235 mu mol/l). We noted the presence of submarine walls, steeply inclined bedrock, which appeared to support a highly bio-diverse community that may be worthy of particular conservation measures. Our results also highlight the capability of using marine robotics, particularly autonomous vehicles, to fill the knowledge gap for areas not readily accessible by divers or with surface vessels, and their potential application for the initial survey and subsequent monitoring of Marine Protected Areas.

AB  - Background The distribution of genetic diversity and the underlying processes are important for conservation planning but are unknown for most species and have not been well studied in many regions. In East Asia, the Sichuan Basin and surrounding mountains constitute an understudied region that exhibits a "ring" of high species richness overlapping the eastern edge of the global biodiversity hotspot Mountains of Southwest China. We examine the distributional history and genetic diversification of the Emei mustache toadLeptobrachium boringii, a typical "ring" element characterized by disjunct ranges in the mountains, by integrating time-calibrated gene tree, genetic variability, individual-level clustering, inference of population splitting and mixing from allele frequencies, and paleoclimatic suitability modeling. Results The results reveal extensive range dynamics, including secondary contact after long-term isolation via westward dispersal accompanied by variability loss. They allow the proposal of a model that combines recurrent contractions caused by Quaternary climatic changes and some failed expansions under suitable conditions for explaining the shared disjunct distribution pattern. Providing exceptional low-elevation habitats in the hotspot area, the eastern edge harbors both long-term refugial and young immigrant populations. This finding and a synthesis of evidence from other taxa demonstrate that a certain contributor to biodiversity, one that preserves and receives low-elevation elements of the east in this case, can be significant for only a particular part of a hotspot. By clarifying the low variability of these refugial populations, we show that discordant mitochondrial estimates of diversity can be obtained for populations that experienced admixture, which would have unlikely left proportional immigrant alleles for each locus. Conclusions Dispersal after long-term isolation can explain much of the spatial distribution of genetic diversity in this species, while secondary contact and long-term persistence do not guarantee a large variation. The model for the formation of disjunct ranges may apply to many other taxa isolated in the mountains surrounding the Sichuan Basin. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the heterogeneous nature of hotspots and discordant variability obtained from genome-wide and mitochondrial data.

AB  - The angelshark (Squatina squatina) has the northernmost range of any angel shark species, but there is limited information on its distribution, habitat use and ecology at higher latitudes. To address this, Angel Shark Project: Wales gathered 2231 S. squatina records and 142 anecdotal resources from fishers, coastal communities and archives. These spanned the coastal waters of Wales and the central Irish Sea and were dated from 1812 to 2020, with 97.62% of records within 11.1 km (6 nm) of the coast. Commercial, recreational and charter boat fishers provided the majority of S. squatina records (97.18%), with significantly more sightings from three decades (1970s, 1980s and 1990s) and in the months of September, June, August and July (in descending order). The coastal area between Bardsey Island and Strumble Head had the most S. squatina records (n = 1279), with notable concentrations also found in Carmarthen Bay, Conwy Bay and the Outer Severn Estuary. Species distribution models (SDM) identified four environmental variables that had significant influence on S. squatina distribution, depth, chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity, and these varied between the quarters (Q) of the year. SDM model outputs predicted a larger congruous area of suitable habitat in Q3 (3176 km(2)) compared to Q2 (2051 km(2)), with suitability along the three glacial moraines (Sarn Badrig, Sarn-y-Bwch and Sarn Cynfelyn) strongly presented. Comparison of modelled environmental variables at the location of S. squatina records for each Q identified reductions in depth and salinity, and increases in chlorophyll-a and SST when comparing Q2 or Q3 with Q1 or Q4. This shift may suggest S. squatina are making seasonal movements to shallow coastal waters in Q2 and Q3. This is supported by 23 anecdotal resources and may be driven by reproductive behaviour, as there were 85 records of S. squatina individuals <= 60 cm in the dataset, inferred as recently born or juvenile life-history stages. The results have helped fill significant evidence gaps identified in the Wales Angelshark Action Plan and immediate next research steps are suggested.

AB  - This study provides empirical assessments of the magnitude of human pressures on forest habitat in Jamaica's Hellshire Hills. The Hellshire Hills represents an outstanding example of the Caribbean region's dry limestone forests. Approximately 160 km(2) in area, the Hellshire Hills is home to a unique and rich biodiversity, including the critically endangered Jamaican Iguana (Cylcura collei). The area's biodiversity is under increasing threat from deforestation from subsistence driven encroachment. Using deforestation as a spatial indicator of habitat loss, the study derives satellite based estimates of the rate of habitat destruction within and immediately outside the area. The underlying human driving forces in this destruction are analyzed in a regression analysis of key socio-economic indicators that adusts for these locational differences. Results suggest that immiserating pressures on species habitat, particularly outside the area, are greater than anywhere else on the island. Simulations of species loss and edge-induced disturbances to species habitat also indicate that the potential impacts of forest conversion may be substantial and extend well beyond the area's boundaries. Together, the study's results highlight the intrinsic vulnerablity of the Hellshire Hills to outside disturbance. In particular, they raise doubts about the potential of the area (which has been accorded protected status within the recently established Portland Bight Protected Area) to provide for the long-term preservation and viability of the area's species. It is concluded that appropriate reserve design and species protection will require the collection of detailed empirical data on species diversity, numbers, habitat requirements, and spatial distribution. However, before this information can be collected priorities for biodiversity conservation must be set. Costs and benefits of conversation must also be assessed within the overall context of an integrated rural development plan for the area.

AB  - Predictive models are frequently used to define the most suitable areas for species protection or reintroduction. Land-cover variables can be used in different ways for distribution modelling. The surface area of a set of land-cover classes is often used, each land-cover presence/absence or the distance to them from any point of the study area can be preferred; multiple types of landcover variables may be combined to produce a single model. This paper assesses whether different approaches to using land-cover variables may lead to different ecological conclusions when interpreted for conservation by focusing on the distribution of the salamader Salamandra salamandra longirostris, an endangered amphibian subspecies in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Twenty-eight land-cover classes and another 42 environmental variables were used to construct four different models. Three models used a unique type of land-cover variable: either the presence of each class, the surface area of each class or the distance to each class, with all three variable types jointly entered in a fourth model. All models attained acceptable scores according to some criteria (discrimination, descriptive and predictive capacities, classification accuracy and parsimony); however most of the assessment parameters computed indicated a better performance of the models using either the surface area of land classes or the distance to them from every sampled square, compared to the model using class presences. The best scores were obtained with the fourth model, which combined different types of land-cover variables. This model suggested that oak forest fragmentation in favour of herbaceous crops and pastures may have negative effects on the distribution of S. s. longirostris. This was only partially suggested by the first three models, which considered a single type of land-cover variable, demonstrating the importance of considering a multi-variable analysis for conservation planning.

AB  - Tigers are globally threatened and their conservation relies on intact habitat that supports key large prey. The Churia habitat is relatively unknown even though it occupies a significant portion of the forested landscape of the Terai Arc, which stretches over 1000 km in a narrow band across Nepal and India, parallel to the Himalayas. To address this lack of detailed information relevant to tiger conservation, we used sign surveys to estimate occupancy probability for 5 focal prey species of tigers (gaur, sambar, chital, wild pig, and barking deer), and assess tiger habitat use within 537 km(2) of the understudied Churia habitat in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal. Multi-season occupancy models allowed us to make seasonal (winter vs. summer) inferences regarding changes in occupancy or habitat use based on covariates influencing occupancy and detection. We found that sambar had the largest spatial distribution occupying 431-437 km(2), while chital had the smallest at 100-158 km(2) across both seasons. The gaur population showed the most seasonal variation occupying from 413 to 318 km(2), suggesting their migration out of the Churia in summer and moving in during winter. Wild pigs showed the opposite trend occupying from 444 to 383 km(2); suggesting moving into Churia in summer and out in winter. Barking deer were widespread in both seasons (329-349 km(2)). Tiger habitat use (psi(SE)) was higher in winter 0.63 (0.11) than in summer 0.54 (0.21), but confidence intervals overlapped and area used was similar across seasons, 337 km(2) (winter) to 291 km(2) (summer). Available habitat, distribution of water sources, and human disturbance were the most common variables influencing spatial distribution of prey and habitat use of tigers at different spatial scales. Overall, we found high prey occupancy and tiger habitat use, suggesting the Churia is valuable habitat for ungulates and tigers. Given that this habitat accounts for 639 km(2) within CNP and 7642 km(2) across the entire Terai Arc, the Churia should no longer be neglected in global tiger conservation planning.

AB  - Biodiversity is being lost at an increased rate as a result of human activities. One of the major threats to biodiversity is infrastructural development. We used meta-analyses to study the effects of infrastructure proximity on mammal and bird populations. Data were gathered from 49 studies on 234 mammal and bird species. The main response by mammals and birds in the vicinity of infrastructure was either avoidance or a reduced population density. The mean species abundance, relative to non-disturbed distances (MSA), was used as the effect size measure. The impact of infrastructure distance on MSA was studied using meta-analyses. Possible sources of heterogeneity in the results of the meta-analysis were explored with meta-regression.
   Mammal and bird population densities declined with their proximity to infrastructure. The effect of infrastructure on bird populations extended over distances up to about 1 km, and for mammal populations up to about 5 km. Mammals and birds seemed to avoid infrastructure in open areas over larger distances compared to forested areas, which could be related to the reduced visibility of the infrastructure in forested areas. We did not find a significant effect of traffic intensity on the MSA of birds. Species varied in their response to infrastructure. Raptors were found to be more abundant in the proximity of infrastructure whereas other bird taxa tended to avoid it. Abundances were affected at variable distances from infrastructure: within a few meters for small-sized mammals and up to several hundred meters for large-sized mammals.
   Our findings show the importance of minimizing infrastructure development for wildlife conservation in relatively undisturbed areas. By combining actual species distributions with the effect distance functions we developed, regions sensitive to infrastructure development may be identified. Additionally, the effect distance functions can be used in models in support of decision making on infrastructure planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The exotic Sonneratia apetala is widely planted in mangrove afforestation in China due to its high adaptability and fast growth rates. This species has triggered intense debate on its ecological invasion risk during the past decades because of its natural reproduction, dispersal, and spread. However, national plans for the management and control of this exotic species are unclear, partly due to the lack of an accurate distribution map of the species for broad latitudinal areas. Mangrove species with subtle spectral differences and varied growth phases require plenty of samples to describe their spectrum; however, the scarcity of samples resulting from the low accessibility of their habitats hinders the mapping of the species across the national coastal zone. To overcome this problem, we derived S. apetala samples from existing discrete localized studies and then iteratively optimized the trained binary model by incorporating new negative samples until a threshold converged. Negative samples were more easily acquired in areas where the absence of S. apetala had been confirmed. This approach avoids the prereq-uisite that S. apetala can be distinguished by visual inspections, which is commonly used in routine classification procedures or active learning classifiers. The approach was applied to derive classification results with the help of a Random Forest classifier using both Sentinel-1 and-2 imagery hosted on Google Earth Engine, considering that S. apetala differs from native mangrove species in terms of the large crown, drooping branches, and biochemical properties. The generated S. apetala map was evaluated using three prepared datasets and achieved overall accuracies of 98.1 % and 96.4 % using the test dataset and independent evaluation dataset, respectively, as well as an accuracy of 91.7 % using 145 field samples provided by mangrove specialists. The total area of exotic S. apetala in China reached 2,968 ha in 2020, accounting for 11.0 % of the total mangrove area in China. This study is the first attempt to delineate the detailed national-scale distribution of S. apetala in coastal China. The information provided in this study can support the management and control of S. apetala. The developed approach can be generalized to other vegetation species in broad latitudinal areas, and can be further improved by probing the internal details of the trained classifier.

AB  - Aim To assess the range size patterns of ferns and lycophytes along elevational gradients at different latitudes in an ecographical transition zone and search for predictors of range size from a set of environmental factors.
   Location Mexico, from 15 degrees to 23 degrees N.
   Taxon Ferns and lycophytes.
   Methods All terrestrial and epiphytic species were recorded in 658 plots of 400 m(2) along eight elevational gradients. To test whether the range size within assemblages increases with elevation and latitude, we calculated the latitudinal range using the northern and southern limits of each species and averaged the latitudinal range of all species within assemblages weighted by their abundances. We related climatic factors and the changes with latitude and elevation with range size using linear mixed-effects models.
   Results Species richness per plot increased with elevation up to about 1,500-2,000 m, with strong differences in overall species richness between transects and a reduction with increasing latitude. The mean weighted range size of species within assemblages declined with elevation, and increased with latitude, as predicted by theory. However, we also found marked differences between the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of Mexico, as well as low range size in humid regions. The best models described about 76%-80% of the variability in range size and included the seasonality in both temperature and precipitation, and annual cloud cover.
   Main conclusion Latitudinal and elevational patterns of range size in fern assemblages are driven by an interplay of factors favouring wide-ranging species (higher latitudes with increasing temperature seasonality; dryer habitat conditions) and those favouring species with restricted ranges (higher elevations; humid habitat conditions), with additional variation introduced by the specific conditions of individual mountain ranges. Climatically stable, humid habitats apparently provide favourable conditions for small-ranged fern species, and should accordingly be given high priority in regional conservation planning.

AB  - Fire has historically been an important ecological factor maintaining southeastern U. S. vegetation. Humans have altered natural fire regimes by fragmenting fuels, introducing exotic species, and suppressing fires. Little is known about how these alterations specifically affect spatial fire extent and pattern. We applied historic (1920 and 1943) and current (1990) GIS fuels maps and the FARSITE fire spread model to quantify the differences between historic and current fire spread distributions. We held all fire modeling variables (wind speed and direction, cloud cover, precipitation, humidity, air temperature, fuel moistures, ignition source and location) constant with exception of the fuel models representing different time periods. Model simulations suggest that fires during the early 1900's burned freely across the landscape, while current fires are much smaller, restricted by anthropogenic influences. Fire extent declined linearly with patch density, and there was a quadratic relationship between fire extent and percent landscape covered by anthropogenic features. We found that as little as 10 percent anthropogenic landcover caused a 50 percent decline in fire extent. Most landscapes (conservation or non-conservation areas) are now influenced by anthropogenic features which disrupt spatial fire behavior disproportionately to their actual size. These results suggest that land managers using fire to restore or maintain natural ecosystem function in pyrogenic systems will have to compensate for anthropogenic influences in their burn planning.

AB  - Monitoring programs should be based on the measurement of two main pillars for evaluating the conservation status of a species: population size and geographical distribution. To date, the only way reported in the literature to obtain detailed information on L. cervus population size is to use the capture-mark-recapture method. This is an expensive and time-consuming technique that implies physical capture and handling of individuals, which could affect their survival. Therefore, in this study we tested and compared two non-invasive sampling approaches, namely evening walk transects and diurnal tree trunk surveys, to derive accurate abundance estimates by means of N-mixture models in a Bayesian framework. In our study, both methods showed relatively high detection probability (>= 56%). However, tree surveys performed better than walk transects (approximate to 80%), especially with the progression of the sampling season. Tree surveys proved to be more effective than walk transects in providing data for an accurate population density estimate (much smaller 95% Bayesian Confidence Intervals). In light of a cost and benefit assessment, the tree survey is undoubtedly more convenient, as well as more effective, as it is more time consuming but less expensive than a walk transect (one operator for 2-3 h vs. two operators for 30 min each). Moreover, it needs fewer expert operators because of the greater proximity to the species, increasing the probability of correctly identifying it, i.e., reducing type I error (false positive or overestimation of counts). For the first time, we applied N-mixture models for estimating population abundance of L. cervus. Overcoming all the limits imposed by the use of the capture-mark-recapture method, in this study we performed a further step forward in the planning of monitoring aimed at the conservation of L. cervus and the evaluation of its demographic trend.

AB  - With the historical and continued fragmentation of Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris) forests, an increasing need emerges to identify remaining Black Pine Snake, Pituophis melanoleucus lodingi, populations and understand species environment correlations so that conservation efforts for this taxon are properly directed and appropriate. This study had three main objectives: (1) to use radiotelemetry data in conjunction with GIS modeling to assess multiple scale resource selection for P. in. lodingi; (2) to use occurrence data to validate our habitat suitability model; and (3) to quantify microhabitat characteristics of P. in. lodingi locality records and evaluate differences in land cover between historical and recent records. At the landscape scale, P. m. lodingi selected evergreen forests in upland areas lacking cultivated crops, pasture and hay fields, developed areas, and roads. Within home ranges, P. in. lodingi were found closer to scrub/shrub habitat and open areas than expected. Our Boolean model reduced the area deemed suitable for P. in. lodingi by 84.3%, while accurately categorizing 75% of recent P. m. lodingi occurrences, demonstrating the potential for robust model development despite small sample sizes. We found significant habitat differences between recent and historical P. in. lodingi locality records, which corroborated the findings of our Boolean model. Recent sites of occurrence were, on average, 597 in from areas with a model score of "optimal," whereas sites with no recent records were, on average, 1582 in from areas with an optimal score. Recent sites were characterized by significantly less canopy cover, less basal area, less midstory cover, greater percentages of grass, bare soil, and forbs in the ground cover, less shrubs and litter in the ground cover, and a more recent buns history than sites with no recent records. Areas containing historical P. In. lodingi populations are simultaneously becoming unsuitable at both the landscape and microhabitat scales. Our Boolean modeling approach represents a cost-effective way to plan for informed management actions for snake taxa of conservation concern.

AB  - Understanding patterns of habitat selection across a species' geographic distribution can be critical for adequately managing populations and planning for habitat loss and related threats. However, studies of habitat selection can be time consuming and expensive over broad spatial scales, and a lack of standardized monitoring targets or methods can impede the generalization of site-based studies. Our objective was to collaborate with natural resource managers to define available nesting habitat for piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) throughout their U.S. Atlantic coast distribution from Maine to North Carolina, with a goal of providing science that could inform habitat management in response to sea-level rise. We characterized a data collection and analysis approach as being effective if it provided low-cost collection of standardized habitat-selection data across the species' breeding range within 1-2 nesting seasons and accurate nesting location predictions. In the method developed, >30 managers and conservation practitioners from government agencies and private organizations used a smartphone application, iPlover, to collect data on landcover characteristics at piping plover nest locations and random points on 83 beaches and barrier islands in 2014 and 2015. We analyzed these data with a Bayesian network that predicted the probability a specific combination of landcover variables would be associated with a nesting site. Although we focused on a shorebird, our approach can be modified for other taxa. Results showed that the Bayesian network performed well in predicting habitat availability and confirmed predicted habitat preferences across the Atlantic coast breeding range of the piping plover. We used the Bayesian network to map areas with a high probability of containing nesting habitat on the Rockaway Peninsula in New York, USA, as an example application. Our approach facilitated the collation of evidence-based information on habitat selection from many locations and sources, which can be used in management and decision-making applications.

AB  - Earth-observing satellites are a major research tool for spatially explicit ecosystem nowcasting and forecasting. However, there are practical challenges when integrating satellite data into usable real-time products for stakeholders. The need of forecast immediacy and accuracy means that forecast systems must account for missing data and data latency while delivering a timely, accurate, and actionable product to stakeholders. This is especially true for species that have legal protection. Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus (Atlantic sturgeon) were listed under the United States Endangered Species Act in 2012, which triggered immediate management action to foster population recovery and increase conservation measures. Building upon an existing research occurrence model, we developed an Atlantic sturgeon forecast system in the Delaware Bay, USA. To overcome missing satellite data due to clouds and produce a 3-d forecast of ocean conditions, we implemented data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) on daily observed satellite data. We applied the Atlantic sturgeon research model to the DINEOF output and found that it correctly predicted Atlantic sturgeon telemetry occurrences over 90% of the time within a 3-d forecast. A similar framework has been utilized to forecast harmful algal blooms, but to our knowledge, this is the first time a species distribution model has been applied to DINEOF gap-filled data to produce a forecast product for fishes. To implement this product into an applied management setting, we worked with state and federal organizations to develop real-time and forecasted risk maps in the Delaware River Estuary for both state-level managers and commercial fishers. An automated system creates and distributes these risk maps to subscribers' mobile devices, highlighting areas that should be avoided to reduce interactions. Additionally, an interactive web interface allows users to plot historic, current, future, and climatological risk maps as well as the underlying model output of Atlantic sturgeon occurrence. The mobile system and web tool provide both stakeholders and managers real-time access to estimated occurrences of Atlantic sturgeon, enabling conservation planning and informing fisher behavior to reduce interactions with this endangered species while minimizing impacts to fisheries and other projects.

AB  - Between 2001 and 2009, 26 marine-protected areas (MPA) were established on the east Australian seaboard, at least in part, to manage human interactions with a critically endangered population of grey nurse shark, Carcharias taurus. This network is spread across six MPA systems and includes all 19 sites outlined in the National Recovery Plan for C. taurus, though five sites remain open to some forms of fishing. The reserve network has complex cross-jurisdictional management, as the sharks occur in waters controlled by the Australian states of New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland, as well as by the Commonwealth (Federal) government. Jurisdiction is further complicated by fisheries and conservation departments both engaging in management activities within each state. This has resulted in protected area types that include IUCN category II equivalent zones in NSW, Queensland, and Commonwealth marine parks that either overlay or complement another large scaled network of protected sites called critical habitats. Across the network, seven and eight rule permutations for diving and fishing, respectively, are applied to this population of sharks. Besides sites identified by the recovery plan, additional sites have been protected as part of the general development of MPA networks. A case study at one of these sites, which historically was known to be occupied by C. taurus but had been abandoned, appears to shows re-establishment of an aggregation of juvenile and sub-adult sharks. Concurrent with the re-establishment of the aggregation, a local dive operator increased seasonal dive visitation rates at the site fourfold. As a precautionary measure, protection of abandoned sites, which includes nursery and gestating female habitats are options that may assist recovery of the east coast population of C. taurus.

AB  - Habitat destruction and overhunting are two major drivers of mammal population declines and extinctions in tropical forests. The construction of roads can be a catalyst for these two threats. In Southeast Asia, the impacts of roads on mammals have not been well-documented at a regional scale. Before evidence-based conservation strategies can be developed to minimize the threat of roads to endangered mammals within this region, we first need to locate where and how roads are contributing to the conversion of their habitats and illegal hunting in each country. We interviewed 36 experts involved in mammal research from seven Southeast Asian countries to identify roads that are contributing the most, in their opinion, to habitat conversion and illegal hunting. Our experts highlighted 16 existing and eight planned roads - these potentially threaten 21% of the 117 endangered terrestrial mammals in those countries. Apart from gathering qualitative evidence from the literature to assess their claims, we demonstrate how species-distribution models, satellite imagery and animal-sign surveys can be used to provide quantitative evidence of roads causing impacts by (1) cutting through habitats where endangered mammals are likely to occur, (2) intensifying forest conversion, and (3) contributing to illegal hunting and wildlife trade. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to identify specific roads threatening endangered mammals in Southeast Asia. Further through highlighting the impacts of roads, we propose 10 measures to limit road impacts in the region.

AB  - An alteration in the hydrological connectivity reduces the synergistic processes and interactions between rivers and their floodplains, and changes the distribution of waterbirds that rely on floodplains as foraging grounds. Recent river and wetland conservation and restoration efforts have been partially focused on reinstating the natural river-floodplain connectivity to ameliorate the ecological effects of regulation in river systems. However, in regions where human well-being is tightly linked with the cultivation of the floodplain (such as fisheries), management options are constrained and trade-offs among competing social, economic and ecological goals may be necessary for the wise use of wetlands. Poyang Lake in east central China includes numerous sub-lakes with different types of hydrological regulation; therefore, this lake may provide a useful context for exploring the likelihood of such trade-offs. In this study, we used multiyear simultaneous waterbird survey data together with habitat maps derived from satellite imagery for Poyang Lake to examine-the variations in waterbird community structure and abundance within sub-lakes with different types of hydrological regulation. Using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, we built generalized linear mixed models to explore the differences in wetland composition and waterbird abundance/diversity among three lake types (i.e. isolated, freely connected, and controlled) at community, guild and species levels.. The results showed hydrological connectivity alteration clearly affects wintering waterbirds; in addition, the ecological benefits of a natural flow regime were most unambiguous at the community level. Nevertheless, little evidence exists to indicate that the lakes' ecological values as waterbird foraging grounds were compromised by partial regulation. That is, species richness and population size were comparable in naturally connected and controlled lakes. Our results suggest that, with carefully designed management plans, a delicate balance between waterbird conservation and development can be accomplished in large river floodplains.

AB  - Aim To create a fine-scale map of the distribution of Asiatic black bears, identify landscape variables affecting the spatial range of this species and assess population trends using presence-absence data and opinions of local villagers.
   Location Sichuan Province, south-western China.
   Methods We divided the province into 15 x 15 km cells, stratified them by forest cover, elevation and road density and randomly selected 494 cells (21% of province) for surveys. In each cell, we interviewed villagers and ground-verified their reports of bear presence. We ground-truthed reports of bear absence by conducting transects for bear sign in the best available habitat. We used logistic regression to identify key variables affecting presence of bears and predict their occurrence in unsampled cells.
   Results We detected bears in 360 cells (73%). Models correctly predicted bear occurrence in 90.3% of cells where we detected bears and 84.5% of sampled cells where bears were absent. Models predicted 42.7% of Sichuan to be occupied by bears. Bear occurrence was strongly related to forest cover throughout the province. Roads had a negative effect in western region of province. Agricultural lands had a negative effect only when they were distant from forests. Villagers were accurate in their knowledge of bear presence or absence. Interviewed villagers (n = 1816) thought that bears were increasing in 32%, stable in 10%, and decreasing in 58% of cells with bears. Where bear populations were perceived to be declining, villagers identified poaching as the most common cause.
   Main conclusions Our fine-scale distribution map can be used for future monitoring and the key landscape factors related to occupancy by bears can be used in management plans for this species. Interviewing local villagers is an efficient and reliable means of assessing distribution, and changes therein, for animals such as bears that often interact with people and leave obvious signs.

AB  - Hydrothermal vent fields in the western Pacific Ocean are mostly distributed along spreading centers in submarine basins behind convergent plate boundaries. Larval dispersal resulting from deep-ocean circulations is one of the major factors influencing gene flow, diversity, and distributions of vent animals. By combining a biophysical model and deep-profiling float experiments, we quantify potential larval dispersal of vent species via ocean circulation in the western Pacific Ocean. We demonstrate that vent fields within backarc basins could be well connected without particular directionality, whereas basin-to-basin dispersal is expected to occur infrequently, once in tens to hundreds of thousands of years, with clear dispersal barriers and directionality associated with ocean currents. The southwest Pacific vent complex, spanning more than 4,000 km, may be connected by the South Equatorial Current for species with a longer-than-average larval development time. Depending on larval dispersal depth, a strong western boundary current, the Kuroshio Current, could bridge vent fields from the Okinawa Trough to the Izu-Bonin Arc, which are 1,200 km apart. Outcomes of this study should help marine ecologists estimate gene flow among vent populations and design optimal marine conservation plans to protect one of the most unusual ecosystems on Earth.

AB  - The department of Antioquia, Colombia, lies in the northwestern corner of South America and provides a biogeographical link among divergent faunas, including Caribbean, Andean, Pacific and Amazonian. Information about the distribution of biodiversity in this area is of relevance for academic, practical and social purposes. This data paper describes the dataset containing all bird specimens deposited in the Coleccion de Ciencias Naturales del Museo Universitario de la Universidad de Antioquia (MUA). We curated all the information associated with the bird specimens, including the georeferences and taxonomy, and published the database through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility network. During this process we checked the species identification and existing georeferences and completed the information when possible. The collection holds 663 bird specimens collected between 1940 and 2011. Even though most specimens are from Antioquia (70%), the collection includes material from several other departments and one specimen from the United States. The collection holds specimens from three endemic and endangered species (Coeligena orina, Diglossa gloriossisima, and Hypopirrhus pyrohipogaster), and includes localities poorly represented in other collections. The information contained in the collection has been used for biodiversity modeling, conservation planning and management, and we expect to further facilitate these activities by making it publicly available.

AB  - Introduction: Migration of people from rural environments to cities has accelerated urbanization and modified the landscape as well as the ecological processes and communities in these areas. The Costa Rican endemic Cabanis's Ground-Sparrow (Melozone cabanisi) is a species of limited distribution restricted to the "Gran Area Metropolitana", which is the biggest urban settlement of the country. This area has experimented and still experiment an ongoing fragmentation and loss of habitat used by this species (coffee plantations, shrubs, and thickets). Objective: To determine the effects of urbanization on habitat abundance and spatial pattern for the occurrence of Melozone cabanisi. Methods: We modeled the area of potentially suitable habitat for this species in Costa Rica using occurrence and bioclimatic data. Then, we estimated the actual suitable habitat using land cover type layers. Finally, we analyzed the connectivity among the actual suitable habitat patches using single-patch and multi-patch approaches. Results: From the area of potentially suitable habitat estimated by the bioclimatic model, 74 % were urban areas that are unsuitable for Melozone cabanisi. The largest suitable patches within urban areas were coffee plantations; which also were crucial for maintaining connectivity between habitat patches along the species' range. Conclusions: To preserve and protect the Melozone cabanisi, these areas must be taken into consideration by decision-makers in the present and future management plans. We recommend avoiding change shrubs and thickets to urban cover to preserve the occurrence of Melozone cabanisi, and implement a program for the payment of environmental services to landholders, supported by the local governments, to protect those habitats in urban contexts.

AB  - Individual and population-specific patterns of growth, and variations in these patterns, can be determined if the age of individuals is known; this allows the dynamics of populations to be more accurately modelled and projected into the future and provides a better understanding of the life history. Besides contributing to our understanding of the fundamental ecological issue of limitation of distribution and abundance, such knowledge is critical to management or conservation plans for many species. Skeletochronology, the reading of growth layers in bony structures, has been used extensively to determine the age of individual fish and, to a lesser extent, of reptiles and amphibians. This study evaluates the use of skeletochronology to determine the age of garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.). with emphasis on the development of techniques that allow the sampling of bone structures from live animals. Layers were observed in the caudal vertebrae of two species of garter snakes, using standard histological techniques, and were consistent in number within individual snakes, with some variability. The validity of growth layers as an indicator of age was established using snakes raised in the laboratory under differing hibernation regimes. Skeletochronology has the potential to be an important sind useful technique for the study Of age in snakes, but is very labour-intensive and is best used as part of a large, long-term project.

AB  - Graph-based analysis is a promising approach for analyzing the functional and structural connectivity of landscapes. In human-shaped landscapes, species have become vulnerable to land degradation and connectivity loss between habitat patches. Movement across the landscape is a key process for species survival that needs to be further investigated for heterogeneous human-dominated landscapes. The common frog (Rana temporaria) was used as a case study to explore and provide a graph connectivity analysis framework that integrates habitat suitability and dispersal responses to landscape permeability. The main habitat patches influencing habitat availability and connectivity were highlighted by using the software Conefor Sensinode 2.2. One of the main advantages of the presented graph-theoretical approach is its ability to provide a large choice of variables to be used based on the study's assumptions and knowledge about target species. Based on dispersal simulation modelling in potential suitable habitat corridors, three distinct patterns of nodes connections of differing importance were revealed. These patterns are locally influenced by anthropogenic barriers, landscape permeability, and habitat suitability. And they are affected by different suitability and availability gradients to maximize the best possible settlement by the common frog within a terrestrial habitat continuum. The study determined the key role of landscape-based approaches for identifying the "availability-suitability-connectivity" patterns from a local to regional approach to provide an operational tool for landscape planning.

AB  - The Craugastor rugulosus species series has been one of the most affected clades by the decline of amphibian populations in Mesoamerica. These stream-dwelling frogs are threatened at all altitudinal ranges throughout their distribution. Craugastor ranoides is categorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to the disappearance of populations in the highlands and lowlands of Costa Rica. Currently the species is only found on the Santa Elena Peninsula. Additional ecological and natural history studies are necessary to formulate conservation plans for this species, which should include captive breeding programs and continuous monitoring of wild populations. We conducted a study of density, habitat use, and morphometrics of C. ranoides in three streams on the Santa Elena Peninsula Guanacaste, Costa Rica, during two consecutive dry seasons. The density of adult frogs and the probabilities of detection were similar during both dry seasons but we found differences in both parameters between streams. Counts of juveniles and subadults differed between seasons and between streams. Stream sector (50-m length) occupancy was approximately 80% during both dry seasons. We found most frogs motionless on boulders, but juveniles also frequented leaf litter. Sexual dimorphism was found in snout-vent length, mass, and tympanum diameter in subadults and adults. This study establishes a baseline for further monitoring of wild populations. Additional research and monitoring are necessary to detect possible changes in abundance and potential decline of these populations, which might be the only ones remaining in Costa Rica.

AB  - Similar species may co-occur in sympatry because of the partitioning of habitat use and resources at different spatial and temporal scales. Understanding co-occurrence patterns of species may assist in explaining patterns of habitat selection, which is important when planning conservation actions for threatened species. Little is known about the ecological preferences of Asian hill partridges, especially where multiple species co-occur. We quantitatively tested how topography and forest type affect the presence of two sympatric hill partridge species, the orange-necked partridge (Arborophila davidi) and green-legged partridge (Tropicoperdix chloropus) in forested habitats in southern Vietnam, and tested the strength of their co-occurrence at the landscape level. We surveyed the occurrence of both species using line transects. We used Poisson regression and probabilistic models to investigate the habitat requirements of both species and co-occurrence patterns. Our habitat-use models indicate that both species use shallow slopes and mosaic forest, while they tend to avoid steep slopes and bamboo forest. The orange-necked partridge seems to be confined to higher elevations while green-legged partridge is distributed over a wider elevational range. This difference in elevational range seems to drive the differences in habitat use between the two species. The orange-necked partridge appears to be strongly associated with mosaic forest, and moderately associated with evergreen forest, but mostly avoided bamboo forest and was never detected in mixed deciduous forest. The green-legged partridge was able to use multiple forest types. The probabilistic models suggest that these two species do not show significant negative or positive co-occurrence when in sympatry. This is the first quantitative data regarding habitat preferences of these sympatric tropical hill partridges at a landscape scale; we presume that their co-occurrence may be maintained by the partitioning of ecological niches or resources at a finer scale. Further research is needed to identify factors controlling their co-occurrence and potential interactions at a micro-scale. An enhanced understanding of habitat preferences of these species will be beneficial for understanding finer scale distribution patterns between species in the genus Arborophila and Tropicoperdix, especially when multiple species occur in sympatry.

AB  - Trait-based approaches are an alternative to species-based approaches for functionally linking individual organisms with community structure and dynamics. In the trait-based approach, rather than focusing on the species identity of the organism, the focus is on the organism traits, which represent their physiological, morphological, or life-history characteristics. Although used in ecological research for several decades, this approach only emerged in ecological modelling about twenty years ago. We review this rise of trait-based models and trace the occasional transfer of trait based modelling concepts between terrestrial plant ecology, animal and microbial ecology, and aquatic ecology, discuss terminology of trait-based approaches and evaluate future implementation of trait-based models, including cross-discipline exchange. Trait-based models have a variety of purposes, such as predicting changes in community patterns under climate and land-use change, understand underlying mechanisms for community assemblies, planning and assessing conservation management, or studying invasion processes. In modelling, trait-based approaches can reduce technical challenges such as computational limitations, scaling problems, and data scarcity. However, we note inconsistencies in the current usage of terms in trait-based approaches and these inconsistencies must be resolved if trait based concepts are to be easily exchanged between disciplines. Specifically, future trait-based models may further benefit from incorporating intraspecific trait variability and addressing more complex species interactions. We also recommend expanding the combination of trait-based approaches with individual-based modelling to simplify the parameterization of models, to capture plant-plant interactions at the individual level, and to explain community dynamics under global change.

AB  - Although sea ice loss is the primary threat to polar bears (Ursus maritimus), little can be done to mitigate its effects without global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other factors, however, could exacerbate the impacts of sea ice loss on polar bears, such as exposure to increased industrial activity. The Arctic Ocean has enormous oil and gas potential, and its development is expected to increase in the coming decades. Estimates of polar bear resource selection will inform managers how bears use areas slated for oil development and to help guide conservation planning. We estimated temporally-varying resource selection patterns for non-denning adult female polar bears in the Chukchi Sea population (20082012) at two scales (i.e., home range and weekly steps) to identify factors predictive of polar bear use throughout the year, before any offshore development. From the best models at each scale, we estimated scale-integrated resource selection functions to predict polar bear space use across the population's range and determined when bears were most likely to use the region where offshore oil and gas development in the United States is slated to occur. Polar bears exhibited significant intra-annual variation in selection patterns at both scales but the strength and annual patterns of selection differed between scales for most variables. Bears were most likely to use the offshore oil and gas planning area during ice retreat and growth with the highest predicted use occurring in the southern portion of the planning area. The average proportion of predicted high-value habitat in the planning area was >15% of the total high-value habitat for the population during sea ice retreat and growth and reached a high of 50% during November 2010. Our results provide a baseline on which to judge future changes to non-denning adult female polar bear resource selection in the Chukchi Sea and help guide offshore development in the region. Lastly, our study provides a framework for assessing potential impacts of offshore oil and gas development to other polar bear populations around the Arctic.

AB  - More than half of turtle species worldwide are threatened because of habitat loss, invasive species, environmental pollution, disease, unsustainable use, and global climate change. However, some turtles are capable of existing in highly modified habitats, including structures designed to benefit human populations such as reservoirs and canal systems. Examining turtle distributions in large canal systems can inform conservation plans protecting turtle populations within a potential reservoir network and expand our understanding of underlying mechanisms regulating populations. We conducted spatial capture-recapture on turtles inhabiting sections of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. We developed a Bayesian spatial capture-recapture model to estimate densities, sex ratios, and associated capture probability parameters for Chrysemys picta (Painted Turtle), Chelydra serpentina (Common Snapping Turtle), Sternotherus odoratus (Eastern Musk Turtle), and Pseudemys rubriventris (Red-Bellied Turtle) captured at 12 sites along 28 km of the canal. We examined the impact of canal depth and forest cover on population densities and the variation in capture probability between sites and sampling days. We found population densities to vary between sites and the associated sex ratios to vary between species, as did the effect of depth and forest cover. Overall capture rates decreased each day, but there was trap-happy behavior from all species except S. odoratus. Our information can set a baseline for understanding turtle populations and inform management in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. It is also one of the first studies to establish methods for using new spatial capture-recapture to quantify densities and aquatic space use of turtles.

AB  - Farmland birds have declined in large areas of western and northern Europe. This decline has been connected with changes in the agricultural landscape. We studied the effects of landscape composition on birds in a boreal agricultural-forest mosaic in SW Finland. This study was carried out with a grid-based approach: bird pairs were counted in 105 grid squares of 25 ha within an area of 26.25 km(2). The total density of farmland birds and density of red-listed species were related to the land cover variables using generalized linear modelling (GLM). Farmland birds consist of a variable group of species either breeding or feeding in agricultural land. The model explained a moderate proportion (49%) of the variation in the total density of farmland birds in the landscape. In a regression analysis cover of non-arable agricultural land (semi-natural grasslands, built-up areas) explained a much higher proportion (r(2)=0.49) of the variation in farmland bird density than that of arable land (cultivated fields and set-aside fields, r(2)=0.04). Semi-natural grasslands, which have drastically declined throughout NW Europe, and built-up areas (mainly farmyards) had the most significant positive effects on the density of red-listed species. The results emphasize the significance of semi-natural grasslands for the declining red-listed farmland bird species. Birds are usually not restricted to certain patches of habitat but use several patches in their home range. Thus, when studying bird-landscape relations for land use planning, we also recommend grid-based approaches covering the whole landscape variation.

AB  - 1. Anthropogenic structures are mainly known to have negative impacts on wildlife populations but they can be beneficial. Power lines are a main driver of bird mortality through collision or electrocution, but electricity pylons are also commonly used for nest building by some species. Birds and nests cause power outages that need to be tackled by electricity companies. However, the use of pylons by threatened species provides an opportunity for conservation purposes.
   2. In this study, we describe an empirical modelling approach to predict the circumstances under which nesting birds use electricity pylons. We focused on white storks Ciconia ciconia, a species that has been increasingly using electricity pylons for nesting across Europe.
   3. In a country-level census in Portugal, we found a total of 1,348 white stork nests in 668 of the 8,680 very high-tension power line pylons occurring in the distribution range of this colonial species, with spatial clustering in pylon occupation up to a distance of 30 km. The number of nests in each used pylon ranged from 1 to 21 (M +/- SD=2.2 +/- 2.06).
   4. The main drivers of pylon use by nesting storks were distance to major feeding areas (rice fields, landfills and large wetlands), with more intensive use closer to these features, followed by land cover type surrounding each pylon. Pylon type and age, and stork population density in the region, had comparatively less importance.

AB  - So Paulo is the most developed state in Brazil and contains few fragments of native ecosystems, generally surrounded by intensive agriculture lands. Despite this, some areas still shelter large native animals. We aimed at understanding how medium and large carnivores use a mosaic landscape of forest/savanna and agroecosystems, and how the species respond to different landscape parameters (percentage of landcover and edge density), in a multi-scale perspective. The response variables were: species richness, carnivore frequency and frequency for the three most recorded species (Puma concolor, Chrysocyon brachyurus and Leopardus pardalis). We compared 11 competing models using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and assessed model support using weight of AIC. Concurrent models were combinations of landcover types (native vegetation, "cerrado" formations, "cerrado" and eucalypt plantation), landscape feature (percentage of landcover and edge density) and spatial scale. Herein, spatial scale refers to the radius around a sampling point defining a circular landscape. The scales analyzed were 250 (fine), 1,000 (medium) and 2,000 m (coarse). The shape of curves for response variables (linear, exponential and power) was also assessed. Our results indicate that species with high mobility, P. concolor and C. brachyurus, were best explained by edge density of the native vegetation at a coarse scale (2,000 m). The relationship between P. concolor and C. brachyurus frequency had a negative power-shaped response to explanatory variables. This general trend was also observed for species richness and carnivore frequency. Species richness and P. concolor frequency were also well explained by a second concurrent model: edge density of cerrado at the fine (250 m) scale. A different response was recorded for L. pardalis, as the frequency was best explained for the amount of cerrado at the fine (250 m) scale. The curve of response was linearly positive. The contrasting results (P. concolor and C. brachyurus vs L. pardalis) may be due to the much higher mobility of the two first species, in comparison with the third. Still, L. pardalis requires habitat with higher quality when compared with other two species. This study highlights the importance of considering multiple spatial scales when evaluating species responses to different habitats. An important and new finding was the prevalence of edge density over the habitat extension to explain overall carnivore distribution, a key information for planning and management of protected areas.

AB  - Under the EU Habitats Directive, cetacean species must be maintained at favourable conservation status in European waters. Whether this is achieved via protected area designation, curtailment of activities such as fishing or construction, or time restrictions on noise, it is dependent on understanding the temporal patterns in occurrence. Our ability to study this is often limited by the relatively short time-series of data available to researchers. This study uses nine years of passive acoustic monitoring data paired with environmental covariates to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of harbour porpoise and dolphin species using generalised estimating equations-generalised linear models (GEE-GLMs). This long-term time-series included periods of increased disturbance due to construction of an underwater gas pipeline in the area, enabling us to investigate the effect of construction on species occurrence. Harbour porpoise and dolphins occurred in every season, with detections peaking in winter. We found a negative association between dolphins and porpoises throughout the year. Inter-annual variation in occurrence was evident, with a cyclical bi-annual pattern highlighted for both species suggesting a complex pattern of movement. Construction activity had a significant negative effect on the presence of porpoise but not dolphins. However, no long-term decrease in detection rates of porpoise was recorded. This study highlights the importance of understanding what factors influence cetacean occurrence as well as the temporal scale of disturbance effects for planning and management of construction activities in coastal areas.

AB  - Ecological niche models (ENMs) are often used to predict species distribution patterns from datasets that describe abiotic and biotic factors at coarse spatial scales. Ground-truthing ENMs provide important information about how these factors relate to species-specific requirements at a scale that is biologically relevant for the species. Chimpanzees are territorial and have a predominantly frugivorous diet. The spatial and temporal variation in fruit availability for different chimpanzee populations is thus crucial, but rarely depicted in ENMs. The genetic and geographic distinction within Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) populations represents a unique opportunity to understand fine scale species-relevant ecological variation in relation to ENMs. In Cameroon, P.t.ellioti is composed of two genetically distinct populations that occupy different niches: rainforests in western Cameroon and forest-woodland-savanna mosaic (ecotone) in central Cameroon. We investigated habitat variation at three representative sites using chimpanzee-relevant environmental variables, including fruit availability, to assess how these variables distinguish these niches from one another. Contrary to the assumption of most ENM studies that intact forest is essential for the survival of chimpanzees, we hypothesized that the ecotone and human-modified habitats in Cameroon have sufficient resources to sustain large chimpanzee populations. Rainfall, and the diversity, density, and size of trees were higher at the rainforest. The ecotone had a higher density of terrestrial herbs and lianas. Fruit availability was higher at Ganga (ecotone) than at Bekob and Njuma. Seasonal variation in fruit availability was highest at Ganga, and periods of fruit scarcity were longer than at the rainforest sites. Introduced and secondary forest species linked with anthropogenic modification were common at Bekob, which reduced seasonality in fruit availability. Our findings highlight the value of incorporating fine scale species-relevant ecological data to create more realistic models, which have implications for local conservation planning efforts.

The development and implementation of better fire management practices and firefighting strategies are important steps to reduce the Amazon ecosystems' degradation and carbon emissions from land-use change in the region. We extended the application of the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) to model fire occurrence probability in the Brazilian Amazon on a monthly basis during the 2008 and 2010 fire seasons using fire detection data derived from satellite images. Predictor variables included climatic variables, inhabited and uninhabited protected areas and land-use change maps. Model fit was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) value (threshold-independent analysis), binomial tests and model sensitivity and specificity (threshold-dependent analysis). Both threshold-independent (AUC = 0.919 +/- 0.004) and threshold-dependent evaluation indicate satisfactory model performance. Pasture, annual deforestation and secondary vegetation are the most effective variables for predicting the distribution of the occurrence data. Our results show that MaxEnt may become an important tool to guide on-the-ground decisions on fire prevention actions and firefighting planning more effectively and thus to minimise forest degradation and carbon loss from forest fires in Amazonian ecosystems.

AB  - Monitoring the distribution and movements of a species following reintroduction can aid resource managers in assessing release-site fidelity, rates of spread, initial project success, and feasibility of (or need for) future releases. We used radio-telemetry to monitor an entire founding population of 70 elk (Cervus elaphus) during 16 months following their reintroduction to eastern Ontario, Canada. At the end of the study, elk were widely scattered over a 27,000 km2 area. Dispersal distances ranged from 2 to 142 km; 50% of animals moved > 40 km from the release site. Dispersal distances differed by time periods and age but not sex. Calves dispersed significantly shorter distances than adults and many mature elk were isolated during the rut. In contrast to a random distribution model, movements had a strongly southwestern directional bias, perhaps owing to prevailing winds from the same direction. Mortality during the study period was 27%; the primary causes of known mortalities were emaciation, collision with automobiles, and illegal shooting. During the first 11 / 2 years, lack of release-site fidelity and high dispersal coupled with animal-human conflicts and mortalities likely contributed to an initial lag in population growth. Resource managers planning animal reintroductions should consider using methodologies that enhance site fidelity following release.

AB  - Climate change impacts to ocean ecosystems are altering the distribution and abundance of fish populations and impacting the people whose health, well-being, and livelihoods depend on them. Thousands of published papers make it very clear that fish are on the move, alterations in productivity are occurring, and natural and human ecosystems are responding to climate variability and change. Across the globe, numerous high-level strategies have been developed to provide guidance for managing fisheries in the face of climate change, but specific examples of implementation and actionable decision making in real-world situations to address climate change impacts are generally lacking. Here we present a review of tangible actions that have been undertaken to reduce, mitigate, and confront climate change impacts to fisheries at a range of levels from individual choice to federal governance. Actions fall into seven general categories covering conservation of natural marine resources, emerging fisheries, reference points, future planning, integrated monitoring and management, and increasing adaptive capacity across all levels. We found that diverse fishery actors around the globe, including managers, scientists, and industry, are taking actions to address climate impacts, but given the scale of the problem there are relatively few intentional, well-documented examples of tactical responses.

AB  - AimWe examined three potential enhancements of the stable isotope technique for elucidating migratory connectivity in birds inhabiting poorly studied areas, illustrated for Eurasian cranes (Grus grus) that overwinter in and migrate through Israel. First, we examined the use of oxygen stable isotopes (O-18), seldom applied for this purpose. Second, we examined the relationship between ambient water O-18 and hydrogen stable isotope (H-2) values derived from various models, to determine the geographical origins of migrants. Third, we introduced the use of probabilistic distribution modelling to refine the assignment to origin of migrants lacking detailed distribution maps.
   LocationFeather samples were collected in the Hula Valley (northern Israel) and across the species breeding range in north Eurasia.
   MethodsWe analysed O-18 and H-2 in primary and secondary flight feathers using standard mass spectrometry. The maximum entropy (maxent) model was used to map the probability surface of potential breeding areas, as a Bayesian prior for assigning Hula Valley cranes to potential breeding grounds.
   ResultsWe found that O-18 was suitable and informative. The soil water isoscape performed better for O-18 while precipitation isoscape was preferable for H-2. The maxent-based probability surface largely refined assignments. Overall, most (>85%) cranes were assigned to the area west of the Ural Mountains, but for two individuals, most of the assigned area (>90%) was farther east, suggesting, for the first time, that Eurasian cranes may undertake the North Asia-Middle East (and perhaps Africa) migration flyway.
   Main conclusionsOur results call for broader use of O-18 in migratory connectivity studies and for application of probabilistic distribution modelling. We also encourage investigation of factors determining O-18 and H-2 integration into animal tissues. The proposed framework may help improve our understanding of migratory connectivity of species inhabiting previously unexplored areas and thus contribute to the development of efficient conservation plans.

AB  - Freshwater biodiversity is declining, despite national and international efforts to manage and protect freshwater ecosystems. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) has been proposed as an approach that could more efficiently and adaptively balance ecological and societal needs. However, this raises the question of how social and ecological objectives can be included in an integrated management plan. Here, we present a generic model-coupling framework tailored to address this question for freshwater ecosystems, using three components: biodiversity, ecosystem services (ESS), and a spatial prioritisation that aims to balance the spatial representation of biodiversity and ESS supply and demand. We illustrate this model-coupling approach within the Danube River Basin using the spatially explicit, potential distribution of (i) 85 fish species as a surrogate for biodiversity as modelled using hierarchical Bayesian models, and (ii) four estimated ESS layers produced by the Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) platform (with ESS supply defined as carbon storage and flood regulation, and demand specified as recreation and water use). These are then used for (iii) a joint spatial prioritisation of biodiversity and ESS employing Marxan with Zones, laying out the spatial representation of multiple management zones. Given the transboundary setting of the Danube River Basin, we also run comparative analyses including the country-level purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) and each country's percent cover of the total basin area as potential cost factors, illustrating a scheme for balancing the share of establishing specific zones among countries. We demonstrate how emphasizing various biodiversity or ESS targets in an EBM model-coupling framework can be used to cost-effectively test various spatially explicit management options across a multi-national case study. We further discuss possible limitations, future developments, and requirements for effectively managing a balance between biodiversity and ESS supply and demand in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - The distribution of harbour porpoises in EU waters is poorly understood, and modelled predictions of their distributions could inform the strategic spatial planning of future exploitation of the marine environment to avoid potential conflicts. We analysed satellite telemetry data from 39 harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena in inner Danish waters using a modelling tool rooted in maximum entropy: Maxent. Maxent does not require absence data and has been shown to be effective for data characterised by small sample size, sampling bias and locational errors. For each season we used an iterative bootstrapping procedure to randomly select among the most precise records from each of the 39 tagged individuals, and ran Maxent on pooled records based on explanatory environmental variables hypothesised to serve as good proxies for harbour porpoise prey abundance. Among our environmental variables, distance to coast and bottom salinity had the most explanatory power, and their response shapes were relatively consistent across most seasons. The predictive power of the models (assessed by ROC-AUC) ranged from 0.70 to 0.86 within seasons. The southern Kattegat, the Belt Seas, most western part of the Baltic Sea and the Sound were predicted to have relatively high probabilities of occurrence across seasons. In contrast, the central part of Kattegat and the Baltic Sea south and east of Limhamn and Darss Ridge consistently showed low probabilities of occurrence. Areas with the lowest probabilities of occurrence were generally characterised by high predictive uncertainty. Our methods have implications for the analyses of satellite tagged animals in terrestrial and marine environments. By coupling a bootstrapping procedure with Maxent we circumvented some of the statistical challenges presented by satellite telemetry data to generate spatial predictions within the inner Danish waters.

AB  - Commercial demand is the prerequisite for the expansion of rubber plantation, which is highly dependent on climate, topography, and soil factors. Without the contextual knowledge on these factors, the expansion of rubber plantation would remain unproductive. This study thereby aimed to evaluate the current and future suitable habitat distributions of rubber using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. A total of 148 field-based presence locations and environmental variables (soil, bioclimatic, topography, and land use) were used to predict the suitable areas of rubber plantations using HadGEM2-ES climate model. Medium and high climatic representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (4.5 and 8.5) were selected to predict the suitable habitats for the years 2050 and 2070. Among various factors, annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of warmest quarter, and soil exchangeable H(+)contributed significantly to the distribution of rubber. Currently, 1119 km(2)and 2716 km(2)were predicted as high and moderately suitable areas respectively. It is predicted with increase rates in the high suitable areas, 49.96% and 328.95% by 2050 and 2070 respectively under RCP 4.5. This result indicates that the medium climate change of RCP 4.5 may have a direct positive effect on the expansion of habitat suitability of rubber. We also found potential areas for rubber cultivation in Jinghong and Mengla townships, where the further expansion is anticipated with desirable land-use planning by conserving reserve forest and native vegetation.

AB  - Metapopulation dynamics are influenced by spatial parameters including the amount and arrangement of suitable habitat, yet these parameters may be uncertain when deciding how to manage species or their habitats. Sensitivity analyses of population viability analysis (PVA) models can help measure relative parameter influences on predictions, identify research priorities for reducing uncertainty, and evaluate management strategies. Few spatial PVAs, however, include sensitivity analyses of both spatial and nonspatial parameters, perhaps because computationally efficient tools for such analyses are lacking or inaccessible. We developed GRIP, a program to facilitate sensitivity analysis of spatial and nonspatial input parameters for PVAs created in RAMAS Metapop, a widely applied software program. GRIP creates random sets of input files by varying parameters specified in the PVA model including vital rates and their correlations among populations, the number and configuration of populations, dispersal rates, dispersal survival, initial population abundances, carrying capacities, and the probability, intensity, and spatial extent of catastrophes, while drawing on specified parameter distributions. We evaluated GRIP's performance as a tool for sensitivity analysis of spatial PVAs and explored the consequences of varying spatial input parameters for predictions of a published PVA model of the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis). We used GRIP output to generate standardized regression coefficients (SRCs) and nonparametric correlation coefficients as indices of the relative sensitivity of predicted conservation status to input parameters. GRIP performed well; with a single analysis we were able to rank the relative influence of input parameters identified as influential by the PVA's original author, S. A. Berglind, who used three separate forms of sensitivity analysis. Our analysis, however, also underscored the value of exploring the relative influence of spatial parameters on PVA predictions; both SRCs and correlation coefficients indicated that the most influential parameters in the sand lizard model were spatial in nature. We provide annotated code so that GRIP may be modified to reflect particular species biology, customized for more complex spatial PVA models, upgraded to incorporate features added in newer versions of RAMAS Metapop, used as a template to develop similar programs, or used as it is for computationally efficient sensitivity analyses in support of conservation planning.

AB  - 1. Seed dispersal by birds is central to the passive restoration of many tree communities. Reintroduction of extinct seed dispersers can therefore restore degraded forests and woodlands. To test this, we constructed a spatially explicit simulation model, parameterized with field data, to consider the effect of different seed dispersal scenarios on the extent of oak populations. We applied the model to two islands in California's Channel Islands National Park (USA), one of which has lost a key seed disperser.
   2. We used an ensemble modelling approach to simulate island scrub oak (Quercus pacifica) demography. The model was developed and trained to recreate known population changes over a 20-year period on 250-km(2) Santa Cruz Island, and incorporated acorn dispersal by island scrub-jays (Aphelocoma insularis), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and gravity, as well as seed predation. We applied the trained model to 215-km(2) Santa Rosa Island to examine how reintroducing island scrub-jays would affect the rate and pattern of oak population expansion. Oak habitat on Santa Rosa Island has been greatly reduced from its historical extent due to past grazing by introduced ungulates, the last of which were removed by 2011.
   3. Our simulation model predicts that a seed dispersal scenario including island scrub-jays would increase the extent of the island scrub oak population on Santa Rosa Island by 281% over 100 years, and by 544% over 200 years. Scenarios without jays would result in little expansion. Simulated long-distance seed dispersal by jays also facilitates establishment of discontinuous patches of oaks, and increases their elevational distribution.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Scenario planning provides powerful decision support for conservation managers. We used ensemble modelling of plant demographic and seed dispersal processes to investigate whether the reintroduction of seed dispersers could provide cost-effective means of achieving broader ecosystem restoration goals on California's second-largest island. The simulation model, extensively parameterized with field data, suggests that re-establishing the mutualism with seed-hoarding jays would accelerate the expansion of island scrub oak, which could benefit myriad species of conservation concern.

AB  - Poaching is driving many species toward extinction, and as a result, lowering poaching pressure is a conservation priority. This requires understanding where poaching pressure is high and which factors determine these spatial patterns. However, the cryptic and illegal nature of poaching makes this difficult. Ranger patrol data, typically recorded in protected area logbooks, contain information on patrolling efforts and poaching detection and should thus provide opportunities for a better understanding of poaching pressure. However, these data are seldom analyzed and rarely used to inform adaptive management strategies. We developed a novel approach to making use of analog logbook records to map poaching pressure and to test environmental criminology and predator-prey relationship hypotheses explaining poaching patterns. We showcase this approach for Golestan National Park in Iran, where poaching has substantially depleted ungulate populations. We digitized data from >4800 ranger patrols from 2014 to 2016 and used an occupancy modeling framework to relate poaching to (1) accessibility, (2) law enforcement, and (3) prey availability factors. Based on predicted poaching pressure and patrolling intensity, we provide suggestions for future patrol allocation strategies. Our results revealed a low probability (12%) of poacher detection during patrols. Poaching distribution was best explained by prey availability, indicating that poachers target areas with high concentrations of ungulates. Poaching pressure was estimated to be high (>0.49) in 39% of our study area. To alleviate poaching pressure, we recommend ramping up patrolling intensity in 12% of the national park, which could be achievable by reducing excess patrols in about 20% of the park. However, our results suggest that for 27% of the park, it is necessary to improve patrolling quality to increase detection probability of poaching, for example, by closing temporal patrolling gaps or expanding informant networks. Our approach illustrates that analog ranger logbooks are an untapped resource for evidence-based and adaptive planning of protected area management. Using this wealth of data can open up new avenues to better understand poaching and its determinants, to expand effectiveness assessments to the past, and, more generally, to allow for strategic conservation planning in protected areas.

AB  - Marine debris has been found in marine animals since the early 20th century, but little is known about the impacts of the ingestion of debris in large marine mammals. In this study we describe a case of mortality of a sperm whale related to the ingestion of large amounts of marine debris in the Mediterranean Sea (4th published case worldwide to our knowledge), and discuss it within the context of the spatial distribution of the species and the presence of anthropogenic activities in the area that could be the source of the plastic debris found inside the sperm whale. The spatial distribution modelled for the species in the region shows that these animals can be seen in two distinct areas: near the waters of Almeria, Granada and Murcia and in waters near the Strait of Gibraltar. The results shows how these animals feed in waters near an area completely flooded by the greenhouse industry, making them vulnerable to its waste products if adequate treatment of this industry's debris is not in place. Most types of these plastic materials have been found in the individual examined and cause of death was presumed to be gastric rupture following impaction with debris, which added to a previous problem of starvation. The problem of plastics arising from greenhouse agriculture should have a relevant section in the conservation plans and should be a recommendation from ACCOBAMS due to these plastics' and sperm whales' high mobility in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - The systematics of Peripatopsis moseleyi (Wood-Mason, 1879), a widely distributed South Africa velvet worm species, was examined to test the occurrence of cryptic lineages within this taxon. A total of 81 specimens of P. moseleyi were collected from 12 localities throughout its known distribution in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa. All specimens were sequenced for a 631 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase one subunit (COI) locus, while a 717 bp pair fragment of the 18S rDNA locus was sequenced for a single sample for each of the clades evident from the COI topology. DNA sequence data were analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inferences, while a haplotype network was constructed and an analysis of molecular variation was conducted. Gross morphological characteristics, such as the number of pre-genital leg pairs, the genital areas and colour variation in each sample locality were examined. Moreover, characters of the antennae, the shape of the main dermal papillae and male genital pad features were investigated. Topologies derived from the combined DNA analyses (COI and 18S rDNA) were congruent and revealed that P. moseleyi is a complex comprised of five genetically distinct clades. At present, these clades could not be differentiated based on morphological characters, suggesting that traditional species-discriminating characters have limited taxonomic utility. However, colour differences between the two sympatric morphs may be used to differentiate these clades. Our results indicate that cryptic speciation is present within P. moseleyi, with most of the novel detected lineages characterized by restricted geographic distribution.

AB  - Determination of which aspects of habitat quality and habitat spatial arrangement best account for variation in a species' distribution can guide management for organisms such as the Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), a federally endangered subspecies inhabiting savannas of Midwest and Eastern United States. We examined the extent to which three sets of predictors, (1) larval host plant (Lupinus perennis, wild lupine) availability (2) characteristics of the matrix surrounding host plant patches, and (3) factors affecting a patch's thermal environment, accounted for variation in lupine patch use by Karner blues at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, Indiana and Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, USA. Each predictor set accounted for 7-13% of variation in patch occupancy by Karner blues at both sites and in larval feeding activity among patches at Indiana Dunes. Patch area, an indicator of host plant availability, was an exception, accounting for 30% of variation in patch occupancy at Indiana Dunes. Spatially structured patterns of patch use across the landscape accounted for 9-16% of variation in patch use and explained more variation in larval feeding activity than did spatial autocorrelation between neighboring patches. Because of this broader spatial trend across sites, a given management action may be more effective in promoting patch use in some portions of the landscape than in others. Spatial trend, resource availability, matrix quality, and microclimate, in general, accounted for similar amounts of variation in patch use and each should be incorporated into habitat management planning for the Karner blue butterfly.

AB  - 1. Ecological monitoring programmes are designed to detect and measure changes in biodiversity and ecosystems. In the case of biological invasions, they can contribute to anticipating risks and adaptively managing invaders. However, monitoring is often expensive because large amounts of data might be needed to draw inferences. Thus, careful planning is required to ensure that monitoring goals are realistically achieved.
   2. Species distribution models (SDMs) can provide estimates of suitable areas to invasion. Predictions from these models can be applied as inputs in optimization strategies seeking to identify the optimal extent of the networks of areas required for monitoring risk of invasion under current and future environmental conditions. A hierarchical framework is proposed herein that combines SDMs, scenario analysis and cost analyses to improve invasion assessments at regional and local scales. We illustrate the framework with Acacia dealbata Link. (Silver-wattle) in northern Portugal. The framework is general and applicable to any species.
   3. We defined two types of monitoring networks focusing either on the regional-scale management of an invasion, or management focus within and around protected areas. For each one of these two schemes, we designed a hierarchical framework of spatial prioritization using different information layers (e.g. SDMs, habitat connectivity, protected areas). We compared the performance of each monitoring scheme against 100 randomly generated models.
   4. In our case study, we found that protected areas will be increasingly exposed to invasion by A. dealbata due to climate change. Moreover, connectivity between suitable areas for A. dealbata is predicted to increase. Monitoring networks that we identify were more effective in detecting new invasions and less costly to management than randomly generated models. The most cost-efficient monitoring schemes require 18% less effort than the average networks across all of the 100 tested options.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The proposed framework achieves cost-effective monitoring networks, enabling the interactive exploration of different solutions and the combination of quantitative information on network performance with orientations that are rarely incorporated in a decision support system. The framework brings invasion monitoring closer to European legislation and management needs while ensuring adaptability under rapid climate and environmental change.

AB  - Background Habitat suitability models give insight into the ecological drivers of species distributions and are increasingly common in management and conservation planning. Telemetry data can be used in habitat models to describe where animals were present, however this requires the use of presence-only modeling approaches or the generation of 'pseudo-absences' to simulate locations where animals did not go. To highlight considerations for generating pseudo-absences for telemetry-based habitat models, we explored how different methods of pseudo-absence generation affect model performance across species' movement strategies, model types, and environments. Methods We built habitat models for marine and terrestrial case studies, Northeast Pacific blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and African elephants (Loxodonta africana). We tested four pseudo-absence generation methods commonly used in telemetry-based habitat models: (1) background sampling; (2) sampling within a buffer zone around presence locations; (3) correlated random walks beginning at the tag release location; (4) reverse correlated random walks beginning at the last tag location. Habitat models were built using generalised linear mixed models, generalised additive mixed models, and boosted regression trees. Results We found that the separation in environmental niche space between presences and pseudo-absences was the single most important driver of model explanatory power and predictive skill. This result was consistent across marine and terrestrial habitats, two species with vastly different movement syndromes, and three different model types. The best-performing pseudo-absence method depended on which created the greatest environmental separation: background sampling for blue whales and reverse correlated random walks for elephants. However, despite the fact that models with greater environmental separation performed better according to traditional predictive skill metrics, they did not always produce biologically realistic spatial predictions relative to known distributions. Conclusions Habitat model performance may be positively biased in cases where pseudo-absences are sampled from environments that are dissimilar to presences. This emphasizes the need to carefully consider spatial extent of the sampling domain and environmental heterogeneity of pseudo-absence samples when developing habitat models, and highlights the importance of scrutinizing spatial predictions to ensure that habitat models are biologically realistic and fit for modeling objectives.

AB  - Open ocean predator-prey interactions are often difficult to interpret because of a lack of information on prey fields at scales relevant to predator behaviour. Hence, there is strong interest in identifying the biological and physical factors influencing the distribution and abundance of prey species, which may be of broad predictive use for conservation planning and evaluating effects of environmental change. This study focuses on a key Southern Ocean prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, using acoustic observations of individual swarms (aggregations) from a large-scale survey off East Antarctica. We developed two sets of statistical models describing swarm characteristics, one set using underway survey data for the explanatory variables, and the other using their satellite remotely sensed analogues. While survey data are in situ and contemporaneous with the swarm data, remotely sensed data are all that is available for prediction and inference about prey distribution in other areas or at other times. The fitted models showed that the primary biophysical influences on krill swarm characteristics included daylight (solar elevation/radiation) and proximity to the Antarctic continental slope, but there were also complex relationships with current velocities and gradients. Overall model performance was similar regardless of whether underway or remotely sensed predictors were used. We applied the latter models to generate regional-scale spatial predictions using a 10-yr remotely-sensed time series. This retrospective modelling identified areas off east Antarctica where relatively dense krill swarms were consistently predicted during austral mid-summers, which may underpin key foraging areas for marine predators. Spatiotemporal predictions along Antarctic predator satellite tracks, from independent studies, illustrate the potential for uptake into further quantitative modelling of predator movements and foraging. The approach is widely applicable to other krill-dependent ecosystems, and our findings are relevant to similar efforts examining biophysical linkages elsewhere in the Southern Ocean and beyond.

AB  - The whitespotted eagle rayAetobatus narinariis a tropical to warm-temperate benthopelagic batoid that ranges widely throughout the western Atlantic Ocean. Despite conservation concerns for the species, its vertical habitat use and diving behaviour remain unknown. Patterns and drivers in the depth distribution ofA. narinariwere investigated at two separate locations, the western North Atlantic (Islands of Bermuda) and the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Sarasota, Florida, U.S.A.). Between 2010 and 2014, seven pop-up satellite archival tags were attached toA. narinariusing three methods: a through-tail suture, an external tail-band and through-wing attachment. Retention time ranged from 0 to 180 days, with tags attachedviathe through-tail method retained longest. Tagged rays spent the majority of time (82.85 +/- 12.17% S.D.) within the upper 10 m of the water column and, with one exception, no rays travelled deeper than similar to 26 m. One Bermuda ray recorded a maximum depth of 50.5 m, suggesting that these animals make excursions off the fore-reef slope of the Bermuda Platform. Individuals occupied deeper depths (7.42 +/- 3.99 m S.D.) during the dayversusnight (4.90 +/- 2.89 m S.D.), which may be explained by foraging and/or predator avoidance. Each individual experienced a significant difference in depth and temperature distributions over the diel cycle. There was evidence that mean hourly depth was best described by location and individual variation using a generalized additive mixed model approach. This is the first study to compare depth distributions ofA. narinarifrom different locations and describe the thermal habitat for this species. Our study highlights the importance of region in describingA. narinaridepth use, which may be relevant when developing management plans, whilst demonstrating that diel patterns appear to hold across individuals.

AB  - The Yangtze River estuary (YRE) is an important migration channel and foraging habitat for Coilia nasus. Due to its ecological significance and a prioritization of this species' protection, the need to investigate and analyze environmental relationships of the abundance of Coilia nasus in the YRE as well as develop an understanding of their temporal and spatial distributions is becoming exceedingly important. Using fishery data and environmental survey data from 2009 to 2016, three models including generalized additive mixed models (GAMM), generalized additive models with zero-inflated Poisson distribution (ZIP-GAM) and two-step GAM were used to analyze relationships between environmental factors and the distribution of Coilia nasus in the YRE. The results showed that model fitting of GAMM was more consistent with observations and revealed influences of water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and pH on distribution. GAMM demonstrated that higher Coilia nasus abundances were located in waters with water temperature values at 15 degrees C and 30 degrees C, and lower Coilia nasus abundances were located in areas with water temperature values at 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C. All models indicated that the effect of salinity on abundance of Coilia nasus present a multimodal pattern including three peaks at 5, 15, and 25 ppt respectively. Additionally, abundance of Coilia nasus increased with the increase of chlorophyll A in its range of 0-4 mg/L. In a range of 8.0-9.5, higher PH value was more suitable for the aggregation of Coilia nasus. Cross validation was used to evaluate the predictive performance of models and GAMM was found to be the best. The predicted abundance distribution of Coilia nasus in the summer and autumn of 2016 was relatively higher overall than that in winter and spring. The predicted zero abundance distribution pattern was consistent with the sampling presence distribution which was obtained using fishery independent survey data of the year 2009-2015. Facing the urgency protection of Coilia nasus in YRE, results of this study could be used for Coilia nasus conservation and reserve planning.

AB  - The East Maui Watershed (EMW) is a > 60,000-ha forested watershed with wide temperature and precipitation gradients being invaded by miconia (Miconia calvescens DC.). Current miconia management efforts focus on protecting important watershed and critical habitat areas from miconia invasion. Herein, we report on a miconia species distribution model to predict unoccupied areas that may be still vulnerable to invasion. This suitable habitat model was developed from an ensemble of five algorithms associating five physical features of EMW with miconia occurrence data from a 26-yr management history (1991-2016; n = 114,953). All of the algorithms performed well based on model evaluation statistics (e.g. AUC >= 0.83; TSS >= 0.36). Elevation, slope and rainfall were consistently important predictors, while aspect indices were non-contributors. The binary ensemble model suggests a total of similar to 56.9% of the area of interest is susceptible to invasion by miconia. An independent dataset collected in 2017-2018 (n = 5,222) was used to field validate the ensemble habitat suitability model (EHSM) and found that the model could correctly predict suitable habitat 94% of the time. All five of the model algorithms were updated using this new management data, and the predicted suitable area decreased 2.3%. While binary models are useful for risk assessment, the classification of an area as suitable or not suitable has limitations for land managers adopting for management activities. Utilizing the mean weighted consensus probability surface representation of the model allows for more scrutiny of potential suitable habitat. We suggest using this approach when planning future monitoring efforts, especially if specific areas have a higher prioritization for conservation than others.

AB  - 1 Many authors have suggested that topography and soils are the major determinants of species distributions and community patterns at small or regional scales, but few studies addressed the patterns at mesoscales. We used Reserva Ducke (100 km(2)) as a model to analyse the effects of soil, topography and watersheds on the variation of the herb community composition, and to determine the relative importance of the environmental factors on species composition.
   2 Taxonomic groups are frequently used as surrogates in studies of biodiversity distribution and complementarity, but their efficacy is controversial. We therefore studied the correlations between the distributional patterns of three different herb groups (Marantaceae, pteridophytes and 'others') and their responses to environmental predictors.
   3 Terrestrial herbs were sampled in 59 plots of 250 x 2 m, systematically distributed over the reserve. Plots followed isoclines of altitude, to minimize the internal variation of soil. Composition of the total herb community and of the three herb groups was summarized with PCoA.
   4 Soil structure, represented by PCA axes, was the main determinant of the variation in herb composition for all groups, but slope affected only pteridophytes. Soil and topography explained less than one-third of the variance in community data. Herb composition was significantly different between watersheds, but watersheds differ only slightly in soil parameters. Our results indicate high turnover in species composition, on spatial scales of 5-10 km in central Amazonia, which is not necessarily associated with soil change.
   5 Compositional patterns of the three groups analysed were significantly correlated, but with low values for the correlation coefficient. Although composition was correlated, the responses to environmental predictors differed among groups, and the use of one group as a surrogate will miss around 50% of the variation in other groups.
   6 Although important, soil and topography alone cannot predict herb community structure. Knowledge of geographical, historical or other landscape features, such as watershed morphology, may therefore be necessary to predict the turnover patterns over mesoscales. Moreover, the same factors may not have the same effectiveness as predictors of the structure of seemingly similar biological groups.

AB  - Global mean sea levels may rise between 0.75 and 1.9 m by 2100 changing the distribution and community structure of coastal ecosystems due to flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion. Although habitats will be inundated, ecosystems have the potential to shift inland, and endemic species may persist if conditions are favorable. Predictions of ecosystem migration due to sea level rise need to account for current stressors, which may reduce the resilience of these ecosystems. This study predicts the potential consequences of sea level rise on the groundwater-fed anchialine pool ecosystem in Hawaii. Scenarios of marine and groundwater inundation were compared with current patterns of habitat, introduced fishes, and land use. Results show that current habitats containing endemic anchialine shrimp will be increasingly inundated by marine waters. New habitats will emerge in areas that are low lying and undeveloped. Because of subsurface hydrologic connectivity, endemic shrimp are likely to populate these new habitats by moving through the coastal aquifer. In some areas, rising sea levels will provide surface connectivity between pools currently containing introduced fishes (tilapia, poeciliids) and up to 46 % of new or existing pools that do not contain these fish. Results predicting future habitat distribution and condition due to sea level rise will support conservation planning. Additionally, the interdisciplinary approach may provide guidance for efforts in other coastal aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - In invasion processes, both abiotic and biotic factors are considered essential, but the latter are usually disregarded when modeling the potential spread of exotic species. In the framework of set theory, interactions between biotic (B), abiotic (A), and movement-related (M) factors in the geographical space can be hypothesized with BAM diagrams and tested using ecological niche models (ENMs) to estimate A and B areas. The main aim of our survey was to evaluate the interactions between abiotic (climatic) and biotic (host availability) factors in geographical space for exotic symbionts (i.e., non-free-living species), using ENM techniques combined with a BAM framework and using exotic Entocytheridae (Ostracoda) found in Europe as model organisms. We carried out an extensive survey to evaluate the distribution of entocytherids hosted by crayfish in Europe by checking 94 European localities and 12 crayfish species. Both exotic entocytherid species found, Ankylocythere sinuosa and Uncinocythere occidentalis, were widely distributed in W Europe living on the exotic crayfish species Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus, respectively. No entocytherids were observed in the remaining crayfish species. The suitable area for A.sinuosa was mainly restricted by its own limitations to minimum temperatures in W and N Europe and precipitation seasonality in circum-Mediterranean areas. Uncinocythere occidentalis was mostly restricted by host availability in circum-Mediterranean regions due to limitations of P.leniusculus to higher precipitation seasonality and maximum temperatures. The combination of ENMs with set theory allows studying the invasive biology of symbionts and provides clues about biogeographic barriers due to abiotic or biotic factors limiting the expansion of the symbiont in different regions of the invasive range. The relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors on geographical space can then be assessed and applied in conservation plans. This approach can also be implemented in other systems where the target species is closely interacting with other taxa.

AB  - Anticipating species movement under climate change is a major focus in conservation. Bioclimate models are one of the few predictive tools for adaptation planning, but are limited in accounting for (i) climatic tolerances in preadult life stages that are potentially more vulnerable to warming; and (ii) local-scale movement and use of climatic refugia as an alternative or complement to large-scale changes in distribution. To assess whether these shortfalls can be addressed with field demographic data, we used California valley oak (Quercus lobata Nee), a long-lived species with juvenile life stages known to be sensitive to climate. We hypothesized that the valley oak bioclimate model, based on adults, would overpredict the species' ability to remain in the projected persisting area, due to higher climate vulnerability of young life stages; and underpredict the potential for the species to remain in the projected contracting area in local-scale refugia. We assessed the bioclimate model projections against actual demographic patterns in natural populations. We found that saplings were more constricted around surface water than adults in the projected contracting area. We also found that the climate envelope for saplings is narrower than that for adults. Saplings disappeared at a summer maximum temperature 3 similar to degrees C below that associated with adults. Our findings indicate that rather than a complete shift northward and upward, as predicted by the species bioclimate model, valley oaks are more likely to experience constriction around water bodies, and eventual disappearance from areas exceeding a threshold of maximum temperature. Ours is the first study we know of to examine the importance of discrete life stage climate sensitivities in determining bioclimate modeling inputs, and to identify current climate change-related constriction of a species around microrefugia. Our findings illustrate that targeted biological fieldwork can be central to understanding climate change-related movement for long-lived, sessile species.

AB  - Modelling species distribution is an important aspect of conservation ecology. Empirical models are most commonly used. However, collecting data for these models is time-consuming and expensive. Expert models may be a good alternative method, though previous studies have found mixed results. The purpose of our study was first to create an expert model and evaluate it with independent lynx data, and second to use two discrete types of experts to control for prior radio-tracking experience. Two habitat suitability expert models (scientific and local experts) were constructed in a Geographical Information System using the Analytical Hierarchy Process and Compromise Programming. The models were evaluated with lynx data, taken from the study area in the northwestern Swiss Alps, using Resource Selection Index and Spearman correlation. The correlations showed that both models fitted the data well. However, the local expert model was better (rs = 0.964, P < 0.001) than the scientific expert model (rs = 0.833, P < 0.001). The models were also evaluated in the Jura Mountains to test the local nature of the models. It was found that the local expert model performed less well (rs = 0.939, P < 0.001) than the scientific expert model (rs = 0.967, P < 0.001) as expected. Comparison between weights for each expert group revealed some interesting differences, which showed the local nature of answers and how personal experience and theoretical knowledge can lead to different answers. Our study shows that expert knowledge, and especially local knowledge, can be employed to create a good habitat suitability model. This has important implications for conservation and science because it shows not only that expert knowledge may be used when no other data exist, but also that local 'ground workers' should be employed more often in the development of habitat suitability models or conservation plans. However, there are limitations to the models and, as expert models are relatively new in ecology, more research is needed. Nevertheless, in a climate where there is pressure to keep up with human exploitation of natural resources and to adopt a more strategic approach to conservation, the findings of our study are encouraging.

AB  - The survival of an increasing number of species is threatened by climate change: 20%-30% of plants and animals seem to be at risk of range shift or extinction if global warming reaches levels projected to occur by the end of this century. Plant range shifts may determine whether animal species that rely on plant availability for food and shelter will be affected by new patterns of plant occupancy and availability. Brown bears in temperate forested habitats mostly forage on plants and it may be expected that climate change will affect the viability of the endangered populations of southern Europe. Here, we assess the potential impact of climate change on seven plants that represent the main food resources and shelter for the endangered population of brown bears in the Cantabrian Mountains (Spain). Our simulations suggest that the geographic range of these plants might be altered under future climate warming, with most bear resources reducing their range. As a consequence, this brown bear population is expected to decline drastically in the next 50 years. Range shifts of brown bear are also expected to displace individuals from mountainous areas towards more humanized ones, where we can expect an increase in conflicts and bear mortality rates. Additional negative effects might include: (a) a tendency to a more carnivorous diet, which would increase conflicts with cattle farmers; (b) limited fat storage before hibernation due to the reduction of oak forests; (c) increased intraspecific competition with other acorn consumers, that is, wild ungulates and free-ranging livestock; and (d) larger displacements between seasons to find main trophic resources. The magnitude of the changes projected by our models emphasizes that conservation practices focused only on bears may not be appropriate and thus we need more dynamic conservation planning aimed at reducing the impact of climate change in forested landscapes.

AB  - Diplura is the sister group to insects and one of the three basal hexapod groups with unique entognathan mouthparts. The order is divided into 10 families, which include 1008 species in 141 genera, with a high proportion of monotypic genera. They are ubiquitous in soils and subsurface terrestrial habitats, as well as have an important role in overall biogeochemical cycles.
   We present the first comprehensive review of the global biodiversity and ecology of Diplura. We highlight four aspects of this basal hexapod group: diversity in morphological body plans and sizes; ecology in terrestrial environments from soil to caves; food preference and trophic levels, and their biogeographical and paleobiogeographical significance.
   Diplura depends on high humidity and moderate temperatures. They are presumably very sensitive to anthropogenic pressures and climate change, and therefore are a suitable model for ecophysiological studies and evident priority targets for conservation.
   We conclude that the future efforts should focus on establishing a molecular phylogeny to clarify the relationships between and within families, as well as to reveal global biogeographical patterns. This will require an increase in sampling effort in several regions of the globe, especially in tropical regions.

AB  - In this study, data on microhabitat preference of the Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) was obtained in a cork oak woodland of southern Portugal. over an area of 221 ha. A total of 35 and 30 colonies were surveyed, respectively, in the dry and wet seasons (April to June and October to December, respectively) and 22 variables defining microhabitat structure and composition were monitored within a 10 m-radius circle around each colony. Two logistic regression models were separately computed for the dry and wet seasons, aiming to identify the more relevant variables influencing the presence of voles. Models were statistically robust, revealing good predictive ability (dry season: 94.1% of correct classifications and AUC=0.987; wet season: 82.4% of correct classification and AUC=0.869). Results suggest that open areas with high herbaceous cover were the most important microhabitat factors determining the occurrence of voles across the year. Results also showed that colonies distribution and spacing greatly varied throughout the year which may be highly relevant in the species conservation planning.

AB  - In a dynamic landscape the rate of change in landscape structure can be even more important than the degree of patch isolation in determining population survival and abundance. If the changes in landscape structure occur at an "extremely" high rate (as in some anthropogenic changes), dispersal may not be able to keep up with the high rates of local extinction. Understanding impacts of such changes is thus crucial for determination of the driving factors for species survival in agricultural landscapes and for elaboration of conservation plans. Here we studied the effects of landscape dynamics under local farming practices on movements and population dynamics of a diurnal butterfly Maniola jurtina L. (Satyridae), specifically the impacts of regular yearly mowing on butterfly movements, distribution and abundance over many years. We used an existing simulation model, extended it by the effect of the intensity of disturbance (amount of mown habitat) and timing of disturbance within the reproductive season on the butterfly population dynamics, and validated on our data from a field experiment using a mark-release method. Increase in the amount of disturbed habitats in the landscape led to an increasing isolation of the remnant habitat patches for butterflies. This resulted in decreasing movements between habitat patches and ultimately to population decline, especially in less accessible patches. In the past, influence of landscape dynamics on species survival was usually considered at the long-term scale. our results demonstrate that the short time scale landscape dynamics induced by farming practices should not be neglected. The novelty of this paper stems in the combination of inclusion of landscape dynamics, of realistic dispersal strategies of individuals, and of considering real landscapes. The effect of man-induced landscape changes on population persistence of a real species in a real landscape has not been possible to be studied by any of the previously developed models.

AB  - The badger (Meles metes) is an important wildlife host for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), and is a reservoir of infection to cattle. Reliable indicators of badger abundance at large spatial scales are important for informing epidemiological investigation. Thus, we aimed to estimate badger social group abundance from a large-scale dataset to provide useful information for the management of bTB in the Republic of Ireland (ROI). Robust estimates of species abundance require planned systematic surveying. This is often unfeasible at large spatial scales, resulting in inadequate (biased) data collection. We employed species distributional modelling (SDM) using 7724 badger main-sett (burrow) locations across the ROI at a I ha scale. This dataset was potentially biased as surveying was directed towards areas with cattle bTB-breakdowns. In order to manage sampling bias, we developed a model where the environment was sampled using pseudoabsences geographically constrained to the potential survey area only (constrained model), in addition to a model where all of the ROI was sampled (non-constrained model). Models predictive performance was assessed using internal (splitting the national-scale dataset) and external validation on independent datasets; the latter included 278 main setts from a local-scale unbiased intensive survey (755 km(2)). Finally, the relationship between predicted probability and observed abundance at local-scale was used to infer number of social-groups at the national level. The geographically constrained model showed moderate discriminatory power, but good calibration in both the internal and external validations. The non-constrained model resulted in higher discrimination but poorer calibration in the internal validation, indicating a limitation for national-scale predictions. Interestingly, there was a strong cubic relationship between predicted probability-classes and observed sett density in the local-area (R-2 = 0.85 and 0.96; for the non-constrained and the constrained models, respectively). At the national-scale, the preferred model predicted a total of 19,200 (95% Confidence Interval: 12,200-27,900) social groups. Our analyses demonstrated that under a critical perspective large-scale potentially biased datasets can be used to estimate variations in species abundance. The abundance predictions are in keeping with recent independent estimations of the badger population, and will be a valuable index of species abundance for epidemiology (e.g. risk mapping), species management (e.g. informing vaccine strategies) and conservation planning (e.g. assessing population viability).

AB  - Aim Populations of large ungulates are dwindling worldwide. This is especially so for wild sheep, which compete with livestock for forage, are disturbed by shepherds and their dogs, and are exposed to disease transmissions from livestock. Our aim was to assess spatial patterns in realized niche overlap between wild and domestic sheep to better understand where potential competition might arise, and thus to identify priority areas for wild sheep recovery. Location Southern Caucasus (220,000 km(2)). Methods We studied Gmelin's mouflon (Ovis orientalis gmelinii), an ancestor of domestic sheep, to investigate seasonal habitat use and niche overlap with domestic sheep. To map habitat, we analysed mouflon occurrences collected during 2006-2016, and domestic sheep occurrences from shepherd camp locations digitized on high-resolution satellite imagery. We mapped areas of potential competition between mouflon and domestic sheep and assessed potential habitat displacement. Results Mouflon and domestic sheep niches overlapped substantially (overlap index I = 0.89, where 1 means perfect overlap) but were not identical. Mouflon habitat was less widespread than domestic sheep habitat (14,000 vs. 40,270 km(2)) and tended to be located in more rugged areas with less vegetation cover. We identified 51 priority patches as reintroduction candidates if grazing pressure and poaching were reduced. Main conclusions Our results suggest that competition with domestic sheep might have pushed mouflon into marginal habitat. Thus, conservation efforts focusing on current mouflon habitat might miss suitable reintroduction sites. We demonstrate that a combined habitat model for wild and domestic sheep can identify general sheep habitat, which might be more useful for conservation planning than understanding current mouflon habitat selection. Our results highlight that considering competition with livestock is important for large ungulate conservation, both in terms of reactive (e.g., lessening livestock pressure in prime habitat) and proactive strategies (e.g., reintroduction in areas with low contemporary overlap).

AB  - The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has the potential to influence the distribution and abundance of grasslands in many agricultural landscapes, and thereby provide habitat for grassland-dependent wildlife. Greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) are a grassland-dependent species with large area requirements and have been used as an indicator of grassland ecosystem function; they are also a species of conservation concern across much of their range. Greater prairie-chicken populations respond to the amount and configuration of grasslands and wetlands in agriculturally dominated landscapes, which in turn can be influenced by the CRP; however, CRP enrollments and enrollment caps have declined from previous highs. Therefore, prioritizing CRP reenrollments and new enrollments to achieve the greatest benefit for grassland-dependent wildlife seems prudent. We used models relating either lek density or the number of males at leks to CRP enrollments and the resulting landscape structure to predict changes in greater prairie-chicken abundance related to changes in CRP enrollments. We simulated 3 land-cover scenarios: expiration of existing CRP enrollments, random, small-parcel (4,040 m(2)) addition of CRP grasslands, and strategic, large-parcel (80,000 m(2)) addition of CRP grasslands. Large-parcel additions were the average enrollment size in northwestern Minnesota, USA, within the context of a regional prairie restoration plan. In our simulations of CRP enrollment expirations, the abundance of greater prairie-chickens declined when grassland landscape contiguity declined with loss of CRP enrollments. Simulations of strategic CRP enrollment with large parcels to increase grassland contiguity more often increased greater prairie-chicken abundance than random additions of the same area in small parcels that did not increase grassland contiguity. In some cases, CRP enrollments had no or a negative predicted change in greater prairie-chicken abundance because they provided insufficient grassland contiguity on the landscape, or increased cover-type fragmentation. Predicted greater prairie-chicken abundance increased under large-parcel and small-parcel scenarios of addition of CRP grassland; the greatest increases were associated with large-parcel additions. We suggest that strategic application of the CRP to improve grassland contiguity can benefit greater prairie-chicken populations more than an opportunistic approach lacking consideration of the larger landscape context. Strategic implementation of the CRP can benefit greater prairie-chicken populations in northwestern Minnesota, and likely elsewhere in landscapes where grassland continuity may be a limiting factor.

AB  - Background Habitat loss is a key threat to the survival of many species. Habitat selection studies provide key information for conservation initiatives by identifying important habitat and anthropogenic characteristics influencing the distribution of threatened species in changing landscapes. However, assumptions about the homogeneity of individual choices on habitat, regardless of life stage, are likely to result in inaccurate assessment of conservation priorities. This study addresses a knowledge gap in how animals at different life stages diverge in how they select habitat and anthropogenic features, using a free-ranging population of African wild dogs living in a human-dominated landscape in Kenya as a case study. Using GPS collar data to develop resource selection function and step selection function models, this study investigated differences between second order (selection of home range across a landscape) and third order (selection of habitat within the home range) habitat selection across four life history stages when resource requirements may vary: resident-non-denning, resident-heavily-pregnant, resident-denning and dispersing. Results Wild dogs showed strong second order selection for areas with low human population densities and areas close to rivers and roads. More rugged areas were also generally selected, as were areas with lower percentage tree cover. The strength of selection for habitat variables varied significantly between life stages; for example, dispersal groups were more tolerant of higher human population densities, whereas denning and pregnant packs were least tolerant of such areas. Conclusions Habitat selection patterns varied between individuals at different life stages and at different orders of selection. These analyses showed that denning packs and dispersal groups, the two pivotal life stages which drive wild dog population dynamics, exhibited different habitat selection to resident-non-breeding packs. Dispersal groups were relatively tolerant of higher human population densities whereas denning packs preferred rugged, remote areas. Evaluating different orders of selection was important as the above trends may not be detectable at all levels of selection for all habitat characteristics. Our analyses demonstrate that when life stage information is included in analyses across different orders of selection, it improves our understanding of how animals use their landscapes, thus providing important insights to aid conservation planning.

AB  - 1. Habitat suitability models (HSMs) are commonly used in conservation practise to assess the potential of an area to be occupied and colonised. A major limitation of these models, however, is the omission of spatially explicit understanding of human acceptance towards the focal species. As wildlife is more and more subject to human-dominated landscapes, ignoring the sociological component will result in misrepresentation of the observed processes and inappropriate management.
   2. We distributed 10000 questionnaires across Switzerland and identified key socio-demographical factors correlated with human acceptance of the wolf. We then created a spatially explicit acceptance model based on geo-referenced socio-demographical, social and geographical information. Finally, we combined our acceptance model with a HSM to obtain a unified socio-ecological suitability model, which included human and ecological components.
   3. We showed that the key factors associated with human acceptance were perception of how harmful the wolf is, interest in wolf-related issues, need for livestock protection, and fear of the wolf. Perceived harmfulness was in turn correlated with direct and indirect experience with the wolf, and level of education.
   4. Our acceptance map predicted decreasing acceptance with increasing altitude of residency and proximity to locations of confirmed wolf presence. This resulted in the overall opposition to the wolf for the Alpine region, albeit substantial regional differences.
   5. We found little spatial overlap (6% of Switzerland) between areas where the wolf was accepted and areas of suitable habitat. These areas of socio-ecological suitability were concentrated in the Jura Mountains and in the eastern and southern Alps, and were absent in the western and central Alps. Particularly in the Jura region, which is yet to be colonised, management of human acceptance will be a crucial conservation target.
   6. Synthesis and applications. We developed an integrative, socio-ecological approach that allowed us to accurately reproduce recent wolf recolonisation. We anticipate our framework to be a powerful tool to reliably evaluate overall suitable habitats and predict short to medium-term range expansion for species whose distribution is also dependent on human attitudes. Because our approach is sensitive to both the ecological and human component, it is ideally suited to identify key regions where proactive and targeted socio-ecological management plans are needed.

AB  - Natural resource management professionals require adaptable spatial tools for conserving and managing wildlife across landscapes. These tools should integrate multiple components of habitat quality and incorporate local disturbance regimes. We provide a spatial modeling framework that integrates three components of habitat (nutritional resources, connectivity, and predation risk) into indices of habitat quality under a simulated wildfire disturbance regime. Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a species of conservation concern, is used to illustrate our framework. We simulated disturbance from wildfire on two boreal forest landscapes to produce stand ages, from which we computed and integrated the three habitat indicator components using different schemes. Spatial variation in the influence of wildfire and the distribution of the three components of habitat resulted in heterogeneous patterns of habitat quality. The inclusion of disturbance led to a different habitat quality landscape than that of a static model in which the influence of wildfire on vegetation communities was not considered, incorporating the likelihood of persistence into the overall representation of habitat quality. The integration of nutrition, connectivity, and predation risk into a single index of habitat quality produced spatial patterns distinct from maps of the individual components. Regardless of whether the components were combined through additive, multiplicative, or minimum habitat quality threshold methods, areas of very high- and poor-quality habitat were found at consistent locations across the landscape, suggesting that these two types of regions provide opportunities for long-term management interventions. The framework presented here is adaptable and modular; it could be modified and applied to other species, regions, and disturbance regimes. It provides a nuanced representation of persistent habitat and has the potential to be a useful tool for conservation planning.

AB  - Freshwater biodiversity is showing a global decline in relation to environmental change and there is an urgent need to quantify different facets of biodiversity to assess the conservation value of freshwater ecosystems. Identifying the ecological drivers of arid and semiarid Patagonian waterbodies is a critical requirement for planning action to conserve these still poorly understood habitats. We tested the responses of alpha and beta diversity of invertebrates (presence-absence, abundance, and biomass) to local, landscape, and climatic features, in 45 Patagonian freshwater bodies classified in three groups: isolated ponds, connected ponds, and lotic systems. We first compared the invertebrate community compositions of the different waterbodies. Secondly, using a co-inertia analysis we assessed the relative roles of local, landscape and climatic factors in driving variation in assemblage composition. Finally, we compared different facets of beta diversity and modelled their responses to environmental variables (predictors), by generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM). Unexpectedly, lotic systems with a total of 109 taxa, were richer than lotic ones, but isolated ponds contributed most to beta diversity and supported more unique and proportionally more endemic species. Alpha and beta diversity were mainly driven by local features and secondly by climatic descriptors. However, these patterns shifted according to different community composition measures. Collectively, our results suggest that isolated ponds have a higher biodiversity value and would be more vulnerable than connected ponds and lotic systems to environmental changes. However, all waterbody types contributed to gamma biodiversity, reinforcing the importance of conserving a diversity of freshwater ecosystems in any landscape and particularly in arid and semiarid Patagonia. Our findings are a first step to resolving and quantifying the amount of changes occurring in Patagonian waterbodies, and are a prerequisite for predicting changes in species distributions in the face of global change.

AB  - Connectivity between populations plays a key role in the long-term persistence of species in fragmented habitats. This is of particular concern for biodiversity preservation in drylands, since water limited landscapes are typically characterized by little suitable habitat cover, high habitat fragmentation, harsh matrices, and are being rapidly degraded at a global scale. In this study, we modelled landscape connectivity between 11 guanaco Lama guanicoe populations in Chile's arid Norte Chico, a region that supports the last remnant coastal populations of this emblematic herbivore indigenous to South America. We produced a habitat suitability model to derive a regional surface resistance map, and used circuit theory to map functional connectivity, investigate the relative isolation between populations, and identify those that contribute most to the patch connectivity network. Predicted suitable habitat for L. guanicoe represented about 25% of the study region (i.e., 29,173 km(2)) and was heterogeneously distributed along a continuous stretch along the Andes, and discontinuous patches along the coast. As a result, we found that high connectivity current flows in the mid and high Andes formed a wide, continuous connectivity corridor, enabling connectivity between all high Andean populations. Coastal populations, in contrast, were more isolated. These groups demonstrate no inter-population connectivity between themselves, only with higher altitude populations, and for two of them, animal movement was linked to the effectiveness of wildlife crossings along the Pan-American highway. Our results indicate that functional connectivity is an issue of concern for L. guanicoe in Chile's Norte Chico, implying that future conservation and management plans should emphasize strategies aimed at conserving functional connectivity between coastal and Andean populations, as well as the protection of habitat patches likely to act as stepping stones within the connectivity network.

AB  - The cheetah Acinonyx jubatus has suffered dramatic range contractions and population declines as a result of habitat degradation, prey depletion and conflict with humans. Of further concern is that many of Africa's remaining cheetah populations persist in human-dominated and highly fragmented landscapes, where their ecology is poorly understood and population data are lacking. Presence-absence surveys may be a practical means to collect these data; however, failing to account for detection error can lead to biased estimates and misleading inferences; potentially having deleterious consequences for species conservation. The goal of this study was to identify how an occupancy modelling technique that explicitly accounts for detectability could be used for quantifying cheetah status in human-impacted landscapes. Replicated camera-trap and track surveys of 100-km(2) sample units were used to estimate the proportion of area occupied by cheetahs and to determine the survey effort required to inform conservation planning. Based on our results, 16km [+/- standard error (SE)=12-22] of walking or 193 camera-trap nights (+/- SE=141-292) are required to confirm cheetah absence at a given 100-km(2) grid cell (with 95% certainty). Accounting for detection resulted in an overall cheetah occurrence estimate of 0.40 (SE=0.13), which is 16% higher than the traditional presence-absence estimate that ignores detection error. We test a priori hypotheses to investigate factors limiting cheetahs using an occurrence probability model of their preferred prey. The results show that both cheetahs and their prey were strongly negatively influenced by human settlements. Our study provides an unbiased estimate of occurrence that can be used to compare status across different sites and as a basis for long-term monitoring. Based on our results, we suggest that track and/or camera-trap surveys coupled with site occupancy models may be useful for targeted monitoring of cheetahs across their distribution.

AB  - 1. Management decisions are increasingly based on matrix models intended to predict the long-term fate of endangered species. However, certain elements of these models, such as life-state transition probabilities (vital rates), are difficult to parameterize and their values may vary depending on external conditions such as weather. Details of how weather might influence population performance are rare, yet necessary to assess the effects of global climate change on a species' distribution.
   2. Based on a 26-year data set of a population of Himantoglossum hircinum in a nature reserve in Germany, variations of life-history traits and vital rates were studied. Matrix analysis was used to identify the most important life-state transitions for population growth. Multiple linear regression was used to quantify the response of population traits and vital rates to changing weather conditions.
   3. Population size increased exponentially and density effects could not be observed. Flowering plants and large plants had the highest and second highest reproductive value, respectively. The population's finite rate of increase fluctuated strongly among years; life-history traits varied strongly and were interlinked, thereby violating the assumptions of matrix modelling in a population viability analysis.
   4. Some vital rates and the population growth rate showed a trend over the total period. A certain and sometimes large amount of that variability could be attributed to variability of weather conditions, with warmer winter conditions favouring population performance. Prediction of population size was fairly accurate within a time frame of 10 years, but size class structure was not.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Matrix modelling proved to be unreliable for predicting long-term population dynamics, despite the long-term data set used for matrix construction. This can be explained by weather-dependent variability of vital rates driving population dynamics. A minimum study period of 4 years is necessary to produce relevant information for model development. Our study emphasizes the need for critical evaluation of management decisions based only on single short-term studies and for studies covering longer time intervals than 2-3 years.

AB  - Human impacts (e.g., fishing, pollution, and shipping) on pelagic ecosystems are increasing, causing concerns about stresses on marine food webs. Maintaining predator-prey relationships through protection of pelagic hotspots is crucial for conservation and management of living marine resources. Biotic components of pelagic, plankton-based, ecosystems exhibit high variability in abundance in time and space (i.e., extreme patchiness), requiring investigation of persistence of abundance across trophic levels to resolve trophic hotspots. Using a 26-yr record of indicators for primary production, secondary (zooplankton and larval fish), and tertiary (seabirds) consumers, we show distributions of trophic hotspots in the southern California Current Ecosystem result from interactions between a strong upwelling center and a productive retention zone with enhanced nutrients, which concentrate prey and predators across multiple trophic levels. Trophic hotspots also overlap with human impacts, including fisheries extraction of coastal pelagic and groundfish species, as well as intense commercial shipping traffic. Spatial overlap of trophic hotspots with fisheries and shipping increases vulnerability of the ecosystem to localized depletion of forage fish, ship strikes on marine mammals, and pollution. This study represents a critical step toward resolving pelagic areas of high conservation interest for planktonic ecosystems and may serve as a model for other ocean regions where ecosystem-based management and marine spatial planning of pelagic ecosystems is warranted.

AB  - If occurrence of individual species can be modeled as a function of easily quantified environmental variables (e.g., derived from a geographic information system [GIS]) and the predictions of these models are demonstrably successful, then the scientific foundation for management planning will be strengthened. We used Bayesian logistic regression to develop predictive models for resident butterflies in the central Great Basin of western North America. Species inventory data and values for 14 environmental variables from 49 locations (segments of canyons) in the Toquima Range (Nevada, US.A.) were used to build the models. Squares of the environmental variables were also used to accommodate possibly nonmonotonic responses. We obtained statistically significant models for 36 of 56 (64%) resident species of butterflies. The models explained 8-72% of the deviance in occurrence of those species, Each of the independent variables was significant in at least one model, and squared versions of five variables contributed to models. Elevation was included in more than half of the models. Models included one to four variables; only one variable was significant in about half the models. We conducted preliminary tests of two of our models by using an existing set of data on the occurrence of butterflies in the neighboring Toiyabe Range. We compared conventional logistic classification with posterior probability distributions derived from Bayesian modeling. For the latter, we restricted our predictions to locations with a high (70%) probability of predicted presence or absence. We will perform further tests after conducting inventories at new locations in the Toquima Range and nearby Shoshone Mountains, for which we have computed environmental variables by using remotely acquired topographic data, digital-terrain and microclimatic models, and GIS computation.

AB  - Formal protected areas are a critical conservation measure so long as their tenure is defined and secure and they are well managed. Protected areas in developed countries are assumed to meet these criteria and therefore have not attracted the level of attention given to the adequacy of protected areas in developing countries. We investigate this assumption using as a case study the southern temperate rainforests of Tasmania, Australia. We examine the extent to which these rainforests are protected from potential exposure to mining, commercial logging and climate change. We analyse the tenure of Tasmania's rainforests and identify the protected area categories that prohibit or allow mining or logging. We also model the potential distribution of Nothofagus cunninghctmii, a dominant rainforest canopy tree species, to future climate and compare this with modelled current and future forest fire danger index. Results showed that 90% of the total area of Tasmanian rainforest (715,773 ha(-1)) is in a reserve. However, the area of rainforest in reserves secured from mining and/or commercial logging is only 47% (335,863 ha(-1)) as 43% (308,897 ha(-1)) is in a reserve category where these land uses are permitted. The protected area category with the highest level of protection, prohibiting all mining and logging, is the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area which encompasses 325,920 ha(-1) of temperate rainforest. During a recent legislative review, 66,012 ha(-1) of rainforest in protected areas was downgraded to a reserve category that permits logging or mining. A key conservation instrument therefore is the Management Plan for the World Heritage Area as it overrides land use activities otherwise permitted including the 21,257 ha(-1) which is on a State-defined land tenure that allows for logging or mining. Climate change impacts, as modelled, suggest the main conservation challenges are in maintaining the integrity of the remaining intact rainforest blocks and better managing ignitions from lightning strikes and arsonists in the coniferous and alpine rainforests. Allowing structural degradation and fragmentation to intact rainforest blocks will reduce their capacity to buffer meso-climatic variability and resist fire events thereby undermining their ecosystem integrity. Noting that Aichi Target 11 includes the requirement that reserves are effectively managed, our case study highlights that assessing the effectiveness of a reserve system is not necessarily a straightforward matter as governance systems and regulatory frameworks involve a mix of international obligations, national and sub national policies and statutes, along with other agreements, administrative arrangements and plans of management, which can provide for a range of land use activities and be subject to modification over time.

AB  - The prevalence of studies that discern the drivers of animal migrations is increasing exponentially, in line with raised concerns over climate-driven shifts in phenological patterns. Amphibians that breed in ephemeral wetlands are particularly vulnerable owing to the stochastic nature of their breeding habitat and high survival and reproductive costs associated with untimely migrations. Knowledge of the effects of climatic cues on the timing of amphibian migration and breeding phenologies is required to understand the potential consequences of climate change and to inform conservation plans for at-risk species. Here we use six years of count data from Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, U.S., collected between 2010 and 2016, to model the phenology of migrations of Ambystomo bishopi. Models were fit with a negative binomial error distribution, with daily values of temperature and precipitation as covariates. Models were compared in an AIC framework. We found that salamander movement was strongly tied to environmental cues. A proclivity to move over a medial range of temperatures and precipitation resulted in a 'Goldilocks' set of conditions that facilitate migration. We also discovered a role for endogenous drivers of movement, with day of year predicting above-ground activity regardless of environmental conditions. These results contribute to our basic knowledge of the behavior of A. bishopi and provide managers with useful metrics to maximize the efficacy of conservation actions. More broadly, the methods employed within have utility to amphibian researchers to help predict the effects of climate change and tailor management strategies accordingly.

AB  - The need to restore and enhance rare and threatened habitats has been recognised within the European Union under the EU Habitats and Species Directive. The United Kingdom has responded through the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) that lists 59 actions to be taken, among them to continue to protect ancient semi-natural woodlands and to encourage a steady expansion of woodland and forest cover. There is now an increasing interest and commitment to safeguard and expand the native woodland resource in Britain for landscape and natural heritage value and its restoration is a conservation priority.
   Unfortunately very little is known about the potential distribution and extent of different woodland types to guide native woodland expansion at regional and local levels. Here we developed a site suitability model that predicts and maps the distribution of existing National Vegetation Classification (NVC) woodland sub-communities and communities for current environmental conditions using a Geographical Information System (GIS) as a tool. The NVC is currently the main classification system used by the statutory and voluntary conservation organisations to describe British woodland. The Snowdonia National Park in Wales, UK, was used as a pilot area for developing and testing the methodology, but it could be used in any analysis modelling native woodland potential at a regional or large-district scale.
   The approach taken was to define the environmental spaces occupied by the fragments of NVC woodland types currently present in the National Park. The environmental spaces were then used as a template to produce maps of similar, potentially suitable sites for the occurrence of each NVC type. The results were not as clear-cut as had been hoped because of overlaps in the predicted occurrences of various woodland types. Independent verification of the predictions using non-spatial data revealed that the model produced was very poor. This was not, however, a fault of the modelling but a reflection of the fact that some of the environmental data were at too coarse a scale and that NVC types are not solely determined by environmental factors.

AB  - Studying wildlife-habitat relationships at the edges of their range can provide valuable insights into the environmental factors limiting wildlife distributions and most likely to drive extirpations and range shifts in response to landscape change. Yet the relative impact of those factors is likely different along the range margin, so it is important to identify the limitations to suitable habitat at both regional and local scales. Some of the most drastic impacts of large-scale landscape changes in North America have occurred and are forecasted in the sagebrush steppe ecosystems, where species unable to seek new habitat in the fragmented landscape will be vulnerable to climatic extremes, vegetation community shifts, and anthropogenic land use change. One of the species likely under major threat from landscape changes is the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a sagebrush obligate with habitat constraints that make it susceptible to habitat loss impacts as sagebrush systems contract and fragment at their southern range margin, already naturally fragmented. In this study, we evaluated factors of topography and land cover directly impacting habitat selection by sage-grouse in four study areas along their lagging range edge. We used >116,000 GPS locations from >90 grouse across four study areas in southern Utah and Nevada from 2014 to 2020 in habitat selection analyses using random forest models. Our results showed that sage-grouse exploit topography and sagebrush cover, possibly to break predator sight lines and moderate the risk posed by avian predators using tree perches, complicating the effects of tree cover and conifer encroachment into sagebrush habitat. We found similar trends across all four study areas, suggesting sage-grouse along the southern range margin face similar limitations. However, the effects were nonlinear and varied-models trained in one study area were only moderately successful at predicting selection in others. The local idiosyncrasies along this southern range margin indicate a need for place-based conservation for sage-grouse and other potentially imperiled species. Incorporating new understandings of local impacts will refine regional and range-wide models and support efforts to effectively create habitat and plan for range shifts by vulnerable species in response to environmental change.

AB  - The endangered Cantabrian capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus) lives at the southern edge of tetraonids' distribution range, in entirely deciduous forests. Its conservation planning has been always lek-centred. There is very little information about the specific habitat requirements of hens and broods, even though reproductive success appears to be a limiting factor. We analysed summer surveys from 1997 to 2004, carried out to estimate the reproductive success of the population. We compared the habitat characteristics at different spatial scales of hens with broods, broodless hens, and cocks in summer, with the better known spring habitat in display areas. Summer habitat showed higher proportion of open areas and was associated with more rugged zones at moderate spatial scales (78 ha) than spring habitat at display areas. Cocks and hens showed summer habitat partitioning; hens were associated with higher proportions of open and shrubby habitats. Furthermore, broodless hens preferred areas with higher slope variability than the display and summer areas preferred by cocks. These differences may reflect the sexual dimorphism of the species in reproductive role, energetic demands and conspicuousness. At larger spatial scales a previously developed habitat suitability model performed well to predict good brood-rearing areas. Hens with broods were located in the best-preserved areas in the range, mainly characterized by higher proportion of forest cover at a large (50 km(2)) scale. We suggest that these characteristics indicate refuge habitats where Cantabrian capercaillie can still breed successfully.

AB  - Mountain headwater streams have emerged as important climate refuges for native cold-water species due to their slow climate velocities and extreme physical conditions that inhibit non-native invasions. Species persisting in refuges often do so as fragmented, relict populations from broader historical distributions that are subject to ongoing habitat reductions and increasing isolation as climate change progresses. Key for conservation planning is determining where remaining populations will persist and how habitat restoration strategies can improve biological resilience to enhance the long-term prospects for species of concern. Studying bull trout, a headwater species in the northwestern USA, we developed habitat occupancy models using a data set of population occurrence in 991 natal habitat patches with a suite of novel geospatial covariates derived from high-resolution hydroclimatic scenarios and other sources representing watershed and instream habitat conditions, patch geometry, disturbance, and biological interactions. The best model correctly predicted bull trout occupancy status in 82.6% of the patches and included effects for: patch size estimated as habitat volume, extent of within-patch reaches <9 degrees C mean August temperature, distance to nearest occupied patch, road density, invasive brook trout prevalence, patch slope, and frequency of high winter flows. The model was used to assess 16 scenarios of bull trout occurrence within the study streams that represented a range of restoration strategies under three climatic conditions (baseline, moderate change, and extreme change). Results suggested that regional improvements in bull trout status were difficult to achieve in realistic restoration strategies due to the pervasive nature of climate change and the limited extent of restoration actions given their high costs. However, occurrence probabilities in a subset of patches were highly responsive to restoration actions, suggesting that targeted investments to improve the resilience of some populations may be contextually beneficial. A possible strategy, therefore, is focusing effort on responsive populations near more robust population strongholds, thereby contributing to local enclaves where dispersal among populations further enhances resilience. Equally important, strongholds constituted a small numerical percentage of patches (5%-21%), yet encompassed the large majority of occupied habitat by volume (72%-89%) and their protection could have significant conservation benefits for bull trout.

AB  - Biodiversity monitoring and data-management technologies can enhance the protection of persecuted species, such as African elephants (Loxodonta africana), through providing management-relevant information. Implementing these technologies, however, often presents several capacity and resource challenges for field staff in protected areas. In the Mid-Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZPWMA) is in the process of adopting the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) as law enforcement and data management tool for adaptive management. With the support of several conservation partners, ZPWMA was able to acquire SMART equipment (computers and handheld cyber-tracker devices) as well as train rangers and officers on how to use SMART in the region. Following the training and provision of SMART equipment, most protected areas (6 out of 7) in the Mid-Zambezi Valley have adopted SMART for law enforcement and relevant data are being collected. This study draws from the first-hand experience of training workshops, interviews with field staff, observations from support visits, and discussions with conservation partners in the Zambezi Valley. We observed that the introduction of SMART was marred by (a) technical and capacity challenges, (b) behavioral and human dynamics challenges, and (c) resources challenges. These were linked to ineptness among patrol rangers and officers, discomfort with the new technology, and uneven distribution of resources to implement SMART. To help overcome some of the challenges, we propose the development of an integrated SMART implementation plan, motivation of field staff, learning from implementation models of institutions that have successfully implemented SMART, and the provision of more SMART equipment.

AB  - The Tibetan gazelle Procapra picticaudata is on the verge of extinction in India with only c. 100 individuals remaining in the Hanle Valley of eastern Ladakh and Sikkim. Conservation planning and initiation of a recovery programme are hindered by lack of ecological information on the species and we therefore assessed the biotic and abiotic correlates of its occurrence in the Hanle Valley. Ecological attributes of areas selected by gazelles were compared with those of adjoining areas without gazelles. Resource selection functions revealed that gazelles use relatively flat areas (6-15 degrees) disproportionately during both summer and winter, and preferred south-facing slopes and avoided north-facing slopes during winter. Measurements of plant production using exclosures showed that herbivores removed up to 47% of the forage biomass from areas without gazelles, whereas only 29% was removed from areas with gazelles. Although areas selected by gazelles were only marginally more productive than areas not selected, the proportional representation of forbs in plant biomass was significantly higher in the former. Spatial co-occurrence Patterns examined using null models revealed a significant negative relationship between distribution of gazelles and goats and sheep, and a significant positive relationship between gazelles and wild kiang Equus kiang and domestic yak Bos grunniens. Future in situ recovery programmes for the Tibetan gazelle in Ladakh need to focus on securing livestock-free, forb-dominated areas, with participation from the local pastoral community.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the role of propagule pressure (P), abiotic (A), and biotic (B) factors (collectively indicated as PAB) on the suitability of the Mediterranean island of Sardinia (Italy) to be invaded by the tree Acacia saligna, recently included in the list of invasive alien species of European Union concern.
   To this aim, a binomial Generalized Linear Model was applied for disentangling the relationship between 432 A. saligna occurrence records and 10 thematic layers, at high-resolution (10 x10 m), used as proxies for the 3 categories of PAB variables. The 432 occurrence records of A. saligna were periodically monitored (period 20002018) to check the persistence of the populations and their invasive status. The predictive power of the model was evaluated by computing the mean of the AUC scores, through cross-fold validation. The model adequately described how the PAB factors influence the presence of A. saligna which is mainly shaped by abiotic factors such as topography, and biotic factors such as the presence of woody dune vegetation, and to a lesser extent by other predictors. The projection of the model to the whole island clearly shows that suitability varies at the landscape level due to the variation of the PAB across the territory. The probability of A. saligna occurrence near the coast is higher in sand dunes. In the internal areas of the island it occurs close to the roads and urban areas. This study and the tested methodology could represent a suitable tool to prioritize areas for the monitoring of A. saligna to meet the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No. 1143/2014 on Invasive Alien Species (the IAS Regulation).

AB  - Different Biogeographic provinces and environmental factors are known to influence the dispersibility of long-ranging carnivores over the landscape. However, lack of empirical data on long-ranging carnivores may lead to erroneous decisions in formulating management plans. The Indian Grey wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) is known to be distributed in the vast areas of the Indian subcontinent. However, the actual population estimates are available only for Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Bihar. Whereas, its distribution, population and habitat ecology is poorly known from the eastern region. Hence, this article aimed to evaluate the habitat suitability along with landscape connectivity for the species over the two major biogeographic provinces of India, i.e., Lower Gangetic Plains (7b) and Chhota Nagpur Plateau (6b). The present model with significantly higher Area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.981, indicates its accuracy in predicting the suitable habitats and identifying biological corridors by using environmental, topological and anthropogenic variables. Precipitation of the driest quarter and the precipitation of seasonality were the two best performing variables in our model, capable of explaining about 26% and 22.4% variation in the data respectively. Out of the total area i.e. 4,16,665 Km(2), about 18,237 Km(2) (4.37%) was found to be highly suitable area and about 3,16,803 Km(2) (76.03%) areas as least suitable. The corridor analysis indicated that the habitat connectivity was highest in the border line area of the two biotic provinces located in the south-eastern zone via districts of Purba Singhbhum and Paschim Singhbhum of Jharkhand state and Bankura and West Midnapore districts of West Bengal state. Among the Protected Areas (PAs), natural corridors exist connecting the Simlipal National Park (NP)-Satkosia Wildlife Santuray (WLS), Dalma ranges of Chotta Nagpur plateau along with Badrama WLS, Khulasuni WLS and Debrigarh WLS. Differential management through landscape level planning may be helpful in securing the future of the species in the landscape.

AB  - Aim Conservation of highly mobile species often requires identifying locations or time periods of elevated vulnerability. Since both extrinsic habitat conditions and intrinsic behavioural and energetic requirements contribute to habitat use at the landscape scale, identifying spatial or temporal foci for conservation intervention requires understanding how habitat needs and distributions vary across the annual cycle. Nearshore marine birds inhabit highly dynamic systems and have widely varying habitat needs among breeding, moult and non-breeding seasons, making them a useful case study for testing the relative contributions of individual resource requirements and environmental conditions in driving annual variation in distribution patterns. Location Northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). Methods We tracked Brown Pelicans using bird-borne GPS transmitters and used a combination of Hidden Markov Models and multivariate selectivity analysis to compare the characteristics of preferred resident habitats used throughout the annual cycle. Results Habitat selection was driven by dynamic oceanographic variables during all stages of the annual cycle. Key habitat characteristics varied between seasons, with particularly strong selection on high productivity, low temperature and low salinity during the breeding and post-breeding moult periods. The post-breeding moult also corresponded to a time of limited availability of preferred habitats, resulting in extensive overlap between breeding populations from different administrative planning areas. Main conclusions By incorporating seasonal variation in individual behaviour and resource requirements into our habitat models, we were able to identify the post-breeding moult as a period of high selectivity and restricted availability of preferred habitats for Brown Pelicans. Locations meeting preferred habitat criteria during the post-breeding period, particularly estuarine habitats with high productivity and low salinity, would therefore be high-value targets for management and restoration. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for both intrinsic and extrinsic temporal variation in evaluating habitat selection.

AB  - We analyzed and predicted spatial patterns of turnover in macroalgal community composition (beta diversity) that accounted for broad-scale environmental gradients using two contrasting community modelling methods, Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM) and Gradient Forest Modelling (GFM). Percentage cover data from underwater macroalgal surveys of subtidal rocky reefs along the southeastern coastline of continental Australia and northern coastline of Tasmania were combined with 0.01 degrees-resolution gridded environmental variables, to develop statistical models of beta diversity. GDM, a statistical approach based on a matrix regression, and GFM, a machine learning approach based on ensemble tree based methods, were used to fit models and generate predictions of beta diversity within unsurveyed areas across the region of interest. Patterns of macroalgal beta diversity predicted by both methods were remarkably congruent and showed a similar and striking change in community composition from eastern South Australia to western Victoria and northern Tasmania. Macroalgal communities differed markedly in predicted composition between the open coast and inshore locations. A distinct algal community was predicted for the enclosed Port Philip Bay in Victoria. Sea surface temperature standard deviation and average contributed most to changes in beta diversity for both the GDM and GFM models; changes in wave exposure and oxygen also influenced beta diversity in the GDM model, while salinity and exposure contributed substantially to the GFM model. The GDM and GFM analyses allowed us to model and predict spatial patterns of beta diversity in macroalgal communities comprising > 180 species over 6600 km of coastline. These outputs advance regional-scale conservation management by allowing planners to interpolate from point source ecological data to assess the distribution of biodiversity across their full domain of interest. The congruence between methods suggests that strong environmental gradients related to temperature and exposure are the common drivers of community change in this region.

AB  - Besides protected areas multi-functionally managed forests play an important role in the effort to maintain biodiversity, particularly in areas of intensive historical and current land use. The integration of biodiversity issues under the umbrella of sustainable forest management (SFM) is thus vital to achieve conservation goals. A major challenge for SFM is climate change, and science-based assessment and decision support frameworks are required to address climatic uncertainties in management planning. In this contribution we address issues of biodiversity in the context of a climate change vulnerability assessment framework for 164,550 ha of mountain forests managed by the Austrian Federal Forests (AFF). The principal tools applied to study climate-forest-management interactions and their implications for the multiple objectives of SFM were the ecosystem model PICUS v1.4, multi-criteria analysis and a stakeholder dialogue with the AFF. With this study framework as an example, our objective was to highlight the role of biodiversity within climate change vulnerability assessment of SFM. We found only limited climate sensitivity of SFM biodiversity indicators, compared to production-oriented aspects, as a result of strong management-mediated controls on forest structure and composition. Consequently, overall SFM climate vulnerability was decreasing in the assessment framework with increasing preference weight on biodiversity. However, the role and effect of biodiversity within the multi-indicator assessment framework differed strongly over elevation belts. Our analysis highlights (i) the importance of a realistic consideration of management in assessing biodiversity under SFM: (ii) the need for a concise definition of goals and thresholds for biodiversity conservation in managed forests: (iii) the importance of the local context in defining and interpreting indicators; and (iv) the relevance of an integrated assessment of dynamically interacting processes and indicators, such as disturbances, management and biodiversity.

AB  - Loss and deterioration of habitats are major threats for Tetrao urogallus in central Europe, where forestsare highly fragmented and forest practices have distinctly changed during the last decades. Habitat models are important tools for conservation planning, often relying on presence-absence data. We mapped indirect signs of Tetrao urogallus presence as well as habitat variables over a series of seven study areas in the Austrian Alps, situated on limestone and on silicate rock. We modelled habitat use of Tetrao urogallus with one parametric approach (binary logistic regression) and two machine learning classification algorithms (classification trees and random forests) for both geological substrata separately. All three modelling approaches performed equally well in terms of accuracy or predictive power, but differed in model calibration. Three variables significantly contributed to all three habitat models on limestone and on silicate substrate, respectively, i.e. the cover of field-layer, the cover of dwarf shrubs and the proportion of deciduous trees in forest stands on limestone and the cover of field-layer, the canopy cover and the occurrence of Abies alba and/or Pinus sylvestris in forest stands on silicate rock. Some variables like the cover of Rubus sp. appeared in several models, which are not frequently mentioned in other studies. There have been some explanatory variables, which would have been missed, when applying just one single modelling approach, for example the occurrence of forest edges, the availability of canopy gaps and the supply of ant hills. Our results suggest differing habitat management strategies on limestone and on silicate rock. Considering the large spatial requirements of Tetrao urogallus the necessity of active habitat management for Tetrao urogallus becomes obvious. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exurban development is consuming wildlife habitat within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem with potential consequences to the long-term conservation of grizzly bears Ursus arctos. We assessed the impacts of alternative future land-use scenarios by linking an existing regression-based simulation model predicting rural development with a spatially explicit model that predicted bear survival. Using demographic criteria that predict population trajectory, we portioned habitats into either source or sink, and projected the loss of source habitat associated with four different build out (new home construction) scenarios through 2020. Under boom growth, we predicted that 12 km(2) of source habitat were converted to sink habitat within the Grizzly Bear Recovery Zone (RZ), 189 km(2) were converted within the current distribution of grizzly bears outside of the RZ, and 289 km(2) were converted in the area outside the RZ identified as suitable grizzly bear habitat. Our findings showed that extremely low densities of residential development created sink habitats. We suggest that tools, such as those outlined in this article, in addition to zoning and subdivision regulation may prove more practical, and the most effective means of retaining large areas of undeveloped land and conserving grizzly bear source habitat will likely require a landscape-scale approach. We recommend a focus on land conservation efforts that retain open space (easements, purchases and trades) coupled with the implementation of 'bear community programmes' on an ecosystem wide basis in an effort to minimize huthan-bear conflicts, minimize management-related bear mortalities associated with preventable conflicts and to safeguard human communities. Our approach has application to other species and areas, and it has illustrated how spatially explicit demographic models can be combined with models predicting land-use change to help focus conservation priorities.

AB  - Migratory stopover habitats are often not part of planning for conservation or new development projects. We identified potential stopover habitats within an avian migratory flyway and demonstrated how this information can guide the site-selection process for new development. We used the random forests modeling approach to map the distribution of predicted stopover habitat for the Whooping Crane (Grus americana), an endangered species whose migratory flyway overlaps with an area where wind energy development is expected to become increasingly important. We then used this information to identify areas for potential wind power development in a U.S. state within the flyway (Nebraska) that minimize conflicts between Whooping Crane stopover habitat and the development of clean, renewable energy sources. Up to 54% of our study area was predicted to be unsuitable as Whooping Crane stopover habitat and could be considered relatively low risk for conflicts between Whooping Cranes and wind energy development. We suggest that this type of analysis be incorporated into the habitat conservation planning process in areas where incidental take permits are being considered for Whooping Cranes or other species of concern. Field surveys should always be conducted prior to construction to verify model predictions and understand baseline conditions. Prediccion y Mapeo del Habitat Potencial de Descanso de la Grulla Americana para Guiar la Seleccion de Sitios para Proyectos de Energia Eolica.
   Resumen Los habitats de descanso migratorio frecuentemente no son parte de la planeacion de la conservacion o proyectos de desarrollo nuevos. Identificamos habitats de descanso potenciales dentro de una via de aves migratorias y demostramos como esta informacion puede guiar en la seleccion de sitios para nuevos desarrollos. Usamos el acercamiento del modelo de bosques aleatorios para mapear la distribucion del habitat de descanso predicho de la grulla americana (Grus americana), una especie en peligro cuya via migratoria se traslapa con un area donde se espera que el desarrollo de energia eolica se vuelva cada vez mas importante. Usamos esta informacion para identificar areas para el desarrollo potencial de poder eolico en un estado de los E.U.A. dentro de la via de vuelo (Nebraska) que minimicen los conflictos entre el habitat de descanso de la grulla y el desarrollo de fuentes de energia limpias y renovables. Hasta el 54% de nuestra area de estudio fue predicha como inapropiada como un habitat de descanso para la grulla y podria considerarse como de bajo riesgo para conflictos entre las grullas y el desarrollo de energia eolica. Sugerimos que este tipo de analisis sea incorporado al proceso de planeacion de conservacion de habitat en areas donde permisos de toma incidentales estan siendo considerados para grullas americanas u otras especies de preocupacion. El muestreo en campo debera ser hecho siempre antes de la construccion para verificar las predicciones del modelo y entender las condiciones basales.

AB  - Silvopastoralism in New Zealand's highly erodible hill country is an important form of erosion and sediment control. Yet, there has been little quantitative work to establish the effectiveness of space-planted trees in reducing shallow landslide erosion. We propose a method to provide high-resolution spatially explicit individual tree influence models at landscape scale for the dominant species in pastoral hill country. The combined hydrological and mechanical influence of trees on slopes is inferred through the spatial relationship between trees and landslide erosion. First, we delineate individual tree crowns and classify these into four dominant species classes found in New Zealand's pastoral hill country. This is the first species classification of individual trees at landscape scale in New Zealand using freely accessible data, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.6%. Second, we develop tree influence models for each species class by means of inductive inference. The inferred empirical tree influence models largely agree with the shape and distribution of existing physical root reinforcement models. Of exotic species that were planted for erosion and sediment control, poplars (Populus spp.) and willows (Salix spp.) make up 51% (109,000 trees) in pastoral hill country at a mean density of 3.2 trees/ha. In line with previous studies, poplars and willows have the greatest contribution to slope stability with an average maximum effective distance of 20 m. Yet, native kanuka (Kunzea spp.) is the most abundant woody vegetation species in pastoral hill country within the study area, with an average of 24.1 stems per ha (sph), providing an important soil conservation function. A large proportion (56% or 212.5 km(2)) of pastoral hill-country in the study area remains untreated. The tree influence models presented in this study can be integrated into landslide susceptibility modelling in silvopastoral landscapes to both quantify the reduction in landslide susceptibility achieved and support targeted erosion and sediment mitigation plans.

AB  - Amphibians are declining worldwide and one of the major causes of such decline is habitat loss. Forestry practices have a primary role in causing habitat loss and fragmentation, detrimental to amphibians. We studied the ecological requirements of a fully terrestrial and threatened amphibian, the Golden Alpine Salamander Salamandra atra aurorae, which is endemic to a small portion of the Italian Alps. This rare and elusive salamander lives exclusively in forest environments and forestry practices are considered among its major threats. We employed both a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and an occupancy approach in fifty 400 m(2) plots, within a managed mixed forest dominated by Norway spruce and to a lesser extent beech, and silver fir. Modelling salamander occupancy as a function of site-specific habitat features allowed us to understand the ecological requirements of this salamander and provide precise guidelines for forest management. The application of hierarchical models (occupancy) for evaluating forest management plans is highly effective, requires less effort and is a less impacting methodology than CMR performed by searching for salamanders under shelters also in non-optimal weather conditions. Distance from open pasture edges significantly affects the distribution of salamanders while, at a smaller scale, brushwood piles, classified as fine woody debris (FWD, diameter from 1 to 10 cm), play a key role in providing suitable habitat for this endangered amphibian. The importance of FWD in the conservation of small vertebrates is generally poorly studied and probably underestimated. However, our results show that FWD should be considered as an additional element that has to be managed to enhance habitat suitability for this and, intuitively, for other small forest vertebrates.

AB  - Aim Land-use change leads to local climatic changes, which can induce shifts in community composition. Indeed, human-altered land uses favour species able to tolerate greater temperature and precipitation extremes. However, environmental changes do not impact species uniformly across their distributions, and most research exploring the impacts of climatic changes driven by land use has not considered potential within-range variation. We explored whether a population's climatic position (the difference between species' thermal and precipitation tolerance limits and the environmental conditions a population experiences) influences their relative abundance across land-use types.
   Location Global.
   Methods Using a global dataset of terrestrial vertebrate species and estimating their realized climatic tolerance limits, we analysed how the abundance of species within human-altered habitats relative to that in natural habitats varied across different climatic positions (controlling for proximity to geographic range edge).
   Results A population's thermal position strongly influenced abundance within human-altered land uses (e.g. agriculture). Where temperature extremes were closer to species' thermal limits, population abundances were lower in human-altered land uses (relative to natural habitat) compared to areas further from these limits. These effects were generally stronger at tropical compared to temperate latitudes. In contrast, the influences of precipitation position were more complex and often differed between land uses and geographic zones. Mapping the outcome of models revealed strong spatial variation in the potential severity of decline for vertebrate populations following conversion from natural habitat to cropland or pasture, due to their climatic position.
   Main conclusions We highlight within-range variation in species' responses to land use, driven (at least partly), by differences in climatic position. Accounting for spatial variation in responses to environmental changes is critical when predicting population vulnerability, producing successful conservation plans, and exploring how biodiversity may be impacted by future land-use and climate change interactions.

AB  - Owing to habitat conversion and conflict with humans, many carnivores are of conservation concern. Because of their elusive nature, camera trapping is a standard tool for studying carnivores. In many vertebrates, sex-specific differences in movements - and therefore detection by cameras - are likely. We used camera trapping data and spatially explicit sex-specific capture-recapture models to estimate jaguar density in Emas National Park in the central Brazilian Cerrado grassland, an ecological hotspot of international importance. Our spatially explicit model considered differences in movements and trap encounter rate between genders and the location of camera traps (on/off road). We compared results with estimates from a sex-specific non-spatial capture-recapture model. The spatial model estimated a density of 0.29 jaguars 100 km(-2) and showed that males moved larger distances and had higher trap encounter rates than females. Encounter rates with off-road traps were one tenth of those for on-road traps. In the non-spatial model, males had a higher capture probability than females; density was estimated at 0.62 individuals 100 km(-2). The non-spatial model likely overestimated density because it did not adequately account for animal movements. The spatial model probably underestimated density because it assumed a uniform distribution of jaguars within and outside the reserve. Overall, the spatial model is preferable because it explicitly considers animal movements and allows incorporating site-specific and individual covariates. With both methods, jaguar density was lower than reported from most other study sites. For rare species such as grassland jaguars, spatially explicit capture-recapture models present an important advance for informed conservation planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of fishing have been documented across coral reefs worldwide. No-take marine reserves do not only act as a conservation tool but also allow an opportunity to study impacts of fishing, by acting as control sites. In addition, well-planned and well-managed no-take marine reserves (NTRs) provide conservation benefits that are essential to marine biodiversity and ecosystem-based management. The Abrolhos Marine National Park, off the tropical Brazilian coast, protects part of the largest coral reef system in the South Atlantic. To investigate the effects of fishing on reef fish richness, abundance, biomass, and functional diversity of the fish assemblage, we compared sites across two protection levels considering the variation in habitats (Fringing Reefs-Protected; Pinnacles Reefs-Protected; and Coastal Reefs-Open Access), using Baited Remote Underwater Stereo-Video systems (stereo-BRUVs). We adjusted generalized additive mixed models of fish assemblage characteristics with protection levels and environmental variables, such as topographic complexity (mean relief and relief variation), visibility, and benthic cover percentage. Inside NTRs, we found higher total biomass and biomass of fishery target species and carnivores, specifically for the Carcharhinidae (sharks) and Epinephelidae (groupers) families, indicating direct fisheries effects on these groups. In contrast, the ecological parameters of non-target fish were positively correlated with habitat characteristics, including mean relief and variance of relief. Moreover, fish functional diversity was higher within NTRs, demonstrating an even distribution of functional entities. The presence of large mobile predators and the overall higher biomass of carnivores inside the NTR indicate the effect of fishing exclusion. Our results point to the value of NTRs to study the effects of fishing and achieve biodiversity conservation and suggest the importance of using remote sampling methods to assess large mobile predators.

AB  - 1. Spread of alien species (AS) is a serious threat to marine habitats and analysis of principal descriptors of their occurrence is pivotal to set reliable conservation strategies. 2. In order to assess the susceptibility of marine habitats to biological invasions, a dataset was gathered of the occurrence of 3899 species from 29 phyla, taken from 93 marine sites located along the Italian coast in the period 2000-2012. 3. In total, 61 AS belonging to 11 phyla have been recorded. Invertebrates were the most represented (63%). Alien species were found in all the habitats examined (EUNIS, level 2), although they showed highest abundance in benthic habitats. Most of the AS were associated with a single EUNIS habitat, while some of them were present in more than one habitat. Trans-habitat occurrence suggests the potential invasiveness of AS. 4. According to statistical analysis, AS recorded could have been more numerous, since some of the marine habitats seemed to be still unsaturated. The model that best describes the spread of AS takes account of both native species richness (Rn) and EUNIS habitat type as explanatory variables. The number of observed AS was directly related to Rn and it was highest in rocky circalittoral and infralittoral habitats. 5. The results of this macro-ecological study focus on the importance of performing large-scale studies, since adopting ecosystem approaches to marine invasion management seems especially fruitful. 6. The results, moreover, highlight the importance of AS monitoring of different habitats, from those subjected to anthropogenic pressure, historically considered to be hubs of introduction of AS, to the most biologically rich and diverse marine habitats. Indeed, it is necessary to set monitoring strategies to detect the introduction, the distribution and persistence of AS over time. These recommendations are especially significant in the light of the strategic plans currently under formulation in Mediterranean countries with regard to AS monitoring.

AB  - Estuaries have long been recognized as nursery habitats for various marine fish species. As seascapes consisting of a mosaic of habitat patches, estuarine nurseries incorporate ecological processes such as ontogenetic shifts. To improve our understanding of the habitat requirement changes of nursery species within the estuarine seascape, habitat suitability models were built using boosted regression trees for three size classes of European flounder (Platichthys flesus) juveniles. The models combined several dynamic and static predictors, from physical and chemical water parameters to biological and physical habitat variables. The relationships between juveniles and predictor variables varied with size, potentially indicating the dynamics of habitat use for the juvenile flounder inside the estuarine nursery. Younger post-settled juveniles tended to be spatially constrained to a shallow upstream area and, with size, there were ontogenetic shifts to the middle estuary. This demonstrates the importance of considering different life stages when developing essential fish habitat maps, which reflect fine scale temporal and spatial distributions. Given the high level of anthropogenic pressures to which estuaries are subjected, the consideration of fish ontogenetic habitat requirements within the estuarine nursery is needed to identify high-value areas, and is valuable for developing effective spatial and temporal management plans. These are essential to fully protect the most sensitive life stages, such as early post-settlement stages occupying transient habitats. Additionally, and as the juvenile-habitat associations can rapidly change, fine-scale connectivity in the estuarine nursery becomes even more relevant in determining recruitment. Connectivity should therefore be central in conservation planning, in order to sustain estuarine and marine adult populations, and ultimately maintaining the fisheries.

AB  - Species distribution modelling has been used to identify critical habitats for the delimitation of Marine Protected Areas. Although Marine Protected Areas may often overlap with the distribution of key marine species, illegal human activities often continue within these areas, causing negative impacts on the local biodiversity.
   A generalized linear model with spatial eigenvector mapping was used to investigate, for the first time, the influence of environmental variables and anthropic activities on the number of Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis sightings/grid, and to determine whether a Marine Reserve, in south-eastern Brazil, is adequate for the protection of the local population. Data were collected between May 2007 and October 2013 onboard a 7.5-m vessel with an inboard engine.
   The models for the different periods (annual, dry, and rainy seasons) all indicated that depth, the distance to seafood farms and fishing grounds, and mean sea surface temperatures influenced the distribution of the dolphins within the study area. The annual and seasonal models predicted that the dolphins prefer a continuous area between Cedro and Pico Islands, a large area that lies outside the limits of the Marine Reserve.
   Although the habitat of Ilha Grande bay is still much less degraded than that inhabited by other nearby Guiana dolphin populations, the results of the present study indicate that anthropic activities in this area influence habitat use by the dolphins. Less than 30% of the area used by the dolphins is protected by the Tamoios Ecological Station (ESEC Tamoios).
   Sotalia guianensis is classified as 'Vulnerable' in Brazil, although the marine reserve (ESEC Tamoios) does not protect the core area used by the local dolphin population. The results of the present study provide specific locations for the creation of a new multiple-use MPA, as suggested by the Brazilian National Action Plan for the Conservation of Small Cetaceans, or the inclusion of a special management programme for the area between Cedro and Pico islands to better protect the dolphins in the ESEC Tamoios buffer zone. The continuation of surveys to better understand the current and future impacts of human activities, and the development of a closer interaction with both the local community and local stakeholders will help to safeguard Ilha Grande Bay and the local Guiana dolphin population.

AB  - Habitat quality is a fundamental driver of species distributions and population outcomes but is often difficult to measure and compare alongside measures of habitat amount and fragmentation. Consequently, habitat quality is often omitted from many landscape-level habitat analyses or more indirectly or subjectively represented in resulting habitat management or conservation planning. Yet, the implications of this conceptual and planning omission are poorly understood. We lack general theory that identifies the conditions under which habitat quality is expected to play a vital role in characterizing local and regional population responses. Using a factorial simulation design, we examined the independent contributions of habitat quality, amount, and fragmentation to population persistence to identify the conditions under which habitat quality might be expected to play a more important role than those of habitat amount or fragmentation. We generated a wide range of fractal landscapes, independently varying in habitat amount, fragmentation, and quality in QRule. We simulated interactive animal movement, habitat selection, and persistence for r and K strategist species with short and long dispersal abilities using spatially explicit individual-based models developed in HexSim. Population abundance and extinction risk were recorded through time for each landscape-species combination and used to quantify the relative influence of habitat amount, fragmentation, and landscape quality on population outcomes. We found that habitat degradation influenced extinction risk through a wide range of landscape conditions and species attributes. The most severe extinction responses were observed in scenarios of combined habitat loss and degradation, suggesting that the interactive effects of these variables may greatly affect persistence. Landscape quality modified extinction risks associated with habitat amount-fragmentation thresholds, and we found evidence for quality-based extinction thresholds as habitat was degraded. The strength of landscape-level quality on extinction risk outcomes suggests that habitat degradation should be further investigated as a major driver of population responses to landscape change. A more inclusive paradigm may be required to elucidate the general influences landscape change on population extinction. Habitat degradation, along with habitat loss and fragmentation, should be explicitly considered when assessing the implications of landscape change on population extinction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the face of increasing climate-related impacts on coral reefs, the integration of ecosystem resilience into marine conservation planning has become a priority. One strategy, including resilient areas in marine protected area (MPA) networks, relies on information on the spatial distribution of resilience. We assess the ability to model and map six indicators of coral reef resilience-stress-tolerant coral taxa, coral generic diversity, fish herbivore biomass, fish herbivore functional group richness, density of juvenile corals and the cover of live coral and crustose coralline algae. We use high spatial resolution satellite data to derive environmental predictors and use these in random forest models, with field observations, to predict resilience indicator values at unsampled locations. Predictions are compared with those obtained from universal kriging and from a baseline model. Prediction errors are estimated using cross-validation, and the ability to map each resilience indicator is quantified as the percentage reduction in prediction error compared to the baseline model. Results are most promising (percentage reduction = 18.3%) for mapping the cover of live coral and crustose coralline algae and least promising (percentage reduction = 0%) for coral diversity. Our study has demonstrated one approach to map indicators of coral reef resilience. In the context of MPA network planning, the potential to consider reef resilience in addition to habitat and feature representation in decision-support software now exists, allowing planners to integrate aspects of reef resilience in MPA network development.

AB  - Worldwide landscape changes and the uncertainty about its impacts on species abundances, distributions and on ecosystems structure and functioning, have been increasing the value of modelling tools in a very obvious way. Thirteen years ago, the first holistic stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM) application was published (Ecological Indicators 3(4), 285-303 by Santos and Cabral (2004)) intended for predicting ecological indicators trends in face of realistic scenarios of land use/land cover changes. The application of this StDM framework provided some basis to simulate landscape changes and predict the subsequent response of pertinent ecological indicators. Nevertheless, the results reliability could only be evaluated with subsequent independent information checking. In this work, based on independent data obtained thirteen years after, we compare the simulated land use changes and predicted responses of the selected ecological indicators with the respective real trends. The comparisons made confirmed that the implemented scenario was realistic and the ecological indicators' response mostly accurate. This allowed for demonstrating the proposed frameworks potential and its use in landscape planning and managing of agro-environmental measures. Our approach also provides a promising and intuitive baseline to support risk assessments for land use changes, derived from ecological models linked with ecological monitoring, crucial to guide decision makers and environmental managers.

AB  - Seasonal changes in food availability influence the behavior and diet of primates, and an understanding of dietary changes is important for the development of informed conservation plans. Saimiri vanzolinii is a small-bodied, omnivorous squirrel monkey endemic to the floodplain forests in Central Amazonia. It has a restricted distribution of only ca. 870 km(2) and is classified as Vulnerable. We examined seasonal variation in this species' diet. We collected phenological (presence and absence of ripe fruits from 205 tree species) and dietary and behavioral data for unhabituated groups of S. vanzolinii on nine 2-km transects in the floodplain forests of Central Amazonia for 2 years, encompassing the high-water and low-water periods. Fruit availability was higher, and the monkeys traveled less and fed more during the high-water than the low-water period. There were no seasonal differences between the high-water and low-water periods in the time spent feeding on fruits, flowers, or arthropods. S. vanzolinii spent more time consuming fruit than arthropods in the high-water period, but this was not the case in the low-water period. These findings suggest that food selection changed between seasons, and S. vanzolinii focused more on fruit in the low-water period, when fruit was less available, than in the high-water period, when fruit was more available.

AB  - The increasing number of wind farms for energy production raises concerns about their effects on wildlife and particularly on birds. To date it is unclear whether models that combine data on wind turbine densities and habitat suitability can explain the actual spatial occurrence of collision fatalities and how well these models perform in comparison to models including measures of bird population densities (e.g., the distribution and density of nest sites). Here we analysed whether collision mortality increases with wind turbine density and whether a high population density or habitat suitability in the vicinity of wind turbines amplifies the effect of wind turbine density on collision mortality. We combined opportunistic records of dead White-tailed Eagles by the public in Northeast Germany during the period 2003 to 2014 with data on the distribution of wind turbines, nest sites and habitat suitability. As expected, wind turbine density was a strong predictor of collision mortality. In addition, we found that wind turbine density and habitat suitability had synergistic effects on collision mortality, so that the effect of wind turbine density was amplified in areas of high habitat suitability. Moreover, combining wind turbine density and habitat suitability allowed for better predictions of collision mortality than combining wind turbine density and nest site density. These results suggest that assessments of the spatial occurrence of collision fatalities based on models that combine data on wind turbine densities and habitat suitability can be useful for the strategic planning of wind farm development on regional scales. In particular, our study highlights that wind turbines should not be placed in core population areas of vulnerable bird species because synergies between wind turbine densities and habitat suitability may cause disproportionate increases in mortality. This might undermine the positive effects of parallel conservation efforts.

AB  - For odontocetes, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can be used to differentiate between occurrence and foraging through analysis of click characteristics. Feeing buzzes and navigation/searching echolocation clicks of harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) were differentiated within C-POD data from northwest Ireland between 2009 and 2017. The spatiotemporal distribution of foraging behavior was investigated using generalized additive modelling, at multiple temporal scales. Both the presence/absence of buzzes and foraging intensity (defined by buzz:click ratios) were determined. Feeding buzzes were identified in one third of porpoise positive hours, ranging from 15% in summer, to 40% in autumn, highlighting seasonal variation irrespective of porpoise occurrence. Complex interannual variation in foraging behavior was also shown across the time series. A strong nocturnal peak in foraging intensity was observed. We found increased porpoise foraging with dolphin species detections within the same hour, and a negative impact of construction activities, involving both impulsive and broadband noise. Results highlight the value of long-term acoustic time series, by quantifying variation, and show that extracting foraging behavior from occurrence data can help to unravel habitat use patterns, responses to disturbance, and seasonal changes in behavior. Understanding when and how a species uses an area can better inform marine spatial planning and help mitigate anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Our understanding of migratory birds' year-round ecology and evolution remains patchy despite recent fundamental advances. Periodic reviews focus future research and inform conservation and management; here, we take advantage of our combined experiences working on Western Hemisphere avian migration systems to highlight recent lessons and critical gaps in knowledge. Among topics discussed are: (1) The pipeline from pure to applied researchers leaves room for improvement. (2) Population limitation and regulation includes both seasonal and between-season interactions. (3) The study of movements of small-bodied species remains a major research frontier. (4) We must increase our understanding of population connectivity. (5) With few exceptions, population regulation has barely been investigated. (6) We have increasingly integrated landscape configuration of habitats, large-scale habitat disturbances, and habitat quality impacts into models of seasonal and overall demographic success. (7) The post-breeding season (late summer for latitudinal migrants) is increasingly appreciated for its impacts on demography. (8) We recognize the diverse ways that avian brood parasites, nest predators, and food availability affect demography. (9) Source-sink and meta-population models help us understand migratory avian distributions among fragmented habitats. (10) Advances in modeling have improved estimates of annual survival and fecundity, but for few species. (11) Populations can be limited by ecological conditions in winter, but habitat needs are poorly known for most species at this time. (12) Migration tends to occupy broad spatial fronts that may change seasonally or when migrants cross major barriers. (13) En route conditions can limit migrant populations; linking migration habitat quality indicators to fitness or population consequences presents a major challenge. (14) A variety of intra-tropical Neotropical migration patterns are recognizable,. but almost nothing is known about these systems beyond descriptions of a few typical species' movements. (15) Global climate change scenarios predict range and phenology shifts of Neotropical migrant bird populations that must be considered in conservation plans. Future studies will depend on new technologies and the integration of modeling with sophisticated, large-spatial-scale measurement and parameter estimation; whether the pace of research and management involving migratory birds can match the growth of environmental threats remains to be seen.

AB  - Mountain regions are centers of biodiversity endemism at a global scale but the role of arid-zone mountain ranges in shaping biodiversity patterns is poorly understood. Focusing on three guilds of taxa from a desert upland refugium in Australia, we sought to determine: (a) the relative extent to which climate, terrain or geological substrate predict endemism, and (b) whether patterns of endemism are complimentary across broad taxonomic guilds. We mapped regional endemism for plants, land snails, and vertebrates using combined Species Distribution Models (SDMs) for all endemic taxa (n = 82). We then modelled predictors of endemism using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) and geology, terrain, and climate variables. We tested for the presence of inter- and intraguild hotspots of endemism. Many individual plant and land snail taxa were tightly linked with geology, corresponding to small distributions. Conversely, most vertebrate taxa were not constrained to specific geological substrates and occurred over larger areas. However, across all three guilds climate was the strongest predictor of regional endemism, particularly for plants wherein discrete hotspots of endemism were buffered from extreme summer temperatures. Land snail and vertebrate endemism peaked in areas with highest precipitation in the driest times of the year. Hotspots of endemism within each guild poorly predicted endemism in other guilds. We found an overarching signal that climatic gradients play a dominant role in the persistence of endemic taxa in an arid-zone mountain range system. An association with higher rainfall and cooler temperatures indicates that continuing trends toward hotter and drier climates may lead to range contractions in this, and potentially other, arid-zone mountain biotas. Contrasting patterns of endemism across guilds highlight the need to couple comprehensive regional planning for the protection of climate refugia, with targeted management of more localized and habitat specialist taxa.

AB  - This study examined the distribution of Lonicera maackii (Amur honeysuckle) in a 5.2-ha old-regrowth deciduous forest in southwestern Ohio, and focused on its associations with: (1) forest-edge and internal-forest conditions; and (2) composition and structure of the native flora. Fine-scale vegetation patterns were measured in 60 nested plots and mapped with a geographic information system. L. maackii accounted for 24% of the relative importance of understory trees and shrubs based on its density (3361/ha), frequency (95%), and basal area (1.89m(2)/ha). Within-patch densities correlated significantly with edge attributes, but stem-basal areas were best explained by a covariate model that coupled edge conditions with internal topographic settings. Detrended correspondence analysis identified spatial patterns of community diversity in the understory native flora, and honeysuckle abundances were highest in small discontinuous community patches. Species richness and densities of native shrubs (Lindera benzoin and Viburnum prunifolium) and Acer saccharum saplings were lower when honeysuckle abundances were >3000/ha and/or basal areas were >4 m(2)/ha. These findings identified the importance of forest-edge and internal-forest conditions on spatial patterns of invasion by L. maackii and support management plans that target locations within a forest patch and forest-patch locations of highest potential impact.

AB  - Among the most productive ecosystems around the world, wetlands support a wide range of biodiversity such as waterfowl, fish, amphibians, plants and many other species. They also provide ecosystem services that play important roles in relation to nutrient cycling, climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as food security. In this research, we examined and projected the spatiotemporal trends of change in open wetlands by coupling logistic regression, Markov chain methods and a multi-objective land allocation model into a hybrid geosimulation model. To study the changes in open wetlands we used multi-temporal land cover information interpreted from LANDSAT images (1985, 1995, and 2005). We predicted future spatial distributions of open wetlands in the administrative region of Abitibi-Temiscamingue, Quebec, Canada for 2015, 2025, 2035, 2045 and 2055. A comparison and assessment of the model's outcomes were performed using map-comparison techniques as well as landscape metrics. Change analysis between 1985 and 2005 showed an increase of about 63% in open wetlands, while simulation results indicated that this tendency would persist into 2055 with a continuous augmentation of open wetlands in the region. The spatial distribution of predicted trends in open wetlands could provide support to local biodiversity assessments, management and conservation planning of the open wetlands in Quebec, Canada.

CP  - North American Science Symposium on Toward a Unified Framework for Inventorying and Monitoring Forest Ecosystem Resources
AB  - In 1996 the Smithsonian's Monitoring and Assessment of Biodiversity Program (SI/MAB) and Shell Prospecting and Development B.V. Peru, in cooperation with Peruvian and international organizations launched a multi-disciplinary assessment and monitoring program for the Camisea region of Peru. The area is located east of the Andes along the Urubamba River. Located northwest of the Manu National Park, the area is considered one of the most species rich regions of the world. One of the largest gas reservoirs for South America is located in this biologically and culturally sensitive area.
   The project was designed to evaluate the impact of development on biodiversity following an adaptive management process-setting objectives, carrying out an assessment and monitoring plan for forest biodiversity, evaluation, and decisionmaking. The cyclical nature of the process was maintained through refining the objectives and management decisions based on the results. Thus, adaptive management gives managers the flexibility to adjust on-the-ground practices. This scheme of cooperation allowed more sound development decisions including the decision to avoid the creation of permanent roads, locating the gas processing plant in a biologically less sensitive area, the revegetation of disturbed sites with native species, and the use of underground pipelines.
   Six biological components (vegetation, mammals, arthropods, amphibian and reptiles, birds and aquatic systems) were inventoried in the initial assessment phase. The sites were selected to provide information on areas that would be potentially impacted by development. In addition, a strong local community program was established, and two workshops resulted in the implementation of a training program to build in-country capacity for biodiversity monitoring. A conceptual multi-disciplinary model far monitoring was developed to assess the impact of gas extraction, processing, and transport on the local biodiversity.
   The Camisea project is now coming to an end due to the Peruvian Government and Shell being unable to agree on the natural gas distribution, and subsequent monitoring phases will not continue. Nevertheless, we have had the opportunity to forge a relationship with industry that was beneficial for conservation. In addition, we feel that Shell's approach has now created a precedent that may well be incorporated into the industry by other companies. As conservation biologists we must be prepared to seek and forge other similar relationships that can benefit our natural environment.

AB  - Eastern gray whales' distribution range and plasticity in feeding behavior complicates the understanding of critical life-history such as pregnancy and lactation. Our goal was to determine if females who experienced gestation, gave birth, and lactated their calves, assimilated a high proportion of benthic amphipods from the Bering Sea, which are considered the species' main prey. We used Bayesian stable isotope mixing models to estimate the probability of contribution of food items sampled along the species' distributional range, using isotopic data on amphipods from the Bering Sea, mysids from Vancouver Island, and amphipods and polychaetes from Ojo de Liebre Lagoon. We sampled epidermal tissue from lactating females (n = 25) and calves (n = 34) and analyzed their carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition. Model outcome indicated that benthic amphipods from the Bering Sea were not the primary food for the eastern gray whale. Each mother performed a different feeding strategy, and prey from Vancouver Island were generally as important as that from the Bering Sea. Moreover, model results indicate a constant use of Ojo de Liebre Lagoon as a feeding ground. Our results appear to agree with previous studies that report continuous feeding by females to satisfy certain physiological requirements (e.g., fatty acids omega-6) during migration and breeding time. Future investigations of the isotopic composition of all those prey items that could be assimilated by the eastern gray whale emerge as critical. Both historical and recent information, that would provide insights in the species feeding ecology under past and present environmental conditions, should be considered as equally important to establish conservation and management plans.

AB  - In the framework of climate change, the increase in ocean heat wave frequency is expected to impact marine life. Large-scale positive temperature anomalies already occurred in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea in 1999, 2003 and 2006. These anomalies were associated with mass mortality events of macrobenthic species in coastal areas (0-40 m in depth). The anomalies were particularly severe in 1999 and 2003 when thousands of kilometres of coasts and about 30 species were affected. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology to assess the current risk of mass mortality associated with temperature increase along NW Mediterranean continental coasts. A 3D regional ocean model was used to obtain the temperature conditions for the period 2001-2010, for which the model outputs were validated by comparing them with in situ observations in affected areas. The model was globally satisfactory, although extremes were underestimated and required correction. Combined with information on the thermo-tolerance of a key species (the red gorgonian P. clavata) as well as its spatial distribution, the modelled temperature conditions were then used to assess the risk of mass mortality associated with thermal stress for the first time. Most of the known areas of observed mass mortality were found using the model, although the degree of risk in certain areas was underestimated. Using climatic IPCC scenarios, the methodology could be applied to explore the impacts of expected climate change in the NW Mediterranean. This is a key issue for the development of sound management and conservation plans to protect Mediterranean marine biodiversity in the face of climate change.

AB  - Understanding the capacity of forest tree species to adapt to climate change is of increasing importance for managing forest genetic resources. Through a genomics approach, we modelled spatial variation in climate adaptation within the Australian temperate forest tree Eucalyptus globulus, identified putative climate drivers of this genomic variation, and predicted locations of future climate refugia and populations at-risk of future maladaptation. Using 812,158 SNPs across 130 individuals from 30 populations (i.e., localities) spanning the species' natural range, a gradientForest algorithm found 1177 SNPs associated with locality variation in home-site climate (climate-SNPs), putatively linking them to climate adaptation. Very few climate-SNPs were associated with population-level variation in drought susceptibility, signalling the multi-faceted nature and complexity of climate adaptation. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed 24% of the climate-SNP variation could be explained by annual precipitation, isothermality, and maximum temperature of the warmest month. Spatial predictions of the RDA climate vectors associated with climate-SNPs allowed mapping of genomically informed climate selective surfaces across the species' range under contemporary and projected future climates. These surfaces suggest over 50% of the current distribution of E. globulus will be outside the modelled adaptive range by 2070 and at risk of climate maladaptation. Such surfaces present a new integrated approach for natural resource managers to capture adaptive genetic variation and plan translocations in the face of climate change.

AB  - Reliable species distribution data are important for valid scientific conclusions and effective conservation planning. Mismatch between survey timing and animal behaviors that influence detection may result in false absences that can lead to poorly informed management decisions. Birds exhibit a diversity of diel vocalization patterns, but many large-scale multispecies surveys are based on the songbird dawn chorus, indicating the potential for bias to detect birds with other diel vocalization patterns. In this study, we quantified bias in point counts and morning acoustic recordings to measure the number of occupied sites detected for a set of dawn chorusing birds (songbirds) and irregularly vocalizing wetland birds (waterfowl) relative to estimates obtained from 10-min acoustic recordings conducted hourly throughout 24-h periods for three consecutive days. Furthermore, we investigated which revisitation schedule-same day or different day sampling, as well as increased sampling effort-best minimized false-negative detections for songbirds and waterfowl. Morning surveys significantly underestimated the number of occupied sites for 10 of 13 species. No differences were found between same-day and between-day revisitation schedules with identical sampling effort, regardless of whether birds exhibited a dawn chorus or irregular vocalization patterns. Detection improved with increased sampling effort. Subsampled recordings captured the majority of occupied sites for songbirds (up to 87% of occupied sites detected), but less so for waterfowl (up to 60% of occupied sites detected). Accurate detection for irregularly vocalizing species such as waterfowl will require more intensive sampling effort (likely throughout 24-h periods) when using acoustic recordings.

AB  - Chinkara (Gazella bennettii), the Indian gazelle, is a widespread antelope in the arid and semi-arid regions of the Indian subcontinent; however, the species has been relatively unexplored to the south of its distribution range. In 2016, with indefinite evidence of chinkara presence in Yadahalli Reserved Forest, Karnataka, India, the Forest Department notified the area as a Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS). We conducted a study to explore their possible existence and population status at Yadahalli WLS using a novel approach. We laid 2 sq. km grid cells in the Yadahalli WLS and divided it into four replicated sub-grids using GPS. We walked the grid cells and recorded the chinkara midden and deployed camera traps for direct detection and individual identity. We recorded site covariates, i.e. tree density, tree diversity, basal area, food tree density, cattle dung, goat and sheep droppings and distance from the boundary, and detection covariates, i.e. trail length. We performed occupancy modelling based on midden recordings using PRESENCE ver. 5.3. Through the effort of 62 grids with four spatial replicates, the detection probability of chinkara was found to be 0.68 +/- 0.03(SE), and the estimated averaged occupancy was 0.51 +/- 0.37(SE). The present study reveals a potential population of similar to 85 individuals in the Yadahalli WLS, which is the known southernmost population of the species in India. This study establishes the use of novel methods for monitoring of chinkara populations which will help in the development of a conservation action plan for the species and its habitat.

AB  - Defaunation is a global threat to biodiversity that can be counteracted through trophic rewilding, a restoration strategy that promotes self-regulating ecosystems through active reintroductions or passive management. In order to estimate success in restoration initiatives, progress of the rewilding projects is measured and monitored. However, a spatially explicit understanding of rewilding and rewilding potential in a rewilding site has been absent so far. We present a novel approach for monitoring rewilding progress that focuses on a spatially explicit estimate of progress and ecological integrity within rewilding initiatives. This framework uses habitat classification of the site and tracking data of the reintroduced animals, to model their habitat selection. Through this we measure and map realized and potential rewilding. We operationalize the framework in an ongoing rewilding project in the Ibera Wetlands, Corrientes, Argentina. The majority of areas (76%) predicted to be occupied by reintroduced fauna were only predicted to be selected by one species. Of the four species in the rewilding project, only the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) filled the majority of its potential distribution, whereas pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) and lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) filled less than 23% of theirs. After rewilding we found a 10% increase in the proportion of the study area with high ecological integrity. Through this case study, we showed that this framework can be used to assess the spatial progress of a rewilding site. By incorporating wildlife tracking and satellite-based remote sensing, we are integrating a spatial component to monitoring of rewilding projects that should lead to more detailed understanding of the progress of rewilding. Applying this framework would facilitate decision-making for practitioners and inform species management plans.

AB  - Most environments are variable and disturbances (e.g., hurricanes, fires) can lead to substantial changes in a population's state (i.e., age, stage, or size distribution). In these situations, the long-term (i.e., asymptotic) measure of population growth rate (lambda(1)) may inaccurately represent population growth in the short-term. Thus, we calculated the short-term (i.e., transient) population growth rate and its sensitivity to changes in the life-cycle parameters for three bird and three mammal species with widely varying life histories. Further, we performed these calculations for initial population states that spanned the entire range of possibilities. Variation in a population's initial net reproductive value largely explained the variation in transient growth rates and their sensitivities to changes in life-cycle parameters (all AIC(c) >= 6.67 units better than the null model, all R-2 >= 0.55). Additionally, the transient fertility and adult survival sensitivities tended to increase with the initial net reproductive value of the population, whereas the sub-adult survival sensitivity decreased. Transient population dynamics of long-lived, slow reproducing species were more variable and more different than asymptotic dynamics than they were for short-lived, fast reproducing species. Because lambda(1) can be a biased estimate of the actual growth rate in the short-term (e.g., 19% difference), conservation and wildlife biologists should consider transient dynamics when developing management plans that could affect a population's state, or whenever population state could be unstable.

AB  - White-nose syndrome (WNS), affecting multiple North American bat species during the hibernation period, is a highly pathogenic disease caused by the psychrophilic fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Because the fungal pathogen persists in the hibernation site environment independently of the hosts, previous theory on spatial disease dynamics cannot predict WNS epidemics. However, the ability to understand factors contributing to the spread of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in North America is crucial to the management of infected and susceptible bat populations as well as the conservation of threatened and endangered bat species. Utilizing recent theory on environmental opportunistic pathogens, we modelled the effect of (a) landscape clustering, (b) environmental conditions in hibernacula and (c) microbial competition on the spread of WNS. We used available, already published data to construct and parameterize our model, which takes into account the spatial distribution of hibernation sites, temperature conditions in both the outside ambient and hibernation site environment, bat population dynamics, dispersal and infection by the pathogen, which also has its host-independent dynamics with the environment. We also consider the effect of outside-host competition between the pathogen and other micro-organisms on spatial disease dynamics. Our model suggests that pathogen loads accumulate in poorly connected hibernacula at short host dispersal, which can help found the epidemic. In contrast, invasion of the landscape is most successful at long host dispersal distances, with homogenous hibernation site distribution and heterogeneous between-hibernation site temperatures. Also, increasing the mean temperature across hibernacula increases fungal growth rate, leading to higher disease prevalence and faster invasion rate. Increasing spatial heterogeneity in hibernaculum temperatures results in the formation of disease hotspots in warmer hibernacula, facilitating more effective spread of the disease in the landscape. Cold-adapted competing microbes can prevent invasion, and therefore, overwintering in cold hibernacula increases probability of host survival. Sites that were suboptimal for overwintering prior to WNS may have importance in preventing local extirpations. Although the model is tailored for WNS, due to pressing need for results that can assist in planning conservation measures, these novel results can be broadly applied to other environmentally transmitted diseases.

AB  - Aim In recent years, novel approaches have been proposed to improve current bioregionalization methods, but these have not been thoroughly compared. We assessed the applicability of the recently developed network-based clustering method (Infomap algorithm) in bioregionalization analysis at regional spatial scales and compared the results with commonly used distance-based methods (hierarchical clustering algorithm). We also identified climate regions by using a model-based cluster analysis (Gaussian algorithm). Finally, we quantified the representation of climate regions and bioregions in current protected areas (PAs). Location Iran. Taxa Terrestrial mammals. Methods To define bioregions we used the Infomap algorithm and distance-based clustering methods based on species distribution data (over 14,000 occurrence records for 188 species). The Infomap algorithm was applied using the interactive web application "INFOMAP BIOREGIONS" and the distance-based clustering was based on unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA). To identify climate regions we used principal components analysis and a model-based cluster analysis both based on 15 climatic variables as well as a terrain ruggedness index. Results The Infomap algorithm detected nine biogeographical units: seven bioregions and two transition zones. The distance-based method suggested five bioregions. The identified bioregions differed between methods with some consistent spatial patterns across methods. Temperature and precipitation explained 85.8% of the environmental variation. Eight climate regions were identified. In general, climate variation and bioregional patterns are currently poorly represented in PAs (<25% coverage). Main conclusions The network-based method allowed identifying bioregions at regional scale and was apparently more sensitive than the conventional distance-based method. The detection of transition zones by the Infomap algorithm was an advantage, and stressed the fact that the distribution of Iranian mammalian fauna is complex, especially in the south-eastern part where contact areas between several bioregions are found. The identified bioregions (especially the distance-based bioregions) and climate regions tended to match well with previous bioregionalization studies and the global terrestrial ecoregions. When thoroughly compared and understood, bioregions and climate regions provide a framework for regional biodiversity conservation planning.

AB  - Modeling species abundance patterns using local environmental features is an important, current problem in ecology. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) in South Africa is a global hot spot of diversity and endemism, and provides a rich class of species abundance data for such modeling. Here, we propose a multi-stage Bayesian hierarchical model for explaining species abundance over this region. Our model is specified at areal level, where the CFR is divided into roughly 37,000 one minute grid cells; species abundance is observed at some locations within some cells. The abundance values are ordinally categorized. Environmental and soil-type factors, likely to influence the abundance pattern, are included in the model. We formulate the empirical abundance pattern as a degraded version of the potential pattern, with the degradation effect accomplished in two stages. First, we adjust for land use transformation and then we adjust for measurement error, hence misclassification error, to yield the observed abundance classifications. An important point in this analysis is that only 28% of the grid cells have been sampled and that, for sampled grid cells, the number of sampled locations ranges from one to more than one hundred. Still, we are able to develop potential and transformed abundance surfaces over the entire region.
   In the hierarchical framework, categorical abundance classifications are induced by continuous latent surfaces. The degradation model above is built on the latent scale. On this scale, an areal level spatial regression model was used for modeling the dependence of species abundance on the environmental factors. To capture anticipated similarity in abundance pattern among neighboring regions, spatial random effects with a conditionally autoregressive prior (CAR) were specified. Model fitting is through familiar Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. While models with CAR priors are usually efficiently fitted, even with large data sets, with our modeling and the large number of cells, run times became very long. So a novel parallelized computing strategy was developed to expedite fitting. The model was run for six different species. With categorical data, display of the resultant abundance patterns is a challenge and we offer several different views. The patterns are of importance on their own, comparatively across the region and across species, with implications for species competition and, more generally, for planning and conservation.

AB  - 1. High-resolution vegetation maps are a valuable resource for conservation, land management and research. In Great Britain, the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) is widely used to describe vegetation communities. NVC maps are typically produced from ground surveys which are prohibitively expensive for large areas. An approach to produce NVC maps more cost-effectively for large areas would be valuable.
   2. Creation of vegetation community maps from aerial or satellite images has often had limited success as the clusters separable by spectral reflectance frequently do not correspond well to vegetation community classes. Such maps have also been produced by exploring correlations between community occurrence and environmental variables. The latter approach can have limitations where anthropogenic activities have altered the distribution of vegetation communities. We combined these two approaches and classified 24 common NVC classes of the Yorkshire Dales and an additional class `wood' consisting of trees and bushes at a resolution of 5 m from mostly remotely sensed variables with the algorithm random forest.
   3. Classification accuracy was highest when environmental variables at low and high resolution (50 and 5-10 m, respectively) were added to aerial image information aggregated to a resolution of 5 m. Low-resolution environmental variables are likely to be correlated with the dominant vegetation surrounding a location and thus could represent critical area requirements or local species pool effects, while high-resolution environmental variables represent the environmental conditions at the location.
   4. Overall classification accuracy was 87-92%. The median producer's and user's class accuracies were 95%(58-100%) and 92%(67-100%), respectively.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The classification accuracies achieved in this study, the number of classes differentiated, their level of detail and the resolution were high compared with those of other studies. This approach could allow the production of good-quality NVC maps for large areas. In contrast to existing maps of broad land cover types, such maps would provide more detailed vegetation community data for applications like the monitoring of vegetation in a changing climate, the study of animal-habitat relationships, conservation management or land use planning.

AB  - We present the results of a study to examine the effects of management actions and natural disturbances in influencing the evolution of habitat patterns on forested lands. TELSA, a spatially explicit vegetation succession model with the ability to apply user-defined management actions and stochastic wildfires calibrated to local conditions, was used to evaluate changes in several indicators of habitat condition. We assessed seral stage and patch size changes over multiple 200-year simulations under a constant rate of harvest within each of these analyses. In the absence of natural disturbances, old growth habitat and large patches of forest of similar age and tree species composition decreased unless special management practices were applied. Old-growth management area reserves and periodic 'aggregated cutblock' harvesting entries helped maintain forest seral stage distribution at the target level, and patch size characteristics similar to the patterns that would have occurred under historic natural disturbances. Adding wildfire to the management scenarios substantially reduced the amount of old-growth habitat in designated old-growth management area reserves, compromising the ability to maintain old-growth at target levels. A 50% increase in the area designated as old-growth management area reserves would be required to offset the loss of old growth due to wildfire. Although the amount of old-growth habitat was diminished by wildfire, the availability of large habitat patches greater than 250 ha increased. We discuss the need to consider the role of management and natural disturbances in landscape planning, and suggest that redundancy is essential to maintain those features vulnerable to stochastic disturbances. Landscape scenario modeling can facilitate the development of risk averse plans, and encourage the development of innovative approaches to achieving timber and non-timber objectives.

AB  - The geographic distribution of stream reaches with potential to support high-quality habitat for salmonids has bearing on the actual status of habitats and populations over broad spatial extents. As part of the Coastal Landscape Analysis and Modeling Study (CLAMS), we examined how salmon-habitat potential was distributed relative to current and future (+100 years) landscape characteristics in the Coastal Province of Oregon, USA. The intrinsic potential to provide high-quality rearing habitat was modeled for juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and juvenile steelhead (O. mykiss) based on stream flow, valley constraint, and stream gradient. Land ownership, use, and cover were summarized for 100-m analysis buffers on either side of stream reaches with high intrinsic potential and in the overall area encompassing the buffers. Past management seems to have concentrated nonindustrial private ownership, agriculture, and developed uses adjacent to reaches with high intrinsic potential for coho salmon. Thus, of the area in coho salmon buffers, 45% is either non-forested or recently logged, but only 10% is in larger-diameter forests. For the area in steelhead buffers, 21% is either non-forested or recently logged while 20% is in larger-diameter forests. Older forests are most extensive on federal lands but are rare on private lands, highlighting the critical role for public lands in near-term salmon conservation. Agriculture and development are projected to remain focused near high-intrinsic-potential reaches for coho salmon, increasing the importance of effectively addressing nonpoint source pollution from these uses. Percentages of larger-diameter forests are expected to increase throughout the province, but the increase will be only half as much in coho salmon buffers as in steelhead buffers. Most of the increase is projected for public lands, where policies emphasize biodiversity protection. Results suggest that widespread recovery of coho salmon is unlikely unless habitat can be improved in high-intrinsic-potential reaches on private lands. Knowing where high-intrinsic-potential stream reaches occur relative to landscape characteristics can help in evaluating the current and future condition of freshwater habitat, explaining differences between species in population status and risk, and assessing the need for and feasibility of restoration.

AB  - Climate change is significantly affecting ecosystem services and leading to strong impacts on the extent and distribution of glaciers and vegetation. In this context, species distribution models represent a suitable instrument for studying ecosystem development and response to climate warming. This study applies the maximum entropy model, MaxEnt, to evaluate trends and effects of climate change for three environmental indicators in the area of the Alpi Marittime Natural Park under the Municipality of Entracque (Italy). Specifically, this study focuses on the magnitude of the retreat of six glaciers and on the distribution of two different plant communities, Alnus viridis scrub and Fagus sylvatica forest associated with Acer pseudoplatanus and tall herbs (megaforbie), in relation to predicted increases in mean temperatures. MaxEnt software was used to model and observe changes over a thirty-year period, developing three scenarios: a present (2019), a past (1980) and a future (2050) using 24 "environmental layers". This study showed the delicate climate balances of these six small glaciers that, in the next 30 years, are likely to undergo an important retreat (approximate to-33%) despite the high altitude and important snowfall that still characterize the area. At the same time, it is predicted that the two plant communities will invade those higher altitude territories that, not so long ago, were inhospitable, expanding their habitat by 50%. The MaxEnt application to glaciers has shown to be an effective tool that offers a new perspective in the climate change field as well as in biodiversity conservation planning.

AB  - This research aims to establish the possible habitat suitability of Heracleum sosnowskyi (HS), one of the most aggressive invasive plants, in current and future climate conditions across the territory of the European part of Russia. We utilised a species distribution modelling framework using publicly available data of plant occurrence collected in citizen science projects (CSP). Climatic variables and soil characteristics were considered to follow possible dependencies with environmental factors. We applied Random Forest to classify the study area. We addressed the problem of sampling bias in CSP data by optimising the sampling size and implementing a spatial cross-validation scheme. According to the Random Forest model built on the finally selected data shape, more than half of the studied territory in the current climate corresponds to a suitability prediction score higher than 0.25. The forecast of habitat suitability in future climate was highly similar for all climate models. Almost the whole studied territory showed the possibility for spread with an average suitability score of 0.4. The mean temperature of the wettest quarter and precipitation of wettest month demonstrated the highest influence on the HS distribution. Thus, currently, the whole study area, excluding the north, may be considered as s territory with a high risk of HS spreading, while in the future suitable locations for the HS habitat will include high latitudes. We showed that chosen geodata pre-processing, and cross-validation based on geospatial blocks reduced significantly the sampling bias. Obtained predictions could help to assess the risks accompanying the studied plant invasion capturing the patterns of the spread, and can be used for the conservation actions planning.

AB  - Background: The mangrove crab Ucides cordatus is considered a key species for the ecological balance of mangrove forests and a major source of employment and income for traditional crab collectors in Brazil. Several studies evidenced weak genetic variation among populations due to an efficient larval transport. However, gene flow patterns of the species is poorly understood, with no information about migration rates. The influence of the two main Brazilian currents in larval dispersion is also not clear. In order to provide baseline information for conservation, planning and management of this important fishery resource, the present study aimed to estimate and evaluate spatial distribution of genetic diversity, migration rates and gene flow directivity among populations of U. cordatus in Brazil.
   Methods: Nine microsatellites were used to resolve population structure of 319 crabs collected from six sites located along the Brazilian coast. The degree of geographical differentiation included estimates of genetic diversity, population structure and gene flow models, with spatial analysis of shared alleles (SASHA), isolation by distance tests, AMOVA, discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) and Bayesian clustering. We estimated the amount of ongoing gene flow between clusters using the coalescent-based method implemented in Migrate-N.
   Results: Loci were highly polymorphic (average of 12.4 alleles per locus) evidencing high genetic variability. There was significant differentiation among localities, despite of the low value of F-ST (= 0.019; P < 0.001). F-ST and Jost's D indexes were also estimated in pairwise comparisons and showed significant differences between most of the surveyed site pairs (P < 0.05). Structure evidenced a single genetic group among samples, however SASHA pointed to a non-panmictic condition (P = 0.011). AMOVA detected four statistical significant clusters with low level of differentiation (F-CT = 0.037; P = 0.023). The gene flow model that best described the population connectivity was the island model, with similar to 24 crabs being exchanged among localities per generation.
   Discussion: The high migration rates found among localities seem to be the main force acting to sustain the distribution of the genetic diversity of U. cordatus. Despite the high gene flow and the weak population structure among samples, the significant genetic differences found suggest that gene flow alone does not bypass the effects of genetic drift, natural selection and/or human exploitation. These findings are vital for the establishment of a database to be used in the development of conservation programs.

AB  - The aim of this study is to produce benthic habitats maps in the Natura 2000 SAC Ropotamo, the Bulgarian Black Sea, by integrating acoustic, geological and biological data. The focus is on the soft-sediment physical habitats and biotopes (the environment and the associated biological communities). Bathymetry and backscatter data were collected using multi-beam sonar system SeaBat 7111. Digital terrain models were produced with a resolution of 3 m and 2 m in the open sea and the coastal area respectively and isobaths at 1 m depth interval were drawn. Data of the sonar function of the multi-beam sonar system was processed to generate sonar mosaic of the area. Areas with similar backscatter characteristics were defined in ArcGIS to delineate distinct acoustic facies that presumably represent different lithological types of seabed sediments. The acoustic facies were validated by sediment samples analysed for particle size and invertebrate macrofauna. Fourteen sediment classes (Folk 16) were identified in the region, besides rock and boulders. Sediments distribution map was created using map algebra algorithm (Saretta et al, 2007). The acoustic facies and sediments distribution maps were integrated in ArcGIS to produce a lithological map. Bray-Curtis similarity and clustering procedure were employed to discriminate macrofauna assemblages and Similarity Percentages analysis was used to define the typical species (PRIMER 6). The biological data were overlaid on the lithological map and biotopes were extrapolated, integrating the lithological with biological data in ArcGIS. Depth boundaries between adjacent biotopes were defined using ROC curve analysis on the depth data, and delineated in ArcGIS to produce the final biotopes map. This habitat mapping survey provides basic information on the distribution, extent, area and the associated macrofauna of the habitats of conservation importance in SAC Ropotamo and thus supports spatial planning and ecosystem-based management in a marine protected area.

AB  - Aim The factors that set range limits for animal populations can inform management plans aimed at maintaining regional biodiversity. We examine abiotic and biotic drivers of the distribution of finescale dace (Chrosomus neogaeus) in two Great Plains basins to identify limiting factors for a threatened freshwater fish population at the edge of their range.
   Location Great Plains, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming, USA.
   Methods We investigated abiotic and biotic factors influencing the contemporary distribution of finescale dace in the Belle Fourche and Niobrara River basins with Random Forests classification models using fish surveys from multiple agencies spanning 2008-2019 and GIS-derived environmental data.
   Results In both basins, finescale dace occurrence exhibited a nonlinear response to mean August water temperature. Abiotic covariates, including streamflow, water temperature and channel slope, were important limiting factors in the final model fit with Belle Fourche River basin surveys (n = 131). In contrast, a biotic covariate, native minnow richness, was the most important predictor of finescale dace occurrence in the Niobrara River basin model (n = 27). In the Niobrara River, native minnow richness was lower at sites with non-native northern pike (Esox lucius).
   Main conclusions Basin-specific analyses revealed context dependencies for species-environment relationships, which can inform targeted restoration actions. Similar relationships between water temperature and finescale dace occurrence across both basins suggest summer thermal habitat as a regional limiting factor. The importance of biotic interactions in the Niobrara River highlights an emergent threat from invasive predators to a distinct assemblage of native prairie fishes.

AB  - There has been a growing pressure of human activities, especially road network, on natural habitats of the world, which has led to habitat degradation and loss of ecosystem services. To mitigate the impacts of human activities, appropriate studies quantifying ecosystem services and assessing ecological impacts of road network are essential. The main goal of this study was modeling habitat quality and habitat degradation of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province in the southwestern part of Iran, which is among the most important habitats for wild sheep (Ovis orientalis) classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In this study, we used the habitat quality module of the InVEST software (IntegratedValuation ofEnvironmentalServices andTradeoffs), which was driven from land use/cover data, information on anthropogenic threats, and expert knowledge. We tested the reliability of the habitat quality values by comparing them with the distribution map of wild sheep obtained from the Department of the Environment. Then, to have a more comprehensive assessment of the roads' effects on the natural habitats of this province, considering ecosystem services model, the Spatial Road Disturbance Index (SPROADI) was applied as a landscape index. The results of this study revealed that the east and north eastern parts of the study area which were among the most suitable habitats for wild sheep were highly affected by road network. Overall, findings of our study provided useful information on the spatially explicit distribution of habitat quality and degradation which were a valuable input for conservation planning and enhancing ecosystem services.

AB  - We studied breeding populations of 2 coexisting ground-nesting birds, the red-faced warbler (Cardellina rubrifrons) and yellow-eyed junco (Junco phaeonotus), in high-elevation (>2,000 m) forested drainages of the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, USA. From 2004 to 2005, we 1) estimated density and nesting success of breeding populations of red-faced warblers and yellow-eyed juncos, 2) identified nest-site characteristics for each species (i.e., used sites vs. random plots), 3) compared nest-site characteristics between the 2 species, and 4) examined effects of a recent (2003) wildfire on distribution of nests of both species. In addition, we estimated the areal extent of montane riparian forest (the preferred breeding habitat of both species) within high-elevation forests of the Santa Catalina Mountains. We found that red-faced warblers and yellow-eyed juncos were the 2 most common ground-nesting birds within our study area with an average density of 2.4 and 1.4 singing males/ha, respectively, along drainage bottoms. Compared to random plots, most red-faced warbler and yellow-eyed junco nests were located close (<= 30 m) to drainage bottoms within a strip of montane riparian forest characterized by abundant brush, small woody debris, ferns, and forbs (both species), high number and diversity of saplings and small trees (red-faced warblers), and abundant shrubs and downed logs and less canopy cover (yellow-eyed juncos). Although both species nested in close proximity within montane riparian forest, nest-site characteristics differed between the 2 species, especially at finer spatial scales. For example, most yellow-eyed juncos nested adjacent to grass (principally Muhlenbergia spp.), whereas red-faced warblers nested adjacent to a variety of plant species, including grass, bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum), white fir (Abies concolor), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Both red-faced warblers and yellow-eyed juncos avoided nesting in areas burned during a recent wildfire. In addition, nesting success was low for red-faced warblers (13%) and yellow-eyed juncos (19%) following the wildfire, suggesting an indirect negative effect of fire on breeding populations in the short-term. Montane riparian forest appears to provide important breeding habitat for red-faced warblers and yellow-eyed juncos. However, little research or conservation planning has been directed toward montane riparian forest in the region, even though this forest type is limited in its areal extent (<11% of high-elevation forest in the Santa Catalina Mountains) and increasingly threatened by disturbance. Results from our study can be used to facilitate the management and conservation of breeding populations of red-faced warblers and yellow-eyed juncos in high-elevation forests of the southwestern United States.

AB  - Understanding spatial and temporal variability in the distribution of species is fundamental to the conservation of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. To support strategic decision making aimed at sustainable management of the oceans, such as the establishment of protected areas for marine wildlife, we identified areas predicted to support multispecies seabird aggregations in the Timor Sea. We developed species distribution models for 21 seabird species based on at-sea survey observations from 2000-2013 and oceanographic variables (e.g., bathymetry). We applied 4 statistical modeling techniques and combined the results into an ensemble model with robust performance. The ensemble model predicted the probability of seabird occurrence in areas where few or no surveys had been conducted and demonstrated 3 areas of high seabird richness that varied little between seasons. These were located within 150 km of Adele Island, Ashmore Reef, and the Lacepede Islands, 3 of the largest aggregations of breeding seabirds in Australia. Although these breeding islands were foci for high species richness, model performance was greatest for 3 nonbreeding migratory species that would have been overlooked had regional monitoring been restricted to islands. Our results indicate many seabird hotspots in the Timor Sea occur outside existing reserves (e.g., Ashmore Reef Marine Reserve), where shipping, fisheries, and offshore development likely pose a threat to resident and migratory populations. Our results highlight the need to expand marine spatial planning efforts to ensure biodiversity assets are appropriately represented in marine reserves. Correspondingly, our results support the designation of at least 4 new important bird areas, for example, surrounding Adele Island and Ashmore Reef. Pronostico de la Distribucion Espacial de una Comunidad de Aves Marinas para Identificar areas Prioritarias de Conservacion en el Mar de Timor
   Resumen Entender la variabilidad espacial y temporal en la distribucion de especies es fundamental para la conservacion de los ecosistemas marinos y terrestres. Para apoyar la toma estrategica de decisiones enfocada en el manejo sustentable de los oceanos, como el establecimiento de areas protegidas para la vida silvestre marina, identificamos areas pronosticadas como soporte para la agregacion de multiples especies de aves marinas en el Mar de Timor. Desarrollamos modelos de distribucion de especies para 21 especies de aves marinas basandonos en censos realizados en el mar de 2000 a 2013 y variables oceanograficas (p. ej.: batimetria). Aplicamos 4 tecnicas de modelado estadistico y combinamos los resultados en un modelo ensamblado con desempeno robusto. El modelo ensamblado pronostico la probabilidad de la ocurrencia de aves marinas en areas donde se han llevado a cabo pocos o ningun censo y demostro 3 areas de riqueza alta de aves marinas que variaron poco entre temporadas. Estas se ubicaron dentro de 150 Km de la isla Adele, el Arrecife Ashmore y las islas Lacepede, tres de las agregaciones mas grandes de aves marinas reproductoras en Australia. Aunque estas islas de reproduccion fueron centros para una riqueza alta de especies, el desempeno del modelo fue mayor para 3 especies migratorias no reproductivas que habrian sido ignoradas si el monitoreo regional se hubiera restringido a las islas. Nuestros resultados indican que muchos sitios de importancia para aves marinas en el Mar de Timor ocurren fuera de las reservas existentes (p. ej.: la Reserva Marina del Arrecife Ashmore), donde las embarcaciones, las pesquerias y el desarrollo litoral probablemente sean una amenaza para las poblaciones residentes y migratorias. Nuestros resultados resaltan la necesidad de expandir los esfuerzos de planeacion espacial marina para asegurar que los valores de biodiversidad esten correctamente representados en las reservas marinas. Proporcionalmente, nuestros resultados apoyan la designacion de por lo menos 4 nuevas areas de importancia para aves, por ejemplo, alrededor de la isla Adele y el Arrecife Ashmore.

AB  - Prosopis juliflora is a serious invader, causing great ecological and economic damage in Ethiopia. Thus, it is imperative to examine potential invasion dynamics of P. juliflora at national level under climate change scenario to better influence decision making processes on the management of this invasive species. We derived a consensus model from five modeling approaches to examine the current and future (2050 and 2070) climatic suitability for P. juliflora under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in Ethiopia. Under the current climatic scenario, 94.8% of the country was non-suitable for P. juliflora establishment and invasion while 0.4% (4.56 million ha) was highly suitable. In 2050, highly suitable area for P. juliflora is expected to increase by 55.6% and 63.6%, while moderately suitable area is projected to increase by 33.3% and 42.9% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, respectively. Compared to the current climatic condition, in 2070, highly suitable area for the species is projected to increase by 73.3% (3.43 million ha) and 80.0% (3.65 million ha) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario, respectively. With the current cover, this invasive species had already caused significant impact on rangelands in many parts of the country. Its further expansion would worsen the problem, leading to great environmental and economic damage, thereby threatening the livelihood of the community. Negative environmental and economical impacts caused by the species will be high if preventive and effective management measures are not earnestly taken, and it becomes one of the major challenges for the 21st century pastoralism and their livelihoods. We recommend a national effort be organized towards combating P. juliflora expansion to new areas, especially in regions and protected area predicted as frontiers of potential expansion.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) provide an important tool for conservation of marine ecosystems. To be most effective, these areas should be strategically located in a manner that supports ecosystem function. To inform marine spatial planning and support strategic establishment of MPAs within the California Current System, we identified areas predicted to support multispecies aggregations of seabirds ("hotspots''). We developed habitat-association models for 16 species using information from at-sea observations collected over an 11-year period (1997-2008), bathymetric data, and remotely sensed oceanographic data for an area from north of Vancouver Island, Canada, to the USA/Mexico border and seaward 600 km from the coast. This approach enabled us to predict distribution and abundance of seabirds even in areas of few or no surveys. We developed single-species predictive models using a machine-learning algorithm: bagged decision trees. Single-species predictions were then combined to identify potential hotspots of seabird aggregation, using three criteria: (1) overall abundance among species, (2) importance of specific areas ("core areas'') to individual species, and (3) predicted persistence of hotspots across years. Model predictions were applied to the entire California Current for four seasons (represented by February, May, July, and October) in each of 11 years. Overall, bathymetric variables were often important predictive variables, whereas oceanographic variables derived from remotely sensed data were generally less important. Predicted hotspots often aligned with currently protected areas (e.g., National Marine Sanctuaries), but we also identified potential hotspots in Northern California/Southern Oregon (from Cape Mendocino to Heceta Bank), Southern California (adjacent to the Channel Islands), and adjacent to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, that are not currently included in protected areas. Prioritization and identification of multispecies hotspots will depend on which group of species is of highest management priority. Modeling hotspots at a broad spatial scale can contribute to MPA site selection, particularly if complemented by fine-scale information for focal areas.

AB  - The poor understanding of changes in mollusc ecology along rivers, especially in West Africa, hampers the implementation of management measures. We used a self?organizing map, indicator species analysis, linear discriminant analysis and a random forest model to distinguish mollusc assemblages, to determine the ecological preferences of individual mollusc species and to associate major physicochemical variables with mollusc assemblages and occurrences in the So? River Basin, Benin. We identified four mollusc assemblages along an upstream?downstream gradient. Dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), salinity, calcium (Ca), total nitrogen (TN), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) were the major physicochemical variables responsible for structuring these mollusc assemblages. However, the physicochemical factors responsible for shaping the distribution of individual species varied per species. Upstream sites (assemblage I) showed high DO and low BOD and mineral compounds (i.e., TN, salinity, and Ca), which are primarily responsible for structuring the occurrences of bivalves (Afropisidium pirothi, Etheria elliptica, Sphaerium hartmanni) and the gastropod Lanistes varicus. Sites along the middle reach (assemblage II) were characterised by a high degree of organic pollution but low heavy metal pollution; we detected no specific mollusc indicator species. Downstream sites (assemblage III) displayed high mineral and heavy metal concentrations and a fauna without specific indicator species. Finally, downstream sites associated with brackish water (assemblage IV) displayed important levels of organic and heavy metal pollution. These sites are dominated by diverse gastropods (i.e., Bulinus spp., Gabbiella africana, Indoplanorbis exustus, Pachymelania fusca, Radix natalensis, Stenophysa marmorata and Tympanotonos fuscatus). Our results highlight that mollusc communities in the So? River Basin are structured by key physicochemical variables related to the river?estuary continuum. Habitats that are progressively more downstream are confronted with increasing anthropogenic stress. Conservation and management plans should focus on downstream habitats.

AB  - Simple Summary Areas of endemism (AoEs) are one of the most important topics discussed in biogeography, considering that the analysis of areas of sympatry between endemic species is essential to understand species distribution patterns, reconstruct evolutionary events, regionalize biogeographical areas, and assess regions of high conservation concern. Here, we propose a workflow based on the application of a clustering-based algorithm to identify AoEs and compare it to another method, the Geographical Interpolation of Endemism, based on a kernel density approach. We apply this framework to the flea beetles of the whole sub-Saharan Africa, identifying several AoEs through both methods, but with differences in their delimitation, number and features of characteristic species, and surface. Considering that our proposed workflow can be applied to any territorial context and sets of endemic species, we also provide a GIS tool that implements all the steps into one single toolbox. The identification of AoEs, possibly facilitated by our approach, can provide useful spatial information when dealing with several biodiversity-related issues, even applied to practical conservation measures, such as protected areas management and landscape planning. Areas of endemism (AoEs) are a central area of research in biogeography. Different methods have been proposed for their identification in the literature. In this paper, a "grid-free" method based on the "Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise" (DBSCAN) is here used for the first time to locate areas of endemism for species belonging to the beetle tribe Chrysomelidae, Galerucinae, Alticini in the Afrotropical Region. The DBSCAN is compared with the "Geographic Interpolation of Endemism" (GIE), another "grid-free" method based on a kernel density approach. DBSCAN and GIE both return largely overlapping results, detecting the same geographical locations for the AoEs, but with different delimitations, surfaces, and number of detected sinendemisms. The consensus maps obtained by GIE are in general less clearly delimited than the maps obtained by DBSCAN, but nevertheless allow us to evaluate the core of the AoEs more precisely, representing of the percentage levels of the overlap of the centroids. DBSCAN, on the other hand, appears to be faster and more sensitive in identifying the AoEs. To facilitate implementing the delimitation of the AoEs through the procedure proposed by us, a new tool named "CLUENDA" (specifically developed is in GIS environment) is also made available.

AB  - Better conservation planning requires updated information about leopard distribution to prioritize and allocate limited resources available. The long-term persistence of leopards and sympatric tigers can be compromised by linear infrastructure development such as roads that fragment habitat. We used detection and non-detection data collected along walking search paths (similar to 4140 km) in 96 grid cells (each cell 15 km by 15 km) spread across potential habitat (similar to 13,845 km(2)) in the Terai Arc Landscape, Nepal. Multi-season occupancy models allowed us to make both spatial and temporal inferences between two surveys in 2009 and 2013, based on ecologically relevant covariates recorded in the field or remotely sensed. Additionally, we used 2013 data to make inferences on co-occurrence between tigers and leopards at the landscape level. We found the additive model containing deforestation and district roads negatively influenced leopard detection across the landscape. Although weak, we found anthropogenic factors such as extent of deforestation (decrease in forest cover) negatively affected leopard occupancy. Road abundance, especially for the east-west highway and district roads, also negatively (but weakly) influenced leopard occupancy. We found substantially lower occupancy in the year 2013 (0.59 (SE 0.06)) than in 2009 (0.86 (SE 0.04)). Tigers and leopards co-occurred across the landscape based on the species interaction factor (SIF) estimated at 1.47 (0.13) but the amount of available habitat and the prey index mediated co-occurrence. The SIF decreased as habitat availability increased, reaching independence at large habitat patches, but leopard occupancy declined in sites with tigers, primarily in large patches. The prey index was substantially lower outside of protected areas and leopards and tigers co-occurred more strongly in small patches and at low prey indices, indicating potential attraction to the same areas when prey is scarce. Mitigation measures should focus on preventing loss of critical leopard, tiger, and prey habitat through appropriate wildlife-friendly underpasses and avoiding such habitat when building infrastructure. Leopard conservation has received lower priority than tigers, but our metrics show a large decline in leopard occupancy, thus conservation planning to reverse this decline should focus on measures to facilitate human-leopard coexistence to ensure leopard persistence across the landscape.

AB  - Habitat prioritization is a powerful tool for identifying critical wildlife areas for conservation. This study evaluates the risk of disturbance from maritime activities to seabirds in order to prioritize critical seabird foraging habitat for conservation thereby providing a much-needed methodological contribution demonstrating how to transparently incorporate metrics of "cost" based on risk to support ocean zoning. We standardized and combined predicted seabird distributions for six nonresident species foraging in the non-coastal "offshore" waters in the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, which we predicted using ten years of Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies (ACCESS) at-sea data for the month of July. We obtained maritime activity data from the California Ocean Use Atlas, whale-watching data, expert consultation, and primary literature. Activities included benthic fishing with fixed and mobile gear, military operations, oil spill, shipping, and whale-watching. Risk calculations were based on management effectiveness, spatial and temporal overlap of activities with seabird distributions, changes in area, and severity of negative impacts. Of those activities evaluated with the InVEST Habitat Risk Assessment (HRA) model, higher risk activities were oil spill, benthic fishing with fixed or mobile gear, and military activities. Looking at all risks spatially, highest cumulative risk areas concentrated to the north and northeast of Cordell Bank, along segments of the shelf break, and along areas of the shipping lanes. We demonstrated the use of the HRA tool to quantify costs for use in Marxan habitat prioritization software. The HRA model provided a transparent and replicable cost metric that partitioned risk into exposure and consequence. This approach provided two options for meeting high priority seabird foraging protection goals in the Sanctuaries: 1) protecting the low cost Marxan-prioritized areas or 2) managing high risk maritime activities highlighted by the HRA model. Waters around the Farallon Islands, nearby and northeast of Cordell Bank, and to the southwest of the continental shelf break in the southern region of Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary were identified as areas where seabirds would benefit from a combination of adding protections to some low cost Marxan-prioritized areas and enhancing management of the primary disturbance resulting from higher risk activities of oil spill, benthic fishing with mobile or fixed gear, and military activities, each of which have spatial footprints contributing to high cost Marxan prioritized areas. Either approach could be scaled up to include a larger habitat area, multiple habitat types, and different maritime activities. Our methods can be applied globally to improve ocean zoning where critical wildlife areas are threatened by human activities.

AB  - 1. The selection for particular habitat patches can vary as a function of local and regional levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Although such functional responses can better reveal habitat loss for species of precarious status faced with dwindling resources, they remain rarely used in conservation planning. We show that functional responses can occur at multiple levels, even as nested hierarchies, and that they can explain the plasticity in habitat selection observed in threatened forest-dwelling caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou, within and among home-ranges. 2. Twenty-seven caribou were followed with global positioning system collars between 2005 and 2010. Generalized linear mixed models served as the basis from which we built multi-level functional responses characterizing how caribou alter their selection for closed-canopy conifer forests, depending upon the availability of these forests and the amount of cutovers and roads. 3. Caribou increased their selection for closed-canopy conifer forests in areas of their home-range that were comprised of a high proportion of recent cutovers during calving and summer and of high closed-canopy conifer forests during winter. Also, caribou that were established in highly disturbed areas displayed an overall stronger selection for conifer forests. These individuals further adjusted their selection for conifer forests in areas of their home-ranges that were largely comprised of recent cutovers. This concurrent response to local and global anthropogenic disturbances provides evidence of nested-hierarchical functional responses. 4. Synthesis and applications. Reliable characterization of disturbance effects on animals is necessary for conservation planning. Multi-level functional responses can accurately describe animal distribution, and we provided a framework for modelling these responses. Our multi-level functional responses indicate that fixing habitat requirements based on patterns of habitat selection for the average amount of disturbance can be misleading because it overlooks plasticity in the response of animals to habitat heterogeneity. For example, selection of closed-canopy conifer forests by caribou generally became stronger with increasing disturbance levels. Anthropogenic disturbance thus could not only lead to the functional loss of residual habitat, but it can also increase the relative value of residual patches. Our study provides a tool for more thorough assessments of spatial variation in the attractiveness of resource patches and, presumably, in the fitness benefits.

AB  - Management of human activities which impact the seafloor in the deep ocean is becoming increasingly important as bottom trawling and exploration for minerals, oil, and gas continue to extend into regions where fragile ecosystems containing habitat-forming deep-sea corals and sponges may be found. Spatial management of these vulnerable marine ecosystems requires accurate knowledge of their distribution. Predictive habitat suitability modelling, using species presence data and a suite of environmental predictor variables, has emerged as a useful tool for inferring distributions outside of known areas. However, validation of model predictions is typically performed with non-independent data. In this study, we describe the results of habitat suitability models constructed for four deep-sea reef-forming coral species across a large region of the South Pacific Ocean using MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Tree modelling approaches. In order to validate model predictions we conducted a photographic survey on a set of seamounts in an un-sampled area east of New Zealand. The likelihood of habitat suitable for reef-forming corals on these seamounts was predicted to be variable, but very high in some regions, particularly where levels of aragonite saturation, dissolved oxygen, and particulate organic carbon were optimal. However, the observed frequency of coral occurrence in analyses of survey photographic data was much lower than expected, and patterns of observed versus predicted coral distribution were not highly correlated. The poor performance of these broad-scale models is attributed to lack of recorded species absences to inform the models, low precision of global bathymetry models, and lack of data on the geomorphology and substrate of the seamounts at scales appropriate to the modelled taxa. This demonstrates the need to use caution when interpreting and applying broad-scale, presence-only model results for fisheries management and conservation planning in data poor areas of the deep sea. Future improvements in the predictive performance of broad-scale models will rely on the continued advancement in modelling of environmental predictor variables, refinements in modelling approaches to deal with missing or biased inputs, and incorporation of true absence data.

AB  - Premise of the study: Near-future climate changes are likely to elicit major vegetation changes. Disequilibrium dynamics, which occur when vegetation comes out of equilibrium with climate, are potentially a key facet of these. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making accurate predictions, informing conservation planning, and understanding likely changes in ecosystem function on time scales relevant to society. However, many predictive studies have instead focused on equilibrium end-points with little consideration of the transient trajectories.
   Methods: We review what we should expect in terms of disequilibrium vegetation dynamics over the next 50-200 yr, covering a broad range of research fields including paleoecology, macroecology, landscape ecology, vegetation science, plant ecology, invasion biology, global change biology, and ecosystem ecology.
   Key results: The expected climate changes are likely to induce marked vegetation disequilibrium with climate at both leading and trailing edges, with leading-edge disequilibrium dynamics due to lags in migration at continental to landscape scales, in local population build-up and succession, in local evolutionary responses, and in ecosystem development, and trailing-edge disequilibrium dynamics involving delayed local extinctions and slow losses of ecosystem structural components. Interactions with habitat loss and invasive pests and pathogens are likely to further contribute to disequilibrium dynamics. Predictive modeling and climate-change experiments are increasingly representing disequilibrium dynamics, but with scope for improvement.
   Conclusions: The likely pervasiveness and complexity of vegetation disequilibrium is a major challenge for forecasting ecological dynamics and, combined with the high ecological importance of vegetation, also constitutes a major challenge for future nature conservation.

AB  - Biological significance of scat marking by otters has been a controversial subject among scientists. Using multiyear (2014-2017) data of otter spraint counts in South Korea, this study aimed to test whether the observed pattern of spraint presence/absence is driven by detection error and if/how scat counts can be a proxy for otter abundance at the landscape scale. To test the first hypothesis, spraint presence/absence was analyzed through occupancy models, which relied on environmental variables related to otter detectability and presence. Spraint count models were used to test the second hypothesis against resource-related covariates in combination with landscape, anthropogenic, and climate variables through machine learning algorithms (MLAs). The detection probability has specifically decreased in areas characterized by high rainfall and human population densities, whereas the probability has increased near food-rich sites, characterized by high marking frequencies. The temporal trends of spraint count predictions were in line with changes in the diversity of fish communities in 2014-2017 instead of fish biomass, suggesting that the availability of feeding resources is higher where fish communities are more diverse. Because diverse fish communities can attract otters, fish diversity conservation is critical for preserving this mammal's populations. This fine scale four-year monitoring has contributed to the disentanglement of the role of spraint presence/absence and spraint counts in detectability and population trends. This will assist in identifying key resource areas and planning strategies to promote otter conservation and dispersal dynamics.

AB  - Physical damage caused by the mechanical impact of bottom fishing gears on epibenthic community can reduce the biomass and coverage of habitat-forming species as well as the richness and diversity of the rest of the associated community. A practical development of a methodology for spatially assessing the potential degree of disturbance that benthic habitats suffered as a consequence of trawling and long-lining was carried out using a seamount located within a marine Natura 2000 site in the western Mediterranean as a case of study. By jointly assessing the extent of the impact and mapping the sensitivity of all the habitats to these fishing activities, vulnerability and disturbance per benthic habitat and pressure type was evaluated. Habitat sensitivity and fishing effort were combined using a disturbance matrix which categorize grid cells in 9 different levels of disturbance. Additionally, different thresholds of probability of presence of the different habitats obtained from distribution models were used to identify priority conservation and potential recovery. Around 50% of the area was disturbed by fishing and all habitats, both biogenic and non-biogenic, were subjected to fishing. Most of the trawling effort was carried out on soft bathyal substrates while the percentage of longlining effort carried out on hard bottoms was relatively higher than for trawling. Biogenic habitats showed significantly greater sensitivity to both trawling and longlining than non-biogenic habitats. Disturbed, priority conservation and potential recovery areas were identified and mapped in order to inform marine spatial planning.

AB  - Ecoseries are ecological land units which are classified by means of characteristics of soil and groundwater that can be regarded as conditioning site factors. These conditioning site factors control so-called operative site factors, such as moisture availability, nutrient availability, or acidity, which determine the species composition of the vegetation. Under undisturbed circumstances, each ecoseries type is characterized by a specific frequency distribution of operative abiotic site types. The latter may each carry vegetations in different stages of succession.
   Thanks to the relations between vegetation, operative site factors and conditioning site factors, an adequate ecoseries classification is a valuable tool for environmental policy analyses, for example in the context of predictive modelling or for assessing nature's recovery potential for physical planning, environmental management and nature conservation policy.
   In this paper, we explain how we achieved an ecoseries classification and nationwide 1 km(2) database for the Netherlands, primarily intended for national water management questions. The database is derived from existing maps of soil and groundwater which were re-interpreted from an ecological point of view. We especially treat the use of the ecoseries classification for 'potential site mapping', where 'site' is used in the sense of abiotic conditions determining natural vegetation development. The occurrence probability of potential sites is calculated by applying site-diagrams which introduce a probabilistic element.
   The resulting maps are intended as an aid to focussing the national policy's financial means aimed at 'nature development' and restoration projects. The maps inspire confidence in the approach as they show a considerable overlap with actual sites' occurrence as established from separately gathered floristic and vegetation data.

AB  - We developed broad-scale habitat use models for the distribution of the Iberian hare Lepus granatensis Rosenhaeur, 1856 and the relative abundance of the European wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus (Linnaeus, 1758) in a mountainous area in north-western Spain, the Baixa Limia Site of Community Importance (SCI). For the Iberian hare, the most parsimonious model included average altitude, average slope, scrub-pasture area and length of border between scrublands and forests. Four variables were consequential, 2 of them with a positive sign for the presence of the hare (average altitude and scrubland area) and 2 with a negative one (average slope and length of border between scrubland and forest). For the European wild rabbit the most parsimonious General Linear model obtained included average altitude and scrub-forest edge. Only 2 predictors were consequential, both with a negative sign on the relative abundance of wild rabbits: the average altitude and length of border between scrubland and forest. The models obtained indicated the need of management actions to favour open habitats with suitable vegetation structure, avoiding extensive reforestation. A revision of the current hunting plans in the protected area of Baixa Limia is required.

AB  - Monitoring is usually among the first actions taken to help inform recovery planning for declining species, but these data are rarely used formally to inform conservation decision making. For example, Central Valley Chinook salmon were once abundant, but anthropogenic activities have led to widespread habitat loss and degradation resulting in significant population declines. Monitoring data suggest survival through the southern SacramentoSan Joaquin River Delta, in particular, may be a limiting factor for juvenile Chinook salmon outmigrating from the San Joaquin River and its tributaries. However, survival and routing monitoring data have not been formally used to inform water management in a decision analytic framework. Here, we illustrate how estimates derived from disjunct monitoring data can be used to inform water management and as a basis for adaptively managing flows. We aggregated a meta-analysis of Chinook salmon smolt survival and routing estimates through the south Delta with other sources of data to develop a survival and routing simulation model to estimate optimal flows for the San Joaquin River during smolt outmigration from February-May. We found that large flow pulses at predictable times during the spring are projected to be optimal for increasing Chinook salmon smolt survival to the San Francisco Bay and that optimal scenarios differed somewhat with water year type. Sensitivity analysis revealed temperature and smolt outmigration timing are driving optimal pulse distribution and that water allocation changes little with parameter uncertainty. This case study highlights the utility of the decision-analytic framework for solving conservation problems.

AB  - Habitat use and site fidelity in coastal dolphins can vary in space and time, and are important components in conservation planning and predicting the impacts of environmental change. Little is known of long-term patterns of habitat use and site fidelity in threatened tropical delphinids. Here, we investigate trends in habitat use and site fidelity of Australian humpback dolphins Sousa sahulensis in Moreton Bay, a near-urban embayment in Queensland, Australia, using spatially referenced sightings from systematic surveys and government datasets. Data from 1992 to 2016 were assigned to 3 time periods with similar spatial coverage and compared using ecological niche and kernel models. We also used behavioural data collected from 2014 to 2016 to investigate the potential ecological function underpinning recent habitat preferences. A long-term fidelity and consistency in habitat use was evident at an industrialised port at the mouth of the Brisbane River, but patterns of habitat use were more dynamic elsewhere. Models of spatial patterns of behaviour suggested that areas used consistently were mostly foraging habitats. A marked shift in habitat use away from the northwestern side of Moreton Bay was evident after 1999, which we suggest was due to a decline in habitat integrity exacerbated by periodic floods. Our results imply that the optimal conservation strategy for the species would be to focus on areas that are long-term core habitats, whilst safeguarding against environmental change by maintaining habitat integrity across the broader area delineated by their ecological niche.

AB  - The insular endemic Gates barrel cactus, Ferocactus gatesii (Cactaceae) [syn. Ferocactus gracilis ssp. gatesii], is only found on seven islands in Bahia de Los Angeles (BLA), an International Biosphere Reserve in Baja California, Mexico. The islands have different geologic origins; some formed as a result of lava flows, and others by the cooling of magma within the crust. These rock types give rise to different soil physical properties, with F. gatesii only observed growing in granite substrates. This suggests that F. gatesii is in fact an edaphic endemic, restricted to specific soil lithologies on the small islands. Proposed edaphic properties of the preferred granite substrate include controls on soil porosity, permeability, nutrient availability and geomorphic conditions that may influence plant success. Further research is necessary to evaluate the mechanisms of soil property effects on F. gatesii presence and survival, however, recognizing this general pattern is of critical importance to conservation planning, particularly in the face of intensifying environmental stresses from increased aridity, decreasing precipitation, and illegal harvesting. This new information allows us to improve models for potential habitat in an assisted migration scenario and allows insights into the evolutionary processes that resulted in this narrowly endemic species.

AB  - North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis (hereafter right whales) have recently shifted their distribution away from some protected feeding habitats, which suggests large-scale changes in food supply have occurred. Quantifying the nature and extent of the apparent shift is key to exploring this hypothesis and planning or revising conservation strategies. This paper characterizes decadal right whale occurrence in the Bay of Fundy summer feeding habitat using data derived from 7522 h of survey effort collected over 30 yr (1987 to 2016) that yielded 11483 right whale sightings. Eight occurrence descriptors were derived to quantify temporal variation in right whale presence, encounter rates and time of arrival in the Bay. Time of arrival was modeled using linear and power function models fit to annual discovery curves. Principal component analysis showed 2 modes that explained 58 and 14 % of the variation in occurrence, respectively. The first mode captured a significant decline in summertime right whale occurrence beginning in 2010. The second mode captured a decadal-scale cycle in seasonal timing of occurrence, which highlighted a sharp change from early to late occupancy at the turn of the millennium. Annual occurrence during the 2010-2016 period was anomalously low in both the Grand Manan Basin critical habitat and the Bay of Fundy Traffic Separation Scheme (shipping lanes), whereas encounters in the region NW of the critical habitat containing Owen Basin and The Wolves islands may be increasing due to a distributional shift within the Bay. We discuss the consequences of these changes for both population dynamics and future conservation of the species.

AB  - Bioclimatology deals with the interrelation between climate and living organisms, in particular, plants and plant communities, considering the main climate variables that are relevant for species distribution. In this context spatial interpolation of monthly temperature and precipitation data using 203 rain gauges and 68 temperature gauges for Sardinia (Italy) was undertaken. As interpolation technique, we used regression kriging which combines multiple linear regression (MLR) with ordinary kriging of the residuals. MLR procedures include as independent variables: altitude, latitude, longitude, coast distance and a topographic factor of relative elevation. Elevation data were obtained from digital elevation model at 40 m resolution. Following the approach of the Worldwide Bioclimatic Classification System, a bioclimatic diagnosis of the entire territory was derived using map algebra calculations of the bioclimatic indices proposed by Rivas-Martinez et al. [(2011). Worldwide Bioclimatic classification system. Global Geobotany, 1, 1-638]. Two macrobioclimates (Mediterranean pluviseasonal oceanic and Temperate oceanic), one macrobioclimatic variant (Submediterranean), and four classes of continentality (from weak semihyperoceanic to weak semicontinental), eight thermotypic horizons (from lower thermomediterranean to upper supratemperate) and seven ombrotypic horizons (from lower dry to lower hyperhumid) were identified, resulting in a combination of 43 isobioclimates. The resulting map represents a useful environmental stratum, for regional planning, ecological modeling and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - There is considerable uncertainty about the relative roles of stream habitat and landscape characteristics in structuring stream-fish assemblages. We evaluated the relative importance of environmental characteristics on fish occupancy at the local and landscape scales within the upper Little Tennessee River basin of Georgia and North Carolina. Fishes were sampled using a quadrat sample design at 525 channel units within 48 study reaches during two consecutive years. We evaluated species-habitat relationships (local and landscape factors) by developing hierarchical, multispecies occupancy models. Modeling results suggested that fish occupancy within the Little Tennessee River basin was primarily influenced by stream topology and topography, urban land coverage, and channel unit types. Landscape scale factors (e.g., urban land coverage and elevation) largely controlled the fish assemblage structure at a stream-reach level, and local-scale factors (i.e., channel unit types) influenced fish distribution within stream reaches. Our study demonstrates the utility of a multi-scaled approach and the need to account for hierarchy and the interscale interactions of factors influencing assemblage structure prior to monitoring fish assemblages, developing biological management plans, or allocating management resources throughout a stream system.

AB  - Complex ecological and epidemiological systems require multidisciplinary and innovative research. Low cost unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can provide information on the spatial pattern of hosts' distribution and abundance, which is crucial as regards modelling the determinants of disease transmission and persistence on a fine spatial scale. In this context we have studied the spatial epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) in the ungulate community of Donana National Park (South-western Spain) by modelling species host (red deer, fallow deer and cattle) abundance at fine spatial scale. The use of UAS high-resolution images has allowed us to collect data to model the environmental determinants of host abundance, and in a further step to evaluate their relationships with the spatial risk of TB throughout the ungulate community. We discuss the ecological, epidemiological and logistic conditions under which UAS may contribute to study the wildlife/livestock sanitary interface, where the spatial aggregation of hosts becomes crucial. These findings are relevant for planning and implementing research, fundamentally when managing disease in multi-host systems, and focusing on risky areas. Therefore, managers should prioritize the implementation of control strategies to reduce disease of conservation, economic and social relevance.

AB  - Bird counts by community volunteers provide valuable information about the conservation needs of many bird species. The statistical modeling techniques commonly used to analyze these counts provide robust, long-term population trend estimates from heterogeneous community science data at regional, national, and continental scales. Here, we present a new modeling approach that increases the spatial resolution of trend estimates and reduces the computational burden of trend estimation, each by an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the approach with data for the American Robin (Turdus migratorius) from Audubon Christmas Bird Counts conducted between 1966 and 2017. We show that aggregate regional trend estimates from the proposed method aligned well with those from the current standard method, and that spatial variation in trends was associated with winter temperatures and human population densities as predicted by ecological energetics. This technique can provide reasonable large-scale trend estimates for users interested in general patterns, while also providing higher-resolution estimates for examining correlates of abundance trends at finer spatial scales, which is a prerequisite for tailoring management plans to local conditions.

AB  - Outdoor recreation is a widely recognized cultural ecosystem service. Ensuring that appropriate, high quality recreation opportunities are available requires, among other factors, knowledge of the environmental preferences of recreation users and spatial indicators of where those environmental features exist on the landscape and offer the potential to meet recreation goals. Diverse types of outdoor recreation exist, and different forms of recreation may be associated with different environmental features. The focus of this study is off-road vehicle (ORV) recreation. We demonstrate how readily available spatial environmental datasets, including high resolution image data provided within GoogleEarth, can be used to develop a cost-effective, objective indicator of ORV recreation across a landscape, which can inform management to provide desired recreation opportunities while protecting ecologically sensitive areas.
   ORV recreational tracks were delineated from GoogleEarth imagery throughout our study area in the Great Western Woodlands of Western Australia. In this region, ORV use is a popular recreation activity and a growing concern of conservation organizations, but is not yet actively managed. Most recreational ORV tracks in the study area are informal and user-created. Mapped ORV recreation tracks were used to model and map the environmental associations of ORV recreation. The pattern of existing tracks indicated associations between recreation and noteworthy environmental amenities in the study area such as the shores of salt lakes and rock outcrops with high ecological and cultural value. However, one of the most important determinants of ORV track presence was accessibility, especially proximity to a road. Access infrastructure, such as proximity to roads, is often used to proxy demand and use in expert-based spatial assessments of ecosystem services. The results of our empirical model underscore the importance of incorporating patterns of both supply (i.e., desired natural amenities) and demand (i.e., access) into ecosystem service assessments. In addition, when integrated with maps of environmental sensitivity and more detailed information about human use, the predictive map of areas providing potential recreation experiences can be used for comprehensive spatial planning of sustainable ORV recreation. One possibility suggested by our results is that careful planning and management of access routes may be an effective means to achieve sustainable ORV recreation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim To map and interpret floristic and geoecological patterns across the Amazon basin by combining extensive field data with basin-wide Landsat imagery and climatic data. Location Amazonia. Taxon Ground truth data on ferns and lycophytes; remote sensing results reflect forest canopy properties. Methods We used field plot data to assess main ecological gradients across Amazonia and to relate floristic ordination axes to soil base cation concentration, Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas (CHELSA) climatic variables and reflectance values from a basin-wide Landsat image composite with generalized linear models. Ordination axes were then predicted across all Amazonia using Landsat and CHELSA, and a regional subdivision was obtained using k-medoid classification. Results The primary floristic gradient was strongly related to base cation concentration in the soil, and the secondary gradient to climatic variables. The Landsat image composite revealed a tapestry of broad-scale variation in canopy reflectance characteristics across Amazonia. Ordination axis scores predicted using Landsat and CHELSA variables produced spatial patterns consistent with existing knowledge on soils, geology and vegetation, but also suggested new floristic patterns. The clearest dichotomy was between central Amazonia and the peripheral areas, and the available data supported a classification into at least eight subregions. Main conclusions Landsat data are capable of predicting soil-related species compositional patterns of understorey ferns and lycophytes across the Amazon basin with surprisingly high accuracy. Although the exact floristic relationships may differ among plant groups, the observed ecological gradients must be relevant for other plants as well, since surface reflectance recorded by satellites is mostly influenced by the tree canopy. This opens exciting prospects for species distribution modelling, conservation planning, and biogeographical and ecological studies on Amazonian biota. Our maps provide a preliminary geoecological subdivision of Amazonia that can now be tested and refined using field data of other plant groups and from hitherto unsampled areas.

AB  - 1. Seabirds and pinnipeds are vulnerable to reductions in prey availability, especially during the breeding season when spatial constraints limit their adaptive capacity. There are growing concerns about the effects of fisheries on prey availability in regions where large commercial fisheries target forage fish.
   2. For breeding seabirds and pinnipeds, prey availability depends on a combination of abundance, accessibility, patchiness and distance from the colony. An understanding of the aspects of prey availability that determine foraging success is essential for the design of effective management responses.
   3. We used a mechanistic individual-based foraging model based on observed data for two sea-bird species, the Peruvian Booby Sula variegata and Guanay Cormorant Phalacrocorax bougainvilliorum, to simulate the foraging patterns of seabirds feeding on schooling fish. We ran the model over simulated prey fields representing eight possible combinations of high or low prey abundance, shallow or deep prey, and broadly distributed or spatially concentrated prey.
   4. The results highlight the importance of the accessibility of prey. Depth distribution was the primary factor determining modelled foraging success for both species, followed by abundance, and then spatial configuration.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The individual-based foraging model provides a spatially explicit framework for assessing the effects of fisheries on the foraging success of seabirds and other central place foragers, and for evaluating the potential effectiveness of marine-protected areas and other fisheries management strategies for safeguarding central place foragers in dynamic ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that broad-scale fisheries management strategies that maintain forage fish above critical biomass levels are essential, but may need to be supplemented by targeted actions, such as time-area closures, when environmental conditions lead to low prey abundance or reduce prey accessibility for seabirds or pinnipeds of conservation concern. The individual-based foraging model is adaptable and could be reconfigured for application to other species and systems.

AB  - Context. The study of the spatial variation in abundance of wild populations and the identification of factors explaining the observed patterns are key both to understand aspects of basic ecology and the effects of human activities. This is usually difficult to evaluate for low-density and widely distributed species, such as the lesser rhea (Rhea pennata pennata), an endemic bird from South America. Recent advances in spatial modelling such as the density surface models (DSM) combine distance-sampling procedures with modelling techniques to produce maps of spatial variation in abundance, and its relationship with predictive variables.
   Aims. We aimed to analyse the spatial distribution and abundance of lesser rhea, and the variables that affect its abundance in Peninsula Valdes (PV) Argentine Patagonia.
   Methods. We conducted 338.4 km of ground surveys of lesser rheas in PV during the end of the Austral summer of 2015. Spatial models were constructed using DSM. Ecological and human-related variables were included in the models to account for variation in the abundance of animals at 4-km(2) spatial resolution.
   Key results. We estimated an overall density of 0.44 birds km(-2) (CV = 32%) for the prediction area of 3320 km(2). High values of normalised difference vegetation index, a correlate of plant productivity, were associated with increased numbers of lesser rheas. The location of ranch buildings, indicators of human presence, had a strong negative effect on lesser rheas, although their abundance increased at high sheep stocking rates.
   Conclusions. As reported by previous studies in different sites, the abundance of lesser rheas in our study area was low. The use of DSM allowed a detailed examination of the spatial variation, as well as the variables involved and the uncertainty of the prediction.
   Implications. The use of DSM techniques can be a useful tool for conservation planning and monitoring. Spatial, high-resolution data combined with knowledge on the factors affecting the number of animals are crucial to target specific conservation actions and monitor their results, and should allow government agencies to make better decisions concerning conservation-oriented management.

AB  - Background: Dupont's Lark is an endangered bird, whose fragmented distribution in Europe is entirely restricted to Spain. This lark, suffering pronounced population decline and range contraction, inhabits steppes that have long been used for grazing sheep and are now threatened by rural abandonment and land use changes. Thus, for conservation of the lark, increasing knowledge about the connectivity of the Spanish metapopulation and identifying the most important connectivity nodes are crucial.
   Methods: The study was carried out in Spain, using over 16,000 Dupont's Lark georeferenced observations. We used distance buffers to define populations and subpopulations, based on the available scientific information. We identified potential stepping stones using a MaxEnt probability of presence model. Connectivity was assessed using Conefor software, using the centroid of each subpopulation and stepping stone as nodes. Each node was assigned a quantitative attribute based on total habitat area, within-node habitat quality and internal fragmentation. We evaluated different connectivity scenarios by potential movement thresholds (5-20-100 km) and presence or absence of stepping stones in the network.
   Results: Dupont's Lark Iberian metapopulation comprises 24 populations and 100 subpopulations, plus 294 potential stepping stones. Movement thresholds and stepping stones had a strong influence in the potential network connectivity. The most important nodes are located in the core of the metapopulation, which shows connectivity among subpopulations in the different indices and scenarios evaluated. Peripheral populations are more isolated and require stepping stones or medium (20 km) or long (100 km) potential movement thresholds to join the network.
   Discussion: Metapopulation connectivity may be greater than expected, thanks to stepping stones and potential medium-distance movements. Connectivity is crucial for conservation and can be increased by preserving or improving adequate habitat in the most important nodes. Given the current species decline, steppe habitat should be urgently protected from land use changes and agriculture intensification, at least in the critical subpopulations and stepping stones. Long-term conservation of steppe lands and Dupont's Lark in Spain requires the recovery of traditional grazing and more research on juvenile dispersion. Meanwhile, the conservation of potentially critical stepping stones should be incorporated to management plans.

AB  - 1. After a century of fire suppression and accumulating fuel loads in North American forests, prescribed burns are increasingly used to prevent conditions leading to catastrophic megafire. There is widespread evidence that prescribed fire was used by Indigenous communities to manage natural and cultural resources tribes for thousands of years. Wildlife habitat is an example of an ecological response that was actively managed with prescribed burns by Indigenous American peoples and is an important factor in western US forest management planning, restoration and climate resilience efforts.
   2. We analysed the effects of modern prescribed burns informed by traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) on the predicted change in elk winter habitat in Karuk aboriginal territory in Northern California between 2013 and 2018 using species distribution and simultaneous autoregressive modelling techniques.
   3. Burn types most closely resembling Karuk traditional practices, specifically those incorporating multiple-year broadcast burns, had significant positive effects on elk winter habitat suitability. Conversely, concentrated burns focused solely on reducing fuel loads had significant negative effects on elk winter habitat suitability. However, areas where these fuel-reduction burns were combined with multiple years of broadcast burns featured the highest increases in habitat.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that transitioning to prescribed burns that more closely follow Karuk traditional ecological knowledge will promote elk habitat in the region. This would be best achieved through continuing to work closely with Indigenous representatives to plan and implement cultural fire prescriptions on a landscape scale, a trend we posit would benefit environmental management efforts across the globe.

AB  - The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a globally threatened species living in the multi-national Hindu-Kush Himalaya (HKH) region. It has a declining population trend due to anthropogenic pressures. Human-driven climate change is expected to have substantial impacts. However, quantitative and transparent information on the ecological niche (potential as well as realized) of this species across the vast and complex eight nations of the HKH region is lacking. Such baseline information is not only crucial for identifying new populations but also for restoring locally-extinct populations, for understanding its bio-geographical evolution, as well as for prioritizing regions and an efficient management.
   First we compiled, and made publicly available through an institutional repository (dSPACE), the best known 'presence only' red panda dataset with ISO compliant metadata. This was done through the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD.org) data-platform to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org). We used data mining and machine learning algorithms such as high-performance commercial Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forest, TreeNet, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines implementations. We averaged all these Geographic Information System (GIS) models for the first produced ensemble model for this species in the HKH region.
   Our predictive model is the first of its kind and allows to assess the red panda distribution based on empirical open access data, latest methods and the major signals and drivers of the ecological niche. It allows to assess and fine-tune earlier habitat area estimates. Our models promote 'best professional practices'. It can readily be used by the red panda Recovery Team, the red panda Action Plan, etc. because they are robust, transparent, publicly available, fit for use, and have a good accuracy, as judged by several independent assessment metrics (Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC-AUC) curves, expert opinion, assessed by known absence regions, 95% confidence intervals and new field data).

AB  - Small-size, relict and marginal tree-species populations are a priority for conservation of forest genetic resources. In-situ conservation of these populations relies on adequate forest management planning based on knowledge and understanding of both ecological (i.e., recruitment or dispersal dynamics) and population-genetic processes (i.e., female reproductive success, gene flow or inbreeding). Here, we estimate the fecundity (or female reproductive success) of adult trees (i.e., the number of successfully established offspring/adult tree) and the effective dispersal distance distribution in the pine forest of Fuencaliente (southern Spain), a small-sized, marginal and relict population of maritime pine growing on a steep, craggy hill with just 312 reproductively active individuals. Previous studies have shown the population to present reduced allelic richness and suffer from genetic introgression from nearby exotic plantations of unknown origin. Between 2003 and 2004, we surveyed all adults and recruits and we measured several adult-specific covariates, including the number of cones of all adults. The population was found to be distributed into two nuclei with 268 (Stand 1) and 44 adults (Stand 2). We used inverse modeling to adjust several dispersal-and-fecundity models including a model with random variation in fecundity among adults (Unrestricted Fecundity or UF model). Results show that: (i) the average fecundity is 2.5-3.2 recruits/adult; (ii) the mean effective dispersal distance is restricted to 13-24 m and (iii) fecundity is most likely controlled by the spatial location of adult trees in Stand,1 but it should be considered randomly distributed in Stand 2 (in this stand five adults mothered 80% of recruits). We conclude that the low fecundity in Stand 1 and the unequal fecundity in Stand 2 may decrease the population genetic diversity and lead to lower effective population size while the low average dispersal distance may reduce the probability of this population expanding to adjacent areas. In light of the results, we define the management priorities for in-situ conservation of this population.

AB  - Forest management planning requires the specification of measurable objectives as desired future conditions at spatial extents ranging from stands to landscapes and temporal extents ranging from a single growing season to several centuries. Effective implementation of forest management requires understanding current conditions and constraints well enough to apply the appropriate silvicultural strategies to produce desired future conditions, often for multiple objectives, at varying spatial and temporal extents. We administered an online survey to forest managers in the eastern US to better understand how wildlife scientists could best provide information to help meet wildlife-related habitat objectives. We then examined more than 1000 review papers on bird-vegetation relationships in the eastern US compiled during a systematic review of the primary literature to see how well this evidence-base meets the information needs of forest managers. We identified two main areas where wildlife scientists could increase the relevance and applicability of their research. First, forest managers want descriptions of wildlife species-vegetation relationships using the operational metrics of forest management (forest type, tree species composition, basal area, tree density, stocking rates, etc.) summarized at the operational spatial units of forest management (stands, compartments, and forests). Second, forest managers want information about how to provide wildlife habitats for many different species with varied habitat needs across temporal extents related to the ecological processes of succession after harvest or natural disturbance (1-2 decades) or even longer periods of stand development. We provide examples of review papers that meet these information needs of forest managers and topic-specific bibliographies of additional review papers that may contain actionable information for foresters who wish to meet wildlife management objectives. We suggest that wildlife scientists become more familiar with the extensive grey literature on forest bird-vegetation relationships and forest management that is available in natural resource management agency reports. We also suggest that wildlife scientists could reconsider everything from the questions they ask, the metrics they report on, and the way they allocate samples in time and space, to provide more relevant and actionable information to forest managers.

AB  - Predicting population dynamics for rare species is of paramount importance in order to evaluate the likelihood of extinction and planning conservation strategies. However, evaluating and predicting population viability can be hindered from a lack of data. Rare species frequently have small populations, so estimates of vital rates are often very uncertain due to lack of data. We evaluated the vital rates of seven small populations from two watersheds with varying light environment of a common epiphytic orchid using Bayesian methods of parameter estimation. From the Lefkovitch matrices we predicted the deterministic population growth rates, elasticities, stable stage distributions and the credible intervals of the statistics. Populations were surveyed on a monthly basis between 18-34 months. In some of the populations few or no transitions in some of the vital rates were observed throughout the sampling period, however, we were able to predict the most likely vital rates using a Bayesian model that incorporated the transitions rates from the other populations. Asymptotic population growth rate varied among the seven orchid populations. There was little difference in population growth rate among watersheds even though it was expected because of physical differences as a result of differing canopy cover and watershed width. Elasticity analyses of Lepanthes rupestris suggest that growth rate is more sensitive to survival followed by growth, shrinking and the reproductive rates. The Bayesian approach helped to estimate transition probabilities that were uncommon or variable in some populations. Moreover, it increased the precision of the parameter estimates as compared to traditional approaches.

AB  - Bryophytes (liverworts, mosses and hornworts) are one of the most diverse plant groups worldwide but one of the least studied in temperate forests from an ecological perspective. In comparison to vascular plants, bryophytes have a broader distribution and a longer altitudinal gradient, and their influence on the landscape is poorly understood. The objective was to evaluate environmental drivers that can influence bryophyte cover, richness, diversity, and nestedness in different forest canopy compositions in two typical landscapes across the natural distribution of bryophytes in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina). Three natural Nothofagus forest types (pure deciduous, pure evergreen, and mixed deciduous-evergreen) in two landscapes (coasts < 100 m.a.s.l. and mountains > 400 m.a.s.l.) were selected (N = 60 plots). In each plot, we established one transect (10 m length) to measure bryophyte cover (point-intercept method). Data were evaluated using generalized linear mixed models and multivariate analyses. The studied environmental drivers were mainly explained by the microclimate, with higher effective annual precipitation and relative air humidity in the coastal forests and higher soil moisture in the mountain forests. Greater liverwort richness was found in evergreen forests at the mountain (9 species) than at the coastal, while mosses showed higher richness in mixed deciduous-evergreen forests at the coastal (11 species) than at the mountain. However, the expected richness according to the rarefaction/extrapolation curves suggested that it is possible to record additional species, except for liverworts in pure deciduous forests on the coasts. Similarities and differences among the studied forest types and among plots of the same forest type and landscape were detected. These differences in the studied indexes (similarity that varied between 0 and 1) ranged from 0.09-0.48 for liverworts and 0.05-0.65 for mosses. Moreover, these results indicated that pure evergreen and mixed deciduous-evergreen forests presented higher moss cover (10.7% and 10.0%, respectively), mainly in the mountains than on the coast. These outputs highlight the need to explore differences at greater altitudinal ranges to achieve sustainability objectives conservation planning for bryophytes in southernmost forests.

AB  - Climate change is expected to result in an acceleration of current rates of sea level rise, inundating many low-lying coastal and intertidal landscapes. This could have important implications for many coastal habitat types and related organisms that depend on these habitats, including shorebirds that rely on them for feeding, overwintering and breeding. Potential change in the availability of suitable breeding area according to linear and model-based sea level rise scenarios was modeled for four breeding birds (Kentish Plover, Little Tern, Common Tern and Black-winged Stilt) in Seovlje Salina Nature Park, based on precise mapping of nests over a period of 10 years and on present environmental predictors. Different breeding niches for the studied bird species in SSNP were identified, which indirectly indicates different responses to environmental change, in this case triggered by climate change induced sea level rise. Future breeding suitability maps indicate that the Little Tern and the Common Tern could potentially face a drastic decrease of adequate breeding grounds in SSNP later than the Kentish Plover and the Black-winged Stilt. However, these individual species responses to sea level rise, as a climate change driver, is a step forward for conservation biologists and landscape planners in protected areas, as they prepare cost-effective plans for mitigating negative impact on these ecosystems. This study also illustrates an important general point about the likely effects of climate change on ecological resources, which is that climate change does not happen in a vacuum; its impact will interact with pre-existing stress factors.

AB  - The non-stationary climates of the 21st century are compelling forest managers to seek non-local species, provenances, and silvicultural regimes that are better suited to the anticipated future climates of their operating areas. Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province's area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC's ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.

AB  - Exponential human population growth has resulted in overexploitation of resources, the introduction of alien invasive species, habitat destruction and fragmentation, and the subsequent global endangerment and extinction of many species. Globally, governmental, and nongovernmental programs, use nature reserves (NRs) to mitigate against the decline of biological diversity by protecting habitats and their inhabitants from fragmentation and other negative anthropogenic impacts. However, numerous studies conducted at multiple spatial and temporal scales have revealed that existing NRs do not effectively represent biodiversity, or are experiencing declines in biodiversity because of anthropogenic encroachment around NRs. Our study examined the spatial distribution and characteristics of the NR system in Alabama using coarse-filter gap analysis. We compiled a dataset of private and public NRs in Alabama, and analyzed the extent and effectiveness of Alabama's NR system in representing ecosystem diversity. We found that NRs occupied approximately 840,000 ha (6.2%) of land area in Alabama. Public NRs covered 6.0% of Alabama land area, and private NRs covered 0.2% of the land area. We found a latitudinal shift in NR parcels from majority private NR parcel presence in northeast Alabama to majority public parcel ownership in southwest Alabama. The statewide mean NR parcel area was 2149.47 ha; the mean public NR area was 4789 ha; the mean private NR area was 151 ha; and the mean distance (isolation) between NRs was 4.5 km. We hypothesize the distribution of parcel property types throughout Alabama was related to socioeconomic status, race, and metropolitan areas throughout the state. Our results may be used to improve conservation planning in Alabama, and our approach used as a model to assess NR systems in other states or regions.

AB  - Geographic range size is often conceptualized as a fixed attribute of a species and treated as such for the purposes of quantification of extinction risk; species occupying smaller geographic ranges are assumed to have a higher risk of extinction, all else being equal. However many species are mobile, and their movements range from relatively predictable to-and-fro migrations to complex irregular movements shown by nomadic species. These movements can lead to substantial temporary expansion and contraction of geographic ranges, potentially to levels which may pose an extinction risk. By linking occurrence data with environmental conditions at the time of observations of nomadic species, we modeled the dynamic distributions of 43 arid-zone nomadic bird species across the Australian continent for each month over 11 years and calculated minimum range size and extent of fluctuation in geographic range size from these models. There was enormous variability in predicted spatial distribution over time; 10 species varied in estimated geographic range size by more than an order of magnitude, and 2 species varied by >2 orders of magnitude. During times of poor environmental conditions, several species not currently classified as globally threatened contracted their ranges to very small areas, despite their normally large geographic range size. This finding raises questions about the adequacy of conventional assessments of extinction risk based on static geographic range size (e.g., IUCN Red Listing). Climate change is predicted to affect the pattern of resource fluctuations across much of the southern hemisphere, where nomadism is the dominant form of animal movement, so it is critical we begin to understand the consequences of this for accurate threat assessment of nomadic species. Our approach provides a tool for discovering spatial dynamics in highly mobile species and can be used to unlock valuable information for improved extinction risk assessment and conservation planning.
   Tamano de Extension Geografica y Evaluacion de Riesgo de Extincion en Especies Nomadas El tamano de extension geografica se conceptualiza frecuentemente como un atributo fijo de las especies y se trata como tal para los propositos de cuantificacion de riesgo de extincion; se asume que las especies que ocupan extensiones geograficas mas pequenas tienen un riesgo de extincion mas alto, cuando todo lo demas es igual. Sin embargo, muchas especies son moviles y sus movimientos varian desde migraciones de ida y vuelta relativamente predecibles hasta movimientos irregulares complejos, como los que muestran las especies nomadas. Estos movimientos pueden llevar a expansiones sustanciales temporales y a una reduccion de las extensiones geograficas, todo esto con el potencial de llegar a niveles que pueden presentar un riesgo de extincion. Al enlazar los datos de presencia con las condiciones ambientales al momento de la observacion de las especies nomadas pudimos modelar las distribuciones dinamicas de 43 especies de aves de zonas aridas a lo largo de la isla de Australia durante cada mes a lo largo de once anos y calculamos el tamano de extension minima y el alcance de las fluctuaciones en el tamano de extension geografica a partir de estos modelos. Hubo una enorme variabilidad en la distribucion espacial pronosticada a lo largo del tiempo: diez especies variaron en el tamano de extension geografica por mas de una orden de magnitud y dos especies variaron por mas de dos ordenes de magnitud. Durante situaciones de condiciones ambientales pobres, varias especies que actualmente no se encuentran clasificadas como amenazadas a nivel global redujeron sus extensiones a areas muy pequenas, esto a pesar de su gran tamano de extension geografica normal. Este hallazgo genera preguntas sobre lo idoneo de las evaluaciones convencionales del riesgo de extincion con base en el tamano estatico de extension geografica (p. ej.: la Lista Roja de la UICN). Se pronostica que el cambio climatico afectara los patrones de las fluctuaciones de recursos en casi todo el hemisferio sur, donde el nomadismo es la forma dominante de movimiento de animales, asi que es critico que comencemos a entender las consecuencias de esto para tener una evaluacion certera del riesgo de extincion de especies nomadas. Nuestra estrategia proporciona una herramienta para descubrir las dinamicas espaciales de especies con movilidad alta y puede usarse para liberar informacion valiosa para una mejor evaluacion de riesgo de extincion y planeacion de la conservacion.

AB  - Geomorphic landscape features have been suggested as indicators of forest diversity. However, their explanatory power has not yet been explicitly tested at a regional scale in tropical rainforest. We used forest inventories conducted according to a stratified sampling design (3,132 plots in 111 transects at 33 sites) and holistic multi-scale geomorphological mapping derived from a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model to describe and explain spatial patterns in floristic composition across French Guiana (80,000 km(2)). We measured and identified 123,906 trees with DBH a parts per thousand yen20 cm and used constrained and unconstrained ordinations to analyze variations in the abundance of 221 taxa and 51 families. Variance partitioning and variograms were used to detect spatial patterns in species composition, compare the explanatory power of spatial and environmental factors, and select the variables that best explain forest composition. Strong floristic patterns corresponded to a major latitudinal gradient and significant sub-regional floristic structure. Geomorphological landscapes shaped by historic climate fluctuations and major geological events successfully captured these patterns and explained the variation in abundance of 80 taxa, corresponding to 65 % of the inventoried trees. Our findings suggest that long-term forest dynamics are under substantial "geomorphographic control". A geomorphological perspective on landscapes that incorporates current and past environmental filters and historical biogeographical processes could thus be used more systematically in tropical regions for regional planning and forest conservation.

AB  - Background: Riparian forests provide ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being. The Pepital River is the main water supply for Alcantara (Brazil) and its forests are disappearing. This is affecting water volume and distribution in the region. Promoting forest restoration is imperative. In deprived regions, restoration success depends on the integration of ecology, livelihoods and traditional knowledge (TEK). In this study, an interdisciplinary research framework is proposed to design riparian forest restoration strategies based on ecological data, TEK and social needs.
   Methods: This study takes place in a region presenting a complex history of human relocation and land tenure. Local populations from seven villages were surveyed to document livelihood (including 'free-listing' of agricultural crops and homegarden tree species). Additionally, their perceptions toward environmental changes were explored through semi-structured interviews (n = 79). Ethnobotanical information on forest species and their uses were assessed by local-specialists (n = 19). Remnants of conserved forests were surveyed to access ecological information on tree species (three plots of 1,000 m(2)).
   Results included descriptive statistics, frequency and Smith's index of salience of the free-list results. Results: The local population depends primarily on slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture to meet their needs. Interviewees showed a strong empirical knowledge about the environmental problems of the river, and of their causes, consequences and potential solutions. Twenty-four tree species (dbh > 10 cm) were found at the reference sites. Tree density averaged 510 individuals per hectare (stdv = 91.6); and 12 species were considered the most abundant (density > 10ind/ha). There was a strong consensus among plant-specialists about the most important trees. The species lists from reference sites and plant-specialists presented an important convergence.
   Conclusions: Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood but also the main driver of forest degradation. Effective restoration approaches must transform problems into solutions by empowering local people. Successional agroforestry combining annual crops and trees may be a suitable transitional phase for restoration. The model must be designed collectively and include species of ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic value. In deprived communities of the Amazon, forest restoration must be a process that combines environmental and social gains.

AB  - A Geographic Information System was used to assess the representation of ecological land units (ELUs) both within and external to the current preserve network of the Lower Twin Creek Watershed (LTCW), southwestern Ohio. ELUs were classified using multivariate and cluster analyses on forest canopy tree species and seven physiographic and soil variables derived from digital elevation models and a soil series map. Cluster analysis of the five most significant variables (landform, soil drainage, hillshade, curvature, and percent slope) influencing vegetation distribution resulted in nine discrete ELUs. They included uplands dominated by Fagus grandifolia-Acer saccharum, dry slopes dominated by Quercus spp.-Carya ovata, mesic slopes dominated by a mixed mesophytic community, and wet floodplains dominated by Platanus occidentalis-Populus deltoides. The area of forest in each ELU in the preserve network was compared to the area of forest in each ELU in the watershed as a whole and the potential natural area of forest cover determined by topographic position. Well-drained upland and poorly-drained upland ELUs were most underrepresented in the preserve network followed by wet broad floodplains. Results of the gap analysis based on current vegetation distribution were influenced by the pattern of deforestation in the LTCW. which was, in turn, related to topographic position: slopes were more likely to be forested and incorporated into a preserve system than more level lands suitable for agriculture. Protecting and restoring forest in upland ELUs will be necessary to capture a full range of ecosystem diversity in the LTCW.

AB  - Background.Picea chihuahuana, which is endemic to Mexico, is currently listed as Endangered on the Red List. Chihuahua spruce is only found in the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), Mexico. About 42,600 individuals are distributed in forty populations. These populations are fragmented and can be classified into three geographically distinct clusters in the SMO. The total area covered by P. chihuahuana populations is less than 300 ha. A recent study suggested assisted migration as an alternative to the ex situ conservation of P. chihuahuana, taking into consideration the genetic structure and diversity of the populations and the predictions regarding the future climate of the habitat. However, detailed background information is required to enable development of plans for protecting and conserving species and for successful assisted migration. Thus, it is important to identify differences between populations in relation to environmental conditions. The genetic diversity of populations, which affect vigor, evolution and adaptability of the species, must also be considered. In this study, we examined 14 populations of P. chihuahuana, with the overall aim of discriminating the populations and form clusters of this species.
   Methods. Each population was represented by one 50 x 50 m plot established in the center of its respective location. Climate, soil, dasometric, density variables and genetic and species diversities were assessed in these plots for further analyses. The putatively neutral and adaptive AFLP markers were used to calculate genetic diversity. Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering technique and k-means clustering algorithm were used to classify the populations in the optimal number of clusters. Later stepwise binomial logistic regression was applied to test for significant differences in variables of the southern and northern P. chihuahuana populations. Spearmans correlation test was used to analyze the relationships among all variables studied.
   Results. The binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that seven climate variables, the geographical longitude and sand proportion in the soil separated the southern from northern populations. The northern populations grow in more arid and continental conditions and on soils with lower sand proportion. The mean genetic diversity using all AFLP studied of P. chihuahuana was significantly correlated with the mean temperature in the warmest month, where warmer temperatures are associated to larger genetic diversity. Genetic diversity of P. chihuahuana calculated with putatively adaptive AFLP was not statistically significantly correlated with any environmental factor.
   Discussion. Future reforestation programs should take into account that at least two different groups (the northern and southern cluster) of P. chihuahuana exist, as local adaptation takes place because of different environmental conditions.

AB  - Contraction of native old forest can limit occurrence of old forest associated species, especially species with limited vagility. Patterns of size and distribution of remaining patches of old forest along with forest disturbance and what replaces old forest can influence whether species adapt or perish after forest loss. The arboreal red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) is a small arvicoline rodent that is associated with old coniferous forest and typically emigrates short distances. Since 1911, old forest (>= 80 years old) in the northern half of the Oregon Coast Range has been reduced by >80%, primarily due to large stand replacing wildfires, timber harvest, and subsequent conversion to young forest (<80 years old). In 2011, the tree vole population in the northern half of the Oregon Coast Range was listed as a candidate species as a distinct population segment under the United States Endangered Species Act, primarily due to habitat loss. We examined the contribution of current and historical (early 20th century) old forest cover, and recent disturbances (1984-2012) on relative habitat suitability for tree voles using light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) data, Landsat imagery, and machine learning. We used a step -wise variable removal procedure to build a parsimonious model and to rank contribution of variables in our final model. We further described the configuration of large patches of old forest using metrics of amount and distance from patch for historical, current, two forest loss scenarios, and two forest restoration scenarios within our study area. Red tree vole relative habitat suitability was positively correlated with current old forest cover at the local scale and negatively correlated with distance from large patches of current old forest. Landscape context, specifically proximity to old forest and absence of recent disturbance contributed most to relative habitat suitability of young forest matrix. If old forest contracted to only reserves on federal lands, amount would decrease from 10.9% to 9.5% and be spatially clumped with an increase in average distance to nearest patch from 3.1 km to 11.1 km. Alternatively, a random addition of patches equivalent to a 1.4% increase in amount, would reduce distance to nearest patch to 1.8 km. Given the history of large historical wildfires in the Oregon Coast Range, restoration of even a small amount of old forest throughout the study area would likely enhance connectivity and resiliency of red tree vole populations in the event of large-scale loss of old forest.

AB  - Balancing trade-offs between foraging and risk factors is a fundamental behavior that structures the spatial distribution of species. For African elephants Loxodonta africana, human pressures from poaching and conflict are primary drivers of species decline, but little is known about how elephants structure their spatial behavior in the face of human occupancy and predation. We seek to understand how elephants balance trade-offs between resource access, human presence and human predatory risk factors (poaching and conflict killing) in an unfenced, dynamic ecosystem where elephants persist primarily outside protected areas in community rangelands. We used tracking data from 101 elephants collected between 2001 and 2016. We investigated elephant behavior in response to landcover, topography, productivity, water, human features and human predation risk using third-order resource selection functions. We extended this analysis by employing a mixed-effects multinomial regression to identify temporal shifts in habitat use, and evaluated temporal shifts in movement patterns by estimating mean squared displacement across different productivity periods. Across periods, elephants displayed strong selection for productive areas and areas near water. Temporal shifts in habitat use showed that, during the dry period, elephants were clustered around permanent water sources where humans also congregated. At the onset of the wet period, a shift occurred where elephants moved away from permanent water and from permanent settlements towards seasonal water sources and seasonal settlements. Our findings indicate that foraging and water access are important limiting factors affecting elephants that potentially restrain their spatial responses to humans at the scale of our analysis. Given that pastoralists and elephants rely on the same resources, increasing human and livestock populations enhance pressure on shared resources and space in Africa's drylands. The long-term conservation of elephants will require approaches that reduce poaching as well as landscape level planning to prevent negative impacts from increasing competition for preferred resources.

AB  - Although the Middle East supports a high level of avian biodiversity, the ecology of relatively few species that use the region has been studied in detail. Despite its restricted breeding distribution in the Middle East, and apparent unfavorable conservation status, little is known about the population ecology of the Sooty Falcon (Falco concolor), one of only two falcon species that breeds in the boreal summer. We applied multi-state models to capture-mark-recapture data collected during 2007-2014 in the Sultanate of Oman to estimate, for the first time, the probabilities of capture, age-specific breeding probabilities, and state-specific apparent survival for Sooty Falcon. Capture probability for breeding adults (+/- 1SE) was 0.443 +/- A 0.088. Annual apparent survival probability for pre-breeders and for breeding adults was 0.570 +/- A 0.048 and 0.656 +/- A 0.069, respectively. The probability that 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old falcons returned as breeders was 0.065 +/- A 0.036, 0.159 +/- A 0.069, and 0.339 +/- A 0.211, respectively. In 2013, we radio-tagged five fledgling falcons, and monitored their fates using satellite-based tracking. All initiated their first migration and survived for 48 days following radio-tagging, but four of the five birds died by 70 days post-tagging; only one survived > 100 days. Our results suggest that only about 12 % of fledglings survive to the average age of first breeding (similar to 3.8 years), and that most of first-year mortality occurs during their first migration or soon after they reach their destination. Low apparent survival of pre-breeders could result in low recruitment to the breeding population, and population declines. A comprehensive population-level assessment is urgently needed to accurately determine the status of Sooty Falcons, and to devise flyway-scale conservation plans.

AB  - Aim: To explore the recent (past similar to 1,000year) migration history of yellow-cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis), a climate-threatened tree, which appears to lag behind its potential climatic niche at a leading northern range edge, and infer its continued migration potential under changing climate.
   Location: Southeast Alaska, USA.
   Methods: We located 11 leading range edge yellow-cedar stands near Juneau, Alaska, determined their proportional occupancy of modelled habitat and estimated stand ages to determine approximate time of establishment. We used future climate projections to determine the potential vulnerability of these leading edge populations using a well-established risk factor for yellow-cedar mortality in the region.
   Results: Despite abundant potential habitat, and having existed in the study area > 675years, yellow-cedar has only occupied a small proportion (< 0.8%) of suitable habitat. Yellow-cedar appears to have undergone a past pulse of successful regeneration and establishment during the Little Ice Age climate period, with little expansion in recent decades. Under high emissions future climate scenarios, nine of 11 stands (82%) may become exposed to climate conditions that predispose yellow-cedar to root freezing injury by 2070.
   Main conclusions: We show that yellow-cedar's migration near a northern range edge is episodic, with a past pulse of establishment during the Little Ice Age. When planning for the conservation and management of this culturally and economically valuable tree, forest managers should consider yellow-cedar's currently limited migration at the leading edge, mortality emerging farther north in recent decades and potential vulnerability of range edge stands by 2070. The range of intense, climatic driven yellow-cedar mortality is expanding northward and rapidly approaching the species' leading edge in southeast Alaska. Yellow-cedar's episodic migration demonstrates that species may not respond linearly to a warming climate and that other factors controlling dispersal to suitable habitat must be considered for accurate range predictions.

AB  - Wetland habitats are among the most threatened of all ecosystems today and still face an on-going threat despite several international agreements and national policies. In Europe, the Habitats Directive (HD) plays an important role in the protection of habitats and species of European importance. In the present study we use statistical modelling techniques and geographic information systems to explore linkages between HD Annex 1 listed habitats in wetlands and catchment characteristics, e.g. size, geology and land uses at various spatial scales (50m, 100m, 500m and whole catchment). Specifically we test if we can predict the spatial distribution of protected wetland habitats from catchment characteristics and additionally that we can identify critical variables and their spatial scale. We find that we are able to use catchment characteristics to predict the occurrence of protected habitats in riparian areas with 76% correctly classified habitats. At the catchment scale a low percentage of anthropogenic drainage together with a high percentage of forest increase the probability of having protected habitats in riparian areas, whereas at the local scale a low percentage of arable land and a high percentage of natural vegetation increase the probability of having protected habitats. We believe that the model approach used can have important implications. Firstly, the model can be used as a screening tool for identifying areas with potential conservation value. Secondly, the model can also be used as a management planning tool. Riparian areas are increasingly being used as mitigation measures to reduce loads of nutrients and toxic compounds to freshwater ecosystems. These measures may interfere with the hydrological and biochemical settings in riparian areas and threaten communities that are sensitive to eutrophication, e.g. HD Annex 1 habitats. The model can with a relatively high predictability point to areas where mitigation measures should be avoided because of conservation interests. Similarly the model can be used to identify areas that potentially can be restored successfully. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Borderea chouardii is a relictual and dioecious, strictly sexually reproducing, long-living geophyte of the Dioscoreaceae family. Previous biological and demographic studies have indicated the existence of a uniformly distributed panmictic population of this taxon at the southernmost Spanish pre-Pyrenean mountain ranges where it occurs in rather inaccessible crevices of a single limestone cliff. However, individuals of B. chouardii are spatially subdivided into two subpopulations located, respectively, on the upper and lower parts of the cliff, and vertically separated 150 m. Because of its extreme rarity, B. chouardii was the first Iberian taxon to have a specific conservation plan and has been included in several red lists under the category of critically endangered (CR). However, no previous attempts have been conducted to analyse the fine scale evolutionary mechanisms involved in its present microspatial distribution. Genetic diversity and population structure have been investigated through the analysis of neutral hypervariable markers such as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) to unravel the impact of life history traits in the differentiation of the two subpopulations. Both types of molecular markers were unequivocal in distinguishing two genetically distinct groups of individuals corresponding to their spatial separation. However, SSRs detected a higher level of subpopulation differentiation (F-ST = 0.35, R-ST = 0.32) than RAPDs (F-ST = 0.21). SSR data indicated significant deviation from random dispersal of genes and genotypes between the two groups, suggesting that mating occurs mainly among individuals within subpopulations, thus, favouring the divergence between the two groups. This microevolutionary differentiation scenario might have been caused by a coupled effect of past genetic drift and reproductive isolation, as a result of strong glacial age bottlenecks and inefficient dispersal system of pollen and seeds, respectively. The identification of such genetic structure in this narrow endemic prompts a modification of the management strategies of its single extant population.

AB  - Power line casualties are considered one of the main causes of mortality in the endangered Bonelli's Eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus, although little is known about factors involved in collisions with wires and their consequences at population level. We studied 18 radio-tracked individuals to determine the risk of collision with power lines at two spatial scales (flight height and span crossings). Through logistic regression modelling we found that the risk of collision was mainly determined by eagles' home range use, being reduced in kernel 80%, kernel 95% and MCP respectively to 0.421, 0.114 and 0.032 times in comparison to risk associated to the 50% kernel area. In addition, the risk of collision increased in open habitats (around 1.5 times higher than in forested habitats) far from urban areas (2.345 times higher than near urban areas) that were good for hunting, and in cliff areas used for breeding and roosting, where eagles fly at a lower height (the probability of eagles flying at a low height was 1.470 times higher than in forested habitats). A significant positive correlation was found between territorial turnover rates and the risk ascribed to transmission lines with earth wires in 15 breeding territories. Moreover, this correlation had a higher significance for the 50% kernel area when transmission without earth wires and double circuit distribution lines were added, although no correlations were encountered for distribution lines. These results suggested that power line collisions might be more important than previously reported as a cause of mortality for the species and thus conservation actions should be applied in order to minimise their effects on population dynamics. Predictive models may be a useful tool in careful planning of new power line routes and the wire-marking of the existing ones. Kernel areas should be used rather than fixed radii given that distances from nests may not adequately match the risk of collision.

AB  - Modification of river flows by dams and barrages has fragmented riverine habitats and threatened the survival of Indian subcontinental river dolphins. In this study, habitat use by endangered Ganges river dolphins in response to dry-season operations (December-March) of the Farakka barrage on the Ganga River, located about 20 km upstream of the India-Bangladesh border, was assessed. Ten surveys were conducted in: (i) the Ganga River below the barrage, where rapid changes in water levels were expected owing to barrage operations; (ii) the Farakka feeder canal with stable water levels; and (iii) the Hooghly River downstream of the canal. Dolphin distribution, water depth, fishing boat count and temperature were recorded in all surveys and the data were analysed in a dynamic occupancy modelling framework. Temporal trends in river discharge, primary productivity and fish availability were also estimated to explain river dolphin responses. Occupancy and colonization by dolphins increased in all stretches by spring/March, correlated with rising water temperature and increased fishing intensity, which was related to upstream migration of hilsa fish. In the Ganga River, dolphin occupancy in deep river pools remained stable, but resulted in increased overlap with fisheries as river flow declined. The feeder canal, with stable flows, witnessed increased colonization by dolphins, but also greater risk of bycatch in fishing nets. The canal that appeared as a hydrological refuge thus became an 'ecological trap'. The findings highlight the need for integration of flow maintenance and fishery regulations in the monitoring and management of canals as effective refuges for riverine species. We advocate the inclusion of ecological flow criteria and fishery regulations to reduce dolphin bycatch mortality, in the context of establishing river dolphin conservation plans and transboundary water-sharing guidelines. The revision of the India-Bangladesh water-sharing treaty in 2026 could incorporate the above considerations.

AB  - Context. Conservation planning for threatened species depends on improved knowledge of the whereabouts of critical populations and thus the development of optimal detection methods.
   Aims. To compare the effectiveness of infrared cameras and hair tunnels for detecting small to medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals in south-eastern Australian forests.
   Methods. Reconyx PC90 cameras were paired with Handiglaze hair tunnels at 110 stations in south-eastern New South Wales. All devices were baited using rolled oats, peanut butter and pistachio essence and left in situ for a minimum duration of 30 days. Camera detection data were analysed for the first 15 and 30 days, whereas hair-tunnel detection data were analysed for the entire duration of deployment. Linear mixed models with site as a random effect and device as a fixed effect were developed for mammal species richness. Linear mixed logistic regression models for binary data were developed for detection probabilities of five taxa of interest, namely, Isoodon, Perameles, Potorous, Trichosurus and Wallabia.
   Key results. Hair tunnels detected eight mammal species, whereas cameras detected 18 species. Modelled detection rates using cameras were 3.16 +/- 0.21 species per site after 15 days and 4.24 +/- 0.23 species per site after 30 days, whereas hair tunnels detected 0.34 +/- 0.21 species over the entire deployment. Cameras were therefore approximately 9 - 12 times better at measuring mammal richness than were hair tunnels, depending on survey duration. In all calculations, the probability of detecting the five taxa of interest was significantly greater using cameras than using hair tunnels.
   Conclusions. Infrared cameras and hair tunnels offer ethical advantages over direct detection methods such as cage trapping for small to medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals. Cameras also offer practical benefits because they work for protracted periods, without frequent checking by field researchers. Cameras are more effective at detecting a wide range of species than are hair tunnels and are significantly better for detecting the taxa we examined. Unlike hair tunnels, cameras sometimes allow for the identification of individual animals, and provide information about frequency of habitat use, reproductive status and aspects of behaviour.
   Implications. On a unit by unit basis, infrared cameras are a far more efficient way to census a broad spectrum of ground-dwelling mammals than are hair tunnels.

AB  - Aim: Conservation assessment and planning across extensive regions rely on the use of mapped or modelled surrogates because direct field-based inventories of biodiversity rarely provide complete spatial coverage. Surrogates are assumed to represent spatial patterns in the distribution of biodiversity, yet the validity of this assumption is rarely evaluated. Here, we use data from new biological surveys targeting poorly known taxonomic groups across sparsely surveyed landscapes to test: (1) the performance of established and novel surrogates; and (2) the value of targeted survey data in further improving surrogate effectiveness.
   Location: Continental Australia.
   Methods: Surrogates were derived from either mapped land classifications (bioregions, vegetation types), or models of spatial turnover in biodiversity composition. Models were derived by linking best-available biological observations to high-resolution mapped climate, terrain and soil attributes using generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM). The performance of surrogates was evaluated using survey data for eight biological groups collected as part of the Bush Blitz programme (http://bushblitz.org). For the GDM-based surrogates, within-and cross-taxon performance was first evaluated for models fitted to biological data available prior to Bush Blitz, and then for models enhanced through the addition of the Bush Blitz data.
   Results: All of the tested surrogates performed significantly better than random across all eight biological groups. GDM-based surrogates performed over 10% better on average than the best performing combination of mapped land classifications. The addition of Bush Blitz targeted data in GDM-based surrogates led to further improvements in surrogate performance.
   Main conclusions: Our results support continued investment in targeted biological survey programmes to enhance the performance of surrogates and ensure that surrogates represent a wider breadth of biodiversity. The strong performance of compositional turnover modelling, relative to mapped land classifications, suggests that this surrogate strategy deserves greater consideration in future conservation assessments and has potential for use in continental-scale monitoring of biodiversity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of prey and predator distributions can provide valuable insights into pest management strategies and conservation of natural enemies in agro-ecosystems. The alfalfa weevil,Hypera postica(Gyllenhal), is an economically important pest of alfalfa throughout the western United States. Coccinellids and nabids are among the most important natural enemies of this species, contributing to the biological control ofH. posticain alfalfa fields. The spatio-temporal dynamics ofH. posticaand these two predator groups were investigated using 81 (= 9 x 9 grid) sample points in each of five alfalfa fields in north-central Montana. The data were analyzed using variogram and spatial analysis by distance indices (SADIE).
   RESULTS: Variogram analysis revealed the spatial dependence (aggregation) ofH. posticain 17 of 19 sampling times for larvae, and three of 12 sampling times for adults. Using SADIE, statistically significant aggregation distribution was evident in four of 19 sampling times for larvae, and five of 12 sampling times for adults ofH. postica. Combined variogram and SADIE showed strong evidence of spatial aggregation ofH. posticalarval population (similar to 95%) while a moderate level of aggregation in the adult population (similar to 67%) of the sampling times analyzed. The average aggregation distances based on the range value of the variogram were 22.3 m and 14.7 m for larvae and adults, respectively. Based on variogram results, populations of natural enemies, coccinellids andNabisspp. were found spatially aggregated in 57.9% and 5.6% of the sampling times, respectively. SADIE further supported the variogram results as coccinellid populations (52.6% of sampling times) were highly aggregated in contrast with theNabisspp. populations (5.6% of sampling times) in alfalfa fields. There was no evidence of significant spatial synchrony betweenH. posticaand its predators, coccinellids andNabisspp.
   CONCLUSION: Our study was able to determine the spatial and temporal distribution ofH. posticaand its two natural enemies (coccinellids and nabids) in irrigated alfalfa fields. The possible implications of these findings for integrated pest management (IPM) of alfalfa weevil populations are discussed.

AB  - One shortcoming of marine protected areas (MPA) implementation is the potential for unintended consequences, such as fisheries effort displacement, that cause negative economic and social effects for fishermen and undermine social support for MPA implementation efforts.
   The objective of this work is to analyse the effects of a proposed MPA system on fisheries in a biodiversity conservation priority site in northern Chile using a spatial dynamic modelling approach and incorporating ecological, social and economic criteria.
   We developed an Ecospace model representing the ecological benthic subsystems dominated by kelp beds off the Mejillones Peninsula, Chile. We compared changes in fisheries indicators and the spatial distribution of effort among a no-MPA baseline scenario and four scenarios using proposed MPA core and buffer zones with high or low dispersal rates for the species in the model.
   An overlay analysis was performed to identify which zones and users of the fishing grounds would be affected by the proposed MPA system and to what degree.
   We found a high degree of overlap of the proposed MPA site with fishing grounds of high economic importance and with a fishing ground where women are allowed to work, this can cause significant displacement of women that have no alternative livelihood, with possible undesired social impacts on the fishing community.
   Results from the kelp forest spatial food web model reveals that the biomass build-up of fished species is sensitive to dispersal rates, especially in scenarios with small reserves. A general pattern of fishing effort reallocation at the border of individual MPAs and open areas closer to the port was observed. Fisheries indicators show-negative effects for both MPA scenarios, with undesirable changes in catch and profits for rockfish and kelp exploitation.
   Our results suggest that implementation of the MPA proposal for the Mejillones Peninsula could generate negative consequences for the fishing community of Constitucion cove. The inclusion of fisheries management objectives along with biodiversity conservation in the planning process of the Mejillones Peninsula MPA system may help to address putative negative effects on fisheries and may allow for the creation of support for future MPAs from the fishermen community.

AB  - Models predicting the spatial distribution of wild animals are essential for conservation purposes (e.g. conservation plan formulation and reserve selection) and for assessment of ecological impacts of factors such as pollution and climate change. When a species' habitat use depends on highly dynamic environmental conditions, predictive models should be constructed for specific time periods, taking into account the existing spatial distribution of the relevant habitat conditions. In the case of ringed seals (Phoca hispida), habitat use is intimately connected with sea ice. In the High Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard, ringed seals have two different tactics for selection of large-scale summer habitat. Some individuals spend summer in coastal (inshore) areas, while others migrate offshore to the southern limits of the northern sea ice edge. The predicted decline of the sea ice extension in the Arctic is likely to critically affect the profitability of this latter foraging-migration tactic. Two modelling approaches were used in this study to explore when impacts are likely to occur. One approach explored small-scale habitat use within the two types of summer areas using habitat residency functions. These functions were empirically derived from statistical Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models fit to spatial data on seal residency times (i.e., first-passage times) and local habitat features such as ice conditions. These functions predict the probability of using a given area longer than a given time. They were subsequently used to produce cartographic predictions of habitat use intensity for different times of the year, under various scenarios for sea ice conditions. Such dynamic predictions of animal space use (in space and time), can have wide applications for studies of other marine and terrestrial species that are based on data collected from telemetry. In the second approach, data from satellite telemetry and ringed seals energetics during summer were combined to construct a model for ringed seal blubber mass gain during summer. This model was then used to predict the profitability of offshore migrations as a function of the distance to the sea ice edge. This distance is expected to increase in a warmer climate. Migrations to offshore ice edges were predicted to become energetically unprofitable for ringed seals if the sea ice retreats further than 600-700 km from Svalbard.

AB  - Habitat configuration is an important baseline to delineate protected area design, refine impact mitigation measures and define habitat protection plans for threatened species. For coastal delphinids, outlining their habitat configuration becomes a real challenge when faced with large distribution ranges that straddle international borders, leaving broad information gaps in uninvestigated areas. This study projected likely habitats of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, in the Beibu Gulf (Gulf of Tonkin) based on occurrence data and remotely sensed oceanographic characteristics. Net primary productivity was derived to measure the ecosystem service of humpback dolphin habitats. Bathymetry and chlorophyll-a concentration are major variables contributing to humpback dolphin habitat configuration, which is characterized by shallow water depth and high primary productivity. Three major, likely habitats were identified in the northern Beibu Gulf from western Leizhou Peninsula to the China-Vietnam border, western Gulf of Tonkin from the Red River estuary to the central coast of Vietnam, and south-western Hainan Island. Less than 9% of likely habitats are currently protected by marine protected areas. Affinity to high primary productivity and shallow depths implies that prey abundance and foraging efficiency influence habitat selection by Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Anthropogenic activities potentially altering oceanographic characteristics may impact regional marine ecosystem functions, and hence habitat configuration. Habitat protection actions for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins include implementing coordinated and systematic surveys in major habitats, associating core habitat protection with protected area networks and maritime function zoning, ensuring ecosystem function integrity within major habitats, and reducing both explicit lethal impacts and implicit anthropogenic impacts from activities that change oceanographic features. The habitat protection plan should not only consider marine habitats, but also adjacent coastal landscapes and river catchments. This requires coordination, collaboration and information sharing between scientific research teams, government policy representatives, non-governmental organizations, local communities and other interested stakeholders.

AB  - Understanding how marine predators find patchily distributed prey resources in a dynamic environment is key to identifying important ecological areas for ecosystem-level conservation management. However, the mechanisms underpinning important foraging areas often result from complex interactions between static and dynamic covariates (e.g. topography and currents). Modelling habitat associations with hydrodynamic processes is rarely useful when attempting to identify and characterise foraging areas across an individual's foraging range. Investigating the influence of static habitat features on predator behaviour can provide a more tractable baseline understanding of habitat associations, upon which additional complexity can be added. Seabed gradient covariates (e.g. slope and aspect) are often used, yet such metrics are computed at singular user-defined resolutions, and provide limited ecological insight when used in isolation. Instead, categorising the seabed into geomorphological features may provide better characterisation of seabed structure. Here we explore the utility of a pattern recognition algorithm to delineate whole geomorphological features ("geomorphons") on the seabed (e.g. valleys, ridges, footslopes) from bathymetry data, and examine the influence of geomorphology on marine predator habitat use. We demonstrate the potential application of this approach in a case study, examining the influence of geomorphons on the at-sea behaviour of a highly mobile predator inhabiting shelf seas: the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus). We analyse GPS tracking data from three seals tagged in the southern North Sea, an area with heterogeneous geomorphology. We use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to infer foraging and travelling behaviour and model the effect of different feature types on the probability of switching between states. All three seals showed an increased probability of transitioning from travelling to foraging when encountering slopes, footslopes and hollows, and foraging activity was concentrated at slopes on the fringes of the Dogger Bank. We hypothesise that such features may host prey aggregations, and/or lead to increased prey capture success. The results suggest the importance of such areas for grey seals in the southern North Sea, a region undergoing rapid and widespread anthropogenic habitat change. This method could be incorporated into future species distribution models to improve estimates of predator distribution, informing conservation management and marine spatial planning.

AB  - Zoning adjustments are a key method of improving the conservation efficiency of a nature reserve. Existing studies typically consider the one-period programming method and ignore dynamic ecological changes during the programming of a nature reserve. In this study, a scientific method for nature reserve (NR) programming, namely the multiperiod dynamic programming (MDP) algorithm, is proposed. The MDP algorithm designs an NR over three periods and does so by using ecological suitability values for each grid area. Ecological suitability values for each period were determined based on existing data on rare aquatic animals with Maxent software and cellular automata (CA). CA were used to determine the actual protection effect and to adjust each period's ecological suitability values through comparisons with the sites' surroundings. The maximization of ecological suitability values was used as an objective function; these values were assumed to indicate protection benefits. The objective function of the MDP also includes grid perimeters and numerical minimization for spatial compactness. Moreover, we designed three MDP constraints for the dynamic programming, including base constraints, distinguishing constraints, and multiperiod constraints. In the base and distinguishing constraints, we require a grid square to be a core, buffer, or unselected square, and we require the core and buffer grids to be spatially connected. For the multiperiod constraints, we used virtual points to ensure spatial continuity in different periods while attaining high ecological suitability. Our main contributions are as follows: (1) the novel MDP algorithm combining ecological attributes and multiperiod dynamic planning to optimize NR planning; (2) the use of virtual points to avoid selecting invalid grids and to ensure spatial continuity with significant protection benefits; and (3) the definition of ecological suitability values and use of CA to simulate dynamic changes over the three periods. The results reveal that the MDP algorithm results in a reserve with greater protection benefits than current reserves with superior spatial distribution due to multiperiod programming. The proposed MDP algorithm is a novel method for the scientific optimization and adjustment of nature reserves.

AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and four-channel red, green, blue, and near-infrared (RGBI) remote sensed imageries allow an accurate quantification and contiguous measurement of vegetation characteristics and forest structures. This information facilitates the generation of habitat structure variables for forest species distribution modelling. However, applications of remote sensing data, especially the combination of structural and spectral information, to support evidence-based decisions in forest managements and conservation practices at local scale are not widely adopted. In this study, we examined the habitat requirements of pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) (PW) in Hamilton County, Ohio, using ecologically relevant forest structural and vegetation charac-teristics derived from LiDAR and RGBI data. We hypothesized that the habitat of PW is shaped by vegetation characteristics that are directly associated with the availability of food, hiding and nesting resources, the spatial arrangement of habitat patches within home range, as well as proximity to water sources. We used 186 PW presence or absence locations to model their presence and absence in generalized additive model (GAM) at two scales, representing foraging and home range size, respectively. The results confirm PW's preference for tall and large mature stands with structural complexity, typical of late-successional or old-growth forests. Besides, the crown size of dead trees shows a positive relationship with PW occurrence, therefore indicating the importance of declining living trees or early-stage dead trees within PW home range. These locations are preferred by PW for nest cavity excavation as it attempts to balance the ease of excavation and tree security. In addition, we found that PW can adjust its travel distance to the nearest water resource, suggesting that habitat fragmentation can have certain impacts on PW. Based on our findings, we recommend that forest managers should use different priorities to manage nesting, roosting, and feeding habitats. Particularly, when devising forest management and hazard tree removal plans, one needs to consider retaining enough cavity trees within high-quality PW habitat. By mapping PW habitat suitability for the study area, we highlight the importance of riparian corridor in facilitating PW to adjust to the fragmented urban landscape. Indeed, habitat improvement for PW in the study area could be achieved by conserving riparian corridors and promoting riparian forest succession along major rivers in Hamilton County.

AB  - Halophila stipulacea is a small tropical seagrass, native to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and the Indian Ocean. It invaded the Mediterranean Sea 150 years ago as a Lessepsian migrant, but so far has remained in insulated, small populations across this basin. Surprisingly, in 2002 it was reported in the Caribbean Sea, where within less than two decades it spread to most of the Caribbean Island nations and reaching the South American continent. Unlike its invasion of Mediterranean, in the Caribbean H. stipulacea creates large, continuous populations in many areas. Reports from the Caribbean demonstrated the invasiveness of H. stipulacea by showing that it displaces local Caribbean seagrass species. The motivation for this review comes from the necessity to unify the existing knowledge on several aspects of this species in its native and invasive habitats, identify knowledge gaps and develop a critical strategy to understand its invasive capacity and implement an effective monitoring and conservation plan to mitigate its potential spread outside its native ranges. We systematically reviewed 164 studies related to H. stipulacea to create the "Halophila stipulacea database." This allowed us to evaluate the current biological, ecological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular knowledge of H. stipulacea in its native and invasive ranges. Here we (i) discuss the possible environmental conditions and plant mechanisms involved in its invasiveness, (ii) assess the impact of H. stipulacea on native seagrasses and ecosystem functions in the invaded regions, (iii) predict the ability of this species to invade European and transoceanic coastal waters, (iv) identify knowledge gaps that should be addressed to better understand the biology and ecology of this species both in its native and non-native habitats, which would improve our ability to predict H. stipulacea's potential to expand into new areas in the future. Considering the predicted climate change scenarios and exponential human pressures on coastal areas, we stress the need for coordinated global monitoring and mapping efforts that will record changes in H. stipulacea and its associated communities over time, across its native, invasive and prospective distributional ranges. This will require the involvement of biologists, ecologists, economists, modelers, managers, and local stakeholders.

AB  - We used spatial simulation models to evaluate how current and two alternative policies might affect potential biodiversity over 100 years in the Coast Ranges Physiographic Province of Oregon. This 2.3-million-ha province is characterized by a diversity of public and private forest owners, and a wide range of forest policy and management objectives. We evaluated habitat availability for seven focal species representing different life histories. We also examined how policies affected old-growth stand structure, age distributions relative to the historical range of variability, and landscape patterns of forest types.
   Under the current policy scenario, the area of habitat for old-growth forest structure and associated species increased over time, the habitat for some early-successional associates remained stable, and the area of hardwood vegetation and diverse early- successional stages declined. The province is projected to move toward but not reach the historical range of variation of forest age classes that may have occurred under the wild. re regimes of the pre-Euroamerican settlement period. Ownership explained much of the pattern of biodiversity in the province, and under the current policy scenario, its effect increased over time as the landscape diverged into highly contrasting forest structures and ages. Patch type diversity declined slightly overall but declined strongly within ownerships. Most of the modeled change in biodiversity over time resulted from policies on public forest lands that were intended to increase the area of late-successional forests and species.
   One of the alternative policies, increased retention of wildlife trees on private lands, reduced the contrast between ownerships and increased habitat availability over time for both early- and late-successional species. Analysis of another alternative, stopping thinning of plantations on federal lands, indicated that current thinning regimes improve habitat for the Olive-sided Flycatcher, but the no-thinning alternative had no effect on the habitat scores for the late-successional species in the 100-year simulation. A comparison of indicators of biological diversity suggests that using focal species and forest structural measures can provide complementary information on biodiversity. The multi-ownership perspective provided a more complete synthesis of province-wide biodiversity patterns than assessments based on single ownerships.

AB  - Assessing the effects of landscape composition on invasive and native wildlife abundance patterns is necessary to reach effective biodiversity management planning, especially on the margins of cities. However, we still have a limited understanding on the relationships between the landscape components and bird abundance. Given this knowledge gap, an urban-rural gradient approach was performed (1) to evaluate relationships between abundances of three sympatric dove species, namely invasive Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto), expanding laughing dove (Spilopelia senegalensis), and native European turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur), and landscape composition, and (2) to identify the elements of the landscape that are determining in explaining the abundance patterns for these three species. Our results showed (1) the presence of a substantial segregation in the abundances of the three species along urban-rural gradient depending on the cover of built-up areas, (2) that the abundance of Eurasian collared dove increased with high cover (%) of built-up areas and low cover of cereals, (3) that laughing dove abundance increased with a high cover of permanent crops and low road lengths, but decreased when there are more than three fruit trees species, and (4) that of European turtle dove increased with a high cover of permanent crops, vegetable crops, and a high richness of fruit trees, but decreased with high built-up areas cover and when roads lengths exceed 1 km. Considering these responses to urban-rural gradient, these species can be classified into three distinct spatial categories: (1) "urban dweller" for the invasive Eurasian collared dove, (2) "urban utilizer" for expanding laughing dove, and (3) "urban avoider" for the native European turtle dove. The possible expansion of the urban areas at the detriment of permanent crops could be unfavourable for the native European turtle dove. Further monitoring, by a fixed time step, to detect environmental factors behind the changes in the composition of landscape and distribution of wildlife (both invasive and native) would be of great importance. The synergy among farmers, urban managers and researchers is recommended for the conservation of biodiversity in this region.

AB  - Aim To examine whether benthic assemblages are more diverse in a region of high topographic and oceanographic complexity by comparing benthic invertebrate assemblages across continental margins with contrasting environments. Location Challenger Plateau and Chatham Rise, to the west and east of New Zealand, respectively. Methods Benthic faunal data were sourced from extensive seabed surveys in 2007, when both margins were sampled with an epibenthic sled and a towed video system. Three methods were used to investigate benthic assemblages in relation to environmental variables: one based on individual species distribution models (SDMs) using boosted regression trees analysis (BRT), and two community-based modelling methods using generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM) and gradient forest analysis (GF), respectively. Each method was used to model and predict the turnover in assemblages with respect to environment the biophysical patterns across the study region. Results Across Chatham Rise, a complex oceanographic environment arising from steep gradients in productivity and temperature at the Subtropical Front produced a high diversity of assemblages associated with the sub-Antarctic water mass, the Subtropical Front, steep-sloping regions and fast tidal currents. In contrast, Challenger Plateau lies entirely beneath a single (subtropical) water mass, and assemblage diversity was lower, with a distinctive assemblage on the plateau itself and a deep-water assemblage similar to the northern deep-water assemblage of Chatham Rise. Across both regions, assemblage turnover was fastest in cold waters, at shallow depths and in deep mixed layers. Main conclusions Benthic assemblages were more varied on Chatham Rise than on Challenger Plateau, supporting the hypothesis that environmentally heterogeneous margins have higher assemblage diversity. Differing assemblages on the northern and southern flanks of Chatham Rise suggest a biogeographical boundary for benthic taxa across the Subtropical Front. These results demonstrate that oceanographically and topographically complex margins have a diverse assemblage structure that should be considered in planning for the sustainable management of diversity.

AB  - Aim To identify and quantify biotic and abiotic factors associated with the regional gradients in the distribution and abundance of bird communities restricted and endemic to the Succulent and Nama Karoo biomes of South Africa.
   Location The arid Nama and Succulent Karoo biomes in South Africa.
   Methods The quarter degree grid cell (QDGC) was used to extract environmental data, while the bird data previously atlased, was linked to the same geo-referenced system, using a geographical information system (GIS). Bird species were grouped into different life-history assemblages. A quantitative, systematic analysis of the different bird communities spanning the Karoo was undertaken to examine contributions of broad- and local-scale physical environmental and biotic factors to regional variations in the species composition, using multivariate statistical and spatial analytical tools. These included two indirect gradient methods; principal components analysis (PCA) and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and two direct gradient methods; canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA).
   Results Principal components analysis results showed that the selected environmental variables accounted for about 85% of the variation in the region. The first two principal gradients defined regional temperature seasonality and variability especially in winter and summer. The third principal gradient mainly defined summer rainfall areas in association with the coefficient of variation of rain and regional primary production, while the fourth gradient defined winter rainfall areas, growth days and elements of landscape structure. CCA/RDA analysis produced shortened hierarchically ranked explanatory variables for each bird assemblage. Stepwise gradient analysis results showed summer rain, rainfall concentration, topographic heterogeneity and annual evapotranspiration, as the most important climate variables explaining species occurrence. Landscape, in terms of percentage transformation, morphology, coefficient of variation of primary productivity and distance between suitable habitat patches, were also important, but to a lesser degree. Total variation explained (TVE) by the supplied variables was between 23 and 37% of variation. Less than 20% of TVE was the intrinsic spatial component of environmental influence, indicating that any unmeasured factors were independent of spatial structuring. For all the eight bird assemblages, climate contributed most to TVE (24-57%). Landscape characteristics (human-induced transformation, vegetation in terms of size if grassy clumps and the average distances between them) contributed theleast to TVE for all the different assemblages (0-6%), especially the granivorous assemblage where it was not significant at all (0%). Seasonal extremes and variability were more important in explaining species gradients than were annual climatic conditions, with the exception of annual potential evapotranspiration.
   Main conclusions This study was able to synthesize species environment relations at the broad scale and demonstrated the association of arid zone endemic species occurrence with climate extremes and seasonality. Given the predicted climate change scenarios for South Africa, this regional gradient study provides a quantitative ecological basis for finer scale modelling and analysis, developing regional strategies for conserving biodiversity as well as predicting and planning for the effects of global climate change. However, most importantly, it clearly showed that bird species restricted and endemic to the arid Karoo biome may be more sensitive to climate rather than vegetation structure as previously thought.

AB  - In this work we used the information of the Annual Hunting Reports (AHRs) to obtain a high-resolution model of the potential favourableness for wild rabbit harvesting in Andalusia (southern Spain), using environmental and land-use variables as predictors. We analysed 32,134 AHRs from the period 1993/2001 reported by 6049 game estates to estimate the average hunting yields of wild rabbit in each Andalusian municipality (n=771). We modelled the favourableness for obtaining good hunting yields using stepwise logistic regression on a set of climatic, orographical, land use, and vegetation variables. The favourability equation was used to create a downscaled image representing the favourableness of obtaining good hunting yields for the wild rabbit in 11km squares in Andalusia, using the Idrisi Image Calculator. The variables that affected hunting yields of wild rabbit were altitude, dry wood crops (mainly olive groves, almond groves, and vineyards), temperature, pasture, slope, and annual number of frost days. The 11km squares with high favourableness values are scattered throughout the territory, which seems to be caused mainly by the effect of vegetation. Finally, we obtained quality categories for the territory by combining the probability values given by logistic regression with those of the environmental favourability function.

AB  - Managers need information about the vulnerability of historical plant communities, and their potential future conditions, to respond appropriately to landscape change driven by global climate change. We model the climate envelopes of plant communities on the Kenai Peninsula in Southcentral Alaska and forecast to 2020, 2050, and 2080. We assess 6 model outputs representing downscaled climate data from 3 global climate model outputs and 2 representative concentration pathways. We use two lines of evidence, model convergence and empirically measured rates of change, to identify the following plausible ecological trajectories for the peninsula: (1.) alpine tundra and sub-alpine shrub decrease, (2.) perennial snow and ice decrease, (3.) forests remain on the Kenai Lowlands, (4.) the contiguous white-Lutz-Sitka spruce complex declines, and (5.) mixed conifer afforestation occurs along the Gulf of Alaska coast. We suggest that converging models in the context of other lines of evidence is a viable approach to increase certainty for adaptation planning. Extremely dynamic areas with multiple outcomes (i.e., disagreement) among models represent ecological risk, but may also represent opportunities for facilitated adaptation and other managerial approaches to help tip the balance one way or another. By reducing uncertainty, this eclectic approach can be used to inform expectations about the future.

AB  - Freshwater mussels (Unionidae) are among the most imperiled groups of organisms in the world, and the lack of information regarding species distributions, life-history characteristics, and ecological and biological requirements may limit the protection of remaining mussel populations. We examined the influence of hydrologic factors on the occurrence of the Suwannee Moccasinshell Medionidus walkeri, a federally threatened freshwater mussel species, endemic to the Suwannee River Basin in Georgia and Florida. We also evaluated the influence of survey effort on detection of Suwannee Moccasinshell during field surveys. We compiled all recent (2013-2016) mussel survey records in the Suwannee River Basin. We calculated cumulative discharge contributed by upstream springs for each of 220 survey locations. We combined the spring discharge predictor variable with Suwannee Moccasinshell detection and nondetection data from each survey location to develop a suite of occupancy models. Modeling results indicated that detection of Suwannee Moccasinshell during surveys was strongly and positively related to survey effort. Modeling results also indicated that sites with cumulative spring discharge inputs exceeding similar to 28 cubic meters per second were most likely (i.e., predicted occupancy probabilities > 0.5) to support Suwannee Moccasinshell populations. However, occupancy declined in the lowermost reaches of the Suwannee mainstem despite high spring discharge inputs, presumably due to greater tidal influences and differences in physicochemical habitat conditions. Historical localities where Suwannee Moccasinshell has presumably been extirpated are all devoid of springs in their upstream watersheds. We hypothesize that springs may buffer extremely tannic, and at times polluted, surface waters, in addition to maintaining adequate flows during periods of drought, thereby promoting the persistence of Suwannee Moccasinshell populations. Our study suggests that springs are a critical resource for Suwannee Moccasinshell and may be more important for conservation planning than was previously recognized.

AB  - Coldwater fishes are sensitive to abiotic and biotic stream factors, which can be influenced by climate. Distributions of inland salmonids in North America have declined significantly, with many of the current strongholds located in small headwater systems that may serve as important refugia as climate change progresses. We investigated the effects of discharge, stream temperature, trout biomass, and food availability on summer growth of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri, a species of concern with significant ecological value. Individual size, stream discharge, sample section biomass, and temperature were all associated with growth, but had differing effects on energy allocation. Stream discharge had a positive relationship with growth rates in length and mass; greater rates of prey delivery at higher discharges probably enabled trout to accumulate reserve tissues in addition to structural growth. Temperature effects were positive but not significant, and support in growth models was limited, likely due to the cold thermal regimes of the study area. The strength of the discharge effect on growth suggests that climate adaptation strategies for coldwater fishes that focus solely on thermal characteristics may be misleading and highlights the importance of considering multiple factors, including hydrologic regimes, in conservation planning.

AB  - Avian electrocutions on power poles affect raptor populations globally. Mitigation strategies in the USA are typically bottom-up, combining risk assessments for individual poles into a utility-specific avian protection plan. This approach is usually reactive, relying on incidental documentation of electrocutions for initiation, and can allow uncoordinated mitigation strategies among adjacent utilities. A top-down strategy may help solve both problems if maps identifying where distribution power poles occur were available for comparison to range maps for species at risk of electrocution. Range maps exist but pole location data are rarely publicly available in the USA. Pole-density models were previously created for Colorado and Wyoming, the Great Basin, and the Columbia Plateau because pole density can serve as a surrogate for electrocution risk. We used each of these models to predict pole densities throughout four additional areas: the Northwestern Plains, Southwestern Plains, Southwestern Plateaus, and parts of New Mexico not included in other modeled areas. We also applied the Colorado and Wyoming model to portions of the Uinta Basin and Wyoming Basin projecting from Colorado and Wyoming into Idaho and Utah. The Colorado and Wyoming model fit all areas better than other models, except parts of New Mexico not included in other modeled areas, where the Great Basin model fit best. Our model predictions facilitate assessment of pole density across much (2,573,746 km(2)) of the western USA. To assess whether the models are useful in predicting electrocutions, we compared predicted pole densities throughout White Sands Missile Range to locations of 59 avian electrocutions. Electrocutions occurred at low rates in cells with low predicted pole densities, and at higher rates in cells with moderate and high predicted pole densities. Because the models do not include species-specific information, they have the potential to be applicable to the conservation of a wide variety of species.

AB  - Invasion of the tall grass Brachypodium genuense was observed in an area of the central Apennines (Italy) where the population size of Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) was in strong decline. Since this dominant tall grass threatens biodiversity and forage quality, our hypothesis was that B. genuense abundance influenced that of palatable species for the chamois, depending on their functional traits and distribution patterns. Our sampling design used plots of 10 x 10 m and 1 x 1 m to investigate the plant community level and fine-scale interactions. We analyzed data using correlation, generalized linear models, and redundancy analyses. We found that B. genuense can reach high abundance values on the deepest soils. Its high cover value influences plant community composition by competitive exclusion of subordinate species and suppression of functional features because of temporal or spatial niche overlap. This leads to low cover of palatable species at a fine scale, and to poor pasture quality for chamois at a wider scale. Therefore, we postulated that B. genuense invasion, enhanced by long-term grazing cessation, may reduce the availability of palatable plants for Apennine chamois, especially below the potential timberline (1900-2000 m a.s.l.). The high abundance of B. genuense may amplify the effect of other negative factors, such as competition with red deer (Cervus elaphus) and climate change, in restricting the suitable habitat of the Apennine chamois to the higher sectors of the central Apennines. Thus, we suggested that B. genuense spread should be monitored carefully and plans to control its invasion should be implemented.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are empirical models relating species occurrence to environmental variables based on statistical or other response surfaces. Species distribution modeling can be used as a tool to solve many theoretical and applied ecological and environmental problems, which include testing biogeographical, ecological and evolutionary hypotheses, assessing species invasion and climate change impact, and supporting conservation planning and reserve selection. The utility of SDM in real world applications requires the knowledge of the model's accuracy. The accuracy of a model includes two aspects: discrimination capacity and reliability. The former is the power of the model to differentiate presences from absences; and the latter refers to the capability of the predicted probabilities to reflect the observed proportion of sites occupied by the subject species.
   Similar methodology has been used for model accuracy assessment in different fields, including medical diagnostic test, weather forecasting and machine learning, etc. Some accuracy measures are used in all fields, e.g. the overall accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; while the use of other measures is largely restricted to specific fields, e.g. F-measure is mainly used in machine learning field, or is referred to by different names in different fields, e.g. "true skill statistic" is used in atmospheric science and it is called "Youden's J" in medical diagnostic field. In this paper we review those accuracy measures typically used in ecology. Generally, the measures can be divided into two groups: threshold-dependent and threshold-independent. Measures in the first group are used for binary predictions, and those in the second group are used for continuous predictions. Continuous predictions may be transformed to binary ones if a specific threshold is employed. In such cases, the threshold-dependent accuracy measures can also be used.
   The threshold-dependent indices used in or introduced to SDM field include overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, odds ratio, true skill statistic, F-measure, Cohen's kappa, and normalized mutual information (NMI). However, since NMI only measures the agreement between two patterns, it cannot differentiate the worse-than-random models from the better-than-random models, which reduces its utility as an accuracy measure.
   The threshold-independent indices used in or introduced to the SDM field include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Gini index, and point biserial correlation coefficient. The proportion of explained deviance D-2 and its adjusted form have been also introduced into SDM field. But this adjusted metric has no theoretical foundation in the context of generalized linear modeling. Therefore, we provide another adjusted form, which was proposed by H. V. Houwelingen based on the asymptotic chi(2) distribution of the log-likelihood statistics. Its superiority over other related measures has been found through previous simulation studies. We also provide another analogous measure, the coefficient of determination R-2, which has had a long history in weather forecast verification and was also recommended for use in medical diagnosis. Though these measures D-2 and R-2 are routinely used to evaluate generalized linear models (GLMs), we argue that nothing prevents them from being applied to other GLM-like models.
   In SDM accuracy assessment, discrimination capacity is often considered, but model reliability is frequently ignored. The primary reason for this is that no reliability measure has been introduced into the ecological literature. To meet this need we also suggest that root mean square error be used as a reliability measure. Its squared form, mean square error, has been used in meteorology for a long time, and is called Brier's score. We also discuss the effect of prevalence dependence of accuracy measures and the precision of accuracy estimates.

AB  - The impact of rural building on the type, area and distribution pattern of habitats in a hedged grassland landscape is assessed from a field-mapped survey of a random sample of 25 ha grid squares (1998 and 2007). Buildings covered 4.0% of Northern Ireland in 1998 increasing by 30.4% to 5.2% in 2007. The number, area and edge density of building patches also increased. Building was predominantly on productive agricultural grassland. A relatively small area but wide range of other habitats was built over, in particular broadleaf seminatural woodland and species-rich grassland habitats, specified by the European Habitats Directive as important for their biodiversity. Building on habitats such as wetland, bog and heath, associated with biophysical land use constraints, was much less. Building followed a simple area-proportional model in which habitats with the greatest area were proportionately more built over. The impact of building next to existing buildings and at isolated sites followed a similar pattern. The current land use planning policy and practice does not adequately protect habitats. This paper highlights the importance of implementing a consistent rural development strategy across government sectors to facilitate habitat protection and the ecosystem services they provide.

AB  - Many procedures exist for identifying sets of sites that collectively represent regional biodiversity. Whereas the mechanics and suitability of these procedures have received considerable attention, little effort has been directed towards assessing and quantifying the effects of varying data inputs on their outcomes. In the present paper, we use sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impacts of varying degrees of (i) survey intensity (ii) survey extent and (iii) taxonomic diversity on iterative reserve selection procedures. A comprehensive distribution database of the mammalian fauna from the Transvaal region of South Africa is systematically perturbed before implementation of a site selection algorithm. The resulting networks of sites are then compared to quantitatively assess the impact of database variations on algorithm performance. Systematic data deletions result in increased network variability (identity of selected sites), decreased numbers of frequently selected sites, decreased spatial congruence among successive runs and a rapid increase in the number of additional sites required to represent all species present in the region. These effects become particularly evident once data sets are reduced to below 20% of the original data. Consequently, a mixed survey strategy that balances survey effort with survey extent and maximizes taxonomic knowledge is more likely to ensure appropriate planning outcomes.

AB  - Questions Understanding spatial variation in floristic composition is crucial to quantify the extent, patchiness and connectivity of distinct habitats and their spatial relationships. Broad-scale variation in floristic composition and the degree of uniqueness of different regions remains poorly mapped and understood in several areas across the globe. We here aim to map vegetation heterogeneity in Amazonia. Location Middle Jurua river region, Amazonas State, Brazil. Methods We mapped four plant groups by applying machine learning to scale up locally observed community composition and using environmental and remotely sensed variables as predictors, which were obtained as GIS layers. To quantify how reliable our predictions were, we made an assessment of model transferability and spatial applicability. We also compared our floristic composition map to the official Brazilian national-level vegetation classification. Results The overall performance of our floristic models was high for all four plant groups, especially ferns, and the predictions were found to be spatially congruent and highly transferable in space. For some areas, the models were assessed not to be applicable, as the field sampling did not cover the spectral or environmental characteristics of those regions. Our maps show extensive habitat heterogeneity across the region. When compared to the Brazilian vegetation classification, floristic composition was relatively homogeneous within dense forests, while floristic heterogeneity in rainforests classified as open was high. Conclusion Our maps provide geoecological characterization of the regions and can be used to test biogeographical hypotheses, develop species distribution models and, ultimately, aid science-based conservation and land-use planning.

AB  - At the southern end of its range, the Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) occurs in high densities and nests in a wide range of forest types and ages, exhibiting different foraging and nesting habits than in the northern part of its range. The intensive monitoring of this subspecies on public lands in Marin County, California, combined with the availability of fine-scale geographic information system (GIS) data, provided a unique opportunity to apply and evaluate a habitat-based species occurrence modeling approach at the scale most relevant to local land managers and planning agencies. We used 4 years of breeding owl survey data (1998-2001) and GIS layers representing topographic, anthropogenic, and vegetation-based landscape characteristics to build logistic regression models of owl nest-site occurrence. Models were used to develop spatial predictions of occurrence within the study area and in adjacent ecoregions, which were validated with an independent dataset. We also compared the predictive performance of two vegetation layers differing in their floristic detail and spatial accuracy. The model based on a local vegetation layer generally exhibited better model performance than the model based on the more generic regional layer. Model results indicated that forest connectivity and topographic conditions, rather than forest type or age, were the strongest predictors of nesting owl presence. Predicting outside the original study area was somewhat successful for a coastal ecoregion similar in vegetation and climate, but not better than random for a nearby inland ecoregion, suggesting that locally derived models are necessary to adequately predict nest-site occurrence.

AB  - Sea turtles migrate between nesting beaches and foraging grounds, but little is known about the cues they use to direct these migrations, and the habitats that define their foraging grounds. Here, we used satellite telemetry to follow the movements of 11 flatback turtles Natator depressus after nesting on islands in the waters off the coast of the Kimberley region of northern Australia. State-space models were used to objectively define inter-nesting, migration and foraging behaviour during the 327 +/- 315 d (mean +/- SD) that the turtles were tracked. These animals migrated along the coast in water depths of 63 +/- 5 m to foraging grounds on the mid-Sahul Shelf in the Timor Sea in average water depths of 74 +/- 12 m, 135 +/- 35 km from shore. Distribution modelling showed that flatback turtles preferred foraging and transiting in clear waters (suspended material <0.06 g m(-3)), 60 to 90 m deep and in association with complex, benthic geomorphology (banks, shoals, terraces, deep holes and valleys) thought to support a high abundance of sessile invertebrates, the likely targets of their foraging. Distance to the tidal front was also a strong predictor of turtle migratory behaviour, with the animals potentially following tidal fronts along the Kimberley coast. Our study identified both critical habitats for this species and the environmental variables that predict their migration and foraging. This information is important to aid spatial planning of conservation for this data-deficient species that is endemic to northern Australia.

AB  - Dispersal is a key demographic process involving three stages: emigration, transience and settlement; each of which is influenced by individual, social and environmental determinants. An integrated understanding of species dispersal is essential for demographic modelling and conservation planning. Here, we review the dispersal patterns and determinants documented in the scientific literature for the grey wolf (Canis lupus) across its distribution range. We showed a surprisingly high variability within and among study areas on all dispersal parameters - dispersal rate, direction, distance, duration and success. We found that such large variability is due to multiple individual, social and environmental determinants, but also due to previously overlooked methodological research issues. We revealed a potential non-linear relationship between dispersal rate and population density, with dispersal rate higher at both ends of the gradient of population density. We found that human-caused mortality reduces distance, duration and success of dispersal events. Furthermore, dispersers avoid interaction with humans, and highly exposed areas like agricultural lands hamper population connectivity in many cases. We identified numerous methodological research problems that make it difficult to obtain robust estimates of dispersal parameters and robust inferences on dispersal patterns and their determinants. In particular, analyses where confounding factors were not accounted for led to substantial knowledge gaps on all aspects of dispersal in an otherwise much-studied species. Our understanding of wolf biology and management would significantly benefit if wolf dispersal studies reported the results and possible factors affecting wolf dispersal more transparently.

AB  - Matrix contrasts affect communities in patchy landscapes by influencing resources, abiotic conditions and spill-over effects. However, current knowledge is significantly biased towards forest and rural communities. We examined the effects of three different matrix types, i.e., low, intermediate and high contrasts, on carabid beetle assemblages at urban railway verges in two climatic regions. Study sites were located in Finland and in Slovenia. Using pitfall trapping, non-metric multidimensional scaling and generalised linear mixed models, we investigated carabid assemblages at railway verges and in differently contrasting adjacent matrices, i.e. built-up, grassland and forest. The matrix influenced carabid assemblages at railway verges. Assemblages grouped with adjacent matrix types, although some Finnish railway assemblages included a characteristic set of open dry habitat species. Abundances of generalist species at railway verges were higher when next to grassland or forest than urban matrices. Habitat specialists responded negatively to high contrast matrices, resulting in lower abundances of open habitat specialists in railway verges when next to forests and nearly no spill-over of forest specialists into railway verges. These patterns were consistent in both countries, i.e. irrespective of climatic region. Our study emphasises effects of the adjacent matrix and matrix contrasts on communities in linear open habitat patches in cities. Knowledge on matrix effects in patchy landscapes, such as urban environments, is essential in understanding the distribution and composition of communities in discrete patches. This knowledge can be used in conservation planning. If habitat specialists are negatively affected by high matrix contrasts, high contrasts should be avoided.

AB  - Alaska has one of the most rapidly changing climates on earth and is experiencing an accelerated rate of human disturbance, including resource extraction and transportation infrastructure development. Combined, these factors increase the state's vulnerability to biological invasion, which can have acute negative impacts on ecological integrity and subsistence practices. Of growing concern is the spread of Alaska's first documented freshwater aquatic invasive plant Elodea spp. (elodea). In this study, we modeled the suitable habitat of elodea using global and state-specific species occurrence records and environmental variables, in concert with an ensemble of model algorithms. Furthermore, we sought to incorporate local subsistence concerns by using Native Alaskan knowledge and available statewide subsistence harvest data to assess the potential threat posed by elodea to Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and whitefish (Coregonus nelsonii) subsistence. State models were applied to future climate (2040-2059) using five general circulation models best suited for Alaska. Model evaluations indicated that our results had moderate to strong predictability, with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values above 0.80 and classification accuracies ranging from 66 to 89 %. State models provided a more robust assessment of elodea habitat suitability. These ensembles revealed different levels of management concern statewide, based on the interaction of fish subsistence patterns, known spawning and rearing sites, and elodea habitat suitability, thus highlighting regions with additional need for targeted monitoring. Our results suggest that this approach can hold great utility for invasion risk assessments and better facilitate the inclusion of local stakeholder concerns in conservation planning and management.

AB  - Coastal and estuarine waters are important ecosystems with high primary and secondary productivity, but they are prone to the impacts of habitat loss caused by anthropogenic activities. For species exclusively inhabiting coastal and estuarine waters, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, irreversible habitat loss can have dramatic implications for population viability. >A Landsat image database was used to determine the extent of coastal changes along the northern Beibu Gulf, where a large humpback dolphin population is found. The results were compared with the standardized sighting gradient (SPUF) determined from a questionnaire survey of fishermen and likely core habitats identified by application of a global digital elevation model. >Both SPUF and likely core habitat results indicated a continuous distribution of the humpback dolphin along the northern Beibu Gulf. Landsat images revealed that 129.6km(2) of coastal waters were permanently lost in the past 40years, 60km(2) within the likely core habitats. Although this may be considered small, the impact of such habitat loss could be substantial in some local habitats. >The humpback dolphin population in the northern Beibu Gulf should be regarded as one management unit, with two or more social subunits. Immediate systematic surveys are needed to fill information gaps on true distribution range and habitat-use patterns. >Habitat protection actions for dolphins in the northern Beibu Gulf should include both core and linking habitats, including enacting protected areas in core habitats, mitigating anthropogenic impacts in likely habitats, restoring both coastal waters and surrounding landscape quality, effective treatment of industrial sewage discharge, and comprehensive environmental impact assessments for the planning of coastal development projects.

AB  - Aim To determine whether there is evidence of changes in small mammals distributions and emergent metacommunity structure in the Atlantic Forest resulting from extensive habitat loss and fragmentation associated with anthropogenic activities.
   Location South American Atlantic Forest from northeastern Brazil to eastern Paraguay.
   Methods Using presence-absence data for non-volant small mammals, we analysed metacommunity structure for communities from 76 fragments distributed throughout Atlantic Forest. We evaluated coherence, range turnover and range boundary clumping for the entire non-volant small mammal assemblage, marsupials, rodents and sigmodontine rodents separately. beta-diversity based on the multiplicative model was used to estimate the number of compartments (groups of sites with similar species composition) in Clementsian structures, and cluster analysis identified which sites formed compartments. Canonical correspondence analysis determined which environmental factors were associated with the gradients along which metacommunities were structured. Distance-decay analysis evaluated the spatial structure in small mammal and environmental data, and Mantel tests evaluated correlations between them.
   Results Rodent metacommunities had Clementsian structure, whereas marsupials had Gleasonian structure. Compartment locations for rodents were consistent with areas of endemism. Temperature seasonality was most associated with the gradients along which metacommunities were structured. Assemblage and environmental dissimilarity among sites had significant positive relationships with geographic distance.
   Main conclusions Compartment locations in Clementsian structures mirrored historical refugium locations and important vicariance events associated with large rivers. Despite extensive deforestation in Atlantic Forest, small mammal distributions are consistent with expectations based on historical biogeography, suggesting that anthropogenic activities have not yet greatly affected geographic distributions of emergent metacommunity structures. However, extinction debt associated with recent fragmentation and habitat loss may exist. Any effective conservation plan for large and fragmented biomes must consider areas of endemism to maintain regional biodiversity and maintain sufficiently large and connected fragments to facilitate rescue effects and minimize effects of extinction debt.

AB  - 1. Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability.
   2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature.
   3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change.
   4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution.
   5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change.

AB  - Benthic habitat maps, including maps of seabed sediments, have become critical spatial-decision support tools for marine ecological management and conservation. Despite the increasing recognition that environmental variables should be considered at multiple spatial scales, variables used in habitat mapping are often implemented at a single scale. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for using environmental variables at multiple scales for modelling and mapping seabed sediments. Sixteen environmental variables were derived from multibeam echosounder data collected near Qikiqtarjuaq, Nunavut, Canada at eight spatial scales ranging from 5 to 275 m, and were tested as predictor variables for modelling seabed sediment distributions. Using grain size data obtained from grab samples, we tested which scales of each predictor variable contributed most to sediment models. Results showed that the default scale was often not the best. Out of 129 potential scale-dependent variables, 11 were selected to model the additive log-ratio of mud and sand at five different scales, and 15 were selected to model the additive log-ratio of gravel and sand, also at five different scales. Boosted Regression Tree models that explained between 46.4 and 56.3% of statistical deviance produced multiscale predictions of mud, sand, and gravel that were correlated with cross-validated test data ( Spearman's rho(mud) = 0.77, rho(sand) = 0.71, rho(gravel) = 0.58). Predictions of individual size fractions were classified to produce a map of seabed sediments that is useful for marine spatial planning. Based on the scale-dependence of variables in this study, we concluded that spatial scale consideration is at least as important as variable selection in seabed mapping.

AB  - The Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus is the only wader that nests on the beaches of Galicia, north-west Spain. In November 2002, much of that habitat was heavily affected by the Prestige oil spill, considered one of the largest spills ever experienced in Europe. We used a 23-year dataset (1988-2010) tracking the abundance and distribution of Kentish Plover breeding pairs along the Galician coast to evaluate population trends and identify the underlying effects of an oil spill. A TRIM linear trend model classified the population trend as a moderate increase; the main trend exhibited a decline in the population from 2002 to 2004 (the second reproductive period after the catastrophe), followed by a moderate increase to the present. The results showed that the variation in annual population trends can be explained by considering the characteristics and location of breeding beaches. In the most parsimonious model, three covariates were significant: the beach position: inner (located in the interior part of the estuaries), or outer (exposed to the open sea), the beach length, and the location of the stretch of coastline in relation to the Prestige wreck. The variation was obvious both with regard to population size and habitat use, with an increase in the number of birds and breeding locations and changes in distribution along the entire Galician Coast after 2004. The birds reacted to the catastrophe by avoiding the most affected areas and moving to new breeding beaches, suggesting that conservation plans must take into account the correct management of currently unoccupied beaches that could provide potential habitat for the species.

AB  - Climate change is expected to alter the geographic distribution of wildfire, a complex abiotic process that responds to a variety of spatial and environmental gradients. How future climate change may alter global wildfire activity, however, is still largely unknown. As a first step to quantifying potential change in global wildfire, we present a multivariate quantification of environmental drivers for the observed, current distribution of vegetation fires using statistical models of the relationship between fire activity and resources to burn, climate conditions, human influence, and lightning flash rates at a coarse spatiotemporal resolution (100 km, over one decade). We then demonstrate how these statistical models can be used to project future changes in global fire patterns, highlighting regional hotspots of change in fire probabilities under future climate conditions as simulated by a global climate model. Based on current conditions, our results illustrate how the availability of resources to burn and climate conditions conducive to combustion jointly determine why some parts of the world are fire-prone and others are fire-free. In contrast to any expectation that global warming should necessarily result in more fire, we find that regional increases in fire probabilities may be counter-balanced by decreases at other locations, due to the interplay of temperature and precipitation variables. Despite this net balance, our models predict substantial invasion and retreat of fire across large portions of the globe. These changes could have important effects on terrestrial ecosystems since alteration in fire activity may occur quite rapidly, generating ever more complex environmental challenges for species dispersing and adjusting to new climate conditions. Our findings highlight the potential for widespread impacts of climate change on wildfire, suggesting severely altered fire regimes and the need for more explicit inclusion of fire in research on global vegetation-climate change dynamics and conservation planning.

AB  - There is a growing focus around the world on marine spatial planning, including spatial fisheries management. Some spatial management approaches are quite blunt, as when marine protected areas (MPAs) are established to restrict fishing in specific locations. Other management tools, such as zoning or spatial user rights, will affect the distribution of fishing effort in a more nuanced manner. Considerable research has focused on the ability of MPAs to increase fishery returns, but the potential for the broader class of spatial management approaches to outperform MPAs has received far less attention. We use bioeconomic models of seven nearshore fisheries in Southern California to explore the value of optimized spatial management in which the distribution of fishing is chosen to maximize profits. We show that fully optimized spatial management can substantially increase fishery profits relative to optimal nonspatial management but that the magnitude of this increase depends on characteristics of the fishing fleet and target species. Strategically placed MPAs can also increase profits substantially compared with nonspatial management, particularly if fishing costs are low, although profit increases available through optimal MPA-based management are roughly half those from fully optimized spatial management. However, if the same total area is protected by randomly placing MPAs, starkly contrasting results emerge: most random MPA designs reduce expected profits. The high value of spatial management estimated here supports continued interest in spatially explicit fisheries regulations but emphasizes that predicted increases in profits can only be achieved if the fishery is well understood and the regulations are strategically designed.

AB  - Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) habitat use and its relationship to environmental conditions are generally unknown in the Southern Ocean, presenting challenges for predicting their seasonal occurrence and potential effects of fishing pressure and climate change on this endangered species. Using biological data collected during 14 shipboard surveys off the northern Antarctic Peninsula and oceanographic data from satellite remote sensing, we mapped the distribution of fin whale hotspots, Antarctic krill abundance (biomass from acoustics, concentrations from nets) and ocean conditions during mid- and late-summer to investigate the environmental determinants of whale hotspots. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to test the hypothesis that intra-seasonal changes in fin whale hotspot distribution relate to sea surface temperature (SST), krill abundance and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). More whale hotspots (sightings and individuals) are observed during late- than mid-summer surveys. During mid-summer, hotspots occurred near Elephant Island while in late-summer they were distributed throughout the slope region in proximity to the mean location of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The spatial mean of EKE did not differ between mid- and late-summer surveys, but the spatial mean of SST was significantly warmer during late-summer. The GAM for mid-summer indicates that fin whale hotspots were positively related to SST, EKE and acoustically determined krill biomass. The GAM for late-summer indicates the hotspots were negatively related to net-based krill abundance and positively related to acoustic krill biomass and EKE. This study is important because environmental determinants of fin whale hotspots may be used as reference points for implementing future conservation plans for their recovering populations.

AB  - The Cortes geoduck (Panopea globosa) has been considered a Gulf of California (GC) endemic but anecdotal and unpublished evidence has suggested its presence in Bahia Magdalena (BM), on the Pacific coast of southern Baja California. Establishing the identity of geoduck clams and their distribution limits is not only of clear biological significance to understand their structural and functional variation, but is also of consequence for their conservation and management, given the multi-million dollar fishery they support in north-west Mexico. We analysed Panopea clams from Mexican populations, including BM, using an integrative approach including genetics, morphometrics, and an ecological niche model. Our genetic results (restriction fragment length polymorphisms of nuclear ribosomal DNA and mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences) clearly identify BM geoducks as P. globosa, implying a significant geographical range expansion outside of the GC and refuting its status as endemic to the Gulf. On the other hand, clams from BM were phenotypically different (shell significantly higher) from other Mexican P. globosa and Panopea generosa specimens, which may account for the confusion in their morphological identification. The ecological niche model for P. globosa, integrating ecological and distributional data from the GC, revealed a very low probability (< 10%) that this species could successfully occupy BM. Our results and those of others suggest that the Cortes geoduck population in BM may be adapted to specific environmental conditions differing from those experienced by conspecifics inside the Gulf and is likely isolated. This is highly relevant for the management plans of Mexican geoducks.

AB  - Pelagic seabirds that breed colonially are central-place foragers; their spatial distribution is restricted to marine areas around their colonies during the chick-rearing period, when attendance and food provision to their chicks has to be intense. In this study we analyzed the foraging trips of 11 Scopoli's shearwater Calonectris diomedea breeders that were tagged with GPS data loggers during 2014 in oligotrophic waters (Ionian Sea, western Greece), and assessed the range and oceanographic parameters of their foraging habitat. Contrary to previous findings suggesting a varying foraging strategy depending on the breeding stage, the tracked shearwaters made short trips, less than 4 days long, in the vicinity of the colony. By applying the Adaptive Kernel method, their 50% and 95% foraging range was estimated at 6871 km(2) and 23 014 km(2) respectively. In addition, generalized additive models showed that sea surface temperature (<25.5 degrees C), minimum distance from the colony (<100 km), fishing pressure index from small scale fisheries (medium values) along with a two-dimensional soap film smoother for space (casting, northing) were the most significant factors affecting at-sea distribution of this marine top predator during the early chick-rearing period (i.e. 99.9% of the final model deviance). Our study will contribute to the revision of the boundaries of the local Special Protection Area (SPA) of Strofades. It will also address the implementation of specific conservation measures for the species at regional and national scale, and the development of a management plan for the protection of the study area.

AB  - Predation on livestock is one of the main factors that cause the felids hunting, in particular for puma and jaguar this conflict with humans is severe. Most studies have assessed the predation impacts on livestock production; however there is a spatial pattern in attacks occurrence that is feasible to analyze from ecological niche modeling. The objective of this research was to generate a risk model of livestock predation by puma and jaguar in Mexico based on environmental and livestock management variables, which allows identification of zones of risk in order to define mitigation strategies at national level. We produced a geographic ensemble model of risk of predation from three algorithms for jaguar and five for puma. The variables most positively related with predation risk by jaguar were vegetative cover percentage, percentage of free grazing animals, and altitude, whereas arid vegetation has a negative influence on predation risk. In the case of puma the variables with highest contribution were livestock density, which negatively influences on the predation risk, in addition to forest and altitude, both with a positive relation. The ensemble models are an accurate approach to delineating the zones of predation risk by felids; however at a regional scale the environmental characteristics that favor predation may be different. It is recommended that researchers carry out studies for each biogeographic province that facilitate the identification of specific patterns and the definition of mitigation strategies most suitable for each one.

AB  - Climate change represents a significant threat to global biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. Climate change is expected to have also impacts on forest ecology. It is thus important to make assessments of possible impacts of climate change on forests in different regions to allow respective governments and communities to adapt. Climate change is projected to affect individual organisms, populations, species distributions and ecosystem composition and functions. This impact can be both direct by temperature increases, precipitation and sea level changes, and indirect, for instance by changing the intensity and frequency of wild fires. Processes such as habitat loss, modification and fragmentation and the spread of non-native species will result from the impacts of climate change. India has 14 major forest types classified based on climate and altitude. 72% of forests are tropical moist deciduous, dry deciduous and evergreen forests. The major scenario of climate change in India is deduced from greenhouse gas increase. This scenario forecasts a general increase in temperature and rainfall in all regions. This could result in increased productivity and shift forest type boundaries along altitudinal and rainfall gradients, with species migrating from lower to higher elevations and the drier forest types being transformed into moister types. Thus, climate change could cause irreversible damage to unique forest ecosystems and biodiversity, rendering several species extinct, locally and globally.
   Studies of ecological changes and sea level rise should be done to provide continuous inputs for necessary management intervention. Sustainable development of local communities, effective management of natural resources with concerns for conserving biodiversity, and rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems in the context of climate change phenomenon are all closely associated with one another. Forest planning and development programmes have to be based on traditional knowledge and ensure people's participation to appropriately adopt various policy and management practices to minimize the adverse impacts and vulnerability to climate change.

AB  - Context. Habitat degradation and fragmentation of vegetation can transform and deplete local wildlife populations, and is a key threatening process globally. In northern Australian tropical savannas, clearing is relatively rare across the biome, although it is slowly intensifying as a result of increasing agricultural development. However, the terrestrial vertebrates in these largely intact landscapes are undergoing current population declines because of a variety of land-management changes, one of which is increasing land clearing; therefore, there is a need to understand the relative effect of small-scale land clearing the fauna.
   Aims. The present study examined the variation in abundance of birds, mammals and reptiles in intact, thinned and cleared Eucalyptus woodlands in a tropical savanna bioregion.
   Methods. The vertebrate fauna were sampled in 88 sites over two general geographic locations within the Desert Uplands in 2005 and 2006. Standardised 1-ha surveys were employed in a single vegetation type and across three treatments. As two discrete locations were examined, linear mixed models were used in the analysis.
   Key results. The fauna composition varied significantly across the intact, thinned and cleared sites. Bird species richness reduced from intact to thinned and cleared sites, and reptile richness and abundance declined in cleared sites, but was largely unaffected by thinning. Seventeen bird species recorded significant variation in abundance across the three vegetation structural types, with 12 most abundant in the intact sites. Mammals on the whole were recorded in very low abundances and in few sites. For reptiles, two were most abundant in thinned sites and three in intact sites.
   Conclusions. In the present study, we have demonstrated that small-scale clearing and vegetation manipulation via thinning, even within largely intact tropical savanna woodland, can cause localised depletion of some species, although most notably where the vegetation disruption was most severe (i.e. clearing). Birds are most affected, and many species that declined in abundance are the same as those that suffered severe population reductions as a result of broad-scale clearing in south-eastern Australia.
   Implications. The proposed increase in the intensity of agricultural land use in northern Australia will result in incremental landscape change as a result of clearing. Understanding how the gradual reduction of vegetation cover and habitat will change the faun assemblage is important for pre-emptive conservation planning. This is vital to avoid the mistakes of extensive landscape change in southern Australia that has left a legacy of a permanently depleted fauna.

AB  - Altered disturbance regimes in forest ecosystems can lead to the formation of dense, persistent understory vegetation composed of a small number of dominant species. This understory layer often limits tree seedling recruitment, decreases biodiversity, and can alter forest ecosystem structure and functioning. In the southern Appalachians - one of the most biodiverse regions in North America - pervasive logging in the 19th and early 20th centuries may have contributed to the formation of a dense understory shrub layer that suppresses plant diversity and tree recruitment, but the evidence for this idea has been mixed. To help clarify this issue, we tested whether (a) the two dominant understory shrub taxa (Kalmia latifolia and evergreen Rhododendron species) were more common or more abundant in areas with a history of intense logging than in areas undisturbed by logging, and (b) the relationships between the understory shrub layer and environmental gradients that drive regional biodiversity and plant distributions in the Southern Appalachians (e.g., climate, soils) differ in logged versus undisturbed areas. We used publicly available, extensive, and spatially explicit data on vegetation, climate, topography, soils, solar radiation, and logging history in Great Smoky Mountains National Park to build beta and binomial regression models of shrub frequency and cover as a function of logging history and environmental variables. Contrary to our expectation and speculations in the literature, we found that the dominant shrub taxa were more common (frequent) in areas with no logging history. However, we also found that logging history effects on shrub abundance (cover) varied along environmental gradients. For example, in topographically shaded landscape positions evergreen Rhododendron thickets exhibited greater cover in logged areas than in areas with no logging history. On the other hand, Rhododendron thickets exhibited lower cover in logged areas than in areas with no logging history at low elevations. Thus, conservation planning and forest management in topographically complex regions need to consider both landscape context (e.g., elevation, landscape position) and past logging as important interacting drivers that either facilitate or suppress local formation of dense shrub understories that can ultimately impact tree regeneration patterns, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - International scientific fishery survey programmes systematically collect samples of target stocks' biomass and abundance and use them as the basis to estimate stock status in the framework of stock assessment models. The research surveys can also inform decision makers about Essential Fish Habitat conservation and help define harvest control rules based on direct observation of biomass at the sea. However, missed survey locations over the survey years are common in long-term programme data. Currently, modelling approaches to filling gaps in spatiotemporal survey data range from quickly applicable solutions to complex modelling. Most models require setting prior statistical assumptions on spatial distributions, assuming short-term temporal dependency between the data, and scarcely considering the environmental aspects that might have influenced stock presence in the missed locations. This paper proposes a statistical and machine learning based model to fill spatiotemporal gaps in survey data and produce robust estimates for stock assessment experts, decision makers, and regional fisheries management organizations. We apply our model to the SoleMon survey data in North-Central Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea) for 4 stocks: Sepia officinalis, Solea solea, Squilla mantis, and Pecten jacobaeus. We reconstruct the biomass-index (i.e., biomass over the swept area) of 10 locations missed in 2020 (out of the 67 planned) because of several factors, including COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions. We evaluate model performance on 2019 data with respect to an alternative index that assumes biomass proportion consistency over time. Our model's novelty is that it combines three complementary components. A spatial component estimates stock biomass-index in the missed locations in one year, given the surveyed location's biomass-index distribution in the same year. A temporal component forecasts, for each missed survey location, biomass-index given the data history of that haul. An environmental component estimates a biomass-index weighting factor based on the environmental suitability of the haul area to species presence. Combining these components allows understanding the interplay between environmental-change drivers, stock presence, and fisheries. Our model formulation is general enough to be applied to other survey data with lower spatial homogeneity and more temporal gaps than the SoleMon dataset.

AB  - The Atlantic Rain Forest, an important biodiversity hot spot, has faced severe habitat loss since the last century which has resulted in a highly fragmented landscape with a large number of small forest patches (<100 ha). For conservation planning it is essential to understand how current and future forest regeneration depends on ecological processes, fragment size and the connection to the regional seed pool. We have investigated the following questions by applying the forest growth simulation model FORMIND to the situation of the Atlantic Forest in the state of Sao Paulo, SE Brazil: (1) which set of parameters describing the local regeneration and level of density regulation can reproduce the biomass distribution and stem density of an old growth forest in a reserve? (2) Which additional processes apart from those describing the dynamics of an old growth forest, drive forest succession of small isolated fragments? (3) Which role does external seed input play during succession? Therefore, more than 300 tree species have been classified into nine plant functional types (PFTs), which are characterized by maximum potential height and shade tolerance. We differentiate between two seed dispersal modes: (i) local dispersal, i.e. all seedlings originated from fertile trees within the simulated area and (ii) external seed rain. Local seed dispersal has been parameterized following the pattern oriented approach, using biomass estimates of old growth forest. We have found that moderate density regulation is essential to achieve coexistence for a broad range of regeneration parameters. Considering the expected uncertainty and variability in the regeneration processes it is important that the forest dynamics are robust to variations in the regeneration parameters. Furthermore, edge effects such as increased mortality at the border and external seed rain have been necessary to reproduce the patterns for small isolated fragments. Overall, simulated biomass is much lower in the fragments compared to the continuous forest, whereas shade tolerant species are affected most strongly by fragmentation. Our simulations can supplement empirical studies by extrapolating local knowledge on edge effects of fragments to larger temporal and spatial scales. In particular our results show the importance of external seed rain and therefore highlight the importance of structural connectivity between regenerating fragments and mature forest stands.

AB  - A phenology model was developed for the wild daffodil Narcissus radiiflorus growing in alpine meadows. The model is based on temperature-dependent growth rates and on the rate summation method, and represents the development from 1 January to full bloom, i.e, phase I, and from full broom to 50% fruit maturity, i.e. phase II. Published data obtained in the laboratory and observations made at different altitudes near the villages of Seewis i. P. and Fanas in the canton of the Grisons, Switzerland, were used for estimating model parameters. To conserve N. radiiflorus the first cut should be delayed until completion of phase II. The time in days between full bloom and 50% fruit maturity at different altitudes was simulated by using 16 years of temperature data. These data were recorded at a nearby weather station and adapted to different altitudes by assuming a 0.5 degrees C decrease in temperature for a 100 m increase in altitude. Significant differences between the length of phase II at different altitudes were found. However, in the main areas where Narcissus occurs, a subset of equal mean duration of phase II could be identified. This is explained by the compensation of the altitude-dependent temperature decrease caused by the general increase in temperature during phase II, i.e. in June and July. For this subset the logistic function was fitted to the frequency distribution of the number of days required to complete phase II. When accepting a 10% risk of mowing too early, the first cut should be delayed by 34 days after full bloom. The 34-day rule is considered a more adequate and efficient method to plan meadow management than the method actually used based on predefined calendar days. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, we have experienced mega-flood disasters in Japan due to climate change. In the last century, we have been building disaster prevention infrastructure (artificial levees and dams, referred to as "grey infrastructure") to protect human lives and assets from floods, but these hard protective measures will not function against mega-floods. Moreover, in a drastically depopulating society such as that in Japan, farmland abandonment prevails, and it will be more difficult to maintain grey infrastructure with a limited tax income. In this study, we propose the introduction of green infrastructure (GI) as an adaptation strategy for climate change. If we can use abandoned farmlands as GI, they may function to reduce disaster risks and provide habitats for various organisms that are adapted to wetland environments. First, we present a conceptual framework for disaster prevention using a hybrid of GI and conventional grey infrastructure. In this combination, the fundamental GI, composed of forests and wetlands in the catchment (GI-1) and additional multilevel GIs such as flood control basins that function when floodwater exceeds the planning level (GI-2) are introduced. We evaluated the flood attenuation function (GI-1) of the Kushiro Wetland using a hydrological model and developed a methodology for selecting suitable locations of GI-2, considering flood risk, biodiversity and the distribution of abandoned farmlands, which represent social and economic costs. The results indicated that the Kushiro Wetland acts as a large natural reservoir that attenuates the hydrological peak discharge during floods and suitable locations for introducing GI-2 are concentrated in floodplain areas developing in the downstream reaches of large rivers. Finally, we discussed the network structure of GI-1 as a hub and GI-2 as a dispersal site for conservation of the Red-crowned Crane, one of the symbolic species of Japan.

AB  - Artificial light at night poses a significant threat to multiple taxa across the globe. In coastal regions, artificial lighting close to marine turtle nesting beaches is disruptive to their breeding success. Prioritizing effective management of light pollution requires an understanding of how the light exposure of nesting areas changes over time in response to changing temporal and spatial distributions of coastal development. We analyzed multitemporal, satellite night-light data, in combination with linear mixed model analysis, to determine broadscale changes in artificial light exposure at Australian marine turtle nesting areas between 1993 and 2010. We found seven marine turtle management units (MU), from five species, have experienced significant increases in light exposure over time, with flatback turtles nesting in east Australia experiencing the fastest increases. The remaining 12 MUs showed no significant change in light exposure. Unchanging MUs included those previously identified as having high exposure to light pollution (located in western Australia and southern Queensland), indicating that turtles in these areas have been potentially exposed to high light levels since at least the early nineties. At a finer geographic scale (within-MU), nine MUs contained nesting areas with significant increases in light exposure. These nesting areas predominantly occurred close to heavily industrialized coastal areas, thus emphasizing the importance of rigorous light management in industry. Within all MUs, nesting areas existed where light levels were extremely low and/or had not significantly increased since 1993. With continued coastal development, nesting females may shift to these darker/unchanging 'buffer' areas in the future. This is valuable information that informs our understanding of the capacity and resilience of marine turtles faced with coastal development: an understanding that is essential for effective marine turtle conservation.

AB  - Aim Regional movements of tropical birds are among the least understood patterns of migration, generally assumed to be related to seasonality of vegetation and food resources. We used readily available remotely sensed data to analyse this relationship in the three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculatus), an IUCN Vulnerable canopy frugivorous bird that undergoes localized altitudinal and latitudinal movements between several non-breeding and breeding ranges.
   Location Central America.
   Methods We generated ecological niche models (GARP and Maxent) based on remotely sensed vegetation indices (enhanced vegetation index, EVI; red index, RI; and normalized difference water index, NDWI) that were used as proxies for canopy characteristics and phenological changes between seasons. The variation in EVI was also analysed in relation to known bellbird seasonal migration patterns.
   Results Remotely sensed summaries of intra- annual vegetation variation could not explain known movement patterns of bellbirds breeding in Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, Costa Rica. The ecological niche modelling (ENM) framework used for exploring potential movement patterns of another population of bellbirds, observed in March 2004 in Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica, showed that the Atlantic and Pacific lowlands are suitable for the bellbirds year- round, while middle elevations, where breeding may occur, have limited suitability.
   Main conclusions Our findings suggest that: (1) the Corcovado population tracks similar environmental conditions during the non- breeding season; (2) migration to middle elevation breeding sites might be related to factors other than vegetation seasonality or breeding might not be restricted to these elevation ranges; and (3) the lowlands comprising most of the suitable areas for bellbirds are where anthropogenic pressure is highest, so conservation status should consider this threat, and conservation planning should emphasize these areas.

AB  - Across species, diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is critical to individual disease resistance and, hence, to population health; however, MHC diversity can be reduced in small, fragmented, or isolated populations. Given the need for comparative studies of functional genetic diversity, we investigated whether MHC diversity differs between populations which are open, that is experiencing gene flow, versus populations which are closed, that is isolated from other populations. Using the endangered ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) as a model, we compared two populations under long-term study: a relatively "open," wild population (n=180) derived from Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar (2003-2013) and a "closed," captive population (n=121) derived from the Duke Lemur Center (DLC, 1980-2013) and from the Indianapolis and Cincinnati Zoos (2012). For all animals, we assessed MHC-DRB diversity and, across populations, we compared the number of unique MHC-DRB alleles and their distributions. Wild individuals possessed more MHC-DRB alleles than did captive individuals, and overall, the wild population had more unique MHC-DRB alleles that were more evenly distributed than did the captive population. Despite management efforts to maintain or increase genetic diversity in the DLC population, MHC diversity remained static from 1980 to 2010. Since 2010, however, captive-breeding efforts resulted in the MHC diversity of offspring increasing to a level commensurate with that found in wild individuals. Therefore, loss of genetic diversity in lemurs, owing to small founder populations or reduced gene flow, can be mitigated by managed breeding efforts. Quantifying MHC diversity within individuals and between populations is the necessary first step to identifying potential improvements to captive management and conservation plans.

AB  - Fewer than 250 Asian elephants remain in China, occupying fragmented habitats of Yunnan Province. One such fragmented population of 18-23 individuals occupies the Nangunhe Nature Reserve Area in Lincang City, Yunnan Province, China. The greatest threat to the survival of this population is the loss and fragmentation of habitat. In this study, we applied an ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) model to evaluate the habitat suitability of Lincang City for Asian elephants based on geographical factors, vegetation type, and human disturbance. Optimal, relatively suitable, and marginal habitat accounted for 0.16% (38.45 km(2)), 0.61% (150.00 km(2)), and 3.34% (817.26 km(2)) of the total study area, whereas non-suitable habitat accounted for 95.89% (23,463.29 km(2)) of this area. The marginality of Asian elephant habitat in Lincang was 1.954, indicating nonrandom selection of various eco-geographical variables in the environment. The primary factor affecting Asian elephant habitat quality was vegetation type, followed by geographical factors and human disturbance. A habitat quality map for the total distribution of Asian elephants remaining in China (i.e., Yunnan Province: Xishuangbanna, Lincang, and Pu'er) based on our current and previous study showed that just 1400.57 km(2) and 2689.62 km(2) relatively suitable and optimal habitat is available, owing to significant deforestation. In addition to reintroduction programs, conservation strategies should focus on improving the quality of marginal habitats for elephants, in parallel to placing ecological corridors through non-suitable habitat to connect all suitable habitats for this and other extremely small elephant populations in China to reduce genetic isolation and secure long-term survival for the species.

AB  - Identifying resource preference is considered essential for developing targeted conservation plans but, for many species, questions remain about the best way to estimate preference. Resource preferences for bees are particularly difficult to determine as the resources they collect, nectar and pollen, are challenging to estimate availability and collection. Resources are traditionally measured at the flower or inflorescence level, but these measures of availability do not correspond to the resources actually used by bees. Additionally, it is unclear as to whether common models including availability are appropriate for bees which may target resources regardless of available quantities. Here we first compare two common hypotheses of resource use - the 'random use hypothesis' and the 'linear preferences hypothesis' - using three different measures of availability (pollen, flower and inflorescence) - to determine if one measure of availability was better for understanding bee pollen use. Next, the superior model using availability was compared to a novel model of bee pollen use the 'target use hypothesis'. This model assumes that bees target some resources regardless of how much of each resource is available (but assuming resources are present at a site), and thus models preference without availability data. Of the models including availability, the linear preference model using inflorescence availability best explained the pollen use data. This suggests that bumblebee pollen use is non-random and that cues to identify and locate resources (i.e. display size and quantity) may be more important than the quantity of the resource available (i.e. pollen availability). Additionally, in most cases the target use model explained the data equal to or better than the other models suggesting bee resource use may be better modeled without measured availability data compared to linear models. These results could be important for expanding resource use analysis of bees that are difficult to quantify availability.

AB  - Geodiversity, (diversity of the geosphere) incorporates many of the environmental patterns and processes that are considered drivers of biodiversity. Components of geodiversity (climate, topography, geology and hydrology) can be considered in terms of their resource giving potential, where resources are taken as energy, water, space and nutrients. The total amount of these resources, along with their spatial and temporal variation, is herein proposed as a compound index of geodiversity that has the potential to model broad scale biodiversity patterns. This paper outlines potential datasets that could be used to represent geodiversity, and then reviews the theoretical links between each element of the proposed compound index of geodiversity (overall resource availability, temporal variation and spatial variation in those resources) and broad-scale patterns of biodiversity. Support for the influence of each of the elements of geodiversity on overall biodiversity patterns was found in the literature, although the majority of relevant research focuses on resource availability, particularly available energy. The links between temporal and spatial variation in resources and biodiversity have been less thoroughly investigated in the literature. For the most part, it was reported that overall resource availability, temporal variation and spatial variation in those resources do not act in isolation in terms of controlling biodiversity. Overall there are sufficient datasets to calculate the proposed compound index of geodiversity, and evidence in the literature for links between the geographical distribution of biodiversity and each of the elements of the compound index defined. Since data for measuring geodiversity is more spatially consistent and widely available (thanks to satellite remote sensing) geodiversity has potential as a conservation planning tool, especially where biological data are not available or sparsely distributed.

AB  - Genetic studies of population or 'stock' structure in exploited marine fishes typically are designed to determine whether geographic boundaries useful for conservation and management planning are identifiable. Implicit in many such studies is the notion that subpopulations or stocks, if they exist, have fixed territories with little or no gene exchange between them. Herein, we review our long-term genetic studies of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), an estuarine-dependent sciaenid fish in the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean. Significant differences in frequencies of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and of alleles at nuclear-encoded microsatellites occur among red drum sampled across the northern Gulf of Mexico. The spatial distribution of the genetic variation, however, follows a pattern of isolation-by-distance consistent with the hypothesis that gene flow occurs among subpopulations and is an inverse (and continuous) function of geographic distance. However, successful reproduction and recruitment of red drum depend on estuarine habitats that have geographically discrete boundaries. We hypothesize that population structure in red drum follows a modified one-dimensional, linear stepping-stone model where gene exchange occurs primarily (but not exclusively) between adjacent bays and estuaries distributed linearly along the coastline. Gene flow does occur among estuaries that are not adjacent but probabilities of gene exchange decrease as a function of geographic distance. Implications of our hypothesis are discussed in terms of inferences drawn from patterns of isolation-by-distance and relative to conservation and management of estuarine-dependent species like red drum. Based on estimates of the ratio of genetic effective population size and census size in red drum, observed patterns of gene flow in red drum may play a significant role in recruitment.

AB  - Background Forests perform various important ecosystem functions that contribute to ecosystem services. In many parts of the world, forest management has shifted from a focus on timber production to multi-purpose forestry, combining timber production with the supply of other forest ecosystem services. However, it is unclear which forest types provide which ecosystem services and to what extent forests primarily managed for timber already supply multiple ecosystem services. Based on a comprehensive dataset collected across 150 forest plots in three regions differing in management intensity and species composition, we develop models to predict the potential supply of 13 ecosystem services. We use those models to assess the level of multifunctionality of managed forests at the national level using national forest inventory data. Results Looking at the potential supply of ecosystem services, we found trade-offs (e.g. between both bark beetle control or dung decomposition and both productivity or soil carbon stocks) as well as synergies (e.g. for temperature regulation, carbon storage and culturally interesting plants) across the 53 most dominant forest types in Germany. No single forest type provided all ecosystem services equally. Some ecosystem services showed comparable levels across forest types (e.g. decomposition or richness of saprotrophs), while others varied strongly, depending on forest structural attributes (e.g. phosphorous availability or cover of edible plants) or tree species composition (e.g. potential nitrification activity). Variability in potential supply of ecosystem services was only to a lesser extent driven by environmental conditions. However, the geographic variation in ecosystem function supply across Germany was closely linked with the distribution of main tree species. Conclusions Our results show that forest multifunctionality is limited to subsets of ecosystem services. The importance of tree species composition highlights that a lack of multifunctionality at the stand level can be compensated by managing forests at the landscape level, when stands of complementary forest types are combined. These results imply that multi-purpose forestry should be based on a variety of forest types requiring coordinated planning across larger spatial scales.

AB  - The paper presents a synthesis of some of the interdisciplinary work from the ARCPATH project that focuses on the effects of climate change on Arctic social-ecological systems. It does so through the prism of whales and their recreational ecosystem services (ES). Whales present a group of species that are vulnerable to climate change and, at the same time, are central to the economies, cultures, and identities of many Arctic coastal communities. One such community is the town of Husavik in Skjalfandi Bay, Iceland. The paper conducts an initial literature review to examine the effects of climate change on whales, globally, before using these findings and site-specific data from climate change modelling, whale observations from whale watching boats and whale watching trip records to investigate possible future impacts on whale watching in Skjalfandi Bay. The literature review identifies three categories of impacts on whales due to climate change, which concern changing distributions and migration, prey availability, and sea-ice and ocean temperature. Linear regression models identify statistically significant relationships between sea-surface temperatures (SST) and cetacean sightings for minke whales, blue whales and white-beaked-dolphins over the period 1995 to 2017. These species appear to have changed their usual feeding areas, and the results imply that further increases in SST are likely to further affect whale distributions. Future climate scenarios indicate that at least 2 degrees C of SST warming in Skjalfandi Bay up to 2050 might be inevitable regardless of the future emissions scenario, which implies nearly certain change that would require adaptation. The reliance of the local tourism sector on whale watching makes Husavik vulnerable to the effects of climate change on whales. The results of this interdisciplinary inquiry emphasize the interconnectedness of different components of social-ecological systems and calls for adaptation planning that would enhance the resilience of local community to climate change and conservation measures that could enhance the protection of whales beyond the scope of the current whale sanctuary in Skjalfandi Bay.

AB  - Light detection and ranging (lidar) is a useful tool for measuring three-dimensional habitat structure; hence, its use in habitat suitability models has been explored, both as a single resource and in combination with other remote-sensing techniques. Here, we evaluated the suitability of airborne lidar data in comparison with aerial photographs and field surveys for modelling the distribution of an endangered and cryptic forest species, the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). The study was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park of southeast Germany. Subsequently, a prediction map for conservation planning was generated for a large area, which encompassed the National Park. We examined the utility of lidar data for generating a hazel grouse distribution model by using machine learning (boosted regression trees), and then compared the results to variables derived from field surveys and aerial photographs, both separately and in combination. The cross-validated discrimination ability of the model was slightly higher when using lidar data (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.79) compared to models using aerial photographs (AUC, 0.75) or field survey data (AUC, 0.78). The predictive performance consistently increased when combining the predictors from different sources, with an AUC of 0.86 being produced in the model combining all three data sources. The three data sources complemented one another, with each data source probably having an advantage at deriving one of three key aspects of the hazel grouse habitat, namely, vertically well-structured forest stands, horizontally mixed successional vegetation stages, and certain deciduous trees as food resources such as mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). In addition, the diverse lidar metrics might be applied to simultaneously characterize vertically and horizontally well-structured forest stands. We conclude that public available airborne lidar data are a viable source for creating habitat suitability maps for large areas and may have increased utility for detecting forest characteristics and valuable wildlife habitats.

AB  - 1. Generalized additive models of sighting data for cetaceans collected during two surveys of waterways in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh indicated that Ganges River dolphin Platanista gangetica gangetica distribution was conditionally dependent (P<0.05) on low salinity, high turbidity, and moderate depth during both low and high freshwater flow: and Irrawaddy dolphin Orcaella brevirostris distribution was conditionally dependent (P<0.05) on low salinity during high freshwater flow, high and moderate depths during low and high freshwater flow, respectively, low and high-low extremes of turbidity during low and high freshwater flow, respectively; and high temperature and increasing numbers of large-small channel confluences during low freshwater flow.
   2. According to sighting data collected over a 3-year period by the captains of three nature tourism vessels, there were significant differences between the actual and expected frequencies of Ganges River dolphin sightings and individuals according to various channel types (chi-square-64.22, P<0.0001 and chi-square = 134.14. P<0.0001, respectively, df = 6) and of Irrawaddy dolphin sightings and individuals (chi-square = 15.28, P = 0.0182. and chi-square = 29.42. P<0.0001, respectively, df = 6), with shared preferences for wide sinuous channels with at least two small confluences or one large confluence.
   3. The dependency exhibited by both species for environmental characteristics associated with abundant freshwater flow. including low salinity and the availability of confluences, make them particularly vulnerable to habitat loss due to upstream water abstraction and sea-level rise.
   4. Although the results of this Study may not affect plans for construction in India of large-scale, inter-basin water transfer projects that will result in further declines in freshwater flows, or decisions within the international community about CO, emissions affecting global sea levels, they call be used to prioritize locations where protective measures could be employed to benefit the long-term conservation of both species.

AB  - Macroalgae play a structuring role in benthic ecosystems, which makes it very important to monitor their cover rates and study their community structures and changes in time. Such studies are usually led by autonomous divers and often do not generate sufficient data to provide enough material for strategically-sound conservation plans. This paper describes the dataset generated in the framework of the evaluation of the potential of a complementary data acquisition method: annotating videos transects obtained using an underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). The focus was on Cystoseira brachycarpa, together with the abundance of several other macroalgae species, which could be identified using the ROV images after validation through specimen identification. Furthermore, in order to allow future uses, such as monitoring the status of colonisation of the invasive algae Caulerpa cylindracea, the ROV was sent to some deeper transects on sedimentary habitats (40 m) below the Posidonia meadows lower limits. New information The project, while providing some interesting insights on using a ROV as a tool to study marine biodiversity, generated a dataset for the distribution of 19 macroalgae on both standardised and new transects in the Bay of Calvi (Katz et al. 2021). The observed species of macroalgae included: Acetabularia acetabulum, Amphiroa rigida, Caulerpa prolifera, Caulerpa cylindracea, Codium bursa, Colpomenia sinuosa, Corallinales (order), Cystoseira brachycarpa, Cystoseira crinita, Cystoseira spinosa, Cystoseira zosteroides, Dictyota (genus), Flabellia petiolata, Halopteris (genus), Halopteris scoparia, Jania (genus), Osmundaria volubilis, Padina pavonica and Peyssonnelia squamaria. The videos also showed that the invasive algae Caulerpa cylindracea has spread between 2016 and 2019 and that more focused studies should be held in the Bay to assess the actual reach and possible impacts of this invasion.Finally, our ROV video transects have also underlined the significant presence of particular benthic macroalgae communities over habitat zones described as "soft-bottom" on benthic habitat maps. Although the biomass per unit area of these communities is probably lower than for most coastal rocky bottoms, this widely-spread habitat type holds a contribution to primary production to be considered in coastal ecosystem models.

AB  - Motion-activated cameras are a versatile tool that wildlife biologists can use for sampling wild animal populations to estimate species occurrence. Occupancy modelling provides a flexible framework for the analysis of these data; explicitly recognizing that given a species occupies an area the probability of detecting it is often less than one. Despite the number of studies using camera data in an occupancy framework, there is only limited guidance from the scientific literature about survey design trade-offs when using motion-activated cameras. A fuller understanding of these trade-offs will allow researchers to maximise available resources and determine whether the objectives of a monitoring program or research study are achievable. We use an empirical dataset collected from 40 cameras deployed across 160 km(2) of the Western Slope of Colorado, USA to explore how survey effort (number of cameras deployed and the length of sampling period) affects the accuracy and precision (i. e., error) of the occupancy estimate for ten mammal and three virtual species. We do this using a simulation approach where species occupancy and detection parameters were informed by empirical data from motion-activated cameras. A total of 54 survey designs were considered by varying combinations of sites (10-120 cameras) and occasions (20-120 survey days). Our findings demonstrate that increasing total sampling effort generally decreases error associated with the occupancy estimate, but changing the number of sites or sampling duration can have very different results, depending on whether a species is spatially common or rare (occupancy =psi) and easy or hard to detect when available (detection probability = p). For rare species with a low probability of detection (i. e., raccoon and spotted skunk) the required survey effort includes maximizing the number of sites and the number of survey days, often to a level that may be logistically unrealistic for many studies. For common species with low detection (i. e., bobcat and coyote) the most efficient sampling approach was to increase the number of occasions (survey days). However, for common species that are moderately detectable (i. e., cottontail rabbit and mule deer), occupancy could reliably be estimated with comparatively low numbers of cameras over a short sampling period. We provide general guidelines for reliably estimating occupancy across a range of terrestrial species (rare to common: psi = 0.175-0.970, and low to moderate detectability: p = 0.003-0.200) using motion-activated cameras. Wildlife researchers/managers with limited knowledge of the relative abundance and likelihood of detection of a particular species can apply these guidelines regardless of location. We emphasize the importance of prior biological knowledge, defined objectives and detailed planning (e. g., simulating different study-design scenarios) for designing effective monitoring programs and research studies.

AB  - 1. Understanding spatial interactions between specific sources of anthropogenic impact on cetaceans and the ecological conditions intrinsic to these mammals, has several applications for conservation and management. Here cetacean habitats are classified into vulnerability levels by combining human development metrics and cetacean characteristics, allowing areas identified as more vulnerable to be given management priority.
   2. Ten bio-physical and anthropogenic factors were identified as key shapers of cetacean habitats and, using the Gulf of California as a case study, 18 variables were defined to measure those factors. Principal component analysis (PCA) and GIS were used to distill the relationships across all variables, in order to obtain a vulnerability index. Aggregates of variables were also investigated to map the spatial distribution of anthropogenic impacts and cetacean characteristics (species richness, relative abundance of encounter, residence condition, diet specificity and threat status). For this latter purpose, separate indices representing five 'categories' (pollution from land sources, urban development, potential for accidents, resource depletion and fragility of cetacean areas) and three 'vulnerability components' (risk of hazards, intrinsic resilience and damage) were calculated.
   3. The methodology clearly differentiated the study area according to levels for each 'category' and 'vulnerability component', as well as to levels of vulnerability of cetacean areas in relation to human activities; and identified those variables with the greatest contributions, without recourse to the subjective criteria common in other approaches. The analyses were conducted using environmental units generated by the Marine Ecological Zoning Plan for the Gulf of California (OEMGC, by its Spanish acronym) which tied model outputs to this planning framework. The variables selected were easily obtainable through governmental and research institutions which make them suitable for adaptive management purposes. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In the present period of rapid, worldwide change in climate and landuse (i.e., global change), successful biodiversity conservation warrants proactive management responses, especially for long-distance migratory species. However, the development and implementation of management strategies can be impeded by high levels of uncertainty and low levels of control over potentially impactful future events and their effects. Scenario planning and modeling are useful tools for expanding perspectives and informing decisions under these conditions. We coupled scenario planning and statistical modeling to explain and predict playa wetland inundation (i.e., presence/absence of water) and ponded area (i.e., extent of water) in the Rainwater Basin, an anthropogenically altered landscape that provides critical stopover habitat for migratory waterbirds. Inundation and ponded area models for total wetlands, those embedded in rowcrop fields, and those not embedded in rowcrop fields were trained and tested with wetland ponding data from 2004 and 2006-2009, and then used to make additional predictions under two alternative climate change scenarios for the year 2050, yielding a total of six predictive models and 18 prediction sets. Model performance ranged from moderate to good, with inundation models outperforming ponded area models, and models for non-rowcrop-embedded wetlands outperforming models for total wetlands and rowcrop-embedded wetlands. Model predictions indicate that if the temperature and precipitation changes assumed under our climate change scenarios occur, wetland stopover habitat availability in the Rainwater Basin could decrease in the future. The results of this and similar studies could be aggregated to increase knowledge about the potential spatial and temporal distributions of future stopover habitat along migration corridors, and to develop and prioritize multi-scale management actions aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of global change on migratory waterbird populations.

AB  - Broadscale land use changes are occurring rapidly in rural landscapes worldwide, within which revegetation with native plant species to increase the area of suitable habitat is a key activity. Current models for planning revegetation are based solely on the spatial arrangement of new and remnant vegetation. Making wise decisions about revegetation requires projective models of ecological responses to revegetation, but there are few appropriate data. Substantial time lags are expected in the availability of many habitat resources because different resources are realised at different stages of vegetation maturation. Here we present results of surveys of 72 revegetation sites established over a range from 5 to more than 130 yr from the slopes and plains of central Victoria, Australia. We surveyed vegetation provision of habitat resources essential for many birds and arboreal and scansorial mammals (e.g. canopy, large boughs, tree hollows and fallen timber). Predictive models were developed for habitat resource provision as functions of time since planting, planting density and other covariates. Different habitat resources developed at different rates. While dense canopy and various forms of bark resources developed in about 10 yr, large boughs, tree hollows and fallen timber loads required at least 100 yr to develop. The development of these key habitat resources was delayed in revegetated sites with high stem densities. Habitat resources that are essential for many birds and arboreal and scansorial mammals have long time lags that models for planning offsets or landscape reconstruction should account for. Management has substantial effects: planting at high densities greatly reduces tree girth growth rates and delays the occurrence of large boughs, tree hollows and fallen timber by decades.

AB  - Aim Understanding how landscape features affect gene flow is critical to connectivity conservation and restoration management. Here, we examined the relationship between functional connectivity (gene flow) and structural connectivity (area and spatial configuration of habitats) in three co-occurring short-range plant taxa in an ancient terrestrial island system. Location Low-altitude mountain range south-western Australia. Methods We analysed spatial patterns of genetic differentiation at nuclear microsatellite loci using Bayesian clustering. Circuit theory modelling was used to generate all possible pathways that connect populations as resistance distance matrices based on two surfaces for each taxon. The first surface assumes a flat terrain and tests whether genetic similarity declines only with distance-isolation by distance (IBD). The second surface is habitat suitability based on species distribution modelling (SDM), which tests whether genetic similarity is a function of connected and suitable habitat. Multiple matrix regression with randomization was used to test the significance of the resistance distance matrices at predicting two metrics of genetic differentiation (F-ST and D-EST). Variance explained was partitioned using redundancy analysis. Results Genetic structure for the insect-pollinated taxa-Acacia adinophylla-and Tetratheca aphylla subsp. aphylla was at similar spatial scales. Unexpectedly, a higher level of genetic structure was found in the wind-pollinated Lepidosperma bungalbin. IBD best explained the gene flow of A. adinophylla (R-2 = 0.41-0.43) with partial support provided by habitat suitability (R-2 = 0.04-0.07). In contrast, connectivity by habitat suitability was highest for T. aphylla subsp. aphylla (R-2 = 0.56-0.59). Drivers of L. bungalbin connectivity were inconsistent between the two measures of genetic differentiation. Main conclusions Gene flow is facilitated by different factors for the three taxa. Habitat fragmentation would most strongly impede gene flow for T. aphylla subsp. aphylla. Geographical distance cannot be assumed as the sole or best determinant of gene flow among populations, nor can findings be generalized to coexisting taxa.

AB  - Dead wood is an important element of forests both for biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Due to intensive silviculture, however, dead wood usually is strongly underrepresented in European forests. Forest reserves cannot fully compensate for this because they comprise only a small proportion of forested areas and are often isolated. Retaining a certain number of dead trees in managed forests is important, but may cause safety problems for lumbermen and visitors and still does not necessarily lead to an amount and incidence (i.e., probability of occurrence) of dead wood that might be required for many species and certain ecosystem functions. Our studies concentrate on a third and complimentary dead wood management strategy: dead wood islands, i.e. small unmanaged islands distributed throughout managed forests. As an example, we focus on European beech forests (Fagus sylvatica). An important question related to this strategy is: how do amount, quality, and incidence of dead wood depend on the island's size? To provide an answer, we use the spatially explicit, rule-based simulation model BEFORE-CWD that was developed to analyse dead wood dynamics in natural beech forests. This model and its predecessor, BEFORE, are well-verified and validated. They reproduce a suite of observed patterns and generate valid secondary and independent predictions. We found that islands that are too small, i.e. smaller than 0.33 and 0.08 ha for standing and lying dead wood, respectively, can fail to provide dead wood for several decades. The shape of the islands has only a minor effect. Extreme storm events temporarily increase and then decrease the amount of standing dead wood. In terms of the amount and incidence of dead wood, it makes no difference if one big or several small islands are set aside from management, unless the islands are not too small. We conclude that even relatively small unmanaged islands within managed forests can reliably provide dead wood and therefore should be considered as a management option. Our results can be used, for example by using metapopulation models of species of interest, to develop management plans for creating networks of dead wood islands.

AB  - Obtaining a comprehensive knowledge of the spatial and temporal variations of the environmental factors characterizing the Azores region is essential for conservation and management purposes. Although many studies are available for the region, there is a need for a general overview of the best available information. Here, we assembled a comprehensive collection of environmental data and briefly described the ocean climatology and its variability in the Azores. Data sources used in this study included remote sensing oceanographic data for 2003-2013 (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, particulate inorganic carbon, and particulate organic carbon), derived oceanographic data (primary productivity and North Atlantic oscillation index) for 2003-2013, and in situ data (temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate and silicate) obtained from the World Ocean Atlas 2013. We have produced 78 geographic datasets of environmental data for the Azores region that were deposited at the World Data Center Pangaea and also made available at the SIGMAR Azores website. As with previous studies, our results confirmed a high spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variability of the marine environment in the Azores region, typical of mid-latitudes. For example, lower sea surface temperature was found in the northern part of the study area coinciding with higher values for chlorophyll-a concentration, net primary production (NPP), and particulate organic and inorganic carbon. Higher values for some of these parameters were also found on island slopes and some seamounts. Compiled data on the environmental conditions at near-seabed revealed some notable variations across the study area (e.g., oxygen and nutrients) and with depth (e.g., temperature, salinity, and oxygen). Knowledge of these patterns will help improve our understanding of the distribution of many deep-sea organisms such as fish, cold-water corals, and sponges, thereby supporting the implementation of marine spatial planning and other management measures. It should be noted that the assembled datasets suffer from a number of limitations related to the accuracy of remote sensing and global bathymetry data, or to the limited and unevenly distributed collection of environmental observations. Accordingly, an effective observing system for detecting oceanic change with adequate accuracy and precision is still required.

AB  - A central component of predictive ecology in wetlands is the analysis of species distribution as a function of their biotic and abiotic environment. Decision-makers in biodiversity conservation, species monitoring and environmental planning, among others normally use this analysis. Habitat suitability modelling is a major component of the process of making the analysis, however, temporal and spatial variations of hydrological, hydrodynamic and environmental variables are normally not well known and overall values are estimated. In Abras de Mantequilla wetland (Ecuador) we find a tropical situation where the hydrodynamics of inflows seem to play an important role on the stability of the ecosystem. The habitat suitability in wetlands is driven by hydrodynamic, physical and biological interactions that are not fully understood. This research explores the habitat changes in space and time of a littoral fish community (Characidae) in this tropical wetland, identifying extremes using a constant analysis (thresholds in a range), a one variable index, and a fuzzy combination of hydrodynamic model variables. The main goal was to quantify the extension of the habitat areas were the habitat index was high enough to be considered as suitable for this fish community. This analysis was based on the hydrodynamic features and on spatiotemporal variations of the habitat index. The hydrodynamic variables water depth and velocity were modelled with a 2D flow representation and information from hydrological models simulations at the inflows of the wetland. The hydrodynamic model of the wetland was built in Delft3D-FLOW software. A change of spatial distribution of the habitat for Characidae family was related to the velocity and water depth. Results from the Habitat model indicated that when only water depth was selected as unique variable for the analysis, the percentage of suitable areas was higher at the beginning and at the end of the wet season. Conversely, when velocity was selected as unique variable the percentage of suitable areas was higher during the middle of the wet season. A subsequent combination of both variables depth and velocity showed a similar trend to the one of velocity alone. The results from this Combined Habitat Index determined that a higher percentage of suitable areas for this fish assemblage occurred during periods of high flows (middle of the wet season), given the hydrodynamic variables selected. Thus, it would appear that the habitability of the Characids in the littoral areas decreased when low flows occurred. Despite this fact, it is essential to acknowledge that other physical, chemical and biotic variables may play an important role in the presence of this community and therefore should be gradually included in future studies for an integrated ecological habitat assessment.

AB  - The demand for carbon permits is expected to increase rapidly with the introduction in Australia of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) in 2010. The CPRS will cap the emission of greenhouse gasses and create a market for carbon trading. Some prediction of the behaviour and impacts of the emerging market will inform potential policy responses. Introduction of a carbon market could result in strong demand for widespread conversion of land in agricultural regions to tree-based production of carbon permits which may pose a number of threats and opportunities for Australia's biodiversity, water resources, and rural environments and communities. This study aimed to quantify the potential generation of carbon permits from reforestation following the CPRS, and the potential conflicts this may cause. Carbon price was considered the main driver of adoption and this study does not consider other factors that may influence adoption. Specific focus was on the Mediterranean-type agricultural landscapes in South Australia.
   The potential distribution of the supply carbon permits from reforestation in South Australia's agricultural regions was modelled within a Geographic Information System (GIS). Spatio-temporal and economic models of tree growth and productivity, and agricultural profitability were used to estimate the viability of reforestation for carbon permits under various carbon price scenarios. Low diversity monocultures and high diversity native species were considered. Biodiversity conservation values were modelled spatially using a series of landscape ecology metrics and conservation planning principles. Spatially explicit water resource management priorities were modelled based on soil landscape characteristics. The impact on water yields from carbon-driven reforestation was modelled using Zhang curves. The location of threats and opportunities associated with the production of carbon permits were identified and then coupled with economically viable areas for carbon reforestation to identify hotspots where there is high potential for carbon supply that either complements or conflicts with biodiversity and water management goals.
   The results of this study found that reforestation for the supply of carbon permits under the CPRS may be more profitable than agricultural production over significant proportions of South Australia's agricultural landscapes, depending on future carbon prices. For example, it would be economically viable to reforest approximately 5.3 million ha (50%) of the study area if the carbon price was $ 20/t of CO2-e. Whilst reforestation using a diverse mix of native species was viable over 4 million ha at $ 20/t it could potentially cover over 40% of the high priority biodiversity conservation locations. However, significant threats are posed to zones of high priority biodiversity conservation value and high yield water run-off and aquifer recharge. The conversion of shallow-rooted annual cropping systems to deep-rooted tree-based monocultures uses more water and provides minimal biodiversity value. Approximately 1,200 GL would potentially be unavailable for surface and groundwater storage in catchments supplying a large proportion of the South Australian population if the carbon price is $ 20/t of CO2-e
   Various policy options are available to ensure reforestation is steered toward tree species that provide biodiversity benefits (e. g. mixed planting of species with local provenance). For example, a payment for ecosystem services (biodiversity) could be paid to land owners to compensate for the difference in income from the sale of permits generated by high yielding low diversity plantings against the lower yielding diverse plantings. This study suggests those payments would have to be in the order of only $ 5/ha/yr if carbon price is $ 20/t of CO2-e, but up to $ 115/ha/yr if carbon price is $ 45/t. Regulatory measures could be applied in locations where reforestation threatens aquatic ecosystems and the availability of water resources. Similarly, hotspots could be zoned where monocultures provide high opportunity and no threat to ecosystems.

AB  - We sought to identify those in-site habitat characteristics that best predict distributions of woodland birds in the boxironbark region of central Victoria, Australia. Our focus was on comparing and melding outcomes from several forms of ensemble modelling methods, which account for uncertainty in model structure and allow assessments of variable importance. We used boosted regression trees (BRT), Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) and random forests (RF) to model bird occurrences for 47 species using 43 predictor variables measured at 184 2-ha sites. The majority of predictor variables were in-site habitat variables, but vegetation cover in the surrounding landscape (500 m radius) and geographic coordinates were included to account for known effects of habitat fragmentation and of geographic clines. A consensus model also was developed, built from averaged predictions from the three techniques. We subdivided the avifauna into guilds and other categories (e.g. conservation status) to examine whether there were differences among such subdivisions. Based on cross validation, the consensus model and RF performed best, followed by BART and then BRT. Of the in-site habitat variables, the basal area of red-ironbark trees and groundstorey characteristics such as fine- and coarse-litter cover and litter depth had greatest influence on bird occurrences. These results can inform on-site restoration actions (what to restore) and, therefore, complement strategic landscape planning (where and when to restore).

AB  - In this work, we investigated the relationship between habitat types (HTs) and selected environmental factors in the highlands at altitudes of 1800-2558 m in the Kamnik-Savinja (KS) Alps in Slovenia. For 275 sampling sites, we identified seven HTs in their typical form and 11 ecotones, and provided field and modelled data for 14 environmental factors. HTs-environment relationships were analysed using multivariate ordination methods. In addition, binomial generalised linear mixed models were applied to reveal the influence of environmental factors on the occurrence of most frequent HTs in the study area [Outer Alpine Pinus mugo scrub (EUNIS code F2.4/Natura 2000 code 4070*), Southern rusty sedge grasslands (E4.413/6170), Cushion sedge carpets (E4.433/6170) and Fine calcareous screes (H2.43/8120)]. Results showed that certain modelled data (e.g. average annual air temperature) combined with field measurements (e.g. inclination, soil surface and soil moisture) can be effective predictors of most representative HTs in the study area, and thus useful for further refining of monitoring. Our study contributes to the knowledge and understanding of the relationships between environmental conditions and the occurrence of highland HTs in KS Alps, which probably concerns a great part of the Alpine highlands. Such knowledge is essential for assessing credible long-term conservation planning.

T2  - BIRD STUDY
LA  - English
AB  - The object of the research reported here teas to produce a map of habitat quality for the Dunlin across the Flow Country of northern Scotland for use in conservation and land-use planning. The region is too large (ca. 1800 km(2)) to survey on foot without significant expenditure of time and resources. Habitat quality was therefore predicted by relating Dunlin density recorded on a set of sample sites in the region to vegetation and landform characteristics. Density was then extrapolated across the whole region based on the recurrence of similar habitat conditions. The abundance of Dunlin in the Flow Country is shown to be related to several different classes of environmental variation. Dunlin are absent from several easily delimited types of habitat (e.g. lochs and woodland). A presence/absence map of habitat quality for the species is achieved simply by mapping these habitat features. Abundance on the moorland that remains is related to vegetation characteristics and the presence of clusters of pools (pool-systems). Dunlin prefer areas of moorland with shout, sparse vegetation. However, within such sites, regardless of vegetation type, Dunlin density varies systematically with respect to pool-systems, increasing exponentially as these habitat features are approached. Density variation with respect to changes in vegetation characteristics and pool-systems were modelled to produce a map of habitat qualify within a I ha grid over the whole region.

AB  - Background: Movement data are frequently collected using Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, but recorded GPS locations are subject to errors. While past studies have suggested methods to improve location accuracy, mechanistic movement models utilize distributions of turning angles and directional biases and these data present a new challenge in recognizing and reducing the effect of measurement error.
   Methods: I collected locations from a stationary GPS collar, analyzed a probabilistic model and used Monte Carlo simulations to understand how measurement error affects measured turning angles and directional biases.
   Results: Results from each of the three methods were in complete agreement: measurement error gives rise to a systematic bias where a stationary animal is most likely to be measured as turning 180 degrees or moving towards a fixed point in space. These spurious effects occur in GPS data when the measured distance between locations is < 20 meters.
   Conclusions: Measurement error must be considered as a possible cause of 180 degrees turning angles in GPS data. Consequences of failing to account for measurement error are predicting overly tortuous movement, numerous returns to previously visited locations, inaccurately predicting species range, core areas, and the frequency of crossing linear features. By understanding the effect of GPS measurement error, ecologists are able to disregard false signals to more accurately design conservation plans for endangered wildlife.

AB  - As the demand for carbon-neutral energy sources increases, so does the need to understand the impacts that these technologies have on the environment. Here, we assess the potential consequences of additional mortality on an Endangered raptor recently exposed to wind farms for the first time, the Black Harrier Circus maurus, one of the world's rarest harriers. We conduct a population viability assessment using a Bayesian model integrating life-history information and annual reporting rates from detection/non-detection surveys from the South African Bird Atlas Project. Our model estimates a global population of approximately 1300 birds currently declining at 2.3% per year, and one that could collapse in under 100 years, if an average of three to five adult birds are killed annually. This level of mortality may soon exist, given the current rate of fatalities and the number of wind farms planned within the species' distribution. In addition, we find that the population is sensitive to changes in climate. Our results highlight the critical need for appropriate placement, and adaptive management of wind farms and other infrastructure causing harrier mortality. We also show how detection/non-detection data may be used to infer population dynamics and viability, when population counts are unavailable.

AB  - Comparisons of spatial and temporal variation in demographic rates are crucial to understanding population dynamics. Yet, even well-studied species are often lacking in comparisons of such variability in demographic data, making these contrasts imperative to conduct in population ecology research. We conducted a long-term monitoring study of Spotted Salamanders ( Ambystoma maculatum) at five ponds in Missouri, USA. We sampled populations using drift fences, and monitored breeding immigration dates, adult population sizes, sex ratio, juvenile recruitment, metamorph sizes, and metamorph emigration dates. Generally, we found that our study populations exhibited characteristics similar to other populations across their distribution. We also found spatial and temporal variation among populations in nearly all demographic parameters, however, indicating that multipopulation and multiyear studies will likely improve our inferential abilities in understanding population dynamics. We observed an overall positive relationship between metamorph size and date of metamorphosis, but this pattern was not consistent across ponds or years, indicating that different environmental pressures might influence selection on these traits. Finally, we identified rainfall amounts and frequency as the primary factors that influenced adult and metamorph movement patterns to and from ponds. Overall, the spatial and temporal variation in demographic data we provided can be useful for population modeling or conservation planning, in addition to furthering our understanding of population ecology of Spotted Salamanders.

AB  - Resource selection functions are useful tools for land-use planning, especially for wide-ranging species with sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance. We evaluated five a priori hypotheses describing seasonal habitat selection of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) across three regions in northern Ontario. Two regions were Boreal Shield dominated, one area with relatively high anthropogenic disturbance (due to commercial forestry) and the other with relatively low anthropogenic disturbance. The final region was located on the wetland-dominated Hudson Bay Lowlands. Each region encompassed two caribou management ranges: one was used for model development and the other for model evaluation. We developed seasonal resource selection probability functions using seasonal utilization distributions and isopleths derived from GPS collar data (from 212 caribou) to identify high-and low-use areas. We explored selection across five spatial scales; selection patterns were strongest at the 10 000 ha scale. We found temporal and spatial variations in all environmental predictors across ranges and seasons, especially in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. Our results consistently supported the integrated global model (with common variables but range-specific coefficients) where caribou habitat use is related to minimizing apparent competition with moose (Alces alces (L., 1758)) while avoiding disturbed areas, and utilizing areas with adequate forage.

AB  - Lay Summary Seabirds are vulnerable to human disturbance, particularly during nocturnal resting periods. Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) have been anecdotally observed to move offshore into deeper waters at night, where they may encounter more vessel traffic. Yet little is known about their nocturnal habitat use. We evaluated the daily movement ecology and nocturnal habitat selection of Surf Scoters to identify likely nighttime resting areas. Scoters moved into deeper offshore waters at night. They preferred to use offshore coastal areas with moderately deep water and avoided strong tidal currents and heavy vessel traffic lanes. Understanding Surf Scoter nocturnal habitat use can improve oil spill response plans by prioritizing efforts in offshore resting areas to more effectively limit the mortality of scoters and other seabirds.
   Diurnally biased monitoring and research dominate our ecological understanding and guide conservation and management decisions regarding important indicator sea duck species, such as Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata). Advances in telemetry technology are improving our ability to track wildlife across the entire 24-hr day. Using location data derived from birds with surgically implanted satellite transmitters and habitat layers within a GIS (geographic information system), we analyzed Surf Scoter location data to (1) estimate movement distances between diurnal and nocturnal sites, (2) assess differences in environmental conditions at diurnal and nocturnal use locations, (3) evaluate the environmental conditions influencing nocturnal habitat selection, and (4) develop a predictive model to estimate likely nocturnal resting areas across the Salish Sea, which is composed of the inland marine waters of British Columbia, Canada, and Washington State. Surf Scoters in the Salish Sea traveled an average of 4,287 m between diurnal and nocturnal habitats, but distances varied regionally. We found that distance to shore, water depth, tidal current, and vessel traffic influenced nocturnal habitat use. Surf Scoter nocturnal use sites were characterized by greater distances from shore and deeper water than diurnal locations, although scoters avoided areas with strong tidal currents and heavy shipping traffic at night. The Salish Sea is experiencing increased ship traffic from multiple U.S. and Canadian ports. Oil tanker and shipping container vessel traffic pose a potential threat to nocturnal scoter flocks aggregating in deeper water adjacent to and sometimes overlapping with shipping lanes in narrow, glacial-carved channels of the Salish Sea. Current oil spill response plans in Washington State waters utilize diurnal distribution data, lacking important nocturnal use data. Our findings provide critical nocturnal habitat use information that can improve oil spill response policy and highlight the importance of elucidating nocturnal ecology for marine vertebrate species.

AB  - Interactions between cetaceans and the purse seine fishery in coastal waters of mainland Portugal were investigated using onboard observations over a period of 15 years (2003-2018). In 10% of the fishing sets, there were interactions with one of three species of cetaceans: common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), and harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). The common dolphin was the most frequently observed species, occurring in 89% of all interaction events, and the only species with observed mortality. Therefore, this study focused only on the interactions with common dolphins. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to observer data to investigate how the fishing activity and the abundance of small pelagic fish influenced the probability of occurrence of interactions between the common dolphin and the purse seine fishery between 2003 and 2018. The results revealed significant annual and geographic variation in the occurrence of interactions, and a significant influence of fishing effort and catch per unit effort of sardine (Sardina pilchardus). A second GAM in a hurdle model was used to model the number of common dolphins that interacted with the fishing activity as a function of fishing seasonality and the local abundance of pelagic fish. There was a significant effect of the seasonality of the fishing activity and catch per unit effort of sardine and chub mackerel (Scomber colias) on the number of common dolphins interacting with the fishery. The results of this study suggest that the probability of interactions and the number of common dolphins interacting with the fishery were affected by the local abundance of sardine and chub mackerel. As the common dolphin population appears to be increasing in the study area, the risk of by-catch also increases, thus the monitoring of the Portuguese purse seine fishery is important to inform the implementation of management plans, and also as a response to global efforts for sustainable fisheries and marine mammal conservation.

AB  - The Mahalanobis distance statistic (D(2)) has emerged as an effective tool to identify suitable habitat from presence data alone, but there has been no mechanism to select among potential habitat covariates. We propose that the best combination of explanatory variables for a D(2) model can be identified by ranking potential models based on the proportion of the entire study area that is classified as potentially suitable habitat given that a predetermined proportion of occupied locations are correctly classified. In effect, our approach seeks to minimize errors of commission, or maximize specificity, while holding the omission error rate constant. We used this approach to identify potentially suitable habitat for the Olympic marmot (Marmota olympus), a declining species endemic to Olympic National Park, Washington, USA. We compared models built with all combinations of 11 habitat variables. A 7-variable model identified 21,143 ha within the park as potentially suitable for marmots, correctly classifying 80% of occupied locations. Additional refinements to the 7-variable model (e.g., eliminating small patches) further reduced the predicted area to 18,579 ha with little reduction in predictive power. Although we sought a model that would allow field workers to find 80% of Olympic marmot locations, in fact, <3% of 376 occupied locations and <9% of abandoned locations were >100 m from habitat predicted by the final model, suggesting that >90% of occupied marmot habitat could be found by observant workers surveying predicted habitat. The model comparison procedure allowed us to identify the suite of covariates that maximized specificity of our model and, thus, limited the amount of less favorable habitat included in the final prediction area. We expect that by maximizing specificity of models built from presence-only data, our model comparison procedure will be useful to conservation practitioners planning reintroductions, searching for rare species, or identifying habitat for protection.

AB  - The second half of the 20(th) century was characterised by intense processes of urbanisation, industrialisation and agricultural mechanisation, leading to a fragmentation of the agricultural and forest landscape. This, in turn, reduced the bio-permeability of the territory and affected the dispersion of many wild species. Brown hare (Lepus europeus) dispersion is dramatically affected by habitat fragmentation, presence of predators, intense tillage and elevated hunting pressure. Consequently, the only stable populations of hare are often in no-hunting areas where wildlife management is efficient. It is necessary, therefore, to identify not only additional areas suitable for reproduction, but also the most suitable dispersion pathways for hares, in order to optimise management.
   In the present study, by means of a Geographic Information System (GIS), a deterministic hare suitability model was developed on the basis of a multicriterial approach and fuzzy logic. Subsequently, a friction surface was derived from the suitability map in order to describe the land bio-permeability. Finally, on the basis of species potential, the spread of hares from stable population areas (source areas) to the remaining territory was simulated. The area of study was the province of Viterbo (central Italy). The suitability map showed good discrimination ability (ROC=0.705). The hare dispersion simulation map allowed the potential spreading of this species throughout the provincial territory to be analysed. Isolated or less connected zones were highlighted, allowing the distribution of habitat enhancements, and/or the institution of new no-hunting areas devoted to the reproduction and consequent spread of hares throughout the territory, to be localised.
   The presented flexible and reiterable methodology could prove useful for wildlife management and hunting planning over a wide area. It would thus provide an important contribution to reducing the importance of animal translocation and favouring an increase in native resources spontaneously spreading throughout a territory. In a more general sense, this study is in accordance with the sustainable land management perspective, meeting the requirements of environmental protection, without compromising the anthropic development of non-urban areas.

AB  - AimIn the light of human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC), populations are exposed to ever-greater bioclimatic stress at the edge of a species' historic range. The distribution dynamics of European badgers (Meles meles) at their southern edge are linked tightly to climatic variability. We contribute critical data on how climatic context and local factors determine site occupancy in a northern-range population.
   LocationEleven study areas (averaging similar to 21.3km(2)) spread over similar to 50,000km(2) in Northern Scotland.
   MethodsWhile accounting for heterogeneous detectability, we applied single-season occupancy models to broad-scale camera-trapping data (168 stations) to evaluate how Autumn-Winter weather conditions interact with land-cover type (including agricultural land) and human disturbance to determine badger occupancy.
   ResultsMean minimum daily winter temperature and elevation influenced inter-site occupancy. When clustering study areas into two distinct topo-climatic types, badger occupancy was associated with agriculture in areas with lower mean minimum winter temperatures (<0.3 degrees C) at higher elevation (>246m). In areas with higher mean minimum winter temperature (>1.2 degrees C) at lower elevation (<133m), badgers selected sites further away from human infrastructures (settlements and main roads). Climatic factors and human disturbance interact in intricate, context-dependent patterns to determine badger site occupancy.
   Main ConclusionsThe UKCP09 Medium Emissions Scenario projects a winter mean minimum temperature increase of between 1 and 3 degrees C (central estimate) for Northern Scotland by the 2050s. Although warmer weather should benefit badger occupancy, this may be counteracted by up to a predicted 5% human population increase in the Scottish highlands, by 2037, which is likely to disturb badgers. We show that even in instances where species' regional responses to climate change are positive, these effects can be neutralized by other anthropogenic pressures. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence advocating that interactive effects should be taken into account when planning conservation management.

AB  - Aim: Accurate characterization of evolutionary units (species or populations) underlies all ecological and evolutionary studies and is crucial to conservation planning. Seascapes have long been thought to be highly permeable to gene flow, yet over the last decade building evidence has shown that barriers to gene flow in marine environments are much more common than previously thought. Here, we precisely characterize two barriers to gene flow in the tunicate Pyura chilensis across 26 degrees of latitude in the southeastern Pacific, assess their magnitude and explore their congruence with current biogeographical patterns of this region.
   Location: The southeastern Pacific (SEP), from Ilo, Peru (17 degrees S) to Chiloe, Chile (43 degrees S).
   Taxon: Pyura chilensis.
   Methods: We used a combination of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and a 540 bp fragment of the Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) to compare individuals sampled at 26 localities spanning approximately 2500 km of the SEP. Genetic diversity was analysed using Bayesian clustering, haplotype networks, Isolation by Distance and cline models. A Coalescent simulator was used to estimate migration rates.
   Results: The results from both the microsatellite and COI markers indicate the presence of two genetic discontinuities: one at 34 degrees S and one at 39 degrees S which coincide with genetic breaks reported for other species. Interestingly, we were able to determine that genetic transitions occur abruptly and within short geographical distances (similar to 30 km) compared with previous studies of this tunicate. Coalescent simulations indicate the 34 degrees S break is less permeable than the 39 degrees S break, and gene flow appears to be mostly from north to south.
   Main conclusions: Our results support other studies that show that seascapes are complex, and also highlight the importance of accurately sampling distribution ranges when making conclusions about gene flow. Overall, the two main biogeographical barriers to gene flow characterized in the southeastern Pacific are not homogeneously permeable and can be narrow (<30 km). These results are relevant for the management of fisheries in this region and specifically for this commercially important species.

AB  - Saltmarsh ecosystems though ecologically important are one of the least studied ecosystems in Asia. This study reviewed the published literature from 1988 to 2021 of India to assess the current status of the data deficient saltmarsh species Porterasia coarctata (Roxb.) within its distribution limits. This saltmarsh species inhabits the lower intertidal silty-sandy habitats of India's west coast and silty-clay habitats of the east coast. In the lower intertidal zone, P. coarctata is mostly associated with Myrostachia wightiana, whereas in the upper intertidal zone the highest chance of presence was for Suaeda maritima (18%) and the lowest for Cressa cretica (1%), S. fruticosa (1%) and Scirpus littoralis (1%). The deep root system of P. coarctata helps in sediment accretion and facilitates the formation of mangrove ecosystems. From this study it was evident that most of the research on P. coarctata in India was part of survey of mangrove ecosystems. In India, significant knowledge gap exists on the reproductive ecology and population trends of this species. Most importantly, the genes responsible for salinity and sub-mergence tolerance of P. coarctata are well documented, that can provide solutions for salt and submergence tolerant rice plants in coastal areas prone to sea level rise. The blue carbon storage potential of P. coarctata is higher than other saltmarsh plants, that can be leveraged as a nature-based solution for CO2 emission reductions. The ecosystem services of P. coarctata can also contribute towards achieving various sustainable development goals (SDG-1,2,6,13 and14). Coastal development, mangrove restoration and marine food provisioning are the most important drivers causing the decline of P. coarctata ecosystems across India. This study proposes a long-term coastal monitoring plan for essential conservation and management of existing P. coarctata beds and pre-venting further degradation and loss of these ecosystems. This study also showcases species-specific valuation of individual saltmarsh plants at regional scale are essential to catalogue the most efficient saltmarsh plants that can play an important role in future climate change scenarios and serve as a global model.

AB  - Brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis are native fish in decline owing to environmental changes. Predictions of their potential distribution and a better understanding of their relationship to habitat conditions would enhance the management and conservation of this valuable species. We used over 7,800 brook trout observations throughout New York State and georeferenced, multiscale landscape condition data to develop four regionally specific artificial neural network models to predict brook trout abundance in rivers and streams. Land cover data provided a general signature of human activity, but other habitat variables were resistant to anthropogenic changes (i.e., changing on a geological time scale). The resulting models predict the potential for any stream to support brook trout. The models were validated by holding 20% of the data out as a test set and by comparison with additional field collections from a variety of habitat types. The models performed well, explaining more than 90% of data variability. Errors were often associated with small spatial displacements of predicted values. When compared with the additional field collections (39 sites), 92% of the predictions were off by only a single class from the field-observed abundances. Among "least-disturbed" field collection sites, all predictions were correct or off by a single abundance class, except for one where brown trout Salmo trutta were present. Other degrading factors were evident at most sites where brook trout were absent or less abundant than predicted. The most important habitat variables included landscape slope, stream and drainage network sizes, water temperature, and extent of forest cover. Predicted brook trout abundances were applied to all New York streams, providing a synoptic map of the distribution of brook trout habitat potential. These fish models set benchmarks of best potential for streams to support brook trout under broad-scale human influences and can assist with planning and identification of protection or rehabilitation sites.

AB  - The ocean floor, its species and habitats are under pressure from various human activities. Marine spatial planning and nature conservation aim to address these threats but require sufficiently detailed and accurate maps of the distribution of seabed substrates and habitats. Benthic habitat mapping has markedly evolved as a discipline over the last decade, but important challenges remain. To test the adequacy of current data products and classification approaches, we carried out a comparative study based on a common dataset of multibeam echosounder bathymetry and backscatter data, supplemented with groundtruth observations. The task was to predict the spatial distribution of five substrate classes (coarse sediments, mixed sediments, mud, sand, and rock) in a highly heterogeneous area of the south-western continental shelf of the United Kingdom. Five different supervised classification methods were employed, and their accuracy estimated with a set of samples that were withheld. We found that all methods achieved overall accuracies of around 50%. Errors of commission and omission were acceptable for rocky substrates, but high for all sediment types. We predominantly attribute the low map accuracy regardless of mapping approach to inadequacies of the selected classification system, which is required to fit gradually changing substrate types into a rigid scheme, low discriminatory power of the available predictors, and high spatial complexity of the site relative to the positioning accuracy of the groundtruth equipment. Some of these issues might be alleviated by creating an ensemble map that aggregates the individual outputs into one map showing the modal substrate class and its associated confidence or by adopting a quantitative approach that models the spatial distribution of sediment fractions. We conclude that further incremental improvements to the collection, processing and analysis of remote sensing and sample data are required to improve map accuracy. To assess the progress in benthic habitat mapping we propose the creation of benchmark datasets.

AB  - Aim Creating a network of marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean requires extensive knowledge on species' abundances, distributions and population trends especially in the Weddell Sea where year-round pack ice makes most of the Weddell Sea inaccessible. We combine satellite images and citizen science to model habitat suitability for crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) throughout the Weddell Sea. Location Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Methods High-resolution satellite images covering 18,219 km(2)of the Weddell Sea during crabeater seal breeding season (October-November) were hosted on the crowd-sourcing platform Tomnod (DigitalGlobe). Citizen scientists marked "maps" where seals were present/absent and these votes were compared with the votes of an experienced observer. Correction factors were used to correct votes to either a continuous probability of seal presence, or a binary seal presence/absence value. We modelled probability of seal presence using ensemble models of Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and used fitted Maxent models to model seal presence/absence data. Results Model predictive power was low (RF:R-2 = 0.076 +/- 0.002: BRT:R-2 = 0.086 +/- 0.0008; SVM:R-2 = 0.082 +/- 0.003) to average (Maxent: AUC = 0.71 +/- 0.004). Distance to the ice edge and bathymetry were the most important variables that influenced crabeater seal distribution. Main conclusions Crabeater seals were more likely to be present over abyssal water, which coincides with typical adult Antarctic krill habitat - crabeater seal preferred prey. Where ice concentrations were more variable, that is more accessible, crabeater seals were also more likely to occur. Results agreed with the known ecology of crabeaters seals and the abundance, distribution and ecology of Antarctic krill. We were able to survey the largest area ever surveyed in the Weddell Sea and provide a model to assist furthering policy around the proposed protected area.

AB  - Presence-absence data of benthic macro-invertebrates and associated habitat (i.e., sediment type and depth) were collected using a towed camera sled in selected areas along the coast off southern California. Using this information, we developed generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict the probability of occurrence of five commonly observed taxa (cup corals, hydroids, short and tall sea pens, and brittle stars in the sediment) within the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC). We employed a utility-based approach to validate the models and to identify optimal cutoff thresholds for the GLM predictions, given a relative cost of false negatives and false positives. We present optimal cutoff values under a range of cost ratios. Out-of-sample predictive accuracy, assuming equal costs of false negatives and false positives, ranged from 75% to 89%. Estimated area under the characteristic curve (AUC) in our models ranged from 0.76 for brittle stars in sediment to 0.91 for cup corals. An AUC value above 0.7 is an acceptable level of performance, between 0.8 and 0.9 is excellent, and above 0.9 is outstanding. We developed predictive maps of probability of occurrence using our validated models and a seafloor character map based on fine-scale (2-5 m) data. Cup corals and hydroids had high predicted probabilities of occurrence in areas of hard substrata, while short and tall sea pens were predicted to occur in parts of the SBC that had unconsolidated and mixed sediment. Our model predicted that brittle stars would occur throughout the entire channel on various bottom types. The combination of high-resolution seafloor character maps and predictive models of invertebrate distributions will aid managers in identifying habitats of particular concern and areas with vulnerable, deep-sea corals. Our models will be useful for marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management, as well as for assessing the effectiveness of essential fish habitat closures and other marine protected areas.

AB  - Both water managers and researchers have the same goal when it comes to fish conservation, namely, to sustain, to improve or to restore aquatic habitat. To this aim, two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic models have been widely used in aquatic habitat studies because they simulate flow with high accuracy and can predict habitat dynamics. The River2D model is able to integrate the habitat suitability curves for fish life stages with the simulated depth and velocity fields and the riverbed characteristics of substrate and cover, thereby estimating the corresponding weighted usable area, and thus predicting the potential distribution of fish species in the river. However, little is known about the in situ variability associated with such predictions both for hydraulic and biological data, whereas ecological responses are known to be driven by variability. Moreover, when calculating habitat availability, differences can be found by considering in the weighted usable area formulation substrate or cover or even both. To test the level of predictive accuracy of hydraulic and biological simulations, we modelled the habitat use by two fish species, the Iberian barbel Luciobarbus bocagei and the Iberian straight-mouth nase Pseudochondrostoma polylepis, according to their requirements for depth, velocity, substrate and cover and then compared measured and simulated hydraulic and biological outcomes using the River2D model. Results indicate that 2D simulation depends on data collection, especially the density and location of bed topography points. Substantial differences were found in the biological responses. Results may differ when choosing different habitat availability variables. Similarly, habitat use may also be influenced by other biotic and abiotic interactions occurring in ecosystems, and restoration planning should be aware of such variability.

AB  - Plecturocebus ornatus is an endemic vulnerable species due to its population decline and its restricted range within the Eastern Plains of Colombia. This region is affected by deforestation as a result of legal and illegal economic activities. The aim of this work was to analyze the presence and abundance of P. ornatus during a period of urban and livestock production expansion (1986-2019) in Villavicencio, Colombia. This municipality is the most affected by land-use changes associated with regional economic development and represents 3.4 % of P. ornatus distribution???s area. The analysis was performed using satellite images Landsat 4 and 8, with V-Late in ArcGIS 10.5 to describe landscape structure, and P. ornatus occurrence records, obtained through field observations and the Global Biological Information Facility. Densities were calculated for each fragment based on total individuals observed by transect. A generalized lineal model was used to evaluate the effects of patch-scale, landscape-scale and other variables on P. ornatus abundance. By 1986 the rural and peri-urban areas of Villavicencio were already a transformed landscape. During the analyzed period, landscape was predominantly made up of disconnected linear fragments with a secondary humid forest cover. Around 82.1 % of the fragments with P. ornatus records are threatened by urbanization and only 50 % are in protected areas. Densities varied from 0.00 to 7.26 ind/ha (0.00???726.82 ind/km2). Abundance of P. ornatus was highly influenced by landscape-scale variables related with landscape connectivity, as well as fragment area and number of other primate species. Therefore, the implementation of restoration measures that increase landscape connectivity and habitat availability is proposed, as well as more control over environmental land-use planning, to contribute to the conservation of P. ornatus in urban areas.

AB  - The northeastern United States was previously identified under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) as a potential location for restoration of a population of the endangered eastern timber wolf or gray wolf (Canis lupus). The gray wolf has been protected under the ESA since 1974. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a logistic regression model based on regional road abundance to estimate that the Northeastern states from Upstate New York to Maine contain >77,000 km(2) of habitat suitable for wolves. Using current habitat distribution and available ungulate prey (deer and moose), we estimate the area is capable of sustaining a population of approximately 1,312 wolves (90% CI = 816-1,809). This estimate is equivalent to new, much higher potentials estimated for northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan, where wolves are rapidly recovering in the U.S. Midwest. Potential wolf densities vary from a low of <12/1,000 km(2) in the Adirondack Region of Upstate New York, where prey densities are lowest, to 20-25/1,000 km(2) in northern Maine and New Hampshire. A contiguous area of favorable habitat from Maine to northeastern Vermont (>53,500 km(2)) is capable of supporting approximately 1,070 wolves (90% CI = 702-1,439). Such large areas are increasingly rare and important for wolf recovery if populations large enough to have long-term evolutionary viability are to be maintained within the United States. However, large-scale restoration of a top carnivore like the wolf has other consequences for overall forest biodiversity in eastern forests because wolf recovery is dependent on high levels of ungulate prey, which in turn have other negative effects on the ecosystem. In the United States, planning for wolf restoration in the Northeast should take advantage of experience elsewhere, especially the upper Midwest.

AB  - The integration of biodiversity knowledge with management needs in coastal protected ecosystems is a current challenge that requires a social-ecological perspective, especially in view of the current scenario regarding climate changes. At the southeastern Brazil, estuaries inside protected areas highlight as a great source of ecosystem services connected to the biodiversity, such as the food provisioning for local communities (i.e. fishery supply). However, climate change models considering the last four decades alert to an annual rainfall increase in the region, threatening the estuarine biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services. Here, we evaluated how estuarine macrofaunal distribution could be used as ecological indicators to support the stakeholders management needs in subtropical Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The intertidal macrofauna distribution was assessed along physical gradients in estuaries within MPAs of the southeastern Brazil, testing the effects of salinity and sediment properties on taxa richness. Then, implications of these ecological findings were discussed with the local users and managers of the MPAs, aiming to stipulate indicators and management proposals considering the rainfall increase predicted for the region. We found that macrofauna community varied between estuarine zones along the physical gradients. High values of mud and organic content in the sediment were correlated with reduced taxa richness in the upper estuarine zone, indicating high vulnerability of biodiversity to a possible estuarine mud input connected to the expected rainfall increase. Stakeholders noted that this knowledge could assist with spatial planning for an adaptive management of the biodiversity use rules on the MPAs, with focus on the ecosystem services conservation (ecosystem-based management). Stakeholders suggested using biodiversity hotspots to guide estuarine areas classification (no-take zones and sustainable use zones), maintaining the resources use rules adaptable according to the biodiversity changes. In this regard, our data revealed important bioindicators, such as the macrofaunal richness, which can be monitored as "early signals" to assess eventual ecosystem alterations related to the climate changes. These signals can include loss in taxa richness, extirpation of species exclusively found on the lower estuarine zone (sensitives to mud input) and changes in the distribution or abundance of dominant taxa. We suggest that understanding the relationships between macrofaunal indicators and ecosystems services, associated with continuous monitoring, are the key steps to implementing an adaptive ecosystem-based management of these protected estuaries in the current changing scenario, contributing to decision making at local scale that respond to global challenges, as the UN Ocean Decade.

AB  - Brackish water coastal lagoons are least understood with respect to the seasonal and temporal variability in their sedimentary bacterial communities. These coastal lagoons are characterized by the steep environmental gradient and provide an excellent model system to decipher the biotic and abiotic factors that determine the bacterial community structure over time and space. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes from a total of 100 bulk surface sediments, we investigated the sedimentary bacterial communities, their spatiotemporal distribution, and compared them with the rhizosphere sediment communities of a common reed; Phragmites karka and a native seagrass species; Halodule uninervis in Chilika Lagoon. Spatiotemporal patterns in bacterial communities were linked to specific biotic factors (e.g., presence and type of macrophyte) and abiotic factors (e.g., salinity) that drove the community composition. Comparative assessment of communities highlighted bacterial lineages that were responsible for segregating the sediment communities over distinct salinity regimes, seasons, locations, and presence and type of macrophytes. Several bacterial taxa were specific to one of these ecological factors suggesting that species-sorting processes drive specific biogeographical patterns in the bacterial populations. Modeling of proteobacterial lineages against salinity gradient revealed that alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria increased with salinity, whereas beta-Proteobacteria displayed the opposite trend. The wide variety of biogeochemical functions performed by the rhizosphere microbiota of P. karka must be taken into consideration while formulating the management and conservation plan for this reed. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics and functionality of sedimentary bacterial communities and highlighted the role of biotic and abiotic factors in generating the biogeographical patterns in the bacterial communities of a tropical brackish water coastal lagoon.

AB  - More than 18 million seabirds nest on 58 Pacific islands protected within vast U.S. Marine National Monuments (1.9 million km(2)). However, most of these seabird colonies are on low-elevation islands and sea-level rise (SLR) and accompanying high-water perturbations are predicted to escalate with climate change. To understand how SLR may impact protected islands and insular biodiversity, we modeled inundation and wave-driven flooding of a globally important seabird rookery in the subtropical Pacific. We acquired new high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and used the Delft3D wave model and ArcGIS to model wave heights and inundation for a range of SLR scenarios (+0.5, +1.0, +1.5, and +2.0 m) at Midway Atoll. Next, we classified vegetation to delineate habitat exposure to inundation and identified how breeding phenology, colony synchrony, and life history traits affect species-specific sensitivity. We identified 3 of 13 species as highly vulnerable to SLR in the Hawaiian Islands and quantified their atoll-wide distribution (Laysan albatross, Phoebastria immutabilis; black-footed albatross, P. nigripes; and Bonin petrel, Pterodroma hypoleuca). Our models of wave-driven flooding forecast nest losses up to 10% greater than passive inundation models at +1.0 m SLR. At projections of +2.0 m SLR, approximately 60% of albatross and 44% of Bonin petrel nests were overwashed displacing more than 616,400 breeding albatrosses and petrels. Habitat loss due to passive SLR may decrease the carrying capacity of some islands to support seabird colonies, while sudden high-water events directly reduce survival and reproduction. This is the first study to simulate wave-driven flooding and the combined impacts of SLR, groundwater rise, and storm waves on seabird colonies. Our results highlight the need for early climate change planning and restoration of higher elevation seabird refugia to prevent low-lying protected islands from becoming ecological traps in the face of rising sea levels.

AB  - Management and conservation strategies for endangered species require information on their temporal and spatial behavioral and habitat use relationships. We evaluated activity patterns and resource selection of black bears in northwestern Mexico. We surveyed 29 localities with 1450 camera traps stations from 2009 to 2013 in the states of Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico. In each locality, we calculated the proportion of diurnal, nocturnal, and crepuscular activity through a kernel density estimator based on the time of independent photographic events, and we built a beta regression between diurnal density and annual temperature, seasonal rainfall (SR), human density, road density, daylight hours, season, and management type. To evaluate resource selection, we built a binomial logistic regression model incorporating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), mean and coefficient of variation of annual temperature, human population density (PD), terrain roughness, and season. Black bear activity was primarily diurnal with a bimodal tendency around sunrise and sunset. Diurnal activity (between sunrise and sunset) was positively influenced by daylight hours, SR, and private reserves and negatively influenced by anthropogenic factors. Resource selection was positively influenced by the coefficient of variation in temperature and NDVI and negatively associated with average annual temperature, PD, and terrain roughness. Activity patterns and resource use were similar to other regions in North America. However, temperature was one of the main factors influencing black bear activity and resource selection in our study areas and should be considered when developing management plans given projected increases in temperature expected under climate change scenarios. We present the first work of its kind for northwestern Mexico and considered it as an important component in future survey and management protocols for the species in the southern portion of its distribution.

AB  - Framework-forming scleractinian (FFS) corals provide structurally complex habitats to support abundant and diverse benthic communities but are vulnerable to environmental changes and anthropogenic disturbances. Scientific modeling of suitable habitat provides important insights into the impact of the environmental conditions and fills the gap in the knowledge on habitat suitability. This study presents predictive habitat suitability modeling for deep-sea (depth > 50 in) FFS corals in the GoM. We first conducted a nonparametric estimate of the observed coral point process intensity as a function of each numeric environmental variable. Next, we performed species distribution modeling (SDM) using an assemble of four machine learning models - maximum entropy (ME), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN). We found that most important variables controlling the coral distribution are super-dominant gravel and rock substrata. SW and SE aspects, slope steepness, salinity, depth, temperature, acidity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a. Highly suitable habitats are predicted to be on the continental slope off Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi and the shelf and slope of the West Florida Escarpment. All the four models have outstanding prediction performances with AUC values over 095. DNN model performs best (AUC - 0987). The study contributes to coral habitat modeling research by presenting unique methods induding nonparametric function of coral point process intensity. DNN and SVM models that have not been used in coral SDM, post-classification model assembling, and percentile approach to determine a threshold value for classifying a suitability score map into a binary map. Our findings would help support conservation prioritization, management and planning, and guide new field exploration. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of environmental factors on the distribution and persistence of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) is pertinent to policy makers and managers to formulate balanced plans for different land-use types. The study focuses on movement of elephants and how they utilize foraging areas in Sioma Ngwezi landscape in Zambia by answering the following questions: (1) Which environmental variables and land-cover class predict the movement of elephants during the wet season in Sioma Ngwezi landscape? (2) What is the wet season suitable habitat for elephants in Sioma Ngwezi landscape? (3) What are the major wet season movement corridors for elephants in Sioma Ngwezi landscape? We used GPS telemetry data from the collared elephants to assess habitat connectivity. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and linkage mapper were the tools used to predict habitat suitability, movement corridors, and barriers in the landscape during the wet season. The study identified elevation, land cover, and NDVI as the most important environmental predictors that modify the dispersal of elephants in the landscape during the wet season. Additionally, a total of 36 potential wet season corridors were identified connecting 15 core areas mainly used for foraging and protection from poachers in the landscape. Of these, 24 corridors were highly utilized and are suggested as priority corridors for elephant movement in the landscape. The identified wet season habitats and functional corridors may help to combat elephant poaching by patrolling areas with high relative probability of elephant presence. The findings may also help abate human-elephant conflict such as crop-raiding by managing identified corridors that run into agriculture zones in the game management area.

AB  - Seabird populations breeding in the UK Overseas Territories remain relatively understudied compared to UK seabird populations, despite their international importance. Here we present results from one of the first seabird tracking studies in the Caribbean region, of Brown Boobies Sula leucogaster breeding on the Important Bird Area (IBA) of Dog Island, Anguilla. Birds were tracked for 5-7 days during the chick-rearing period using GPS data loggers. We assess how representative the at-sea areas of use (utilisation distributions) identified from our sample of 16 birds are likely to be of those of the whole breeding colony, and examined the effect that grid cell size used in the 'time-in-area' analytical approach has on these predictions. We also assess the effectiveness of the BirdLife International's seaward extension approach to marine IBA designation, where terrestrial IBAs are buffered a set distance using existing information on the foraging radii of the same or similar breeding species. Foraging trips were 125.3 +/- 54.4 (SD) km long and lasted for 5.6 +/- 1.95 hrs on average. Birds travelled into the waters of four neighbouring territories; Saint Martin, Saba, Saint Eustatius and Saint Barthelemy. Our models suggest that many more individuals would need to be tracked to fully identify important at-sea areas for this colony, although this depends on the scale that important areas are defined. Whilst a smaller grid cell size may be necessary for assessing fine-scale habitat use, a larger grid cell size may be more appropriate for marine spatial planning processes. Although the BirdLife Seaward extension approach using maximum foraging distance recorded from Brown Boobies at a Mexican colony predicted a smaller foraging area than that used by Dog Island birds this approach still incorporated at least 99% of their 50% UD, 98% of their 75% UD and 86% of the 95% UD.

AB  - Predicting and modeling of habitat preferences of fish is a very important issue for aquatic management. Classification trees (CTs) were used to predict the habitat preferences of the Caspian kutum (Rutilus frisii kutum, hereafter kutum) in the southern Caspian Sea. The applied model was optimized with genetic algorithm (GA) and greedy stepwise (GS) to select the most explanatory variables for predicting the presence/absence of kutum. The suitability index was considered to determine the quality and suitability of fish habitat in the sea. The results of Paired Student's t tests showed that there was a significant difference between predictive performances of models before and after variable selection methods. Both optimizers improved the predictive power of CTs and resulted in a better understanding of CTs by making a selection of the sea characteristics that were used as inputs to the models. The results show that the effect of different seasons, sea depth, and photosyntheticaly active radiation were the main predictors affecting the habitat preferences of kutum in the Caspian Sea. Constructed trees in combination with GA and GS showed high capability when applied to predict the habitat preferences of this valuable commercial fish species. Determining the habitat needs of the target fish will enhance local fisheries performances and the long-term conservation planning of the fish to implement the ecosystem-based management in the Caspian Sea.

AB  - Effective conservation planning of globally endangered tigers (Panthera tigris) requires a good understanding of their population dynamics. Territoriality, an essential characteristic of many wildlife species, plays a crucial role in the population dynamics of tigers. However, previous models of tiger population dynamics have not adequately incorporated territoriality. We therefore developed and implemented a spatially explicit agent-based model of tiger population dynamics shaped by different territorial behaviors of males and females. To allow for predictions to new conditions, for which no data exist, territories are not imposed but emerge from the tigers' perception of habitat quality and from their interactions with each other. Tiger population dynamics is deduced from merging territory dynamics with observed demographic rates. We apply the model to Nepal's Chitwan National Park, part of a global biodiversity hotspot and home to a large (similar to 125) population of tigers. Our model matched closely with observed patterns of the real tiger population in the park, including reproduction, mortality, dispersal, resource selection, male and female land tenure, territory size and spatial distribution, and tiger population size and age structure. The ultimate purpose of the model, which will be presented in follow-up work, is to explore human-tiger interactions and assess threats to tiger populations across contexts and scales. The model can thus be used to better inform decision makers on how to conserve tigers under uncertain and changing future conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Acid grasslands are threatened both by agricultural intensification with nutrient addition and increased livestock densities as well as by land abandonment. In order to understand and quantify the effect of selected environmental and land-use factors on the observed variation and changes in the vegetation of acid grasslands, large-scale spatial and temporal pin-point plant cover monitoring data are fitted in a structural equation model. The important sources of measurement and sampling uncertainties have been included using a hierarchical model structure. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with the measurement and sampling are separated from the process uncertainty, which is important when generating ecological predictions that may feed into local conservation management decisions. Generally, increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition led to more grass-dominated acid grassland habitats at the expense of the cover of forbs. Sandy soils were relatively more acidic, and the effects of soil type on the vegetation include both direct effects of soil type and indirect effects mediated by the effect of soil type on soil pH. Both soil type and soil pH affected the vegetation of acid grasslands. Even though only a relatively small proportion of the temporal variation in cover was explained by the model, it would still be useful to quantify the uncertainties when using the model for generating local ecological predictions and adaptive management plans.

AB  - Multifunctional forest management is a common topic and hotspot of forestry research in recent years. Evaluating the suitability of forest land for multifunctional management is the first and most important step for realizing sustainable and multifunctional forest management. This research aims to explore the suitability and forest dominant function evaluation model for multifunctional forestry management in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. Using the model proposed in the paper, we expect to provide decision-making information for forest multifunctional management. The study incorporated the distance of the ridge lines extracted by the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data into the evaluation index, and established the ecological status index (IE) and the forest productivity index (IF). Moreover, a nonlinear multifunctional site quality evaluation model (MSQEM) was constructed to evaluate the suitability of multifunctional forest management. A multifunctional management dominant function orientation model (MDFOM) was constructed by Principal Component Analysis, and divided each subcompartment into one of the four resource subgroups, such as timber production function, water conservation function, water and soil conservation function, and other functions. The MDFOM model was used for Rongshui County's forest resource by 11 factors, which were selected because of their easy availability. The factors contain slope, soil thickness, altitude, average age, etc. The results showed that the number of small classes with multifunctional site index larger than 0.5 was 20,841 (56.87%), and the multifunctional suitable area was in clustered distribution, which was consistent with the reality. The result of subcompartment dominant function evaluated by MDFOM was compared with the planning forest species, the overall accuracy was 61%, and the accuracy rate of timber production function was 94.2%. The number of subcompartments with good and above multifunctional management status was 9174 (44.20%), with an area of 48,963.41 hm(2) (51.24%). The multifunctional management status of subcompartments in the study area is at the middle and lower level. Thus, it is urgent to further improve the multi-functional management level of each subcompartment in this area and formulate scientific reasonable and multifunctional forestation measures.

AB  - The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) contains numerous depressional wetlands known as potholes that provide habitats for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species. Mapping these wetlands is essential for identifying viable waterfowl habitat and conservation planning scenarios, yet it is a challenging task due to the small size of the potholes, and the presence of emergent vegetation. This study develops an open-source process within the Google Earth Engine platform for mapping the spatial distribution of wetlands through the integration of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data with high-resolution (10-m) Sentinel-2 bands. We used two machine-learning algorithms (random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM)) to identify wetlands across the study area through supervised classification of the multisensor composite. We trained the algorithms with ground truth data provided through field studies and aerial photography. The accuracy was assessed by comparing the predicted and actual wetland and non-wetland classes using statistical coefficients (overall accuracy, Kappa, sensitivity, and specificity). For this purpose, we used four different out-of-sample test subsets, including the same year, next year, small vegetated, and small non-vegetated test sets to evaluate the methods on different spatial and temporal scales. The results were also compared to Landsat-derived JRC surface water products, and the Sentinel-2-derived normalized difference water index (NDWI). The wetlands derived from the RF model (overall accuracy 0.76 to 0.95) yielded favorable results, and outperformed the SVM, NDWI, and JRC products in all four testing subsets. To provide a further characterization of the potholes, the water bodies were stratified based on the presence of emergent vegetation using Sentinel-2-derived NDVI, and, after excluding permanent water bodies, using the JRC surface water product. The algorithm presented in the study is scalable and can be adopted for identifying wetlands in other regions of the world.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation, which affects many native salmonid species, is one of the major factors contributing to the declines in distribution and abundance of Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus. Increasingly, managers are considering options to maintain and enhance the persistence of isolated local populations through active management strategies. Understanding the ecological consequences of such actions is a necessary step in conservation planning. We used an individual-based model to evaluate the consequences of an ongoing management program aimed at mitigating the anthropogenic fragmentation of the lower Clark Fork River in Montana. Under this program juvenile Bull Trout are trapped and transported from small, headwater source populations to Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, for rearing, and adults are subsequently recaptured in their upstream migration and returned to the natal population for spawning. We examined one of these populations and integrated empirical estimates of demographic parameters to simulate different management scenarios where moderate (n = 4) and high (n = 8) numbers of age-2, age-3, or age-4 Bull Trout were removed for transport with variable return rates under both demographic stochasticity and environmental perturbations. Our results indicated the risks from removal with no returns increased substantially when removal totals and age of Bull Trout removed from the simulated population increased. Specifically, removing eight age-3 or age-4 individuals resulted in 26% and 62% reductions in average adult population size, respectively, across simulations. We found the risks of transport were not likely alleviated with low (3%) or moderate (6%) return rates, and there were considerable risks of declines for the source population even when return rates were extremely high (>12%). Our simulations indicated little risk of declines for the source population with removals of age-2 Bull Trout, and any risks were alleviated with low return rates. However, we found higher return rates were particularly beneficial in the presence of large, density-independent perturbations.

AB  - The road-effect zone is the area in which ecological effects extend outward from a road. Dispersed off-highway vehicle (OHV; e. g., four-wheelers and snowmachines) activity on rural road networks creates a disturbance that reduces the effective amount of wildlife habitat and therefore has the potential for an extensive road-effect zone. Consequently, land managers must consider the trade-offs between rural road development and the conservation of habitat for species of concern. We conducted a spatially-explicit study of moose, Alces alces, occurrence in relation to rural roads and OHV routes in rural Alaska, U. S. A. We used logistic regression and AIC model selection criterion to develop resource selection functions (RSFs) for male and female moose at three spatial scales (250 m, 500 m, and 1000 m) in two seasons (summer and fall). To evaluate an ecological disturbance threshold from increasing route activity on the probability of animal occurrence, the RSFs were plotted against an index of route activity derived from interviews with OHV users, and fit with logarithmic functions. The variable for route activity improved the fit of RSF models for both sexes at all spatial scales and in both seasons. A negative relationship was found between moose occurrence and routes or areas in which routes were in close proximity to primary forage, with the exception of male moose at the 1000-m scale in the fall. Therefore, among the spatial scales of analysis, the road-effect zone for male moose was determined to be between 500 m and 1000 m, and >1000 m for female moose. Furthermore, route activity <0.25 km of vehicle travel/km(2)/day was a threshold value at which moose sustained a high probability of occurrence (0.60 to 0.91). The results of our study suggest that the dispersed ecological effect of rural roads and OHV routes should be considered in transportation and land-management planning efforts. Relatively low levels of vehicular activity may create extensive road-effect zones for sensitive species.

AB  - P>1. Spatially explicit understanding of the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (ES) from global to local scales is currently limited. New studies analysing the simultaneous provision of multiple services at landscape scale should aid the understanding of multiple ES delivery and trade-offs to support policy, management and land planning.
   2. Here, we propose a new approach for the analysis, mapping and understanding of multiple ES delivery in landscapes. Spatially explicit single ES models based on plant traits and abiotic characteristics are combined to identify 'hot' and 'cold' spots of multiple ES delivery, and the land use and biotic determinants of such distributions. We demonstrate the value of this trait-based approach as compared to a pure land-use approach for a pastoral landscape from the central French Alps, and highlight how it improves understanding of ecological constraints to, and opportunities for, the delivery of multiple services.
   3. Vegetative height and leaf traits such as leaf dry matter content were response traits strongly influenced by land use and abiotic environment, with follow-on effects on several ecosystem properties, and could therefore be used as functional markers of ES.
   4. Patterns of association among ES were related to the dominant traits underlying different ecosystem properties. The functional decoupling between height and leaf traits provided alternative pathways for high agronomic value, as well as determining hot and cold spots of ES. Traditional land uses such as organic fertilization and mowing or altitude summer grazing were also linked with ES hot spots, because functional characteristics supporting fodder production and quality are compatible with species and functional diversity.
   5. Synthesis. Analyses of ES using plant functional variation across landscapes are a powerful approach to understanding the fundamental ecological mechanisms underlying ES provision, and trade-offs or synergies among services. Sustainable management of species and functionally diverse grassland could simultaneously aim at conserving biodiversity and locally important ES by taking advantage of correlations and trade-offs among different plant functional traits.

AB  - The conversion of natural lands to developed uses poses a great threat to global terrestrial biodiversity. Natural resource managers, tasked with managing wildlife as a public trust, require techniques for predicting how much and where wildlife habitat is likely to be converted in the future. Here, we develop a methodology to estimate the "social carrying capacity for development" - SKd - for 251 towns across the state of Vermont, USA. SKd represents town residents' minimum acceptable human population size and level of development within town boundaries. To estimate SKd across towns within the state of Vermont (USA), as well as the average state-wide SKd, we administered a visual preference survey (n = 1505 responses) to Vermont residents, and asked respondents to rate alternative landuse scenarios in a fictional Vermont town on a scale of +4 (highly acceptable) to -4 (highly unacceptable). We additionally collected demographic data such as age and income, as well as ancillary information such as participation in town-planning meetings and location of residence. We used model selection and AIC to fit a cubic function to the response data, allowing us to estimate SKd at a town scale based on town demographic characteristics. On average, Vermonters had a SKd of 9.1% development on the landscape; this estimate is 68% higher than year 2000 levels for development (5.4%). Respondents indicated that management action to curb development was appropriate at 9.4% development (roughly the statewide SKd average). Management by local, regional, and state levels were considered acceptable for curbing development while federal level management of development was considered unacceptable. Given a scenario where development levels were at SKd, we predicted a 16,753 km(2) reduction in forested land (-11.16%) and a 1038 km(2) reduction in farmland (-60.45%). Such changes would dramatically alter biodiversity patterns state-wide. In a companion paper, we estimate how these changes would affect the distribution of wildlife species.

AB  - Accurate estimates of the quality and quantity of remnant habitats is critical for planning management activities for the conservation of threatened species. Although habitat quality usually is understood from a multidimensional niche space approach, the availability of foraging substrates can be a suitable and more proximate index of habitat quality for species with specialized habitat requirements, like woodpeckers that feed almost exclusively on larvae of wood-boring beetles in the trunks and branches of infested trees. Recent approaches use simple mathematical algorithms on spectral bands called Vegetation Indices (VI) to identify infestations, providing a new opportunity to assess habitat quality for woodpeckers. In this paper, we tested the ability of 102 VI to estimate tree attributes explaining habitat quality for Magellanic woodpeckers for its usage as a reliable foraging habitat quality estimator. We hypothesized that space use of Magellanic woodpeckers is positively associated with the spatial distribution of decayed trees in the landscape. We developed a methodological framework based on high-resolution, multispectral imagery with three basic steps. First, we mapped individual Nothofagus trees based on estimates of species composition from a supervised classification procedure, VI estimates and image segmentation. Second, we selected the best VI predicting the tree quality for Magellanic woodpeckers. Third, we tested these habitat quality predictors, the species composition and tree age, by using two Synoptic Models of Space Use (SMSU) of Magellanic woodpeckers based on very high-frequency (VHF) radio-telemetry and global positioning system (GPS) telemetry data.
   Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) showed that the VI that best predicted habitat quality at the tree-scale was the Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI, computed as [Red-Blue]/Red-edge), included in almost all the most parsimonious models. The most parsimonious SMSU included only PSRI as an independent covariate, with a strong positive relation. Although coefficient differences were found between telemetry data (VHF vs. GPS data) both showed a positive overall response. Consequently, Red-edge based PSRI can be considered a reliable estimator of tree-scale foraging habitat quality at landscape extents for future research and management activities including Magellanic woodpeckers living on heterogeneous Nothofagus forests.

AB  - The conservation and management of species-at-risk requires periodically collecting information about their distributions and abundances. A comprehensive monitoring plan should, in addition to monitoring the population itself, also assess the status of habitat elements that are key factors in species survival. Places where animals seek safe and secure places to rest are such key habitat elements. We used previously published models to predict resting habitat for fishers (Pekania pennanti) throughout much of their range in California. Unique to this work is that the two models (northwestern California and southern Sierra Nevada) were developed using, as predictors, variables directly from a national plot-based forest inventory program called Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA). Using these models, relative resting habitat suitability can be estimated at each geographically relevant plot in the FIA system every time the plot is resampled. We applied these predictive models to data collected at 3 time periods over an approximately 20 year period to evaluate the trend in predicted fisher resting habitat. None of the 8 national forests, 4 in the northwestern California region and 4 in the southern Sierra Nevada region nor either of these 2 regions as a whole exhibited trends in predicted resting habitat suitability that were significantly increasing or decreasing. Predicted resting habitat suitability tended to be lower on private land than public land, in both regions. As expected, plots that were disturbed by fire exhibited a decrease in resting habitat suitability but, surprisingly, the few plots within harvest unit boundaries had indistinguishable values before and approximately 7 years after the harvest. Using FIA data for future assessments of habitat value will avoid the significant cost incurred when the data need to be collected repeatedly using different data and a field protocol that may vary. We anticipate that the FIA program will continue to be the preeminent plot-based vegetation survey in the United States, and the data to run the resting habitat models will be available every 10 years. Moreover, access to routinely updated plot-based data provides the only way we can envision sampling something as fine-scaled as resting habitat over thousands of square miles of potentially suitable habitat. We hope our example encourages others to parlay the FIA data into a predictive model of fine-scale habitat features that is relevant to other species. Demonstrating the utility of our models should also encourage managers to use the predictions to evaluate the status of fisher habitat in California.

AB  - Vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) are one of the most widely distributed non-human primate species found in South Africa. They occur across all the South African provinces, inhabiting a large variety of habitats. These habitats vary sufficiently that it can be assumed that various factors such as pathogen diversity could influence populations in different ways. In turn, these factors could lead to varied levels of selection at specific fitness linked loci. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) gene family, which play an integral role in vertebrate innate immunity, is a group of fitness linked loci which has been the focus of much research. In this study, we assessed the level of genetic variation at partial sequences of two TLR loci (TLR4 and 7) and a reproductively linked gene, acrosin (ACR), across the different habitat types within the vervet monkey distribution range. Gene variation and selection estimates were also made among 11-21 primate species. Low levels of genetic variation for all three gene regions were observed within vervet monkeys, with only two polymorphic sites identified for TLR4, three sites for TLR7 and one site for ACR. TLR7 variation was positively correlated with high mean annual rainfall, which was linked to increased pathogen abundance. The observed genetic variation at TLR4 might have been influenced by numerous factors including pathogens and climatic conditions. The ACR exonic regions showed no variation in vervet monkeys, which could point to the occurrence of a selective sweep. The TLR4 and TLR7 results for the among primate analyses was mostly in line with previous studies, indicating a higher rate of evolution for TLR4. Within primates, ACR coding regions also showed signs of positive selection, which was congruent with previous reports on mammals. Important additional information to the already existing vervet monkey knowledge base was gained from this study, which can guide future research projects on this highly researched taxon as well as help conservation agencies with future management planning involving possible translocations of this species.

AB  - Limber pine (Anus flexilis), an understudied tree species important to montane and subalpine ecosystems, is listed as endangered in Alberta. Dispersal of seeds to newly disturbed, open areas by Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) is expected to facilitate post-disturbance establishment of limber pine. Prescribed burning has thus been proposed as a tool to stimulate natural regeneration, but no studies have yet surveyed limber pine's regenerative response to disturbance at the northernmost extent of its range. We examined post-fire regeneration in one prescribed burn and one wildfire at the northern edge of limber pine's distribution and compared this to a regeneration baseline of plots in nearby unburned limber pine acting as seed sources to the bums. Using a likelihood-based approach, we then compared hypotheses of ecological processes influencing seedling occurrence and abundance. Overall, we found only six post-fire limber pine seedlings within the burns, as compared to one hundred twenty-four similarly aged seedlings found in unburned plots. Akaike information criterion (AIC) identified distance to a seed source and absence of canopy cover as hurdles for seedling establishment in the burn. Analysis of seedling abundance was performed on only the unburned dataset due to low regeneration in the burned areas surveyed; model selection here showed that when distance to a seed source is small, substrate variables, including less prevalent bare mineral soil, more rocky cover, and finer soil textures, take on an important role in driving abundance. Substrates important for limber pine abundance in unburned stands were found with similar frequency in the burns, indicating limber pine colonization post-disturbance was not substrate limited but instead constrained by other factors. Our findings suggest that extensive prescribed burns and stand-replacing wildfire events at the northern extent of limber pine's range may have limited seedling regeneration in the immediate post-fire period. Conservation efforts may be well-served by focusing on fire mitigation efforts, such as thinning and other fuel treatments, in areas surrounding established limber pine stands. Finally, post-disturbance stands could benefit from supplementary seedling plantings to achieve recovery plan restoration goals for this endangered species.

AB  - Connectivity across the seascape is expected to have profound consequences for the behavior, growth, survival, and spatial distribution of marine species. A landscape ecology approach offers great utility for studying ecological connectivity in tropical marine seascapes. Landscape ecology provides a well developed conceptual and operational framework for addressing complex multi-scale questions regarding the influence of spatial patterning on ecological processes. Landscape ecology can provide quantitative and spatially explicit information at scales relevant to resource management decision making. It will allow us to begin asking key questions such as 'how much habitat to protect?', 'What type of habitat to protect?', and 'Which seascape patterns provide optimal, suboptimal, or dysfunctional connectivity for mobile marine organisms?'. While landscape ecology is increasingly being applied to tropical marine seascapes, few studies have dealt explicitly with the issue of connectivity. Herein, we examine the application of landscape ecology to better understand ecological connectivity in tropical marine ecosystems by: (1) reviewing landscape ecology concepts, (2) discussing the landscape ecology methods and tools available for evaluating connectivity, (3) examining data needs and obstacles, (4) reviewing lessons learned from terrestrial landscape ecology and from coral reef ecology studies, and (5) discussing the implications of ecological connectivity for resource management. Several recent studies conducted in coral reef ecosystems demonstrate the powerful utility of landscape ecology approaches for improving our understanding of ecological connectivity and applying results to make more informed decisions for conservation planning.

AB  - The formerly large continuous range of brown bears in Iran has become confined to fragmented patches due to habitat conversion. Little is known about population genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure, and the consequences of geographic and ecological isolation on spatial genetic variations in Iranian bears. Literature is generally sparse on the effects of isolation by distance (IBD), isolation by resistance (IBR), isolation by environment (IBE), and ecological niche isolation on genetic differentiations of large-bodied carnivores. In this study, we investigated population structure, landscape connectivity, and genetic variations of Iranian brown bear populations using microsatellites. We tested the effects of IBD, IBR, and IBE on the genetic structure using multiple matrix randomized regression (MMRR) in an individual-based approach. A population level method based on an ecological niche modelling (ENM) framework was then used to evaluate the effect of niche divergence on genetic patterns. Bear populations displayed high genetic diversity, among the highest reported for wild brown bears. We also found a relatively significant division of brown bear populations, as well as higher effect of IBR than IBD and IBE, demonstrating the influence of landscape resistance in shaping spatial genetic variations. The results of niche comparisons among brown bear groups showed low niche overlap, and a probable phylogenetic conservatism event. We concluded that a combination of landscape resistance, ecological niche divergence, and probably mate-based dispersal behavior are affecting the gene flow of bear populations. Conservation planning of this vulnerable species should include landscape linkages to maintain gene flow among the isolated populations. (C) 2018 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

AB  - Human-wildlife interactions (HWI) were frequent in the post-socialist period in the mountain range of Central European countries where forest habitats suffered transitions into built-up areas. Such is the case of the Upper Prahova Valley from Romania. In our study, we hypothesized that the increasing number of HWI after 1990 could be a potential consequence of woodland loss. The goal of our study was to analyse the effects of landscape changes on HWI. The study consists of the next steps: (i) applying 450 questionnaires to local stakeholders (both citizens and tourists) in order to collect data regarding HWI temporal occurrences and potential triggering factors; (ii) investigating the relation between the two variables through the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA); (iii) modelling the landscape spatial changes between 1990 and 2018 for identifying areas with forest loss; (iv) overlapping the distribution of both the households affected by HWI and areas with loss of forested ecosystems. The local stakeholders indicate that the problematic species are the brown bear (Ursus arctos), the wild boar (Sus scrofa), the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the grey wolf (Canis lupus). The number of animal-human interactions recorded an upward trend between 1990 and 2018, and the most significant driving factors were the regulation of hunting practices, the loss of habitats, and artificial feeding. The landscape change analysis reveals that between 1990 and 2018, the forest habitats were replaced by built-up areas primarily on the outskirts of settlements, these areas coinciding with frequent HWI. The results are valid for both forest ecosystems conservation in the region, wildlife management, and human infrastructures durable spatial planning.

AB  - Human influence on the environment differs in terms of distribution and intensity, thus producing a gradient of landscape modifications that translates into different landscape structures. Within this variety of landscapes, fringe areas represent complex spaces where dynamic processes and instable conditions can be observed. In this research Kernel Density Estimation, multivariate spatial analysis, landscape pattern analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were combined to model and characterise landscape gradients, and to analyse the structural features of fringe areas. This methodology was applied to a rural area of central Italy, using density indicators associated with urbanisation, agriculture, and natural elements considered to be key components for the identification of landscape gradients. The results highlight not only specific "pillar" landscapes, which are dominated by said components, but also transitional landscapes, where the most relevant forms of interaction between land uses were identified. Characterisation of landscape structures along the gradient illustrated different trends in patch density, shape complexity and landscape diversity, demonstrating greater variability in fringe areas than in pillar landscapes. PCA revealed a partial overlap between the main structural characteristics of the agro-forestry matrix and the medium intensity agricultural landscapes, whereas urban fringes and semi-natural fringes were clearly separated. The discovery of the continuous landscape gradients and an understanding of the gamut of landscape types nested along them is crucial in allowing for more effective land-use planning in which also fringe areas become a relevant part of the process.

AB  - The different ways in which biodiversity is distributed on Earth have always intrigued ecologists, promoting constant research to elucidate the causes and mechanisms that guide their spatial patterns. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain biodiversity across the world. In South American Subtropical Dry forests, a global deforestation hotspot, this type of research remains poorly explored. We aimed to evaluate the response of forests bird communities to different biophysical and environmental factors analyzed simultaneously under three major hypotheses in ecology. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to analyze the seasonal richness and relative frequency in birds for 27 forest sites scattered through the Dry Chaco, Argentina, under the influence of the following predictors: (a) mean seasonal temperature, (b) forest biomass, (c) forest primary productivity using the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and (d) landscape heterogeneity. Our results indicate that forest sites with high biomass and temperature values and with low landscape heterogeneity hold higher bird richness, without any influence of forest productivity. The relative frequency was higher in areas with high temperatures and high landscape heterogeneity around, although with low values of forest productivity. Overall, we highlight that the spatial pattern of bird communities in the Argentinean Dry Chaco forests is determined by areas with high biomass, high temperatures and mainly low landscape transformation in the surroundings. These associations must be considered in future decisions on land use for better territory planning and the conservation of these important areas for bird diversity.

AB  - Rapid urbanization would lead to deterioration of the eco-environment and damage the functioning of ecosystem services. Ecological security pattern (ESP) is one of important national strategies in China for coordinating the ecosystem protection and economic development. Previous studies have mainly focused on how to identify ecological sources and extract ecological corridors, but optimization of the identified ecological sources and resistance surfaces are seldom explored. In this study, a new strategy to optimize ecological sources and resistance surfaces was proposed. The optimal diffusion distance of each existing ecological source with poor landscape connectivity was analyzed to meet future needs. The radial effect of resistance in areas with high resistance values were considered in combination with the characteristics of species migration. Hunan is an important province in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) and the Rise of Central China strategies. Taking a rapidly urbanizing region in Hunan Province as an example, the results showed that the total area of the optimized ecological sources was 9.60% higher than that of the existing area, which expanded the radial range of ecosystem services and enhanced ecosystem internal connectivity. According to the spatial distribution of important ecological landscape elements, the ecological framework of "two axes, four cores, and four belts" was proposed. This study offers a new insight for ESP construction, which can provide a new reference for ecological protection and development planning of rapidly urbanizing regions in central-south China.

AB  - Climate change and security of energy supply are main sustainability issues today and an energy systems shift towards renewable energy sources is therefore urgent. However, unless environmental impacts of such a shift are carefully taken into account, imposed resource and land use changes may counteract other sustainability goals, such as preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) provides a comprehensive framework for assessment of policies and plans where a full range of environmental issues are addressed. The aim of this article was to find possibilities for comprehensive sustainability assessment among published energy-environment models and the linking of renewable energy analysis to landscape and biodiversity issues through land use concerns. Based on the review of relevant energy, environmental and linking models, a survey on publications and a case study on the EU Energy Roadmap 2050, the results show that existing energy models and research have low concerns on land use, landscapes and biodiversity. Consequently, it would be difficult to provide comprehensive decision support by using only these tools. However, suitable energy models, ecological assessment models and multi-criteria approaches exist with great potential for inter-linking. The development of energy models could thus have new orientations, connecting them to involve renewable energy options with land use, landscape and biodiversity concerns, which could be advanced into powerful SEA tools for integrated policy assessment. This will enable the development of more comprehensive decision support tools for assessing future energy scenarios, integrating main policy concerns when assessing renewable energy options.

AB  - In Mediterranean dry grasslands, grazing by domestic animals is an important agricultural activity on dry grasslands. Several bird species occur in these grazed habitats and are now experiencing a near continuous decline. We investigated the impact of livestock grazing on the threatened little bustard (Tetrax tetrax L.). The study was conducted at the NATURA 2000 Site/Important Bird Area of Cabrela, Portugal. Our main goals were to investigate responses of little bustard territorial males and breeding females to different livestock management practices, namely pasture types, stocking rates and sward structure. Bird distribution was surveyed using car and foot surveys. Data on grazing was supplied by land managers every 10 days from February to June through field interviews. Generalised additive models and model averaging were used to compute predictive models. Results indicate that higher probabilities of occurrence were found in long-term pastures and under light-moderate grazing conditions (stocking rates around 0.4 LU/ha). Conversely, lower probabilities of occurrence were found in ungrazed or heavy grazed fields. Males occurred mostly in large fields, but this variable seemed to be less important for females. On the other hand, green plant cover and the vegetation height were good predictors for the occurrence of females but not for males. Females used mostly pastures with vegetation height around 20-25 cm. Our results suggest that grazing management plans that aim to conserve little bustard populations should consider (1) the maintenance of the larger long-term pastures and (2) the use of light-moderate stocking rates (0.2-0.6 LU/ha).

AB  - Existing models for simulating large woody debris (LWD) loads of forest streams were adapted for forest conditions in northern Idaho. Effects of riparian management prescriptions implemented for streams within a habitat conservation planning area for bull trout and other sensitive species were evaluated based on riparian and instream LWD conditions observed along 58 randomly selected stream segments. A wood budgeting system presented by Welty et al. (2002. Riparian aquatic interaction simulator (RATS): A model of riparian forest dynamics for the generation of large woody debris and shade. For. Ecol. Manage. 162:299-318) was employed through use of observed starting instream LWD loads and generalized depletion rates. LWD recruitment estimates were based on locally relevant growth and yield simulators, taper equations, and adjustments for tree fall directional bias. LWD loading, expressed as the number of qualifying pieces per 1,000 ft of stream, was examined under two scenarios: a no-harvest scenario and a harvest scenario. Results indicated no significant difference in the frequency distribution of simulated LWD loading between the no-harvest and harvest scenarios over a 100-year prediction period. Examination of our assumptions indicated that LWD loading was likely underestimated and less variable than would be expected. However, these assumptions had equal effects on each scenario, enabling us to confidently interpret the effects of timber harvest. The nature and extent of riparian forest harvesting evaluated in this simulation is similar to levels being considered elsewhere in the region. Therefore, simulation techniques demonstrated here could be applied elsewhere in the region for evaluating the potential effects of riparian management on fisheries resources.

AB  - The exploitation of mixed fisheries leads to trade-offs between fisheries rent, production (landings) and resource conservation because harvest rent cannot be optimized simultaneously for all species. Additionally, the exploitation of mixed fisheries by heterogeneous fleets complicates their management because of the necessity to allocate catch or effort quotas, under some criterion of efficiency or equitability. The allocation of fishing opportunities impacts directly on the availability of jobs in fisheries. To analyse the trade-offs between employment and profits in mixed fisheries, an optimization bioeconomic model was built for the three bottom-trawl fleet segments operating in the Catalonia demersal fishery (NW Mediterranean Sea). The fishery is subject to a multiannual management plan to align fishing effort with the fisheries mortality that would produce the maximum sustainable yield. The optimal effort allocation among the three fleet segments were compared subject to alternative fisheries management policies: (i) maximum sustainable yield, (ii) maximum economic yield, (iii) maximum labour remuneration, (iv) pretty good yield, and (v) equilibrium biomass larger than biomass at maximum sustainable yield, taking into account the multispecies nature of the fishery. The results show that all management policies provide higher profits than current. In the first three scenarios, high profitability can be made compatible with a lower number of better paid jobs, because the optimal allocation of effort in most scenarios would imply a reduction in the number of vessels. The results also show that the current number of vessels and effort distribution (which are the result of a historical process, rather than the results of a management strategy) are far from any optimum.

AB  - Continuous change over an area of 238 km(2) of the "classic" Karst in Slovenia, previously severely deforested, has resulted in a change of the landscape identity in last 250 years (from 1763/1787 to 2012): grasslands declined from 82 to 20% and forests progressed from 17 to 73%. The Multi-Layer Perceptron model was validated before making predictions for further landscape change using the Markov chain method: a predicted map for 2009 was produced and compared with an actual one. Image similarity statistics indicate 89% similarity and the spatial distribution of predicted grasslands agrees in 98% of locations. The prediction estimates that grasslands will cover 18 km(2) less in 2025 than today and will then shrink to just 6 km(2) (3%) in 2100. The speed of grassland overgrowing was calculated on 2.2 km(2)/year. Forest area will expand by 18 km(2) until 2025, compared to 2012. In 2075, forest will cover 88% of the whole study area, and will reach 90% in 2100, achieving then an almost steady-state situation. Calculation of the spatial change trend for grasslands enabled us also to determine where in space the overgrowing process will occur during each of the predicted periods. Congruent aspects of changed landscape identity (e.g. landscape beauty, diversity, and wilderness) are discussed, but according to legal obligations regarding the conservation of Natura 2000 grassland habitats, the management with grassland remnants (5% of grasslands was already lost after the Slovenian accession to EU in 2003) are suggested to be incorporated in landscape planning.

AB  - To support the assessments of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the IPBES Expert Group on Scenarios and Models is carrying out an intercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models using harmonized scenarios (BES-SIM). The goals of BES-SIM are (1) to project the global impacts of land-use and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (i.e., nature's contributions to people) over the coming decades, compared to the 20th century, using a set of common metrics at multiple scales, and (2) to identify model uncertainties and research gaps through the comparisons of projected biodiversity and ecosystem services across models. BES-SIM uses three scenarios combining specific Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) - SSP1xRCP2.6, SSP3xRCP6.0, SSP5xRCP8.6 - to explore a wide range of land-use change and climate change futures. This paper describes the rationale for scenario selection, the process of harmonizing input data for land use, based on the second phase of the Land Use Harmonization Project (LUH2), and climate, the biodiversity and ecosystem services models used, the core simulations carried out, the harmonization of the model output metrics, and the treatment of uncertainty. The results of this collaborative modeling project will support the ongoing global assessment of IPBES, strengthen ties between IPBES and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and modeling processes, advise the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on its development of a post-2020 strategic plans and conservation goals, and inform the development of a new generation of nature-centred scenarios.

AB  - The large-scale spatial patterns and primary drivers of food web dynamics across seascapes can be investigated using isotope ratios in marine consumers. However, interpreting complex signatures from mobile animals can require good knowledge of spatial isotopic variations in the environment. This is particularly true in the Southern Ocean where regional differences in the physical environment affect habitat predictability and predator foraging. We applied a retrospective-isotope approach integrated with tracking locations for a model species, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), to generate large-scale spatially-explicit predictions of isotopic gradients ("isoscapes") across the Southern Ocean. Vibrissae and blood samples were collected during post- and pre-breeding periods from both Antarctic and sub-Antarctic breeding environments. Stable isotope values from vibrissae growth and serially sampled blood enabled the reconstruction of an isotopic time-series that could be directly related to feeding locations at sea. Tracked seals were widely distributed in the southern Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with important foraging activity centred on productive upwelling areas, oceanic frontal zones and shelf environments. Corresponding seal delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were positively correlated to the Southern Ocean latitudes at which the tracked individuals foraged. Breeding site, bi-monthly foraging period and foraging location all explained significant variation in isotopic values during migration. Isotopic variation was largely driven by the latitudinal and inshore/offshore gradient in delta C-13 and delta N-15 at the base of the food web in neritic and oceanic waters. These delineate the spatio-temporal isotopic variability of important foraging habitats, providing a valuable perspective on the spatial and seasonal distribution of predators and forage availability. Differences in inferred predator distribution within and between breeding locations have implications for relative exposure to anthropogenic threats from fisheries interactions and climate change. This study demonstrates that isotope tracers in archival tissues are useful indicators of resource partitioning by marine consumers to directly inform spatial conservation planning and ecosystem management strategies at the cross-basin scale.

AB  - Desert fishes are some of the most imperiled vertebrates worldwide due to their low economic worth and because they compete with humans for water. An ecological complex of fishes, 2 suckers (Catostomus latipinnis, Catostomus discobolus) and a chub (Gila robusta) (collectively managed as the so-called three species) are endemic to the U.S. Colorado River Basin, are affected by multiple stressors, and have allegedly declined dramatically. We built a series of occupancy models to determine relationships between trends in occupancy, local extinction, and local colonization rates, identify potential limiting factors, and evaluate the suitability of managing the 3 species collectively. For a historical period (1889-2011), top performing models (AICc) included a positive time trend in local extinction probability and a negative trend in local colonization probability. As flood frequency decreased post-development local extinction probability increased. By the end of the time series, 47% (95% CI 34-61) and 15% (95% CI 6-33) of sites remained occupied by the suckers and the chub, respectively, and models with the 2 species of sucker as one group and the chub as the other performed best. For a contemporary period (2001-2011), top performing (based on AIC(c)) models included peak annual discharge. As peak discharge increased, local extinction probability decreased and local colonization probability increased. For the contemporary period, results of models that split all 3 species into separate groups were similar to results of models that combined the 2 suckers but not the chub. Collectively, these results confirmed that declines in these fishes were strongly associated with water development and that relative to their historic distribution all 3 species have declined dramatically. Further, the chub was distinct in that it declined the most dramatically and therefore may need to be managed separately. Our modeling approach may be useful in other situations in which targeted data are sparse and conservation status and best management approach for multiple species are uncertain.
   Una Cuantificacion Basada en la Ocupacion del Estado Altamente en Peligro de los Peces del Desierto del Suroeste de los Estados Unidos Los peces del desierto son unos de los vertebrados en mayor peligro a nivel mundial debido a su bajo valor economico y a que compiten por el agua con los humanos. Un complejo ecologico de peces, dos miembros de la familia Catostomidae (Catostomus latipinnis, C. discobolus) y un bagre (Gila robusta) (todos manejados colectivamente como las llamadas tres especies), endemico a la cuenca estadunidense del Rio Colorado, esta afectado por multiples factores estresantes y supuestamente ha declinado dramaticamente. Construimos una serie de modelos de ocupacion para determinar las relaciones entre las tendencias de ocupacion, la extincion local y las tasas de colonizacion, para identificar los factores limitantes potenciales y para evaluar la idoneidad del manejo colectivo de las tres especies. Durante un periodo historico (1889 - 2011), los modelos con el mejor desempeno (AICc) incluyeron una tendencia positiva de tiempo en la probabilidad de extincion local y una tendencia negativa en la probabilidad de colonizacion local. La probabilidad de extincion local incremento conforme disminuyo la frecuencia de inundaciones pos-desarrollo. Al final de la serie de tiempo, el 47% (95% IC 34 - 61) y el 15% (95% IC 6 - 33) de los sitios permanecieron ocupados por los catostomidos y el bagre, respectivamente, y los modelos con las dos especies de catostomidos como un grupo y el bagre como otro tuvieron el mejor desempeno. Para un periodo contemporaneo (2001 - 2011), los modelos con el mejor desempeno (basados en AICc) incluyeron a la mayor descarga anual. La probabilidad de extincion local disminuyo y la probabilidad de colonizacion local incremento conforme incremento la mayor descarga. Para el periodo contemporaneo, los resultados de los modelos que dividieron a las tres especies en grupos separados fueron similares a los resultados de los modelos que combinaron a los dos catostomidos pero no al bagre. Colectivamente, estos resultados confirmaron que las declinaciones de estos peces estuvieron fuertemente asociadas con el desarrollo del agua y que, en relacion a su distribucion historica, las tres especies han declinado dramaticamente. Ademas, el bagre se distinguio por declinar mas dramaticamente y por lo tanto tal vez requiera de manejo por separado. Nuestra estrategia de modelado puede ser util en otras situaciones en las que los datos de importancia son escasos y el estado de conservacion y la mejor estrategia de manejo para multiples especies son inciertos.

AB  - 1. Climate change and human population growth threaten the supply of fresh water for human use and freshwater biodiversity. Long-term studies are necessary to identify the effects of such temporal trends on biological and ecological phenomena; however, the collection of long-term data can be costly and time-consuming.
   2. We investigated the effect of hydrological variation over time on population dynamics in a perennial river of the northern Chihuahuan Desert, using an imperilled freshwater mussel (Popenaias popeii) as a model. We conducted a 15-year mark-and-recapture study, and distance sampling, to estimate demographic parameters while accounting for habitat heterogeneity and changes in river discharge.
   3. Recapture probability varied between microhabitats, and survival was positively correlated with river discharge. Survival and the finite rate of population growth were relatively stable over time. Over 60% of individuals were found at relatively high density in riffle habitats, which compose c. 16% of the total study area.
   4. Mean monthly temperature in the region increased over the past 100 years, and mean monthly discharge of the Black River declined over the past 65 years. With no significant trends in total monthly precipitation, declines in discharge suggest that reduction of stream flow is likely due to lowering of the water table and decreased groundwater recharge.
   5. Significant changes in climate and hydrological regimes, and increases in anthropogenic threats (increased water demand, degraded water quality) in the region, may induce significant declines in population size of this imperilled mussel. We demonstrated the importance of considering habitat heterogeneity and hydrological cycles over time to examine population dynamics. Survival of benthic invertebrates in desert streams is sensitive to hydrological cycles, which are expected to be altered via climate change and extensive water use. Species recovery plans need to incorporate knowledge of spatial distributions when designing strategies for habitat assessment and making conservation decisions.

AB  - Aim Identifying the drivers of biological invasions is crucial to predict the risk of invasion across broad spatial scales and to devise strategies to prevent invasion impacts. Here, we explore the relative importance and synergies between two key drivers-propagule pressure and landscape disturbance-in determining the invasion of native forest remnants by dogs, one of the most abundant, widely distributed, and harmful invasive species worldwide. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Methods Combining a camera trap dataset (96 sites in forest remnants) and censuses of populations of dogs raised by humans across 12 landscapes (2,830 ha each), we used N-mixture models that account for imperfect detection to confront alternative hypotheses of invasion drivers. We then used this empirical evidence to predict the intensity of dog invasion across the Atlantic Forest hotspot. Results Propagule pressure (density of raised dogs, positive effect) and landscape disturbance (forest cover, negative effect) were equally important drivers of dog invasion, presenting additive rather than synergistic effects. Dogs invade forest remnants far from their homes, making the density of raised dogs the key component of propagule pressure (relative to dog spatial distribution). Forest cover was more important than either the length or density of forest edges, suggesting that both reduced area of forested barriers to long-distance movements and increased proximity of forests to edges facilitate dog access to forests. Across the Atlantic Forest, the combination of high human population density and extensive deforestation makes dog invasion an additional and widespread threat. Main conclusion Combined with available maps of priority areas for biodiversity conservation, our spatial prediction of dog invasion can help target areas for integrated management actions. These actions should go beyond measures to control dog populations and encompass the maintenance and restoration of native forests and strategic planning of afforestation through planted forests.

AB  - Understanding fine-scale habitat needs of species and the factors influencing heterogeneous use of habitat within home range would help identify limiting resources and inform habitat management practices. This information is especially important for large mammals living in fragmented habitats where resources may be scarcer and more patchily distributed than in contiguous habitats. Using bihourly Global Position System (GPS) location data collected from 10 individuals during 2011-2014, we investigated microhabitat features of areas within home ranges that received high vs. low intensity of use by Florida black bears (Ursus americanus floridanus) in north-central, Florida. We identified areas receiving high and low levels of use by bears based on their utilization distributions estimated with the dynamic Brownian bridge movement model, and performed vegetation sampling at bear locations within high-and low-use areas. Using univariate analyses and generalized linear mixed models, we found that (1) canopy cover, visual obstruction, and hardwood density were important in defining high-use sites; (2) the probability of high use was positively associated with principal components that represented habitat closer to creeks and with high canopy and shrub cover and higher hardwood densities, likely characteristic of forested wetlands; and (3) the probability of high use was, to a lesser extent, associated with principal components that represented habitat with high canopy cover, high pine density, and low visual obstruction and hardwood density; likely representing sand pine and pine plantations. Our results indicate that the high bear-use sites were in forested wetlands, where cover and food resources for bears are likely to occur in higher abundance. Habitat management plans whereby bears are a focal species should aim to increase the availability and quality of forested wetlands. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

AB  - As a result of sea-level rise (SLR), coastal anchialine pool habitats will be lost in some locations and will expand inland into low-lying areas in others. New and existing habitats may risk additional SLR-related degradation from non-native species transmission, groundwater pollution, and increased contact with human infrastructure. Despite a worldwide distribution, anchialine ecosystems and biota have been largely omitted from SLR risk assessments for coastal ecosystems.
   Anchialine pools and caves are composed of brackish groundwater that connects to the marine environment through porous rocky substrate but have no overland connection to the ocean. They support unique endemic biota.
   The goal of this study was to develop methods to assess potential impacts to anchialine pools from future coastal flooding, using the island of Hawai'i as a case study. Flood predictions incorporated pool surveys, groundwater-level measurements, and statistical analysis of flood frequencies observed in tide gauges combined with regional scenario-based projections of future sea levels. High-resolution geospatial models were then generated to predict anchialine pool location, density, and risk factors for the next 60 years.
   Along 40 km of coastline, up to 80% of current anchialine pools will be lost by 2080 as pools merge with ocean habitats; however, as groundwater flooding occurs more frequently and new habitats are created inland, the total pool counts will rise from 509 in 2018 to 1,000 by 2080. As a result of extreme water-level events, non-native fishes are predicted to disperse into 42% of pools by 2030. Based on current conditions, development and cesspool risks are quite low for anchialine pools in the study area.
   Outcomes from this study are guiding conservation actions, including habitat restoration, non-native fish removal, and development planning decisions in coastal areas. This study illustrates methods that can be used to assess the effects of SLR on anchialine pool habitats worldwide.

AB  - The present study aims at investigating the past and current trophic status of Lake Ossa and evaluating its potential impact on African manatee health. Lake Ossa is known as a refuge for the threatened African manatees in Cameroon. Little information exists on the water quality and health of the ecosystem as reflected by its chemical and biological characteristics. Aquatic biotic and abiotic parameters including water clarity, nitrogen, phosphorous, and chlorophyll concentrations were measured monthly during four months at each of 18 water sampling stations evenly distributed across the lake. These parameters were then compared with historical values obtained from the literature to examine the dynamic trophic state of Lake Ossa. Results indicate that Lake Ossa's trophic state parameters doubled in only three decades (from 1985 to 2016), moving from a mesotrophic to a eutrophic state. The decreasing nutrient gradient moving from the mouth of the lake (in the south) to the north indicates that the flow of the adjacent Sanaga River is the primary source of nutrient input. Further analysis suggests that the poor transparency of the lake is not associated with chlorophyll concentrations but rather with the suspended sediments brought-in by the Sanaga River. Consequently, our model demonstrated that despite nutrient enrichment, less than 5% of the lake bottom surface sustained submerged aquatic vegetation. Thus, shoreline emergent vegetation is the primary food available for the local manatee population. During the dry season, water recedes drastically and disconnects from the dominant shoreline emergent vegetation, decreasing accessibility for manatees. The current study revealed major environmental concerns (eutrophication and sedimentation) that may negatively impact habitat quality for manatees. The information from the results will be key for the development of the management plan of the lake and its manatee population. Efficient land use and water management across the entire watershed may be necessary to mitigate such issues.

AB  - Fire-killed serotinous trees are often dominant species in fire-prone regions with contrasting wet and dry seasons. We studied a serotinous fire-killed conifer (Callitris preissii, Cupressaceae) to identify the influence of fire regime and climate on geographic variation in level of serotiny, recruitment and population structure. We measured population size distributions, seedling recruitment and level of serotiny for sample stands across a climatic gradient from mesic coastal (including two islands) to semi-arid inland sites in SW Australia. Trees on islands were mostly non-serotinous and were only weakly serotinous on the adjacent mainland in the higher rainfall West coast region. In the semi-arid Goldfields and South inland, and the higher rainfall South coast region, trees were more strongly serotinous with up to six cohorts of closed cones retained on trees. Level of serotiny was stronger at the drier end of the climatic gradient where severe to extreme fire danger weather occurs most frequently, and where vegetation type (e.g., shrublands) supports frequent crown-type, stand-replacing fires. Recruitment was most abundant post-fire in all regions, but seedlings also established inter-fire where there was regular seed fall due to low level of serotiny or spontaneous release of seeds from old cones on trees with a high cone load. Population structures for mainland stands shifted from approximately reverse-J (indicating continuous recruitment) in mesic regions to mainly unimodal (establishment mostly after fire) in drier, inland regions, although some long-unburned inland stands showed occasional inter-fire recruitment, likely linked to high rainfall years. Unimodal population structures characterized islands, where previous studies have identified herbivory on seedlings by refugial populations of native macropods as a limiting factor on inter-fire establishment. Understanding landscape context, response to disturbance, biotic interactions and reproductive traits of dominant species is essential in conservation planning in a rapidly changing global environment.

AB  - Animal conservation requires understanding animal-habitat relationships. The integration of novel remote sensing platforms such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has dramatically improved the resolution of insight when evaluating animal-habitat relationships by characterizing forest structure. However, conventional LiDAR collection (e.g., airborne or terrestrial laser scanning) may be limited by small spatial extents and logistical constraints (e.g., budget) associated with sampling. NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission provides an alternative and complement to conventional LiDAR sampling with globally available waveform LiDAR, which is being collected to characterize vertical and horizontal structure of Earth's forests. Forest carnivores are wide-ranging species occupying forested ecosystems, and are generally associated with vertical and horizontal forest structure for their survival and reproduction. We evaluated patterns in occurrence and habitat use of forest carnivores, which included Pacific martens (Martes caurina), Rocky Mountain red foxes (Vulpes vulpes macroura), and coyotes (Canis latrans) and patterns in occurrence of their prey; American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and snowshoe hares (Lepus americans). Camera trap data were collected during the 2014-2017 winters in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in Wyoming, USA. Our objectives were to (1) combine GEDI samples with multispectral satellite imagery from Landsat 8 to upscale vertical forest structure metrics; (2) assess the relative importance of environmental characteristics influencing occurrence and habitat use of forest-associated predators and prey; and (3) determine if GEDI-derived variables aided our efforts in characterizing animal-environment relationships. We used Random Forest regression models to upscale GEDI samples across our study area and implemented a multi-tiered approach using generalized linear mixed effect models to simultaneously evaluate animal-environment relationships and how GEDI-derived metrics improved the animal-habitat models. GEDI-derived metrics of relative height and foliage height diversity improved our animal-environment models and were among the strongest covariates (effect sizes were 1.3-1.8 times larger than the next closest) in the coyote, red squirrel, and snowshoe hare models. All five species were influenced to some degree by the frequency of rebaiting a camera trap and varying conditions of snow depth. Collectively, our work indicates forest canopy height and complexity variables significantly improved our ability to assess the importance of forest characteristics on forest carnivores and their prey. Indeed, there is an untapped opportunity to enhance animal ecology and conservation planning with continued integration of GEDI information with freely available satellite data to characterize attributes of forest structure across expansive areas.

AB  - Mangroves are one of the world threatened ecosystems, which is protected and categorised under CRZ-I according to the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification. The present study marked the decadal (1990-2017, Landsat series) change of mangroves and mapped the species distribution (2017, Sentinel-2) around Thane creek, Mumbai using SMLC with QGIS-SCP software. ADCIRC model was used to simulate the tidal flooding/ebbing towards mangroves, and the model was validated with the in-situ observation of tides and currents. From 1990 to 2017, the mangrove area increased from 79.14 km(2) to 154.5 km(2) and expanded towards landward and seaward regions. Between 2010 and 2017, there was a fluctuation in the mangrove area with ups and downs in their distribution caused by different climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities. The increase in built-up area was two times than mangrove area increase. The dominance of Avicennia marina species confirms the increased anthropogenic activity along the landward side. To understand the response of mangroves to the tidal dynamics, the model was simulated with two scenarios; with mangroves and without mangroves. In the absence of mangroves (without mangroves), Thane Creek demonstrated a perfect funnelling effect by increased tidal amplification with strong flood currents, resulting in severe coastal inundation and erosion. While with mangroves, tidal currents attenuated 80% of its magnitude and favoured the sediment deposition in mangrove areas, which further enhanced mangrove growth, thereby stabilising the coast. The present study has found that the mangroves in the Thane creek are in the saturation stage and reached the maximum growth towards the landward. The study envisages that the stakeholders should adopt a proper management plan for the restoration of mangroves. The highlight of the present study is the combination of satellite imagery and hydrodynamic modelling. Satellite imagery provides the estimated extent of the mangroves, and this information will be used when simulating the model, which provides maximum inundation and attenuation. The utilisation of LULC classification and ADCIRC model results would be helpful to examine the threatening built-up area due to the tidal inundation. The combination of satellite classification and hydrodynamic model findings will be decisive for management authorities towards the conservation and regeneration activities for a balanced mangrove-creek ecosystem.

AB  - Spatial dispersal pattern could determine the spatial pattern of establishment affecting the vegetation structure. Our work, analyze dispersion and colonization attribute of the hemiparasitic plant Misodendrum punctulatum (Misodendraceae). Our hypothesis outline that the wind dispersal pattern of M. punctulatum seeds determine the infection pattern (colonization) on Nothofagus antarctica, and both processes (dispersion and colonization) are asymmetric in accordance with the predominant wind direction. This study was carry out in a N. antarctica (host) post-fire shrubland. We assessed the seed dispersal estimating number of seed on host branches supplied from infected-survivals hosts (focal host) toward each cardinal direction. Colonization was assessed estimating number of infections on each host, through transects, at every cardinal direction from the focal host. We observed that seeds dispersed decline with distances from the seed source, and dispersion fitted to a negative exponential model. The longest distance of primary dispersion observed was 10 m toward east. About colonization, longest distance from the focal host was 22.5 m toward south. Furthermore, ratio of infected host was lesser on west, one infected by 10 uninfected (1:10) than other compass aspects (1:6). Both process, dispersion and colonization, showed a similar and asymmetric pattern of distribution, which could be result of wind direction predominant from northwest. In addition, a high spatial correlation was observed among number of seed dispersed and recruitment of infection in distances from the sources of seeds. Our results allow understand the patterns of spatial distribution and infection dynamics of Misodendrum punctulatum. In order to plan management strategies, understanding the infection dynamics is useful to perform successfully strategies to the control of hemiparasitic plants in forest to commercial use, and conservation or restoration strategies, e.g. to restorate this hemiparasitic specie in areas recently colonized by N. antarctica. These studied aspects in Misodendrum punctulatum contribute to the knowledge of this ecological interaction, which is frequent in Nothofagus forests from Argentina and Chile.

AB  - Gridded historical climate products (GHCPs) are employed with increasing frequency when modeling ecological phenomena across large scales and predicting ecological responses to projected climate changes. Concurrently, there is an increasing acknowledgement of the need to account for uncertainty when employing climate projections from ensembles of global circulation models (GCMs) and emissions scenarios. Despite the growing usage and documented differences among GHCPs, uncertainty characterization has primarily focused on GCM and emissions scenario choice, while the consequences of using a single GHCP to make predictions over space and time have received less attention. Here we employ average July temperature data from observations and seven GHCPs to model plant canopy cover and tree basal area across central Alaska, USA. We first compare the fit of, and support for, models employing observed temperatures, GHCP temperatures, and GHCP temperatures with an elevation adjustment, finding (1) greater support for, and better fit using, elevation-adjusted vs. raw temperature models and (2) overall similar fits of elevation-adjusted models employing temperatures from observations or GHCPs. Focusing on basal area, we next compare predictions generated by elevation-adjusted models employing GHCP data under current conditions and a warming scenario of current temperatures plus 2 degrees C, finding good agreement among GHCPs though with between-GHCP differences and variation primarily at middle elevations (similar to 1,000 m). These differences were amplified under the warming scenario. Finally, using pooled indices of prediction variation and difference across GHCP models, we identify characteristics of areas most likely to exhibit prediction uncertainty under current and warming conditions. Despite (1) overall good performance of GHCP data relative to observations in models and (2) positive correlation among model predictions, variation in predictions across models, particularly in mid-elevation areas where the position of treeline may be changing, suggests researchers should exercise caution if selecting a single GHCP for use in models. We recommend the use of multiple GHCPs to provide additional uncertainty information beyond standard estimated prediction intervals, particularly when model predictions are employed in conservation planning.

AB  - Translocations are essential for re-establishing wildlife populations. As they sometimes fail, it is critical to assess factors that influence their success pre-translocation. Socioecological suitability models (SESMs) integrate social acceptance and ecological suitability to enable identification of areas where wildlife populations will expand, which makes it likely that SESMs will also be useful for predicting translocation success. To inform site selection for potential elk Cervus canadensis reintroduction to north-eastern Minnesota, United States, we developed broadscale maps of social acceptance from surveys of local residents and landowners, animal use equivalence (AUE) from forage measured in the field and empirical conflict risk from geospatial data. Resulting SESMs integrated social acceptance favourability scores, AUE and conflict risk, and weighted SESMs showed the relative influences of acceptance and conflict. Social acceptance was positive for local residents and landowners (mean >= 5.4; scale of 1-7). AUE (scaled to an elk home range) ranged between 1 and 9 elk/16 km(2) during winter, and from 14 to 83 elk/16 km(2) during summer. Human-elk conflict risk was low (mean <= 0.10; scaled 0-1), increasing from north to south. Geographical distributions differed for social acceptance, AUE and conflict risk, and weighted SESMs revealed unsuitable areas that were otherwise obscured. Synthesis and applications. Integrating human-wildlife conflict risk into SESMs shows where social acceptance of translocated species is likely to erode, even where viewed favourably pre-translocation, to inform translocation planning by highlighting interactions between key factors. Such integrated models supplement existing reintroduction biology frameworks by supporting decision-making and knowledge development. In north-eastern Minnesota, natural resource managers who are considering elk reintroductions are using SESMs reported here to identify where human-elk conflict is unlikely to result in an isolated elk population and where addressing concerns for area residents about conflict risk is essential.

AB  - Abiotic, biotic and human influences are factors that can affect animal home ranges. We calculated home range sizes of adult giraffes in the Tarangire-Manyara region of northern Tanzania (N = 132 giraffes with data collected over 6 years), and investigated correlations between home range sizes and environmental and anthropogenic factors (for a subset of N = 71 giraffes). We used a 95% kernel utilization distribution to define home ranges and modelled home range size as a function of environmental and anthropogenic predictors using multiple linear regression and model selection. We also computed home range sizes of giraffes using 100% minimum convex polygons to compare with estimates from previously published studies, and tested the relationship between rainfall and home range sizes of giraffes across Africa. Average kernel home range sizes were 114.6 km(2) for females (N = 109) and 157.2 km(2) for males (N = 23). Adult female giraffe home range sizes (N = 67) were negatively correlated with distance to densely populated towns. Females living closer to towns had significantly larger home ranges, suggesting a need to range farther to avoid human-impacted areas while obtaining critical resources. No such relationship was evident with bomas, which are homesteads built by indigenous pastoralist people, suggesting that female giraffes are tolerant of traditional land uses. Mean annual rainfall explained 74% of the variation in home range sizes of giraffes across the African continent, with smaller home ranges in regions with higher rainfall and thus greater productivity, providing additional evidence that access to critical resources mediates home range size of this megaherbivore. Quantifying home range sizes and identifying ecological and anthropogenic factors affecting space use can provide insights into mechanisms driving use of space and help wildlife managers make informed decisions that improve conservation plans for at-risk species such as giraffes.

AB  - An ecotope (spatial eco-space) map that considers topography and bio-organism-relevant variables emerges as an important basic framework when landscape-scale characteristics for ecosystem management and wildlife conservation are needed. A spatio-geoecological framework based on geographic information systems (GIS) and a vegetation survey were developed for wildlife habitat evaluation of national parks and applied to a representative rugged valley area of Mt. Sorak National Park in Korea. An ecotope map was classified into hundreds of types and dozens of groups by combining biological and geophysical variables. Variables included: forest vegetation type, topographic solar radiation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, and anthropogenic factors, such as, streams and roads. Layers of GIS variables were produced by field surveys, modeling, satellite images, or digitalization. Vegetation surveys were carried out to identify finer-scale distribution of vegetation types in the rugged valley area. Digital forest vegetation maps from the Forestry Administrator were then modified using the field-surveyed vegetation maps. Topographic solar radiation was predicted with a daily topographic radiation model. The NDVI was calculated from the satellite imagery of a Landsat Thematic Mapper. A digital elevation model (DEM) was used and the other layers were digitized using topographical maps with a scale of 1:25 000. The aim of this study is to determine the geoecological factors relating to the spatial pattern of plant community. It was cleared by the spatial pattern of environmental variables and vegetation characteristics by detrended correspondence analysis using plant species and the environmental variables of each plot. The ordination component value of the first axis shows significant regression to some environmental variables. A case study of habitat evaluation was carried out using the resultant ecotope map. The spatial distribution of potential goral habitat and vegetation characteristics were predicted and the impact of human trails on the neighboring vegetation was also examined for restoration planning. The GIS-based framework developed for wildlife habitat evaluation is useful for natural resource management and human activity control in national parks in Korea.

AB  - The intensive management of tree plantations has replaced and fragmented native forests worldwide. A direct consequence of this activity is the creation of new edges, which generate changes in microclimatic conditions in the adjacent forest as well as in the neighboring clearcut stands left over after harvesting by clearcut logging. Thus, newly created anthropogenic thermal gradients could influence ectothermic responses regarding abundance and physiology of native species in fragmented landscapes. Interestingly, the consequences of these changes have not been studied in insects. To test the effects of the anthropogenic thermal gradient on the abundance and physiology of ectothermic species, we chose the fragmented Maulino forest and the ground-dwelling beetle Ceroglossus chilensis (Coleoptera: Carabidae) as our biological model, working with seven fragments of native forest surrounded by active and clearcut pine plantation stands. We measured temperature variables and beetle abundance in different months using transects perpendicular to the edge and used general linear modelling to explain abundance with temperature. In addition, we assessed the preferential body temperatures (T-b) and Rollover Speed (RoS) of C. chilensis at five different temperatures in controlled conditions to explain field abundance. We found that mean ambient temperatures were up to 42% higher in clearcut stands than in native forest fragments during summer. However, ambient temperatures in autumn were similar between native forest fragments and clearcut stands. The abundance of C. chilensis, is concentrated near the edge in the native forest (between 2 and 10 m to interior of native forest), regardless of month sampled. The abundance of C. chilensis was higher at the edge than inside native forest interiors or clearcut stands, regardless of the month. Ambient temperature surpasses preferential body temperature (14-15.99 degrees C) and physiological performance of C. chilensis (15 degrees C), particularly during summer. Ceroglossus chilensis abundance at the edge of clearcut stands could be favored by understory structural complexity in understory vegetation, creating suitable microclimatic conditions and increasing abundance of prey resource. In essence, we found that the higher temperatures found near the edge inside forest interiors might enable individuals of C. chilensis to display thermoregulatory behavior by concentrating activity at these particular regions, resulting in increased abundances and more concentrated occurrences, helping to explain the edge-biased distribution. Thus, we offer evidence that physiological performance might be a key functional trait to explain abundance of ectothermic species in fragmented forest landscapes. We submit to decision makers linked to the forestry industry, that managing the understory of young tree plantations and increasing the structural complexity at remnant forest edges to cushion high temperatures in clearcut stands would enable more effective conservation planning of thermosensitive ectotherms in disturbed forest landscapes.

AB  - Every year, millions of migratory shorebirds fly through the East Asian-Australasian Flyway between their arctic breeding grounds and Australasia. This flyway includes numerous coastal wetlands in Asia and the Pacific that are used as stopover sites where birds rest and feed. Loss of a few important stopover sites through sea-level rise (SLR) could cause sudden population declines. We formulated and solved mathematically the problem of how to identify the most important stopover sites to minimize losses of bird populations across flyways by conserving land that facilitates upshore shifts of tidal flats in response to SLR. To guide conservation investment that minimizes losses of migratory bird populations during migration, we developed a spatially explicit flyway model coupled with a maximum flow algorithm. Migratory routes of 10 shorebird taxa were modeled in a graph theoretic framework by representing clusters of important wetlands as nodes and the number of birds flying between 2 nodes as edges. We also evaluated several resource allocation algorithms that required only partial information on flyway connectivity (node strategy, based on the impacts of SLR at nodes; habitat strategy, based on habitat change at sites; population strategy, based on population change at sites; and random investment). The resource allocation algorithms based on flyway information performed on average 15% better than simpler allocations based on patterns of habitat loss or local bird counts. The Yellow Sea region stood out as the most important priority for effective conservation of migratory shorebirds, but investment in this area alone will not ensure the persistence of species across the flyway. The spatial distribution of conservation investments differed enormously according to the severity of SLR and whether information about flyway connectivity was used to guide the prioritizations. With the rapid ongoing loss of coastal wetlands globally, our method provides insight into efficient conservation planning for migratory species. Gestion ptima de una Ruta Migratoria de Multiples Especies de Aves Costeras Sometida a Incremento del Nivel del Mar
   Resumen Cada ano, millones de aves costeras migratorias vuelan por la ruta migratoria Asia-Australasia de Oriente entre sus sitios articos de reproduccion y Australasia. Esta ruta incluye numerosos humedales costeros en Asia y el Pacifico que se usan como sitios de parada temporal donde las aves descansan y se alimentan. La perdida de unos cuantos sitios de parada temporal por medio del incremento en el nivel del mar (SLR, en ingles) podria causar declinaciones poblacionales repentinas. Formulamos y resolvimos matematicamente el problema de como identificar los sitios de paradas temporales mas importantes para minimizar las perdidas de poblaciones de aves a lo largo de rutas migratorias al conservar suelos que faciliten cambios orilla arriba de llanuras de marea en respuesta al SLR. Para guiar una inversion en la conservacion que minimice la perdida de poblaciones de aves migratorias durante la migracion, desarrollamos un modelo de ruta migratoria espacialmente explicito acoplado con un algoritmo de flujo maximo. Las rutas migratorias de 10 taxones de aves costeras fueron modeladas en el marco de la teoria de graficos al representar agrupaciones de humedales importantes como nodos y los numeros de aves volando entre 2 nodos como bordes. Tambien evaluamos varios algoritmos de asignacion de recursos que requirieron solo informacion parcial sobre la conectividad de rutas migratorias (estrategia de nodo, basada en los impactos del SLR en los nodos; estrategia de habitat, basada en cambios de habitat en los sitios; estrategia de poblacion, basada en cambios de poblacion en los sitios; e inversion al azar). El algoritmo de asociacion de recursos basado en la informacion de rutas migratorias se desempeno en promedio 15% mejor que las asignaciones simples basadas en patrones de perdida de habitat o conteos locales de aves. La region del Mar Amarillo sobresalio como la prioridad mas importante para la conservacion efectiva de aves costeras migratorias, pero solo la inversion en el area no puede asegurar la persistencia de especies a lo largo de la ruta migratoria. La distribucion espacial de las inversiones de conservacion difiere enormemente de acuerdo a la severidad del SLR y dependiendo de si la informacion sobre la conectividad de las rutas migratorias se uso para guiar las priorizaciones. Con la continua y rapida perdida de humedales costeros a nivel global, nuestro metodo proporciona conocimiento sobre la planeacion eficiente de la conservacion para especies migratorias.

AB  - Agricultural development was the major contributor to South America's designation as the continent with the highest rates of forest loss from 2000-2012. As the apex predator in the Neotropics, jaguars (Panthera onca) are dependent on forest cover but the species' response to habitat fragmentation in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes has not been a subject of extensive research. We used occupancy as a measure of jaguar habitat use in Colombia's middle Magdalena River valley which, as part of the intercontinental Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena biodiversity hotspot, is exceedingly fragmented by expanding cattle pastures and oil palm plantations. We used single-season occupancy models to analyze 9 months of data (2015-2016) from 70 camera trap sites. Given the middle Magdalena's status as a "jaguar corridor" and our possible violation of the occupancy models' demographic closure assumption, we interpreted our results as "probability of habitat use (psi)" by jaguars. We measured the associations between jaguar presence and coverage of forest, oil palm, and wetlands in radii buffers of 1, 3, and 5 km around each camera trap. Our camera traps recorded 77 jaguar detections at 25 of the camera trap sites (36%) during 15,305 trap nights. The probability of detecting jaguars, given their presence at a site, was 0.28 (0.03 SE). In the top-ranked model, jaguar habitat use was positively influenced by wetland coverage (beta = 7.16, 3.20 SE) and negatively influenced by cattle pastures (beta = -1.40, 0.63 SE), both in the 3 km buffers. We conclude that wetlands may serve as keystone habitats for jaguars in landscapes fragmented by cattle ranches and oil palm plantations. Greater focus on wetland preservation could facilitate jaguar persistence in one of the most important yet vulnerable areas of their distribution.

AB  - Few studies have quantitatively projected changes in demography in response to climate change, yet doing so can provide important insights into the processes that may lead to population declines and changes in species distributions. Using a long-term mark-recapture data set, we examined the influence of multiple direct and indirect effects of weather on adult and juvenile survival for a population of Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) in California. We found evidence for a positive, direct effect of winter temperature on adult survival, and a positive, indirect effect of prior rainy season precipitation on juvenile survival, which was consistent with an effect of precipitation on food availability during the breeding season. We used these relationships, and climate projections of significantly warmer and slightly drier winter weather by the year 2100, to project a significant increase in mean adult survival (12-17%) and a slight decrease in mean juvenile survival (4-6%) under the B1 and A2 climate change scenarios. Together with results from previous studies on seasonal fecundity and postfledging survival in this population, we integrated these results in a population model and projected increases in the population growth rate under both climate change scenarios. Our results underscore the importance of considering multiple, direct, and indirect effects of weather throughout the annual cycle, as well as differences in the responses of each life stage to climate change. Projecting demographic responses to climate change can identify not only how populations will be affected by climate change but also indicate the demographic process(es) and specific mechanisms that may be responsible. This information can, in turn, inform climate change adaptation plans, help prioritize future research, and identify where limited conservation resources will be most effectively and efficiently spent.

AB  - Human population growth and anthropogenic activities are exacerbating pressures on biodiversity globally. Land conversion is aggravating habitat fragmentation and non-human primates are increasingly compelled to live in forest-agricultural mosaics. In Sierra Leone, more than half of the wild chimpanzee population (Pan troglodytes verus) occurs outside protected areas and competes for resources with farmers. Our study area, in the Moyamba district in south-western Sierra Leone, is practically devoid of forest and is dominated by cultivated and fallow fields, swamps and mangroves. In this region, traditional slash-and-burn agriculture modifies annually the landscape, sparing swamps and mangroves and semi-domesticated oil palms (Elaeis guineensis). This study aimed to explore ecological and anthropogenic factors influencing chimpanzee relative abundance across this highly degraded and human-impacted landscape. Between 2015 and 2016, we deployed 24 camera traps systematically across 27 1.25x1.25 km grid cells. Cameras were operational over a period of 8 months. We used binomial iCAR models to examine to what extent anthropogenic (roads, settlements, abandoned settlements and human presence) and habitat variables (swamps, farmland and mangroves) shape chimpanzee relative abundance. The best model explained 43.16% of the variation with distance to roads and swamps emerging as the best predictors of chimpanzee relative abundance. Our results suggest that chimpanzees avoid roads and prefer to maintain proximity to swamps. There was no significant effect of settlements, abandoned settlements, mangroves or human presence. It appears that chimpanzees do not avoid areas frequented by people; although, our findings suggest temporal avoidance between the two species. We highlight the importance of studying chimpanzee populations living in anthropogenic habitats like agricultural-swamp matrixes to better understand factors influencing their distribution and inform conservation planning outside protected areas.

AB  - As well as their destructive roles, plants, animals and microorganisms contribute to geomorphology and ecology via direct and indirect bioprotection, which can reduce weathering and erosion. For example, indirect bioprotection can operate via biotic influences on microclimate whereby physical decay processes associated with fluctuations in temperature and moisture (salt crystallization, thermal fatigue and wetting-drying), are limited. In the intertidal zone, the spatial and temporal distribution of macroalgae (seaweeds) is patchy, related to physical and ecological conditions for colonization and growth, and the nature and frequency of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. We examined the influence of seaweed canopies (Fucus spp.) on near-surface microclimate and, by implication, on conditions for mechanical rock decay and under-canopy ecology. Monitoring on hard artificial coastal structures in South West England, UK, built from limestone and concrete showed that both the range and maxima of daily summertime temperatures were significantly lower, by an average of 56% and 25%, respectively, in areas colonized by seaweed compared to experimentally cleared areas. Short-term microclimatic variability (minutes-hours) was also significantly reduced, by an average of 78% for temperature and 71% for humidity, under algal canopies during low-tide events. Using seaweed as an example, we develop a conceptual model of the relationship between biological cover and microclimate in the intertidal zone. Disturbance events that remove or drastically reduce seaweed cover mediate shifts between relatively stable and unstable states with respect to mechanical decay and ecological stress associated with heat and desiccation. In urban coastal environments where disturbance may be frequent, facilitating the establishment and recovery of canopy-forming species on rocks and engineered structures could enhance the durability of construction materials as well as support conservation, planning and policy targets for biodiversity enhancement.

AB  - Little attention has been paid to analyses of pedodiversity. In this study, quantitative aspects of pedodiversity were explored for the USA based on the State Soil Geographic database (STATSGO). First, pedodiversity indices for the conterminous USA were estimated. Second, taxa-area relationships were investigated in each soil taxonomic category. Thirdly, differences in pedodiversity between the USDA-NRCS geographical regions were compared. Fourth, the possible mechanisms underlying the observed relative abundance of soil taxa were explored. Results show that as the taxonomic category decreases from order to series, Shannon's diversity index increases because taxa richness increased dramatically. The relationship between the number of taxa (S) and area (A) is formulated as S=cA(z). The exponent z reflects the taxa-richness of soil 'communities' and increases constantly as taxonomic categories decrease from order to series. The "West" USDA-NRCS geographical region has the highest soil taxa, richness, followed by the "Northern Plains" region. The "South Central" region has the highest taxa evenness, while taxa evenness in the "West" region is the lowest. The "West" or the "South Central" regions have the highest overall soil diversity in the four highest taxonomic categories, while the "West" or "Northern Plains" regions have the highest diversity in the two lowest taxonomic levels. The high diversity index in the "West" region results from high taxa richness while the high diversity index in the "South Central" region results from an evenness of taxa. As the taxonomic level decreases, the pattern of taxa abundance approaches a lognormal distribution. One of the key findings of this research is that at lower levels of soil taxonomic divisions (especially the series level), soil taxa increase continuously with increasing area, indicating considerable soil endemism in the USA (and likely around the world), a key consideration in conservation and preservation planning.

AB  - In arid and semiarid zones, groundwater plays a key role in the ecology and availability of freshwater. Coastal lagoons in arid zones have great importance as a refuge for species of flora and fauna, as a source of freshwater, and for recreational purposes for local communities and tourism. In addition, as environments under natural stress, they are suffering pressure from anthropogenic activities and climate change, especially in zones with intense touristic development as in the case of the Baja California Peninsula in northwest Mexico. In this paper, we analyze the future of a coastal lagoon impacted by climate change and anthropogenic pressures. We constructed a groundwater MODFLOW-SWI2 model to predict changes in freshwater-saltwater inputs and correlated them with the geospatial analysis of the distribution and evolution of the water body and surrounding vegetation. The methodology was applied to the San Jose lagoon, one of the most important wetlands in the Baja California peninsula, which had been affected by anthropogenic activities and endangered by climate change. According to our water balance, the deficit of the San Jose aquifer will increase by 2040 as a result of climate change. The water table north of the lagoon will drop, affecting the amount of freshwater inflow. This reduction, together with an increase of evapotranspiration and the sea-level rise, will favor an increase of mineralization, reducing the surface water and groundwater quality and in consequence affecting the vegetation cover. Without proper management and adequate measures to mitigate these impacts, the lagoon may disappear as a freshwater ecosystem. Results of this research indicate that the use of a groundwater flow model, together with a geospatial analysis provide effective tools to predict scenarios for the future of coastal lagoons, and serve as a basis for land planning, nature conservation, and sustainable management of these ecosystems.

AB  - P>1. Classifications that group rivers and streams with similar ecological characteristics are used increasingly to underpin conservation and resource management planning. Uses include identifying systems that may respond similarly to human activities or management actions, setting guidelines and standards to manage human impacts, interpreting data from inventory (survey) and monitoring, and identifying priority sites for conservation management.
   2. Traditional approaches to river classification have been based mostly on delineating landscape units (ecoregions), often by grouping adjacent catchments having similar ecological character. However, use of this approach can be complicated by marked local heterogeneity of river systems. Instead, classifications may be more ecologically relevant if individual river or stream segments having similar environmental conditions are grouped together, independent of their geographic locations. The latter approach also allows the use of more rigorous classification procedures, including newly emerging techniques that optimise the ability of a classification to discriminate patterns in parallel sets of biological data.
   3. Here, we explore the use of one of these newer techniques, generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM), an extension of generalised regression techniques, that defines an optimal set of transformations of candidate environmental predictors to maximise explanation of species turnover in site-based biological data.
   4. Using two biological data sets describing the distributions of freshwater fish and macroinvertebrates and a candidate set of functionally relevant environmental variables, we used GDM to identify the variables, weightings and transformations that best explain biological dissimilarities across sites. We then used these as input to a multivariate classification of 567 000 river and stream segments throughout New Zealand. Weightings and transformations of these variables were also specified from the GDM analysis. The matrix of transformed environmental predictors was classified in a two-stage process, using non-hierarchical mediod clustering to define an initial set of 400 groups, with relationships between these groups then defined using hierarchical clustering.
   5. The resulting classification better discriminates sites with similar biological character than previous classifications, particularly at higher levels of classification detail. Key factors contributing to this success include the use of detailed, segment-specific environmental variables, coherently accounting for the longitudinal connectivity inherent in rivers including its implications for the construction of biologically relevant predictors, and the use of a modelling technique (GDM) designed to specifically analyse biological turnover and its relationships with environment.

AB  - Seagrasses are rapidly losing their ability to serve ecosystem services (ESs) with the loss of global biodiversity and coastal habitat degradation over the past few decades. Monitoring ESs is therefore important for tracking subsequent decline or recovery. The development of new Earth Observation (EO) technologies and approaches involved in observing and analyzing data collected from remote sensing (RS) satellite/aircraft would make for a useful application: monitoring and mapping spatial distribution of ESs that seagrasses provide to marine ecosystems and human well-being. Unfortunately, current approaches greatly rely on spatial proxy measures to map distribution of ESs. Many of biophysical parameters are currently detectable by EO instruments, with relevance to ESs. This paper review the capabilities of advanced RS techniques for informing species diversity, growth traits, health condition, ecological processes, and water quality variables linking ESs and describe how these EO products can contribute to ES assessments. Incorporation of both the direct (seagrass extent) and indirect (water related ESs) estimates derived from EO data can now provide more direct estimates of seagrass ecosystem properties (seagrass habitat quality and biodiversity) influencing ESs than the spatial proxies presently in use and they can support in developing more mechanistic models in GIS framework and spatially explicit maps of ESs. The increasing range of EO system and data sets suitable for measuring ES indicators has potential to supporting integrated coastal land use planning. Because each ES indicator and service responds to the environment, there is no 'one approach fits all' solution. Selecting EO products, with required resolution to be analyzed will guide to improving mapping efforts. This work also shed lights to sensitize discussion about need of holistic methodologies, challenges, and to motivate an enhanced use of EO-based technology and data. The need for a multidisciplinary project team of ecologists, sociologists, biologists and RS experts has been suggested for proper identification of ES indicators and advanced analysis of EO data. By doing so, we anticipate rapid progress in satellite based ES assessment and characterization of ESs and, in turn, supporting conservation and management of coastal ecosystem.

AB  - Successful restoration of wetland ecosystems requires knowledge of wetland hydrologic patterns and an understanding of how those patterns affect wetland plant and animal populations. Within the Everglades, Florida, USA restoration, an applied science strategy including conceptual ecological models linking drivers to indicators is being used to organize current scientific understanding to support restoration efforts. A key driver of the ecosystem affecting the distribution and abundance of organisms is the timing, distribution, and volume of water flows that result in water depth patterns across the landscape. American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) are one of the ecological indicators being used to assess Everglades restoration because they are a keystone species and integrate biological impacts of hydrological operations through all life stages. Alligator body condition (the relative fatness of an animal) is one of the metrics being used and targets have been set to allow us to track progress. We examined trends in alligator body condition using Fulton's K over a 15 year period (2000-2014) at seven different wetland areas within the Everglades ecosystem, assessed patterns and trends relative to restoration targets, and related those trends to hydrologic variables. We developed a series of 17 a priori hypotheses that we tested with an information theoretic approach to identify which hydrologic factors affect alligator body condition. Alligator body condition was highest throughout the Everglades during the early 2000s and is approximately 5-10% lower now (2014). Values have varied by year, area, and hydrology. Body condition was positively correlated with range in water depth and fall water depth. Our top model was the "Current" model and included variables that describe current year hydrology (spring depth, fall depth, hydroperiod, range, interaction of range and fall depth, interaction of range and hydroperiod). Across all models, interaction between range and fall water depth was the most important variable (relative weight of 1.0) followed by spring and fall water depths (0.99), range (0.96), hydroperiod (0.95) and interaction between range and hydroperiod (0.95). Our work provides additional evidence that restoring a greater range in annual water depths is important for improvement of alligator body condition and ecosystem function. This information can be incorporated into both planning and operations to assist in reaching Everglades restoration goals. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Estuarine intertidal flats are often exploited by humans and waders since they provide food, particularly shellfish. This raises important conservation issues. Waders can be affected by shellfishing activities in multiple ways, such as a reduction of the available shellfish, disturbance by the presence of shellfishers on their feeding areas, and changes in micro-habitat, due to sediment reworking. In this study we quantified the impact of traditional shellfishing on waders in the Tagus estuary. Particular attention was given to hand-raking of clams Scrobicularia plaria, which constitutes most of the consumed food by waders. Shellfishers did not cause a relevant depletion of clams for waders; they removed less than 0.3% of its total production and focused on size classes that were usually not taken by birds. Hand-raking caused temporary changes in the vertical distribution and availability of invertebrate prey in the sediment. However, this did not affect the bird's feeding rates, presumably because prey availability remained above the threshold at which intake rates are expected to decline. The presence of shellfishers in the birds foraging areas potentially affects waders by keeping them away from foraging areas, but even the most affected species lost less than 10% of their foraging grounds due to this factor. Overall, we conclude that the current low harvesting levels of shellfishing are compatible with the preservation of the estuary as a key site for waders. Nevertheless, simulations showed that traditional shellfishing could have much greater potential to affect waders through disturbance than through prey removal. The results for the Tagus show that even small harvest rates, representing a negligible loss of food for waders and potentially considered sustainable by shellfish managers, could have a great impact on waders due to increased disturbance. This effect of disturbance likely occurs in most estuaries and should be taken into consideration when planning shellfish harvesting in important wader feeding areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - 1. During aerial or boat-based surveys for large-bodied diving taxa (e.g. marine mammals and marine turtles), a proportion of animals present will be missed because they are submerged and out of view, leading to availability bias in abundance indices. Information on divesurfacing patterns can improve corrections for availability bias. However, as dive data are typically limited, availability correction factors are often based on poorly resolved dive and surface times, and diving heterogeneity is not considered. 2. We collected dive records for green turtles Chelonia mydas, Linnaeus 1758, and loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta, Linnaeus 1758, on a foraging ground in Shark Bay, Western Australia to quantify dive-surfacing patterns and assess potential correlations with easily measured environmental features: habitat depth and water temperature. Bayesian regression models were used to predict dive and surface interval durations across temperature-depth gradients and assess their uncertainty. We used these predictions to quantify variation in availability correction factors, which were multipliers designed, in this case, to adjust surface sightings data to incorporate diving animals. 3. Dive and surface interval durations for both species varied positively with depth and negatively with temperature, consistent with a priori expectations, although temperature effects were not always significant. Dive metrics were predictable, although uncertainty increased in deeper habitat with few observed dives. 4. Availability correction factors were highly heterogeneous, with larger corrections necessary in colder, deeper conditions (long-diving, infrequent surfacing behaviour) and smaller corrections required in warmer, shallower conditions (short-diving, frequent-surfacing behaviour). 5. Predictable variation in the diving behaviour of chelonid sea turtles across environmental gradients on a foraging ground reveals that site-specific knowledge of dive-surfacing patterns can be important to mitigate the effects of availability bias during population surveys. Accounting for such trends may improve the reliability of ecological inferences (e. g. spatiotemporal distribution trends) and the efficacy of applications (e. g. conservation planning) based on survey data.

AB  - The mangrove ecosystem is significantly affected by human activities, climate change, and rising sea level. The prop-agules of mangroves dispersal with tide and river currents that extend upstream habitats are why mangroves are the dominant species in the tidal area. Bridging critical knowledge gaps can help to create restoration plans for mangrove extension. However, studies on the hydrodynamic and propagation trajectory model (PTM) simulation of propagule long-distance dispersal (LDD) and mangrove growth potential are scarce. By combining various numerical methods and empirical formulas and verifying them with the data obtained through field surveys, this study established a com-prehensive model to assess the dispersal and growth of the propagules of Kandelia ovobata. The stepping-stone approach (SSA) and habitat suitability index (HSI) model were also employed to determine the location of the appro-priate new habitats through iterative simulation in propagule dispersal. Dike removal was proposed as a nature-based solution and modeled to evaluate the benefits of ecological conservation and flood prevention. The PTM simulations indicated that the deterministic process of horizontal advection accounted for > 80 %, and that the remaining variabil-ity in the model could be explained by stochastic processes in predicting mangrove propagules pathways. The inte-grated model of the PTM and SSA proved that propagules have LDD in an estuary. There were few matches in the regions for mangrove growth when comparing the suitability of habitat distribution and the probability of propagule movement. We suggested that the mangrove spread model incorporating the SSA and HSI models predict the potential for mangrove dispersal into new habitats. In addition, the removal of levees aids floodplain regeneration and allows propagules to disperse across the floodplain at high tide and establishment at low tide. The Guandu floodplain resto-ration with dike removal supplied a cobenefits on ecological demands and flood risk reduction. Future research could thus utilize the adaptation and mitigation strategies presented in this study by incorporating socioeconomic consider-ations to enhance practical feasibility.

AB  - Aim To assess the scale of variation for major environmental gradients in Norway. To obtain a step-less model for this variation and to use this model to evaluate the extent to which the consensus expert classification of Norway into vegetation regions can be predicted from environmental variables. To discuss the potential of step-less models for understanding natural variation at regional scales, for stratification and for predictive modelling of species distributions and land-cover types.
   Location The mainland of Norway.
   Methods Fifty-four climatic, topographical, hydrological and geological variables were recorded for grid cells with spatial resolution (grain size) of 1 x 1, 5 x 5 and 10 x 10 km, spanning the entire mainland of Norway. Principal components analyses (PCA) were used to summarize variation in three primary data matrices and three random subsets of these.
   Results The first four principal components explained between 75% and 85% of the variation in the data sets. All PCAs revealed four consistent environmental gradients, in order of decreasing importance: (1) regional variation (gradient) from coast to inland and from oceanic/humid to continental areas; (2) regional variation from north to south and from high to low altitudes; (3) regional variation from north to south and from inland to coast, related to solar radiation; and (4) topographic (terrain relief) variation on finer scales than (1-3). The first two PCA axes corresponded to the two bioclimatic gradients used in expert classifications of Norway into biogeographical regions: vegetation sections (from highly oceanic to slightly continental) and vegetation zones (from nemoral to alpine).
   Main conclusions Our PCA analyses substantiate the current view of bioclimatic regional vegetation variation in Norway, provide an explicit characterization of this variation in terms of climatic variables, and show that environmental variability can be reproduced as GIS layers in step-less models. These models have the potential to become important tools for future predictive modelling within resource management, conservation planning and biogeographical (and other ecological) research.

AB  - The Baixo Vouga Lagunar (BVL) is part of Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon in Portugal, which is classified as a Special Protection Area under the European Habitats and Birds Directives. This part of the system, corresponding to the confluence of the Vouga River with the lagoon, is very important culturally and socioeconomically for the local communities, taking place several human activities, especially agriculture. To prevent salt water intrusion from the Ria de Aveiro into agriculture fields, a floodbank was initiated in the 90's. In frame of ongoing changes in Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics, the existing floodbank will be now extended, introducing further changes in the ecological dynamics of the BVL and its adjacent area. As a consequence, the water level in the floodbank down-stream side is expected to rise, increasing the submersion period in tidal wetlands, and leading to coastal squeeze. The aim of this study is to apply an ecosystem based-management approach to mitigate the impacts on biodiversity resulting from the management plan. To do so, we have modelled the implications of the changes in several hydrological and environmental variables on four saltmarsh species and habitats distribution, as well as on their associated ecosystem services, both upstream and downstream of the floodbank. The ecosystem services of interest were prioritized by stakeholders' elicitation, which were then used as an input to a spatial multi-criteria analysis aimed to find the best management actions to compensate for the unintended loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the BVL. According to our results, the main areas to be preserved in the BVL were the traditional agricultural mosaic fields; the freshwater courses and the subtidal estuarine channels. By combining ecology with the analysis of social preferences, this study shows how co-developed solutions can support adaptive management and the conservation of coastal ecosystems.

AB  - 1. A procedure is described to estimate viable population size and the area of habitat needed to support an endangered stream fish population. Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate population fates with stochastic demography and random variation simulated to cause age class 0 failures in some years. Viable population was defined in this paper to be large enough to have less than a 10% chance of extinction in 100 years and to have a long-term effective size of at least 500 breeding adults, although the method could be applied for any assumed extinction rate and effective size.
   2. Using data for Rio Grande cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis) in an age class model, it was inferred from simulations that minimum viable population size was 2750 fish, which would require 2.2 ha of habitat at median density of the subspecies in New Mexico streams.
   3. Minimum viable population size occurred at the highest survival rate of young of year and no population-wide year class failures. Viable population size, and hence required habitat size, increased as the failure rate for age class 0 increased or when the survival rate from age 0 to 1 declined. This suggested that managers should avoid managing for smallest possible viable population size and instead plan for much larger population sizes to accommodate temporal variation in demography and habitat quality.
   4. Decreased survival rate of young of year caused the stable age class distribution to be skewed toward the age class 0, which profoundly reduced effective population size. This suggested that habitat restoration that improves survival of young of year would be a good strategy to increase effective size over the long term.
   5. Estimating required habitat size could improve introductions of fish to create new populations. Although requiring time-consuming simulations, the procedure can be used to estimate required habitat size for any species for which population and demographic data are available.

AB  - Sea level rise and an increased frequency and severity of storm surge events due to climate change are likely to increase the susceptibility of low lying coastal areas to seawater flooding. An integral part of any coastal management strategy throughout European countries is the "do nothing" scenario; this is the benchmark against which putative intervention strategies are evaluated. While the prime concern of a flood defense scheme appraisal often focuses on the sustained financial "benefits" of an intervention, intrinsic to a complete multicriteria analysis is a comprehensive evaluation of the ecological and social consequences of coastal flooding, reflecting the needs of end users and satisfying relevant national and international policies.
   An ecological perspective may be usefully employed to examine the impact of the do nothing option on coastal environments (e.g. estuaries, sand dunes and grasslands) and businesses. Although at first sight coastal environmental and business systems appear quite different, they have similarities in that both are vulnerable and susceptible to flood damage or loss and both may be analyzed by employing ecological, adaptive, resilience frameworks. From an ecological perspective many coastal environments are of international conservation importance and provide important ecosystem services including coastal protection, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, food production and recreation. Nonetheless, despite their potential vulnerability to coastal flooding, our understanding of the effects of salinity on the biological response of many coastal plants and animals is extremely limited. We show here how plant physiology and patterns of plant and invertebrate distribution are impacted by sea water flooding. We also present responses of model plants to sea water inundation based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) predictions of sea level rise and storm surge events. Results showed that coastal habitats surveyed are relatively resilient to flooding due to their species rich nature and their ability to adapt to flooding. However specific groups of plants such as grasses are more affected by flooding and less able to recover.
   The socio-economic dimensions of doing nothing are addressed in relation to the impacts of coastal flooding specifically on business activity, which has received little attention to date. Here the focus is on the presence or absence of business disruption and recovery plans as a means of increasing a business's adaptation and resilience to flooding. Results show that some businesses, particularly small ones, are more likely to fail to recover from flooding due to lack of forward planning. Therefore from an ecological perspective business recovery post flooding is likely to be dependent upon ability to adapt, which itself depends upon the construction of resilient business environments.

AB  - The Berau Continental Shelf (BCS) in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, harbours various tropical marine ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrass meadows and coral reefs. These ecosystem are located partly within reach of the Berau River plume, which may affect ecosystem health through exposure to land-derived sediments, nutrients and pollutants carried by the plume. This study aims (1) to assess the exposure risk of the BCS coastal ecosystems to river plume water, measured as exposure time to three different salinity levels, (2) to identify the relationships between these salinity levels and the abundance and diversity of coral and seagrass ecosystems, and (3) to determine a suitable indicator for the impacts of salinity on coral reef and seagrass health. We analysed hydrodynamic models, classified salinity levels, and quantified the correlations between the salinity model parameters and ecological metrics for the BCS systems. An Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) analysis revealed three modes of river plume dispersal patterns, which strongly reflect monsoon seasonality. The first mode, explaining 39% of the variability, was associated with the southward movement of the plume due to northerly winds, while the second and third modes (explaining 29% and 26% of the variability, respectively) were associated with the northeastward migration of the plume related to southwesterly and southerly winds. Exposure to low salinity showed higher correlations with biological indicators than mean salinity, indicating that low salinity is a more suitable indicator for coastal ecosystem health. Significant correlations (R-2) were found between exposure time to low salinity (days with salinity values below 25 PSU) with coral cover, coral species richness, seagrass cover, the number of seagrass species, seagrass leaf phosphorus, nitrogen, C:N ratio and iron content. By comparing the correlation coefficients and the slopes of the regression lines, our study suggests that coral reefs are more susceptible to low salinity levels exposure than seagrass meadows. Regarding the risk of corals being exposed to low salinity, nearshore and northern barrier reefs were classified as "high risk", the middle barrier reef as "medium to high risk" and southern barrier reefs as "medium risk". Further offshore, the oceanic reefs were classified as "low risk". Regarding the seagrass meadows, the nearshore region was categorized as "high risk", the barrier reef as "medium to low risk" and oceanic reefs as "low risk". This study contributes to assessing the potential impacts of salinity on the BCS ecosystems, and further provides a knowledge base for marine conservation planning.

AB  - Background Black alder (Alnus glutinosa) forests are in severe decline across their area of distribution due to a disease caused by the soil-borne pathogenic Phytophthora alni species complex (class Oomycetes), "alder Phytopththora". Mapping of the different types of damages caused by the disease is challenging in high density ecosystems in which spectral variability is high due to canopy heterogeneity. Data obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be particularly useful for such tasks due to the high resolution, flexibility of acquisition and cost efficiency of this type of data. In this study, A. glutinosa decline was assessed by considering four categories of tree health status in the field: asymptomatic, dead and defoliation above and below a 50% threshold. A combination of multispectral Parrot Sequoia and UAV unmanned aerial vehicles -red green blue (RGB) data were analysed using classical random forest (RF) and a simple and robust three-step logistic modelling approaches to identify the most important forest health indicators while adhering to the principle of parsimony. A total of 34 remote sensing variables were considered, including a set of vegetation indices, texture features from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a digital surface model (DSM), topographic and digital aerial photogrammetry-derived structural data from the DSM at crown level. Results The four categories identified by the RF yielded an overall accuracy of 67%, while aggregation of the legend to three classes (asymptomatic, defoliated, dead) and to two classes (alive, dead) improved the overall accuracy to 72% and 91% respectively. On the other hand, the confusion matrix, computed from the three logistic models by using the leave-out cross-validation method yielded overall accuracies of 75%, 80% and 94% for four-, three- and two-level classifications, respectively. Discussion The study findings provide forest managers with an alternative robust classification method for the rapid, effective assessment of areas affected and non-affected by the disease, thus enabling them to identify hotspots for conservation and plan control and restoration measures aimed at preserving black alder forests.

AB  - Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is an effective and efficient method which can identify the trade-offs between different river system management options. However, a number of barriers remain between using optimization in research, and implementing it in practice. To address such limitations, this study developed a simplified conceptual model consisting of hydrologic, ecological and optimization components to explore the trade-offs between ecological and human water needs. A hypothetical catchment was used as case study, which drew on data from the Lachlan catchment in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia. The Lachlan River is highly regulated, and supports a range of conflicting water users including agriculture, urban areas and wetlands of high conservation significance.
   In order to capture some of the major components of the Lachlan catchment, the hypothetical case study incorporated two major headwater storages; water users representing a spatial distribution of demands; and a 16,000 ha terminal wetland, represented in terms of wetland vegetation response (using River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) as an indicator species). The influence of groundwater/surface water (GW/SW) interactions on ecosystem response and optimization outcomes was examined for dry versus wet periods.
   Decision variables in the optimization procedure were based on environmental flow rules and licence volumes for other water users, to explore which sets of rules achieved optimal outcomes. The objective functions consisted of maximising an ecological health score for the terminal wetland, and maximising the licence value and hence the water delivered to irrigators. A simple ecosystem response model of the wetland was developed for the purpose of this study, and consisted of a set of relationships between flow and a health score for River Red Gum.
   The methodology developed demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using MOO as a transparent process to explore the trade-offs between different objectives for river system planning. The conceptual model incorporates the major system complexities of conflicting water users, multiple supply storages, and GW/SW interactions. This model is therefore adaptable to an actual representation of the Lachlan catchment, as well as to other areas. These outcomes aid in bridging the gap between use of optimization for water resource decision-making in research and in practice.

AB  - The construction of estuary sluice has profound and adverse biological consequences through its effect on the hydrodynamic process and salinity gradient. Environmental flow plays an essential role in the conservation of the ecological environment, but its calculation methods remain biased towards the traditional single-target fish species. Consequently, these flows ignore the ecological requirements of different biological communities and therefore disregard the long-term perspective of the riverine and estuarine ecosystem. Actually, we found that once the sluice was built, the available habitat throughout the river would show a degradation by 81.55% for fish that produce floating eggs and 14.25% for fish that produce sticky eggs. In addition, changes in the distribution of salinity in estuaries and coastal waters caused by the closure of sluice indicated that the habitats of fish living in low-salinity areas would disappear. This study proposes an ecologically oriented multi-sluice system operation strategy that integrates the demands of fish with different living habits on environmental flow into the joint operation of a multi-sluice system to maintain different ecological functions throughout the Yongjiang River basin. The spawning habits of fish in the study area were investigated, and the differences in their adaptability to various hydrological factors were summarized. MIKE 21 model and PHABSIM were used to ascertain the environmental flow through the data of velocity, water depth, and salinity. Model predictions of the effective habitat were supplemented by the optimum selection, and the discharge of the Fenghua River was suggested to be 105 m(3)/s. Likewise, the survival salinity requirements revealed that the discharge of Yongjiang sluice should reach 250-300 m(3)/s. Results were used to design the joint ecological scheduling schemes, with the aiming of ensuring that the flow velocity of the entire migration channel can meet the requirements of facilitating the upstream movement of fish whilst keeping eggs floating. In the Considering the upstream ability of fish, the tidal law of the estuary and the planned discarded water of estuary sluice, it is suggested that during the spawning time, seven consecutive days of the ebb tide should be selected to carry out the joint operation of Fenghua, Yaojiang and Yongjiang River, and the flow constraint factors are 105, 100 and 250 m(3)/s, respectively.

AB  - Background: The movement behavior of an animal is determined by extrinsic and intrinsic factors that operate at multiple spatio-temporal scales, yet much of our knowledge of animal movement comes from studies that examine only one or two scales concurrently. Understanding the drivers of animal movement across multiple scales is crucial for understanding the fundamentals of movement ecology, predicting changes in distribution, describing disease dynamics, and identifying efficient methods of wildlife conservation and management.
   Methods: We obtained over 400,000 GPS locations of wild pigs from 13 different studies spanning six states in southern U.S.A., and quantified movement rates and home range size within a single analytical framework. We used a generalized additive mixed model framework to quantify the effects of five broad predictor categories on movement: individual-level attributes, geographic factors, landscape attributes, meteorological conditions, and temporal variables. We examined effects of predictors across three temporal scales: daily, monthly, and using all data during the study period. We considered both local environmental factors such as daily weather data and distance to various resources on the landscape, as well as factors acting at a broader spatial scale such as ecoregion and season.
   Results: We found meteorological variables (temperature and pressure), landscape features (distance to water sources), a broad-scale geographic factor (ecoregion), and individual-level characteristics (sex-age class), drove wild pig movement across all scales, but both the magnitude and shape of covariate relationships to movement differed across temporal scales.
   Conclusions: The analytical framework we present can be used to assess movement patterns arising from multiple data sources for a range of species while accounting for spatio-temporal correlations. Our analyses show the magnitude by which reaction norms can change based on the temporal scale of response data, illustrating the importance of appropriately defining temporal scales of both the movement response and covariates depending on the intended implications of research (e.g., predicting effects of movement due to climate change versus planning local-scale management). We argue that consideration of multiple spatial scales within the same framework (rather than comparing across separate studies post-hoc) gives a more accurate quantification of cross-scale spatial effects by appropriately accounting for error correlation.

AB  - Cryptobiotic soil crusts form the dominant cover of a unique system of dunes and intermittently inundated pans and playas situated on the Pleistocene Lake Thompson bed, in the western Mojave Desert, CA. Recent work has reported on basic ecological parameters including distribution, abundance, and species composition of these algal (cyanobacterial)dominated crusts as well as on their photosynthetic rates in laboratory studies. As a step toward building an ecological model for a natural resource management plan, we determined the photosynthetic rate of the crusts under field environmental conditions. We examined the relationship between the environmental conditions of crust moisture content (MC), temperature, and ambient CO? concentration on photosynthetic rates during the mid-spring and the late autumn. Maximal photosynthetic rates (P-max), which did not vary greatly with season, were 3.57 and 3.99 mu mol CO2 M-2 s(-1) for crusts on dunes and in pans, respectively. Mean photosynthetic rates for three types of crust on dunes, smooth and flat, pedicillated, and unconsolidated, were 1.31, 1.47, and 1.29 mu mol CO2 M-2 s(-1), respectively. P-max of crusts on dunes and pans occurred at soil MCs of 110% and 20%, respectively, both lower and higher MCs resulted in decreased rates of photosynthesis. The relation between atmospheric CO2 concentration and net photosynthesis was linear (r(2) = 0.88 and 0.97 for crusts on dunes and pans, respectively) through at least 1000ppm CO2, We measured positive net photosynthesis at temperatures from 0 to 46 degrees C and found no clear optimum within this range when crusts were provided with optimal moisture and light conditions. Photosynthetic rates in this field study were somewhat lower than those measured in the laboratory, but both optimum MC and the relation between ambient CO2 and net photosynthetic rate were similar. Respiration rates were generally less than 10% those of photosynthetic rates. Based on data herein and climatic information, we estimated the potential net primary productivity of crusts on dunes to be 11.7g Cm-2 yr(-1). The photosynthetic rate of the unconsolidated crust type, for which no data have been published, was similar to the other crust types. This finding, together with previous information that the chlorophyll values of this and other crust forms were similar, suggests that ecological studies, as well as conservation and restoration efforts, give these the same attention as the other crust types.

AB  - Agassiz's desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), a threatened species of the southwestern United States, has severely declined to the point where 76% of populations in critical habitat (Tortoise Conservation Areas) are below viability. The potential for rapid recovery of wild populations is low because females require 12-20 years to reach reproductive maturity and produce few eggs annually. We report on a 34-year mark-recapture study of tortoises initiated in 1979 at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area in the western Mojave Desert, California, USA, and provide substantive data on challenges faced by the species. In 1980, the United States Congress designated the Research Natural Area and protected the land from recreational vehicles, livestock grazing, and mining with a wildlife-permeable fence. The 7.77-km(2)study area, centered on interpretive facilities, included land both within the Natural Area and outside the fence. We expected greater benefits to accrue to the tortoises and habitat inside compared to outside. Our objectives were to conduct a demographic study, analyze and model changes in the tortoise population and habitat, and compare the effectiveness of fencing to protect populations and habitat inside the fence versus outside, where populations and habitat were unprotected. We conducted surveys in spring in each of 7 survey years from 1979, when the fence was under construction, through 2012. We compared populations inside to those outside the fence by survey year for changes in distribution, structure by size and relative age, sex ratios, death rates of adults, and causes of death for all sizes of tortoises. We used a Bayesian implementation of a Jolly Seber model for mark-recapture data. We modeled detection, density, growth and transition of tortoises to larger size-age classes, movements from inside the protective fence to outside and vice versa, and survival. After the second and subsequent survey years, we added surveys to monitor vegetation and habitat changes, conduct health assessments, and collect data on counts of predators and predator sign. At the beginning of the study, counts and densities for all sizes of tortoises were high, but densities were approximately 24% higher inside the fence than outside. By 2002, the low point in densities, densities had declined 90% inside the fence and 95% outside. Between 2002 and 2012, the population inside the fence showed signs of improving with a 54% increase in density. Outside the fence, densities remained low. At the end of the study, when we considered the initial differences in location, densities inside the fence were roughly 2.5 times higher than outside. The pattern of densities was similar for male and female adults. When evaluating survival by blocks of years, survivorship was higher in 1979-1989 than in 1989-2002 (the low point) and highest from 2002 to 2012. Recruitment and survival of adult females into the population was important for growing the population, but survival of all sizes, including juveniles, was also critical. Major events and activities driving the decline in populations both inside and outside the fence included illegal collecting, upper respiratory tract disease, and hyperpredation by the common raven (Corvus corax) on juvenile tortoises. Other sources of death were gunshots, vehicles, and predation by mammals. Outside the fence, fragmentation and deterioration of habitat was a critical driver.
   Between the first and last surveys, 2 different ecosystem processes were underway: recovery of vegetation and soils from grazing and vehicles inside the fence and continued deterioration outside the fence. Habitat outside the fence became increasingly denuded of shrubs and fragmented by roads and trails, and habitat fragments increased 50-fold. Outside the fence, biomass of non-native annual plants was higher and the cover of shrubs was lower, a reflection of ongoing deterioration. These changes and losses of habitat resulted in loss of shrub cover and sites for burrows, reduction in preferred food plants, and greater exposure to predators and extremes in temperature. Overall, the tortoise population and habitat inside the fence appeared to benefit from protection and showed signs of recovery at the end of the study. Fencing, control of vehicular access, and removal of livestock grazing were among several recommended management actions for critical habitat in the first recovery plan in 1994. At the end of the study, the Natural Area remained as 1 of 2 fenced, official protected areas for the species in the geographic range. We attribute fencing to continuing higher densities of adults inside the fence compared with outside the fence and promising signs of recovery. Densities of adults at the Natural Area also were 2.3 to 5.5 times higher than in 16 of the 17 Tortoise Conservation Areas (critical habitat units) within the geographic range.
