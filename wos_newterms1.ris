AB  - The Wild goat (Capra aegagrus) has had less attention and study than many other mammals, especially in Iraq. We collected comprehensive data about this species in Iraq, a total of 36 records, in order to build species distribution models using Maximum Entropy and seven environmental variables. The results confirm that suitable habitat is limited to the northeastern part of Iraq, especially the Zagros mountains of Kurdistan region/Iraq. Elevation most influenced the predicted distribution. Habitat suitability under different future climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for 2050 and 2070) is stable but expands compared with the current period. Areas of marginally and highly suitable decrease, while suitable habitat increases compared to the present. Habitat suitability inside existing Protected Areas was significantly higher than outside. Applying IUCN Red List criteria at the national scale, the species was classified as Endangered. The main short-term threat is, against which urgent action is needed to avoid future declines. We conclude that climate change is not likely to be a long-term threat to the Wild goat in Iraq, but urgent action to stop poaching is needed to sustain many Iraqi mammals, especially the Wild goat. Our applied approach can help understand and conserve other critical species in Iraq.

AB  - This study evaluates how a modelling approach to determine areas of suitable habitat for the Critically Endangered Albany cycad Encephalartos latifrons can assist in systematic conservation planning for this and other rare and threatened cycads. A map distinguishing suitable from unsuitable habitat for E. latifrons was produced and important environmental predictors (climate, geology, topography and vegetation) influencing the suitable habitat were estimated. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling technique was chosen for this study as it has consistently performed well compared with alternative modelling methods and is also an appropriate model choice when the sample size is small and locality records are relatively few. Predicted habitat suitability showed that some locations chosen for translocation and restoration of E. latifrons specimens are not suitable. This revealed that modelling suitable habitat can guide relocation and regeneration of E. latifrons and perhaps other threatened cycads with restricted distributions and few locality records. The species distribution model constructed for E. latifrons is the first reported habitat model for a Critically Endangered cycad in South Africa. The results may be incorporated into conservation planning and structured decision-making about translocations and restoration programmes involving vulnerable cycads, which are among the most threatened organisms globally.

AB  - Conservation interventions for threatened species must be based on accurate assessments of the effects of anthropogenic pressures on habitat suitability. We used multiscale multivariable species-distribution modeling to evaluate habitat suitability for an Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) population in Shangyong Reserve, Yunnan Province, southwestern China. We investigated the scales at which measurements of environmental variables best reflected elephant habitat selection, and examined whether these responses changed over 2 decades (2000-2010 and 2011-2020) in response to 20 environmental variables, including 14 variables reflecting landscape fragmentation, the extent of buildings, and transport infrastructure. Elephant presence was sensitive to the scale of each variable, and the effects differed among variables within and between decades. More than half of the variables influenced elephant presence at coarse scales of 8 or 16 km, including 12 variables reflecting anthropogenic pressures in 2000-2010 and 10 in 2011-2020. Overall, multivariate models with variables at their optimal scales had higher discrimination than models at uniformly fine scales of 1 km or 2 km. The extent of suitable habitat for elephants declined by 24% over 2 decades. Less than half of elephant habitat was located within Shangyong Reserve (49% in 2000-2010, 40% in 2011-2020), indicating the importance of managing suitable habitat beyond reserve boundaries. Roads and buildings reduced the probability of elephant presence, with effects that extended beyond their immediate footprint. We advocate that infrastructure be planned with buffers, >= 8 km wide, between roads or buildings and core elephant habitat. Multiscale multivariable species-distribution modeling should be employed to ensure that all suitable habitat for the remaining fragmented elephant populations in Yunnan is identified, mapped, and protected.

AB  - Rapid global change has increased interest in developing ways to identify suitable refugia for species of conservation concern. Correlative and mechanistic species distribution models (SDMs) represent two approaches to generate spatially-explicit estimates of climate vulnerability. Correlative SDMs generate distributions using statistical associations between environmental variables and species presence data. In contrast, mechanistic SDMs use physiological traits and tolerances to identify areas that meet the conditions required for growth, survival and reproduction. Correlative approaches assume modeled environmental variables influence species distributions directly or indirectly; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations are rarely verified empirically. We compared habitat suitability predictions between a correlative-only SDM, a mechanistic SDM and a correlative framework that incorporated mechanistic layers ('hybrid models'). Our comparison focused on green salamanders Aneides aeneus, a priority amphibian threatened by climate change throughout their disjunct range. We developed mechanistic SDMs using experiments to measure the thermal sensitivity of resistance to water loss (r(i)) and metabolism. Under current climate conditions, correlative-only, hybrid and mechanistic SDMs predicted similar overlap in habitat suitability; however, mechanistic SDMs predicted habitat suitability to extend into regions without green salamanders but known to harbor many lungless salamanders. Under future warming scenarios, habitat suitability depended on climate scenario and SDM type. Correlative and hybrid models predicted a 42% reduction or 260% increase in area considered to be suitable depending on the climate scenario. In mechanistic SDMs, energetically suitable habitat declined with both climate scenarios and was driven by the thermal sensitivity of r(i). Our study indicates that correlative-only and hybrid approaches produce similar predictions of habitat suitability; however, discrepancies can arise for species that do not occupy their entire fundamental niche, which may hold consequences of conservation planning of threatened species.

AB  - Natural habitats in urban areas provide benefits for both humans and biodiversity. However, to achieve biodiversity gains, we require new techniques to determine habitat suitability and ecological connectivity that will inform urban planning and development. Using an example of an urban population of water voles Arvicola amphibius, we developed a habitat suitability model and a resistance-surface-based model of landscape connectivity to identify potential connectivity between areas of suitable habitat. We then updated the environmental variables according to new urban development plans and used our models to generate spatially explicit predictions of both habitat suitability and connectivity. To make models accessible to urban and conservation planners, we developed an interactive mapping tool that provided users with a graphical user interface (GUI) to inform conservation planning for this species. The model found that habitat suitability for water voles was related to the proportion and distance from key environmental variables, such as built-up areas and urban green spaces, while the connectivity model identified important corridors connecting areas of potential distribution for this species. Future development plans altered the potential spatial distribution of the water vole population, reducing the extent of suitable habitat in some core areas. The interactive mapping tool made available suitable habitat and connectivity maps for conservation managers to assess new planning applications and for the development of a conservation action plan for water voles. Synthesis and applications. We believe this approach provides a framework for future development of nature conservation tools that can be used by planners to inform ecological decision-making, increase biodiversity and reduce human-wildlife conflict in urban environments.

AB  - If species distribution models (SDMs) can rank habitat suitability at a local scale, they may be a valuable conservation planning tool for rare, patchily distributed species. This study assessed the ability of Maxent, an SDM reported to be appropriate for modeling rare species, to rank habitat suitability at a local scale for four edaphic endemic rare plants of gabbroic soils in El Dorado County, California, and examined the effects of grain size, spatial extent, and fine-grain environmental predictors on local-scale model accuracy. Models were developed using species occurrence data mapped on public lands and were evaluated using an independent data set of presence and absence locations on surrounding lands, mimicking a typical conservation-planning scenario that prioritizes potential habitat on unsurveyed lands surrounding known occurrences. Maxent produced models that were successful at discriminating between suitable and unsuitable habitat at the local scale for all four species, and predicted habitat suitability values were proportional to likelihood of occurrence or population abundance for three of four species. Unfortunately, models with the best discrimination (i.e., AUC) were not always the most useful for ranking habitat suitability. The use of independent test data showed metrics that were valuable for evaluating which variables and model choices (e.g., grain, extent) to use in guiding habitat prioritization for conservation of these species. A goodness-of-fit test was used to determine whether habitat suitability values ranked habitat suitability on a continuous scale. If they did not, a minimum acceptable error predicted area criterion was used to determine the threshold for classifying habitat as suitable or unsuitable. I found a trade-off between model extent and the use of fine-grain environmental variables: goodness of fit was improved at larger extents, and fine-grain environmental variables improved local-scale accuracy, but fine-grain variables were not available at large extents. No single model met all habitat prioritization criteria, and the best models were overlaid to identify consensus areas of high suitability. Although the four species modeled here co-occur and are treated together for conservation planning, model accuracy and predicted suitable areas varied among species.

AB  - Protected areas help to decrease human impacts on threatened mammals but do not always include species' core habitats. Here we focus on the Vulnerable taruka Hippocamelus antisensis near the Atacama Desert, Chile, a population that is mainly threatened by interactions with local human communities. We develop a species distribution model for taruka and assess the contribution of protected areas to safeguarding its preferred habitat. From sightings (collected during 2004-2015), absence records (collected in 2014), and environmental variables, we determined that taruka habitat is scarce, highly fragmented and limited to humid areas. Only 7.7-11.2% of the taruka's core habitat is under protection. We recommend the establishment of a protected area in the south of Arica-Parinacota district, an area without settlements that lies within the taruka's core habitat, along with educational programmes, fencing of crops, and inclusion of communities in decision-making in areas where farmer-taruka interactions are negative.

AB  - To track future climate space, seed dispersal will be essential for plants, but dispersal ability is rarely measured or incorporated into species distribution models. Species distribution models (SDMs) can rank habitat suitability at a local scale, and they may be a valuable conservation planning tool for rare, patchily distributed species. Dispersal is essential for species to survive the threats of habitat destruction and climate change. Combining dispersal ability and habitat suitability at the landscape scale is important to understand and predict species spatial responses to environmental change. This study analyzed future species distributions based on habitat suitability and dispersal scenarios for 7 endangered and vulnerable taxa, using SDM and dispersal ability to predict the range of species distribution across central Italy in the near future 2050. Species distribution models (Ensembles of Small Models, ESMs) were carried out using 19 bioclimatic environmental variables downloaded from WorldClim 1.4. The study identified the most suitable area for this species in the central Apennines. The innovation of this study is the combination of SDMs with dispersal ability based on measured traits of local populations of rare species and subspecies. The main results show a combination of climate change with dispersal ability strongly affects the future potential distribution of the rare species. Thus, obtaining suitable and accessible areas in the near future possible is possible to identify the high suitable sites for the reinforcement of the natural population, ensuring habitat connectivity.

AB  - Species distribution models are an essential tool for biodiversity conservation, with important applications such as spatial prioritisation of conservation actions and elucidating relationships between environmental predictors and species responses. These models are most useful to conservation managers when they include factors that can be readily manipulated, such as fire. In this study, we collated a comprehensive dataset of mammal records from a fire-prone region in south-east Australia where mammals have suffered declines in recent decades. We used species distribution modelling to (1) determine the relative influence of climate, fire, vegetation and topography on ground-dwelling mammal distributions; (2) determine species responses to time since fire, and; (3) provide spatial predictions of habitat suitability for conservation planning. Climate was the predominant driver of habitat suitability for most species, although other factors were influential in some cases. Time since fire was an important factor driving the distribution of only two of 16 modelled species which were more likely to be recorded in recently burnt vegetation. Habitat suitability varied spatially among species however multi-species habitat suitability was highest in the drier and hotter eastern section of the landscape, highlighting a key area for conservation efforts. The outputs from our models can be used for practical conservation actions such as finding new populations or identifying sites for reintroductions. We conclude that presence-only species distribution models are useful for determining species fire responses, complementing more systematic methods, and that including dynamic variables, such as time since fire, can increase their conservation relevance.

AB  - Global biodiversity has already been altered by the climatic changes in various means like species migration, changes in habitat distribution, seasonality changes in phenology etc. In order to implement sustainable conservation or adaptation strategy, it is necessary to understand the impacts of climate change on both ecosystem and species level. Here we present an assessment on current and future habitat suitability distribution of Myristica dactyloides Gaertn. (MD), a medicinally and ecologically important tree species by using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model. The future predictions were done for the year 2050 and 2070 using the bioclimatic variables having 1 km spatial resolution from two different models of fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP5). This study was carried out in the Kolli hill, Eastern Ghats of India. The AUC values confirmed the accuracy of model prediction based on 22 occurrence points. Environmental variables' contributions were evaluated using jackknife test. The more influencing variables will be annual temperature, annual precipitation and precipitation of wettest month. Finally, this study found that there will be a significant reduction in the habitat suitability distribution of Myristica dactyloides in the year 2050 and 2070 in the study area. Hence with the performance of the model, this study found that MaxEnt could be an effective tool for species rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation planning in the light of climate change.

AB  - Tree species in mountainous areas are expected to shift their distribution upward in elevation in response to climate change, calling for a potential redesign of existing protected areas. This study aims to predict whether or not the distributions of two high-mountain tree species, Abies (Abies kawakamii) and Tsuga (Tsuga chinensis var. formosana), will significantly shift upward due to temperature change, and whether current protected areas will be suitable for conserving these species. Future temperature change was projected for 15 different future scenarios produced from five global climate models. Shifts in Abies and Tsuga distributions were then predicted through the use of species distribution models (SDMs) which included occurrence data of Abies and Tsuga, as well as seasonal temperature, and elevation. The 25 km x 25 km downscaled General Circulation Model (GCMs) data for 2020-2039 produced by the Taiwan Climate Change Projection and Information Platform was adopted in this study. Habitat suitability in the study area was calculated using maximum entropy model under different climatic scenarios. A bootstrap method was applied to assess the parameter uncertainty of the maximum entropy model. In comparison to the baseline projection, we found that there are significant differences in suitable habitat distributions for Abies and Tsuga under seven of the 15 scenarios. The results suggest that mountainous ecosystems will be substantially impacted by climate change. We also found that the uncertainty originating from GCMs and the parameters of the SDM contribute most to the overall level of variability in species distributions. Finally, based on the uncertainty analysis and the shift in habitat suitability, we applied systematic conservation planning approaches to identify suitable areas to add to Taiwan's protected area network.

AB  - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is responsible for reviewing the biological status of hundreds of species to determine federal status designations under the Endangered Species Act. The longleaf pine Pinus palustris ecological system supports many priority at-risk species designated for review, including five species of herpetofauna: gopher tortoise Gopherus polyphemus, southern hognose snake Heterodon simus, Florida pine snake Pituophis melanoleucus mugitus, gopher frog Lithobates (Rana) capito, and striped newt Notophthalmus perstriatus. To inform status decisions and conservation planning, we developed habitat suitability models to 1) identify habitat features that best predict species presence and 2) estimate the amount and distribution of suitable habitat across each species' range under current conditions. We incorporated expert judgment from federal, state, and other partners to capture variation in ecological settings across species' ranges, prioritize predictor variables to test in models, mitigate data limitations by informing the selection of pseudoabsence points, qualitatively evaluate model estimates, and improve the likelihood that experts will trust and use model predictions for conservation. Soil characteristics, land cover, and fire interval strongly influenced habitat suitability for all species. Suitable habitat was distributed on known species strongholds, as well as private lands without known species records. Between 4.7% (gopher frog) and 14.6% (gopher tortoise) of the area in a species' range was classified as suitable habitat, and between 28.1% (southern hognose snake) and 47.5% (gopher frog) of suitable habitat was located in patches larger than 1 km(2) (100 ha) on publicly owned lands. By overlaying predictions for each species, we identified areas of suitable habitat for multiple species on protected and unprotected lands. These results have direct applications to management and conservation planning: partners can tailor site-level management based on attributes associated with high habitat suitability for species of concern; allocate survey effort in areas with suitable habitat but no known species records; and identify priority areas for management, land acquisitions, or other strategies based on the distribution of species records, suitable habitat, and land protection status. These results can aid regional partners in implementing effective conservation strategies and inform status designation decisions of the USFWS.

AB  - Understanding patterns in freshwater mussel distributions and habitat use, particularly for imperiled species, is critical for their conservation. To aid in management of imperiled mussels, and to demonstrate the utility using both landscape-based and biotic predictors in assessing species habitat suitability, we modeled 11 imperiled mussels in rivers of Michigan, USA. Models were developed with MaxEnt using a combination of host fish richness, natural abiotic reach variables, and landscape-based natural and anthropogenic variables. Because potential host fishes are important biological determinants of mussel distributions, fluvial host fish distributions (n = 37) were modeled and integrated as a predictor in mussel models. Key predictors determining habitat suitability for mussels included host fish richness, a strong positive predictor for 8 of 11 mussel species, stream discharge, urban land use, and upstream dam density. Models predicted 853 to 10,138 stream km of suitable habitat (1.1 to 13.6% of the state's stream length) for the 11 mussel species, with 54 to 1,382 km (0.1 to 1.8%) being considered highly suitable habitat. Mapping of suitable habitats identified streams with available habitat for multiple listed species, allowing for more informed decisions in conservation planning and management of Michigan's listed freshwater mussels and their fish hosts.

AB  - Models that predict the distributions and habitat suitability for species of conservation concern can be useful for guiding survey, monitoring, and conservation planning efforts. The Humboldt marten (Martes caurina humboldtensis) has significantly declined throughout its historical range in coastal California and Oregon and this taxon is known from a few remnant populations. We developed a landscape habitat suitability model to identify areas of suitable habitat not yet surveyed, to provide a template for designing monitoring programs and research studies, and to inform the development of a conservation strategy. We used the results of 1,159 occupancy surveys to develop a predictive habitat model using Generalized Additive Modeling to relate Humboldt marten detections to combinations of environmental and habitat attributes hypothesized to influence marten distribution. We measured 30 candidate variables at three spatial scales, using 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 km, and although several models were competitive, each contained the same three core variables: old growth structural index measured at the 1-km scale, serpentine habitat measured at the 3-km scale, and annual precipitation measured at the 3-km scale. The final model had an overall correct classification rate of 91% for marten detections, 82% for non-detections and a true skill statistic of 0.73. Model predictions were stable when cross-validated, with the correct classification of marten detections (89%) varying little. The largest complexes of predicted suitable habitat occurred in the areas with the three extant marten populations (north coastal California, south coastal Oregon, and central coastal Oregon), however connectivity of suitable habitat to areas outside these three areas appears limited.

AB  - Climate change is anticipated to alter both wildlife distributions and their movement patterns, due to shifts, loss, and fragmentation of habitat, increasing the risk of extinction for many endangered species. Therefore, climate change must be integrated into wildlife conservation strategies. Using the case study of Asian elephants in China, we used the maximum entropy model to assess habitat suitability by incorporating current and future (2050s) bioclimatic and environmental variables. We then delineated climate refugia where suitable habitat overlapped under both scenarios. Then, we use circuit theory model to analyse potential movement by elephants (through measuring current flow), by linking current habitats and future habitats. Our results showed that current suitable habitat covers an area of about 5228.18 km(2), of which 45.71% is projected to be lost by 2050 due to climate change, leaving 2836.76 km(2). Just 327.2 km(2) new suitable habitat was projected in 2050s. Climate refugia covered 2509.56 km(2), and were mainly located in Mengyang and Shangyong reserves and their surrounding regions. Moreover, maps connecting suitable habitats under current and 2050s identified different regions delineated as important for the potential movement of elephants, which mainly distributed in regions of climate refugia. We proposed various actions to ameliorate the predicted impacts of climate change on Asian elephant, including protecting suitable habitat within regions where elephant are currently distributed, establishing corridors between areas where elephant are distributed, creating cross-boundary protected areas, and translocating elephants. This approach could be applied to the conservation planning of other wildlife, especially for umbrella species that support high biodiversity. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Models relating species distribution records to environmental variables are increasingly applied to biodiversity conservation. Such techniques could be valuable to predict the distribution, abundance or habitat requirements of species that are rare or otherwise difficult to survey. However, despite widely-documented positive intraspecific relationships between occupancy and abundance, few studies have demonstrated convincing associations between models of habitat suitability based on species occurrence, and observed measures of habitat quality such as abundance. Here we compared models based on field-derived abundance and distribution (presence-absence) data for a rare mountain butterfly in 2006-2008. Both model types selected consistent effects of environmental variables, which corresponded to known ecological associations of the species, suggesting that abundance and distribution may be a function of similar factors. However, the models based on occurrence data identified stronger effects of a smaller number of environmental variables, indicating less uncertainty in the factors controlling distribution. Furthermore, cross-validation of the models using observed abundance data from different years, or averaged across years, suggested a marginally stronger ability of models based on occurrence data to predict observed abundance. The results suggest that, for some species, distribution models could be efficient tools for estimating habitat quality in conservation planning or management, when information on abundance or habitat requirements is costly or impractical to obtain.

AB  - Predicting the suitable habitat of a species is one of the adequate and enhancing approach in biodiversity conservation planning and implementation. Species habitat distribution is closely linked with environmental factors and bioclimatic variables used as prediction variables in species distribution models (SDMs). Recent application of satellite remote sensing data and the bioclimatic variables has created an advanced way to improve the SDMs performance. In this study, MaxEnt was used to predict species habitat distribution. Our objectives are to assess the application of satellite remote sensing data in predicting the potential habitat suitability of the arid plant species. We have selected Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce (Ghaf), the national tree of the UAE. We have chosen 33 environmental variables along with 90 species occurrences and for the final model simulation we have used three modeling scenarios. MaxEnt results showed that the model simulation with all key variables has substantially improved the potential habitat suitability prediction with a mean Area Under receiver operating Curve (AUC) value of 0.984, indicating a better predictive accuracy in the integration of satellite remote sensing data, edaphic variables and topographic parameters. Model results showed that the spatial proportions of the potential habitat suitability in the UAE consisted of high (2%), medium (6%) and low (9%) habitat suitability classes. The MaxEnt results revealed that precipitation of the coldest quarter (32.5%), NDVI (12.1%) and elevation (8%), had significant contribution to the potential habitat distribution of UAE Ghaf trees. Cold season precipitation is the most significant climate constraint on the habitat distribution. The most habitat suitability of Ghaf tree in the UAE was within a certain range of NDVI, LST, elevation, aspect, and precipitation patterns. This paper finding could be useful for environmental managers for implementing reforestation not only in UAE but also for the entire middle eastern regions with similar hyper arid conditions.

AB  - Habitat suitability (HS) of target species is assessed in the coastal region of Seno de Corcubion, including Os Minarzos Marine Protected Area (MPA) in west Galicia, NW of Spain. Current MPA was outlined using local environmental knowledge (LEK). Our objective is to test whether maximization of HS of 12 species would select the same MPA as fishers' LEK. A detailed capture database and 13 layers summarizing ecogeographic variables (derived from bathymetry, satellite data and sea bottom classification map) have been used and several Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) Species Distribution Models (SDM) have been tested to find the best HS prediction (according to a nonparametric index due to Boyce). Our SDM results show that the LEK defined MPA (comprising 20% of the total area) is over 70% more suitable than the rest of the region for all species but one (European seabass, only 40%). We conclude that stakeholders LEK methodology correctly identifies local species habitats, and that SDM, and in particular ENFA models, can be used to validate and keep track of the MPA boundaries.

AB  - In recent years, predictive habitat distribution models, derived by combining multivariate statistical analyses with Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, have been recognised for their utility in conservation planning. The size and spatial arrangement of suitable habitat can influence the long-term persistence of some faunal species. In southwestern Victoria, Australia, populations of the rare swamp antechinus (Antechinus minimus maritimus) are threatened by further fragmentation of suitable habitat. In the current study, a spatially explicit habitat suitability model was developed for A. minimus that incorporated a measure of vegetation structure. Models were generated using logistic regression with species presence or absence as the dependent variable and landscape variables, extracted from both GIS data layers and multi-spectral digital imagery, as the predictors. The most parsimonious model, based on the Akaike Information Criterion, was spatially extrapolated in the GIS. Probability of species presence was used as an index of habitat suitability. A negative association between A. minimus presence and both elevation and habitat complexity was evidenced, suggesting a preference for relatively low altitudes and a vegetation structure of low vertical complexity. The predictive performance of the selected model was shown to be high (91 %), indicating a good fit of the model to the data. The proportion of the study area predicted as suitable habitat for A. minimus (Probability of occurrence greater than or equal to0.5) was 11.7%. Habitat suitability maps not only provide baseline information about the spatial arrangement of potentially suitable habitat for a species, but they also help to refine the search for other populations, making them an important conservation tool.

AB  - Natural habitats of Southeastern Iran are threatened by both natural and anthropogenic pressures such as longterm drought, dust storms, and land use change. Surveys on habitat suitability of vulnerable species and integration of protected areas have raised alarm over potential species extinction and geographical isolation of populations. Reducing the threats of human activities on sensitive terrestrial and coastal ecosystems requires integrated planning and management of terrestrial and coastal protected areas, however many of these areas have been selected and managed independently. Selecting coastal protected areas network require a systematic conservation planning approach, to reduce the development impacts on sensitive habitats. Therefore, this study aimed to identify an optimized integrative network of terrestrial and coastal protected areas in southeast Iran. An attempt was made to maximize biodiversity conservation, reduce the isolation of populations, and increase the resilience of the region's natural habitats to new development plans by including coastal habitats meeting the requirements of key species. Firstly, suitable habitats for seven key species were simulated by Species Distribution Models (SDMs) performed via Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), Random Forest (RF), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models fitted with 20 ecological and anthropogenic variables. A habitat suitability map was produced by integrating the SDM-derived habitat suitability maps with the suitable extents identified for egg-laying green sea turtle and potential habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic birds. An attempt was then made for selecting new terrestrial and coastal protected areas using the simulated annealing algorithm under six scenarios. All SDMs exhibited promising performances in predicting the distribution of suitable habitats with AUC values of above 0.8 and the discrimination power of GBM and RF was higher than that of the other SDMs. In total, more than 34 percent of the study area, along the coastline, was categorized as sensitive or extremely sensitive habitat. An east-west habitat corridor presently unprotected playing an important role in connecting habitats needs to be safeguarded to maintain regional biodiversity. Moreover, our study revealed that the majority of suitable habitats with high potential for sensitive species are not currently protected by the existing protected area network.

AB  - We tried to model habitat suitability of two prey and predator species including wild sheep (Ovis orientalis) and wolf (Canis lupus) in Varjin protected area located in northern east of Tehran using a presence only method, maximum entropy (MaxEnt). Totally 11 environmental variables were measured in the species presence points which can be classified in three groups including topographical, vegetation and distal variables. Resulted maps indicated that habitat variables such as slope (ranging from 35 to 40 percent) and elevation (lower than 1700 meters above sea level) are both institute those factors which mostly affect studied prey and predator habitat use. Our results regarding prey and predator geographical range of used habitat indicated that wolves cover most area than wild sheep which show more dispersed habitat resources for the prey species. ENMTools test revealed that wolf's niche breadth is more than twice as much as wild sheep's. Wild sheep in Varjin protected area has a relatively narrow geographical extent and shows a tendency to marginal habitats while wolves cover obviously more areas which denotes its high mobility and low dependency to specific habitats.

AB  - AimThe Asiatic cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus venaticus, a critically endangered large felid, has disappeared from vast tracks of its historical range across south-western Asia. It is currently confined to the arid ecosystems of central Iran for which little is known about its distribution and habitat linkages. We proposed the first evaluation of Asiatic cheetah's distribution and developed models of landscape suitability and connectivity to inform future conservation planning.
   LocationCentral Iran.
   MethodsWe analysed presence data of a 14-year-long cheetah monitoring programme according to environmental and anthropogenic factors, and generated an ensemble model of habitat suitability based on seven species distribution models (SDMs). We then used the concept of circuit theory and landscape connectivity prioritization (LCP) on resultant core habitats and landscape suitability to evaluate potential linkages between core areas.
   ResultsCore habitats, that is, the areas hosting the largest continuous suitable habitats for Asiatic cheetahs, covered approximately 49,144km(2) (c. 6.3% of the study area). Availability of prey species, avoidance of human-dominated areas and their infrastructures, and rough landscapes covered with sparse vegetation were the most predictive factors of the core habitats for the last cheetah population in Asia. Although relatively vast, the area of potential core habitats available to cheetahs appeared to be fragmented with limited connectivity between the northern and southern parts of this distribution.
   Main conclusionsOur approach highlights the importance of distribution models to recognize, at a coarse-scale level, a spatial population structure and habitat suitability characteristics for a large carnivore surviving at very low density. We have identified specific areas of suitable habitat where developing new landscape protection and adaptive conservation management; and improving the safety of important linkages between core habitats are likely to promote the conservation of the last surviving population of cheetah in Asia.

AB  - The Asian elephant has been listed as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List since 1986. In Peninsular Malaysia, the elephant population continues to decline, threatened by habitat degradation. Distinguishing their potential habitats is important in mitigating the impacts of forest fragmentation. This study aimed to predict the potential habitats of elephants in the fragmented forest landscape of Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve and to identify its characteristics. Habitat suitability was evaluated using several environmental variables--elevation, slope, land use, lithology, distance to river and distance from urban areas. The results showed that the distribution of suitable habitats mainly occurred in the eastern region of the study area. Elephant habitat prediction, using maximum entropy modelling, indicated that their most suitable habitat was located in a forested area that was greatly influenced by altitude and river proximity, while urban and agricultural areas cause forest fragmentation and restricted suitability. The prediction of wildlife habitats using maximum entropy modelling is a favourable and effective tool for improving the management and conservation planning of wildlife in the region.

AB  - With estimates of fewer than 1000 mature individuals in the wild, the critically endangered Siamese crocodile, Crocodylus siamensis Schneider, 1801, is one of the least known and at the same time most threatened crocodilian species in the world. Populations have already been depleted to approximately 20% of their former size with habitat destruction, alterations, and loss being the main drivers of population declines. Habitat suitability models were computed using a combination of bioclimatic and remote sensing variables as environmental predictors to evaluate habitat suitability and coverage by designated protected areas across the species' distributional range. In addition, population connectivity as well as current and future habitat fragmentation through dam construction was assessed by performing population connectivity models. Habitat suitability models show the spatial extent of suitable habitat to be high (46%), although only a small proportion is covered by designated reserves (11%). Population connectivity models showed remnant populations to be highly fragmented. Considering habitat suitability, coverage of reserves and population connectivity the lower Mekong River Basin stretching from the Xe Champhon and Xe Xangxoy rivers in Lao PDR to the Srepok and Sekong rivers in eastern Cambodia seem to be particularly important for future conservation prioritization for C. siamensis. The presently established protected area network is unsatisfactory in terms of size and population connectivity and needs to be significantly improved to successfully sustain viable populations of the critically endangered Siamese crocodile in the future.

AB  - The widespread use of spatial planning tools in conjunction with increases in the availability of geographic information systems and associated data has led to the rapid growth in the exploration and application of species distribution models. Conservation professionals can choose from a considerable number of modelling techniques, but there has been relatively little evaluation of predictive performance, data requirements, or type of inference of these models. Empirical data for woodland caribou Rangifier tarandus caribou was used to examine four species distribution models, namely a qualitative habitat suitability index and quantitative resource selection function, Mahalanobis distance and ecological niche models. Models for three sets of independent variables were developed and then a temporally independent set of caribou locations evaluated predictive performance. The similarity of species distribution maps among the four modelling approaches was also quantified. All of the quantitative species distribution models were good predictors of the validation data set, but the spatial distribution of mapped habitats differed considerably among models. These results suggest that choice of model and variable set could influence the identification of areas for conservation emphasis. Model choice may be limited by the type of species locations or desired inference. Conservation professionals should choose a model and variable set based on the question, the ecology of the species and the availability of requisite data.

AB  - We explored the usefulness of three satellite land cover data sets available to land managers in south-central Sweden for conservation planning using four deciduous forest focal resident bird species with different habitat requirements. Habitat suitability models using empirical species-specific habitat parameters and a Geographic Information System were applied to evaluate and compare the degree of consistency among three different land cover data sets. The study area encompassed 10,000 km(2) in a landscape mosaic of managed boreal forests and is within the distribution range of all four focal species. Although the three land cover data sets indicated similar total amounts of deciduous forest, the habitat suitability models showed that different land cover data yielded inconsistent results regarding the amount and distribution of suitable habitat within 5x5 km grid cells. Given this sensitivity to the choice of land cover data sets, the habitat suitability models showed positive relationships among the selected focal species for each land cover data set separately. As expected, decreasing amounts of suitable habitat were identified for species with higher specialisation. Thus, because habitat suitability models are an appropriate way to gain insight into the functionality and connectivity of habitat networks, land cover data must be carefully evaluated and if necessary combined with other landscape information for effective conservation planning.

AB  - 1. Range maps represent the geographic distribution of species, and they are commonly used to determine species coverage within protected areas and to find additional places needing protection. However, range maps are characterized by commission errors, where species are thought to be present in locations where they are not. When available, habitat suitability models can reduce commission errors in range maps, but these models are not always available. Adopting a coarse spatial resolution is often seen as an alternative approach for reducing the effect of commission errors, but this comes with poorly explored conservation trade-offs.
   2. Here, we characterize these trade-offs by identifying scenarios of protected area expansion for the world's threatened terrestrial mammals under different resolutions (10-200 km) and distribution data deriving from range maps and habitat suitability models.
   3. We found that planning new protected areas using range maps results in an overestimation of the species protection level when compared with habitat suitability models (which are more closely related to species presence). This overestimation increases when more area is selected for protection and is higher when higher spatial resolutions are employed.
   4. Adopting coarse resolutions reduced the overestimation of species protection and also halved the spatial incongruence between protected areas prioritized from range maps or habitat suitability models. However, this came at a very high cost, with an area of up to four times greater (12 M km(2) vs. 3 M km (2)) needed to adequately protect all species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that adopting coarse resolutions in protected area planning results in unsustainable increases in costs, with limited benefits in terms of reducing the effect of commission errors in species range maps. We recommend that, if some level of uncertainty is acceptable to practitioners, using range maps at resolutions of 20-30 km is the best compromise for reducing the effect of commission errors while maintaining cost-efficiency in conservation analyses.

AB  - To be effective, management of protected areas should be based on the best available evidence, including the scientific literature and expert knowledge. However, lack of such evidence in a suitable form to support decision-making may hinder effective management. Here we examine the use of Bayesian networks to support the management of protected areas, through the development of habitat suitability models for eight species of conservation concern. Bayesian networks were constructed on the basis of the scientific literature and expert knowledge, and were then tested using results from a field survey. Models of all species demonstrated very high discrimination between presence and absence sites, as indicated by AUC values >0.8, with values >0.9 obtained for four species, and Kappa values in the range of 0.4-0.9. The Bayesian networks were then used to examine the impact of different management interventions on habitat suitability of each species, including tree cutting, grazing and burning. Species differed in terms of their sensitivity to different management interventions, and model output provided evidence of both negative and positive interactions between types of intervention. These results highlight the trade-offs that must often be made when undertaking conservation management, and demonstrate the value of Bayesian networks in helping to make such trade-offs explicit. The identification of management impacts through analysis of available evidence also demonstrates the value of Bayesian networks for supporting evidence-based approaches to protected area management.

AB  - Setting operational targets for the protection of species is crucial for identifying conservation priorities and for monitoring conservation actions' effectiveness. The use of quantitative targets for global species conservation has grown in the past ten years as a response to the commitment of reducing extinction rates established by the Convention on Biological Diversity. We reviewed the use of conservation targets in global scale conservation analyses, and found that most of the publications adopted species representation targets, corresponding to an amount of area to be protected. We found no work adequately targeting species' persistence, i.e. the complement to species extinction risk. Despite the adoption of pragmatic population targets, consisting in a number of individuals to be protected, has been recently proposed for global species conservation, the use of these targets at the species level is not always warranted. Pros and cons of using population persistence targets for species conservation have been discussed, yet the fundamental issue of how to scale these targets from populations to species is still unresolved. We discuss the process of "scaling up" population persistence targets to the species level using habitat distribution models, and test our approach in a case study on the European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus). We identified three main steps to be followed: (i) definition of a population target, (ii) characterisation of the species' populations by means of a habitat suitability model, and (iii) definition of a scaled species target. An up-scaled species target should include multiple conditions reflecting species persistence (number, size, location of the populations to be protected), uniqueness (e.g. evolutionary potential) and representativeness (e.g. presence in different ecosystems). Adopting scaled up species persistence targets within conservation planning approaches can allow protected area plans to give the highest contribution to reducing global species extinction risk.

AB  - Generalizable methods that identify suitable aquatic habitat across large river basins and regions are needed to inform resource management. Habitat suitability models intersect environmental variables to predict species occurrence, but are often data intensive and thus are typically developed at small spatial scales. This study estimated mean monthly aquatic habitat suitability throughout Utah (USA) for Bonneville Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii utah) and Bluehead Sucker (Catostomus discobolus) with publicly available, geospatial datasets. We evaluated 15 habitat suitability models using unique combinations of percent of mean annual discharge, velocity, gradient, and stream temperature. Environmental variables were validated with observed conditions and species presence observations to verify habitat suitability estimates. Stream temperature, gradient, and discharge best predicted Bonneville Cutthroat Trout presence, and gradient and discharge best predicted Bluehead Sucker presence. Simple aquatic habitat suitability models outperformed models that used only streamflow to estimate habitat for both species, and are useful for conservation planning and water resources decision-making. This modeling approach could enable resource managers to prioritize stream restoration across vast regions within their management domain, and is potentially compatible with water management modeling to improve ecological objectives in management models.

AB  - The large, habitat-forming bubblegum coral, Paragorgia arborea, is a vulnerable marine ecosystem indicator with an antitropical distribution. Dense aggregations of the species have been protected from bottom-contact fishing in the Scotian Shelf bioregion off Nova Scotia, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Recently, basin-scale habitat suitability ensemble modeling has projected an alarming loss of 99% of suitable habitat for this species across the North Atlantic by 2100. Here, a regional reassessment of the predicted distribution of this species in the bioregion, using both machine learning (random forest) and generalized additive model (GAM) frameworks, including projection to 2046-2065, was undertaken. Extrapolation diagnostics were applied to determine the degree to which the models projected into novel covariate space (i.e., extrapolation) in order to avoid erroneous inferences. The best predictors of the species' distribution were a suite of temporally-invariant terrain variables that identified suitable habitat along the upper continental slope. Additional predictors, projected to vary with future ocean climatologies, identified areas of the upper slope in the eastern portion of the study area that will remain within suitable ranges for P. arborea at least through to the mid-century. Additionally, 3-D Lagrangian particle tracking simulations indicated potential for both connectivity among known occurrence sites and existing protected areas, and for colonization of unsurveyed areas predicted to have suitable habitat, from locations of known occurrence. These results showed that extirpation of this iconic species from the Scotian Shelf bioregion is unlikely over the next decades. Potential climate refugia were identified and results presented in the context of protected area network design properties of representativity, connectivity, adequacy, viability and resilience.

AB  - Antipatharia are a diverse group of corals with many species found in deep water. Many Antipatharia are habitat for associates, have extreme longevity and some species can occur beyond 8500 m depth. As they are major constituents of coral gardens', which are Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs), knowledge of their distribution and environmental requirements is an important pre-requisite for informed conservation planning particularly where the expense and difficulty of deep-sea sampling prohibits comprehensive surveys.
   This study uses a global database of Antipatharia distribution data to perform habitat suitability modelling using the Maxent methodology to estimate the global extent of black coral habitat suitability. The model of habitat suitability is driven by temperature but there is notable influence from other variables of topography, surface productivity and oxygen levels.
   This model can be used to predict areas of suitable habitat, which can be useful for conservation planning. The global distribution of Antipatharia habitat suitability shows a marked contrast with the distribution of specimen observations, indicating that many potentially suitable areas have not been sampled, and that sampling effort has been disproportionate to shallow, accessible areas inside marine protected areas (MPAs). Although 25% of Antipatharia observations are located in MPAs, only 7-8% of predicted suitable habitat is protected, which is short of the Convention on Biological Diversity target to protect 10% of ocean habitats by 2020.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether limited occurrence data for highly threatened species can provide useful spatial information to inform conservation. The study was conducted across central and southern China. We developed a habitat suitability model for the Critically Endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) based on one biotic and three abiotic parameters from single-site locality records, which represent the only relevant environmental data available for this species. We then validated model quality by testing whether increased percentage of predicted suitable habitat at the county level correlated with independent data on giant salamander presence. We randomly selected 48 counties containing historical records which were distinct from, and independent of, the single-site records used to develop the model, and 47 additional counties containing >50% predicted suitable habitat. We interviewed 2,812 respondents near potential giant salamander habitat across these counties and tested for differences in respondent giant salamander reports between counties selected using each method. Our model predicts that suitable giant salamander habitat is found widely across central and southern China, with counties containing 50% predicted suitable habitat distributed in 13 provinces. Counties with historical records contain significantly more predicted suitable habitat than counties without historical records. There are no statistical differences in any patterns of respondent giant salamander reports in surveyed counties selected from our model compared with the areas of known historical giant salamander distribution. A Chinese giant salamander habitat suitability model with strong predictive power can be derived from the restricted range of environmental variables associated with limited available presence-only occurrence records, constituting a cost-effective strategy to guide spatial allocation of conservation planning. Few reported sightings were recent, however, with most being over 20 years old, so that identification of areas of suitable habitat does not necessarily indicate continued survival of the species at these locations.

AB  - The biodiversity crisis caused by global warming is becoming more and more serious. Thus, many species are facing the crisis of survival, and some species are even on the verge of extinction. To scientifically evaluate the impact of global warming on the distribution, management and protection of Chinese Beech, the habitat suitability of 7 Chinese Beech species was simulated based on 853 literature distribution sites and 11 environmental factors under the current, 2070 RCP2.6 and 2070 RCP8.5 climate conditions and evaluated using ArcGIS 10.2 technology and the MaxEnt model. The results showed that (1) three environmental factors, namely, Precipitation of the Driest Quarter, Minimum Temperature of the Coldest Month and Mean Diurnal Range, were the key factors that influencing the distribution of Chinese Beech; (2) the total current area of suitable habitat of Chinese Beech was about 78615.60 km(2), and only about 9527.36 km(2) was located in protected areas (12.12%); (3) with the continuous warming of the climate, the suitable habitat of Chinese Beech could lose up to 59.24%, and the protected area would be decreasing continuously. Under the best and the most extreme climate scenarios for 2070, the suitable habitat area of Chinese Beech was reduced by 33386.90 km(2) and 46573.50 km(2), respectively, and the protected area decreased by 2,362.22 km(2) and 5,056.40 km(2), respectively. (4) The highly suitable habitat was projected to move the northwest and high altitude areas. Consequently, the protection of Chinese Beech is urgently required.

AB  - Presence-only models such as Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) compare distributions of environmental variables and species, generating habitat suitability (HS) maps. Here, we determined the factors affecting distribution of southern giant petrels (SGP) from northern Patagonian colonies (Isla Arce: 45 degrees 00'S; 65 degrees 29'W, and Isla Gran Robredo: 45 degrees 08'S; 66 degrees 03'W) using ENFA, improving estimates of their potential year-round feeding habitats. Data on movements of 17 adult and 9 first-year juvenile SGP were gathered using satellite telemetry. Model ecogeographical variables (EGV) overlapped the tracked animals. The resulting HS maps included most of the tracking locations along the Argentinean Shelf and reflected characteristics that congregate procellariiformes elsewhere. Wind conditions and primary productivity shaped foraging HS of petrels over the year. However, different EGVs influenced this population differently depending on the requirements of their life stage. For example, juveniles showed high marginality ( values of EGVs different from the mean values available). Breeding adults' HS was determined by a small range of values within those available, showing high specializations. Contrarily, wintering petrels showed

AB  - Knowledge about climate change impacts on species distribution at national scale is critical to biodiversity conservation and design of management programs. Although China is a biodiversity hot spot in the world, potential influence of climate change on Chinese protected birds is rarely studied. Here, we assess the impact of climate change on 108 protected bird species and nature reserves using species distribution modeling at a relatively fine spatial resolution (1 km) for the first time. We found that a large proportion of protected species would have potential suitable habitat shrink and northward range shift by 77-90 km in response to projected future climate change in 2080. Southeastern China would suffer from losing climate suitability, whereas the climate conditions in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and northeastern China were projected to become suitable for more protected species. On average, each protected area in China would experience a decline of suitable climate for 3-4 species by 2080. Climate change will modify which species each protected area will be suitable for. Our results showed that the risk of extinction for Chinese protected birds would be high, even in the moderate climate change scenario. These findings indicate that the management and design of nature reserves in China must take climate change into consideration.

AB  - Endangered species conservation planning needs to consider the effects of future climate change. Species distribution models are commonly used to predict future shifts in habitat suitability. We evaluated the effects of climate change on the highly endangered mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) using a variety of modeling approaches, and assessing model outputs from the perspective of three spatial habitat management strategies: status quo, expansion and relocation. We show that alternative assumptions about the ecological niche of mountain gorillas can have a very large effect on model predictions. ` Standard' correlative models using 18 climatic predictor variables suggested that by 2090 there would be no suitable habitat left for the mountain gorilla in its existing parks, whereas a `limiting-factor' model, that uses a proxy of primary productivity, suggested that climate suitability would not change much. Species distribution models based on fewer predictor variables, on alternative assumptions about niche conservatism (including or excluding the other subspecies Gorilla beringii graueri), and a model based on gorilla behavior, had intermediate predictions. These alternative models show strong variation, and, in contrast to the standard approach with 18 variables, suggest that mountain gorilla habitat in the parks may remain suitable, that protected areas could be expanded into lower (warmer) areas, and that there might be climactically suitable habitat in other places where new populations could possibly be established. Differences among model predictions point to avenues for model improvement and further research. Similarities among model predictions point to possible areas for climate change adaptation management. For species with narrow distributions, such as the mountain gorilla, modeling the impact of climate change should be based on careful evaluation of their biology, particularly of the factors that currently appear to limit their distribution, and should avoid the naive application of standard correlative methods with many predictor variables.

AB  - Alterations of riparian areas of running waters resulted in fragmentation of the riverscape. The possible impact of climate change additionally stresses the importance for conservation planning for riparian habitats, especially for sessile plant species. The survival of species under changing habitat availability can be counteracted by ensuring functional connectivity of riparian plant species. This study applies a coupled modelling framework using species distribution models and dispersal simulations, which allow to analyze the potential future distribution of species in relation to their ecological niche, life history traits including dispersal abilities as well as barriers to dispersal such as dams. Modelled suitable habitats for six riparian plant species characteristic for the olive willow plant community (Salicion elaeagni) showed dramatic changes under the impact of two climate change scenarios. While habitat suitability remained low for species with a narrow ecological niche, it increased under climate change scenarios for species which are also found in secondary habitat outside riparian areas. Simulations of dispersal to the potential future habitat revealed nevertheless high numbers of decolonized cells after 80 years of dispersal for species with high future habitat suitability. This stresses the importance of a joint investigation of the habitat suitability under climate change scenarios, dispersal parameters as well as life history traits for conservation planning of riparian species. The simulated future distribution revealed that barriers along rivers have a significant negative effect on the spread of the studied plant species. Our results suggest that conservation management should focus on providing connected stepping stone habitats for riparian plant species along rivers, as current species occurrences are not persistent over time.

AB  - Many species have already experienced distributional shifts due to changing environmental conditions, and analyzing past shifts can help us to understand the influence of environmental stressors on a species as well as to analyze the effectiveness of conservation strategies. We aimed to (1) quantify regional habitat associations of the California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica); (2) describe changes in environmental variables and gnatcatcher distributions through time; (3) identify environmental drivers associated with habitat suitability changes; and (4) relate habitat suitability changes through time to habitat conservation plans. Southern California's Western Riverside County (WRC), an approximately 4,675km(2) conservation planning area. We assessed environmental correlates of distributional shifts of the federally threatened California gnatcatcher (hereafter, gnatcatcher) using partitioned Mahalanobis D-2 niche modeling for three time periods: 1980-1997, 1998-2003, and 2004-2012, corresponding to distinct periods in habitat conservation planning. Highly suitable gnatcatcher habitat was consistently warmer and drier and occurred at a lower elevation than less suitable habitat and consistently had more CSS, less agriculture, and less chaparral. However, its relationship to development changed among periods, mainly due to the rapid change in this variable. Likewise, other aspects of highly suitable habitat changed among time periods, which became cooler and higher in elevation. The gnatcatcher lost 11.7% and 40.6% of highly suitable habitat within WRC between 1980-1997 to 1998-2003, and 1998-2003 to 2004-2012, respectively. Unprotected landscapes lost relatively more suitable habitat (-64.3%) than protected landscapes (30.5%). Over the past four decades, suitable habitat loss within WRC, especially between the second and third time periods, was associated with temperature-related factors coupled with landscape development across coastal sage scrub habitat; however, development appears to be driving change more rapidly than climate change. Our study demonstrates the importance of providing protected lands for potential suitable habitat in future scenarios.

AB  - Southeast Asian forests are dominated by the tree family Dipterocarpaceae, whose abundance and diversity are key to maintaining the structure and function of tropical forests. Like most biodiversity, dipterocarps are threatened by deforestation and climate change, so it is crucial to understand the potential impacts of these threats on current and future dipterocarp distributions. We developed species distribution models (SDMs) for 19 species of dipterocarps in the Philippines, which were projected onto current and two 2070 representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate scenarios, RCP 4.5 and 8.5. Current land cover was incorporated as a post-hoc correction to restrict projections onto intact habitats. Land cover correction alone reduced current species distributions by a median 67%, and within protected areas by 37%. After land cover correction, climate change reduced distributions by a median 16% (RCP 4.5) and 27% (RCP 8.5) at the national level, with similar losses in protected areas. There was a detectable upward elevation shift of species distributions, consisting of suitable habitat losses below 300 m and gains above 600 m. Species-rich stable areas of continued habitat suitability (i.e., climate macrorefugia) fell largely outside current delineations of protected areas, indicating a need to improve protected area planning. This study highlights how SDMs can provide projections that can inform protected area planning in the tropics.

AB  - The crocodile lizard, Shinisaurus crocodilurus AHL, 1930, is a monotypic taxon, restricted in occurrence to southern China and northern Vietnam. Wild populations are presently suffering tremendous declines, mainly due to illegal poaching, habitat destruction, and fragmentation, which already led to the extinction of populations in Guangxi and Hunan provinces in China. In order to accelerate the discovery of so far unknown populations of S. crocodilurus and to identify suitable priority areas for conservation strategies, we determined the species' potential distribution using correlative species distribution models (SDMs) based on locality records and a set of satellite-based environmental predictors. In addition, we evaluated the coverage of the species' potential distribution with designated protected areas according to IUCN standards. The resulting SDM revealed potentially suitable habitats to be scattered and disconnected while being very small in size. Moreover, present coverage with nature reserves is extremely poor, underlining the urgent need for improved habitat protection measures and potential population restoration of S. crocodilurus.

AB  - Appropriate field survey methods and robust modeling approaches play an important role in wildlife protection and habitat management because reliable information on wildlife distribution and abundance is important for conservation planning and actions. However, accurately estimating animal abundance is challenging in most species, as usually only a small proportion of the population can be detected during surveys. Species distribution models can predict the habitat suitability index, which differs from species abundance. We designed a method to adjust the results from species distribution models to achieve better accuracy for abundance estimation. This method comprises four steps: (1) conducting distance sampling, recording species occurrences, and surveying routes; (2) performing species distribution modeling using occurrence records and predicting animal abundance in each quadrat in the study area; (3) comparing the difference between field survey results and predicted abundance in quadrats along survey routes, adjusting model prediction, and summing up to obtain total abundance in the study area; (4) calculating uncertainty from three sources, i.e., distance sampling (using detection rate), species distribution models (using R squared), and differences between the field survey and model prediction [using the standard deviation of the ratio (observation/prediction) at different zones]. We developed an R package called abundanceR to estimate wildlife abundance and provided data for the Tibetan wild ass (Equus kiang) based on field surveys at the Three-River-Source National Park, as well as 29 layers of environmental variables covering the terrestrial areas of the planet. Our method can provide accurate estimation of abundance for animals inhabiting open areas that can be easily observed during distance sampling, and whose spatial heterogeneity of animal density within the study area can be accurately predicted using species distribution models.

AB  - Ecuador has the largest number of species by area worldwide, but also a low representation of species within its protected areas. Here, we applied systematic conservation planning to identify potential areas for conservation in continental Ecuador, with the aim of increasing the representation of terrestrial species diversity in the protected area network. We selected 809 terrestrial species (amphibians, birds, mammals, and plants), for which distributions were estimated via species distribution models (SDMs), using Maxent. For each species we established conservation goals based on conservation priorities, and estimated new potential protected areas using Marxan conservation planning software. For each selected area, we determined their conservation priority and feasibility of establishment, two important aspects in the decision-making processes. We found that according to our conservation goals, the current protected area network contains large conservation gaps. Potential areas for conservation almost double the surface area of currently protected areas. Most of the newly proposed areas are located in the Coast, a region with large conservation gaps and irreversible changes in land use. The most feasible areas for conservation were found in the Amazon and Andes regions, which encompass more undisturbed habitats, and already harbor most of the current reserves. Our study allows defining a viable strategy for preserving Ecuador's biodiversity, by combining SDMs, GIS-based decision-support software, and priority and feasibility assessments of the selected areas. This approach is useful for complementing protected area networks in countries with great biodiversity, insufficient biological information, and limited resources for conservation.

AB  - Context Understanding the environmental and anthropogenic factors influencing habitat selection of multiple species is a foundation for quantifying human impacts on biodiversity and developing effective conservation measures. Objectives To determine the effect of multiple scales of environmental/topographic and anthropogenic variables and landscape patterns on habitat suitability of terrestrial mammals in Bhutan, assess the effectiveness of the current protected area network, identify areas of high species richness outside of the existing protected area, and evaluate the potential effectiveness of indicator and umbrella species for conservation planning. Methods We modelled multi-scale habitat selection of sixteen species of terrestrial mammals across Bhutan using data from a nation-wide camera trap survey. We used the predicted species distribution maps to assess the multi-species conservation effectiveness of the existing protected area network. We performed simulations to identify high priority areas for multiple species based on their habitat suitability, proximity to existing protected areas and overall connectivity within the predicted distribution of species. We used correlation analysis among predicted occurrence maps and multivariate cluster analysis to identify potential indicator species. We evaluated the potential utility of each species as umbrella species by assessing how well optimal protected areas for that species would protect suitable habitat for all 16 species simultaneously. Results Protected areas and forest cover were strongly associated with habitat use of most modelled species. Additionally, topographical features, like terrain roughness and slope position, contributed to habitat selection of multiple species, but often in different ways. Environmental and topographical variables were mostly selected at medium to broad scales. Anthropogenic variables (agriculture and built-up areas) were negatively associated with habitat suitability of most species at both fine and broad scales. Conservation effectiveness assessment of existing protected areas found protected areas in south-central Bhutan have high effectiveness in terms of both mean and total richness protected. Similarly, biological corridors in the south-central region offered high mean richness protection. Our simulation of optimal areas for additional protection found areas abutting protected areas in southern Bhutan offered high relative species richness protection. Our umbrella species analysis found muntjac, wild pig, serow, sambar and Asian golden cat are the most effective umbrella species for broader biodiversity protection. Our indicator species analysis found tiger, gaur, dhole, clouded leopard, Asian black bear and common leopard as effective indicator species. Conclusions This study highlights the need to protect optimally located species-rich areas outside the current protected areas. This kind of multi-species habitat assessment provides important information to optimize future conservation and development plans at national and regional scales.

AB  - Population declines of many wildlife species have been linked to habitat loss incurred through land-use change. Incorporation of conservation planning into development planning may mitigate these impacts. The threatened Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is experiencing loss of native habitat and high levels of energy development across its multijurisdictional range. Our goal was to explore relationships of the species occurrence with landscape characteristics and anthropogenic effects influencing its distribution through evaluation of habitat suitability associated with one particular habitat usage, lekking. Lekking has been relatively well-surveyed, though not consistently, in all jurisdictions. All five states in which Lesser Prairie-Chickens occur cooperated in development of a Maxent habitat suitability model. We created two models, one with state as a factor and one without state. When state was included it was the most important predictor, followed by percent of land cover consisting of known or suspected used vegetation classes within a 5000 m area around a lek. Without state, land cover was the most important predictor of relative habitat suitability for leks. Among the anthropogenic predictors, landscape condition, a measure of human impact integrated across several factors, was most important, ranking third in importance without state. These results quantify the relative suitability of the landscape within the current occupied range of Lesser Prairie-Chickens. These models, combined with other landscape information, form the basis of a habitat assessment tool that can be used to guide siting of development projects and targeting of areas for conservation.

AB  - Habitat degradation is a major threat to the survival of chiru (Pantholops hodgsonii). Detailed knowledge for habitat conservation in this steppe-dwelling ungulate is needed if effective conservation and management strategies are to be developed. The distribution of potential habitat and the relative value of habitat to chiru on a regional scale remains unknown, hindering landscape conservation planning. Our aim was to identify and rank chiru habitat across the Chang Tang region of the Tibetan Plateau. We assessed overall habitat suitability using geographical data, field surveys, and information contained within previous studies. We identified 10194 km(2) of optimal habitat (1.71 % of the region), 256816 km(2) of suitable habitat (43.17 % of the region), and 213799 km(2) of marginal habitat (35.94 % of the region). Our habitat model shows that suitable habitat is located primarily in the central (Nyingma county and Shuanghu county) and western (Geze county) regions of the study area. When we looked specifically at a chiru reserve (Chang Tang Nature Reserve) located within the study area, we found that over half of the reserve could be classified as suitable habitat. This highlights the regional importance of this reserve to chiru conservation. Our findings further indicate that the protection of suitable habitat and improvement of habitat linkages will be important features of any regional chiru conservation plan.

AB  - Spatial management planning for vulnerable marine ecosystems (VME) across broad areas of un-sampled seafloor requires detailed predictions of species distribution. We utilised two habitat suitability modelling techniques, boosted regression trees (BRT) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt), to create potential distribution maps for 11 VME indicator taxa in the New Zealand area and adjacent seas. New bathymetry data were combined with existing environmental, chemical and physical data to produce a set of 45 predictor variables describing conditions at the seafloor. Nine of these variables were selected for use in the models based on low covariance and high explanatory power. Historical biological survey data were used to provide models with absence data (BRT) or target-group background data (MaxEnt). Model agreement was high, with each model predicting similar areas of suitable habitat both in the vicinity of known VME indicator taxa presence locations as well as across broad regions of un-sampled seafloor. Model performance measures, including cross-validation testing against sets of spatially independent data, did not clearly indicate a preferred modelling method across all taxa. Previous habitat suitability modelling efforts have rarely accounted for model precision, and in this study we used a bootstrap re sampling technique to produce model uncertainty maps to accompany each habitat suitability map. Because of the similar performance of BRT and MaxEnt methods in this study, we conclude that the best approach to incorporating the results into decision-support tools for spatial conservation planning is to average predictions and uncertainty from both.

AB  - The Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus) is an endangered species with a globally declining population. Information on the current habitat distribution and potential suitable habitat for this ecologically important species will provide invaluable insight into conservation planning and the species' future status as climate changes. This is specifically important for areas where there are little or no reported data on the status of the Egyptian Vulture. We used 13 years nestsite records (n = 69) together with relevant environmental variables to understand the known distribution and predict potential habitat distribution of the Egyptian Vulture in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. A machine learning model, maximum entropy, was used to generate various model options, from which the best model was selected based on the Akaike information criterion (AICc) statistical indicators. The model showed reasonably good discriminative ability using both True Skill Statistics TSS = 0.722 and Area under the Curve (AUC) = 0.825 metrics. The Egyptian Vultures in Iraq mainly breed in territories at elevations between 1000 and 3300 m above sea level. This suggests that the species shows preference to areas distant from human settlements likely due to decreased disturbance and that the species may rely on alternative/complementary food sources (e.g. wild goat and boar). The total area of the study site is approximately 51,069 km(2), out of which around 25% (12,767 km(2)) is predicted as suitable breeding habitat for the Egyptian Vulture. The output of this study provides useful baseline information for conservation actions and plans.

AB  - Habitat assessment of species is one of the most important strategies to conserve biodiversity in the protected areas. The main objective of this study is to present an ecological assessment model for habitat management of brown bears using the MaxEnt algorithm in Oshtorankooh protected area, Lorestan. 55 presence points of brown bear and seven environmental variables including slope, elevation, distance from river, distance from road, distance from forest and grassland, distance from cropland and vegetation, and distance from rural area were applied for habitat assessment process. The importance of these variables was investigated by the Jaknikfe test and their predictive rate was assessed by response curves. The distance from the rural area and elevation were respectively the most important factors for modeling the distribution of brown bears in Oshtorankooh protected area. The final suitability map of habitat for brown bear species was classified into four categories: more suitable, suitable, less suitable and unsuitable. An area of 22566.7 ha was determined as a more suitable habitat for brown bears in the study area. The result indicates that the southern and central areas of the study area are more suitable for the species. The result of the model validity was obtained as 0.92, showing that the integrated model was very efficient in the habitat assessment process.

AB  - Habitat loss threatens large mammals worldwide, and their survival will depend on habitat in human-dominated landscapes. Conservation planners thus face the challenge to identify areas of least conflict with land use, yet broadscale species distribution models rarely incorporate real landscape patterns nor do they identify potential conservation conflicts. An excellent example of such conservation challenges is provided by European bison (Bison bonasus). Almost extinct by the early 20th century, bison can only survive in the wild if large metapopulations are established, but it is unclear where new herds can be reintroduced. Using European bison as an example we conducted a continental-scale habitat assessment based on real landscape patterns. Our specific aims here were to (1) map European bison habitat throughout the species' former range, (2) examine whether broadscale habitat suitability factors differ from previously reported fine-scale factors, and (3) assess where suitable habitat occurs in areas with low potential for conflict with land use. We assessed habitat suitability using herd range maps for all 36 free-ranging European bison herds as habitat use data. Habitat suitability maps were compared with maps of land cover, livestock density, agricultural constraints, and protected areas to assess potential conservation conflicts. Our models had high goodness of fit (AUC 0.941), and we found abundant potential bison habitat. European bison prefer mosaic-type landscapes, with a preference for broad-leaved and mixed forests. European bison metapopulations do not appear to be limited by habitat availability. However, most potential habitat occurred outside protected areas and has substantial potential for conservation conflicts. The most promising areas for establishing large bison metapopulations all occur in Eastern Europe (i.e., the Carpathians, the Belarus-Ukraine borderlands, and several regions in European Russia). The future of European bison and that of other large mammals in the wild thus clearly lies in Eastern Europe, because habitat there is most abundant and least fragmented, and because the potential for conflict with land use is lower. More generally we suggest that broadscale habitat assessments that incorporate land use can be powerful tools for conservation planning and will be key if large herbivore and carnivore conservation is to succeed in a human-dominated world.

AB  - The Scaly-sided Merganser Mergus squamatus is a globally 'Endangered' species breeding in north-east Asia. Limited by information on the geographic distribution of suitable habitat, the conservation management programme has not been comprehensive or spatially explicit for the breeding population. This study combines potentially important environmental variables with extensive data on species occurrence to create the first species distribution model for the breeding Scaly-sided Merganser, followed by a GAP analysis to highlight the unprotected areas containing suitable habitat. The predictive map showing the most suitable breeding habitat for the Scaly-sided Merganser covered broad-leaved deciduous forest distributed in six provincial regions in south-east Russia, north-east China, and North Korea. The conservation GAP, i.e. 90% (38,813 km(2)) of highly suitable habitat, is mainly concentrated in the Sikhote-Alin and Changbai mountain ranges. This study suggests that prioritizing conservation of unprotected broad-leaved deciduous riverine forests within the above two mountainous regions should be included in international conservation planning, and the remaining suitable patches need to be preserved to allow range expansion in future. This predictive map improves the expert global assessment of breeding Scaly-sided Merganser distribution and provides a basic reference for establishing conservation areas or implementing conservation actions for the breeding Scaly-sided Merganser in north-east Asia.

AB  - Protected area systems need to conserve species in places with suitable habitat that are configured to facilitate gene flow. Since genetic data require considerable resources to obtain, many proxy methods have been developed to generate plans for protected area systems (prioritizations) that facilitate gene flow without needing genetic data. However, the effectiveness of such methodssuch as minimising fragmentation or enforcing contiguity among priority areasremains largely untested.
   We investigated the ability of prioritizations to maintain gene flow when they are generated using conventional methods for promoting connectivity. Using existing environmental, genetic, and occurrence datasets, we created maps of habitat suitability and resistance to gene flow for nine alpine plant species. Next, we generated multispecies prioritizations that secured 10% of the suitable habitat for each species and attempted to maintain gene flow by (a) penalizing fragmentation, (b) representing species in contiguous areas of suitable habitat, and (c) representing species in contiguous areas with minimal resistance to gene flow as modelled from genetic data.
   We found that prioritizations generated using fragmentation penalties failed to represent seven of the nine species in areas that would maintain high levels of gene flow. Similarly, prioritizations that represented species in contiguous areas of suitable habitat were unable to maintain high levels of gene flow for six speciespotentially because a few areas with high resistance can disrupt gene flow throughout an entire prioritization. Although prioritizations generated using genetic data successfully maintained gene flow, they also selected over three times more land than other prioritizations, suggesting that failing to account for gene flow when setting priorities may underestimate the scale of conservation action required.
   Synthesis and applications. We found that conventional methods for enhancing connectivity in conservation planning, such as spatially clustering priority areas or providing connected sections of suitable habitat, were generally unable to maintain high levels of gene flow. Our results suggest that conservation plans could be substantially improved by directly using genetic data, although whether this is a good choice for a particular situation will also depend on the costs of obtaining these data.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are a powerful tool in conservation. Predictive habitat models attempt to provide detailed predictions of distributions by relating the presence/absence of a species to a set of environmental predictors that are likely to influence the suitability of the environment for the focal species. For most of the available methods, accurate sampling of the presence/absence of the species is crucial. The lack of information about the areas where species are absent complicates the use of common ecological modeling tools, as they rely both on presence and absence data. For this reason, a modeling technique that does not require absence data was used. This modeling approach is extremely useful when absence data are not available, are unreliable, or are ecologically meaningless. So, one statistical technique that can be used to generate habitat maps based on the presence-only data is the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA), using the modeling Biomapper software. The purpose of this study is to provide desirable habitats in Bidouyeh Protected Area in Kerman province based on the presence-only data and environmental conditions of the area by ENFA, to determine which parts according to the current conditions of the region are suitable habitat for Goitered Gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa). according to the Predicted areas, we will be able to better protect and manage the area. The results showed that variables the elevations 2000-2300 m, the western aspects, and the sealed road, respectively, are the most important factors influencing the selection of Goitered Gazelle habitat in Bidouyeh protected area. According to the modeling, approximately 15% of the Bidouyeh protected area is a suitable habitat for Goitered Gazelle.

AB  - The identification of geographical distribution of a plant species is crucial for understanding the importance of environmental variables affecting plant habitat. In the present study, the spatial potential distribution of Astragalus fasciculifolius Boiss. as a key specie was mapped using maximum entropy (Maxent) as data mining technique and bivariate statistical model (FR: frequency ratio) in marl soils of southern Zagros, Iran. The A. fasciculifolius locations were identified and recorded by intensive field campaigns. Then, localities points were randomly split into a 70% training dataset and 30% for validation. Two climatic, four topographic, and eight edaphic variables were used to model the A. fasciculifolius distribution and its habitat potential. Maps of environmental variables were generated using Geographic Information System (GIS). Next, the habitat suitability index (HSI) maps were produced and classified by means of Maxent and FR approaches. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve was used to compare the performance of maps produced by Maxent and FR models. The interpretation of environmental variables revealed that the climatic and topographic parameters had less impact compared to edaphic variables in habitat distribution of A. fasciculifolius. The results showed that bulk density, nitrogen, acidity (pH), sand, and electrical conductivity (EC) of soil are the most significant variables that affect distribution of A. fasciculifolius. The validation of results showed that AUC values of Maxent and FR models are 0.83 and 0.76, respectively. The habitat suitability map by the better model (Maxent) showed that areas with high and very high suitable classes cover approximately 22% of the study area. Generally, the habitat suitability map produced using Maxent model could provide important information for conservation planning and a reclamation project of the degraded habitat of intended plant species. The distribution of the plants identifies the water, soil, and nutrient resources and affects the fauna distribution, and this is why it is relevant to research and to understand the plant distribution to properly improve the management and to achieve a sustainable management.

AB  - Persian Goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) is one of the globally and locally threatened bovines inhabiting in the plains of Iran. There are many studies conducted on the habitat suitability modeling for the species in Iran, however, seasonal variations in the distribution of suitable habitat has not been yet evaluated. To this aim, we used independent species presence data which were collected in the field surveys as well as those which was reported by the game guards during spring 2017 to winter 2018. Maximum entropy modeling approach (MaxEnt )) was applied to relate the habitat suitability of the species in each season to the potential environmental variables in the presence points. The outputs of the model indicated that elevation is the most important variable contributing to the habitat suitability of the species in each season. Moreover, the distribution of suitable habitats in autumn differs drastically from other seasons. The current protected area network of Isfahan province indicates the lowest efficiency regarding the conservation of suitable habitats in the fall which is very critical as the mating event will occure. Isfahan mostly encompass the suitable habitats for spring and the least situated suitable habitats belong to autumn. Based on our findings, we suggest that the current boundaries of protected area network in Isfahan should be reconsidered and redesigned to cover the year round suitable habitats for the species.

AB  - Area of Occupancy (AOO), is a measure of species geographical ranges commonly used for species red listing. In most cases, AOO is estimated using reported localities of species distributions at coarse grain resolution, providing measures subjected to uncertainties of data quality and spatial resolution. To illustrate the ability of fine-resolution species distribution models for obtaining new measures of species ranges and their impact in conservation planning, we estimate the potential AOO of an endangered species in alpine environments. We use field occurrences of relict Empetrum nigrum and maximum entropy modeling to assess whether different sampling (expert versus systematic surveys) may affect AOO estimates based on habitat suitability maps, and the differences between such measurements and traditional coarse-grid methods. Fine-scale models performed robustly and were not influenced by survey protocols, providing similar habitat suitability outputs with high spatial agreement. Model-based estimates of potential AOO were significantly smaller than AOO measures obtained from coarse-scale grids, even if the first were obtained from conservative thresholds based on the Minimal Predicted Area (MPA). As defined here, the potential AOO provides spatially-explicit measures of species ranges which are permanent in the time and scarcely affected by sampling bias. The overestimation of these measures may be reduced using higher thresholds of habitat suitability, but standard rules as the MPA permit comparable measures among species. We conclude that estimates of AOO based on fine-resolution distribution models are more robust tools for risk assessment than traditional systems, allowing a better understanding of species ranges at habitat level.

AB  - Conservation planning depends on reliable information regarding the geographic distribution of species. However, our knowledge of species' distributions is often incomplete, especially when species are cryptic, difficult to survey, or rare. The use of species distribution models has increased in recent years and proven a valuable tool to evaluate habitat suitability for species. However, practitioners have yet to fully adopt the potential of species distribution models to inform conservation efforts for information-limited species. Here, we describe a species distribution modeling approach for at-risk species that could better inform U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's species status assessments and help facilitate conservation decisions. We applied four modeling techniques (generalized additive, maximum entropy, generalized boosted, and weighted ensemble) to occurrence data for four at-risk species proposed for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (Papaipema eryngii, Macbridea caroliniana, Scutellaria ocmulgee, and Balduina atropurpurea) in the Southeastern United States. The use of ensemble models reduced uncertainty caused by differences among modeling techniques, with a consequent improvement of predictive accuracy of fitted models. Incorporating an ensemble modeling approach into species status assessments and similar frameworks is likely to benefit survey efforts, inform recovery activities, and provide more robust status assessments for at-risk species. We emphasize that co-producing species distribution models in close collaboration with species experts has the potential to provide better calibration data and model refinements, which could ultimately improve reliance and use of model outputs.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used in conservation planning, but their utility can be improved by assessing the relationships between environmental and species response variables. We constructed SDMs for 30 stream fishes of Maryland, USA, using watershed attributes as environmental variables and presence/absence as species responses. SDMs showed substantial agreement between observed and predicted values for 17 species. Most important variables were natural attributes (e.g., ecoregion, watershed area, latitude/longitude); land cover (e.g., %impervious, %row crop) was important for three species. Focused analyses on four representative species (central stoneroller, creek chub, largemouth bass, and white sucker) showed the probability of presence of each species increased non-linearly with watershed area. For these species, SDMs built to predict absent, low, and high densities were similar to presence/absence predictions but provided probable locations of high densities (e.g., probability of high-density creek chub decreased rapidly with watershed area). We applied SDMs to predict suitability of watersheds within the study area for each species. Maps of suitability and the environmental and species response relationships can help develop better management plans.

AB  - Climate change has been regarded as one of the major threats to endangered species, and offers a wide variety of challenges to current conservation strategies. Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is a critical initial step for improving in-situ conservation planning. In this study, we used MaxEnt to predict the impacts of climate change on habitat suitability for wild camel (Camelus ferus) in the Kumtag Desert both during the current period and projected into the 2050 s. Our results showed that (i) suitable habitat for wild camel was predicted to decrease by 43.81% by the 2050 s; (ii) currently established nature reserves protected 57.86% of currently suitable habitat; (iii) 44.15% of currently suitable habitat was predicted to be vulnerable to future climate change, with a minor increase in newly suitable habitat by the 2050 s; (iv) climate refuge areas amounted to 21,601 km2 and were mainly located in the core area of the desert. Given these results, we propose conservation implications to mitigate the impacts of climate change on wild camel, including intergrating the suitable habitat into the planning of a proposed national park, constructing habitat corridors, restoring water sources, and implementing long-term monitoring.

AB  - Spatial data on species distributions are available in two main forms, point locations and distribution maps (polygon ranges and grids). The first are often temporally and spatially biased, and too discontinuous, to be useful (untransformed) in spatial analyses. A variety of modelling approaches are used to transform point locations into maps. We discuss the attributes that point location data and distribution maps must satisfy in order to be useful in conservation planning. We recommend that before point location data are used to produce and/or evaluate distribution models, the dataset should be assessed under a set of criteria, including sample size, age of data, environmental/geographical coverage, independence, accuracy, time relevance and (often forgotten) representation of areas of permanent and natural presence of the species. Distribution maps must satisfy additional attributes if used for conservation analyses and strategies, including minimizing commission and omission errors, credibility of the source/assessors and availability for public screening. We review currently available databases for mammals globally and show that they are highly variable in complying with these attributes. The heterogeneity and weakness of spatial data seriously constrain their utility to global and also sub-global scale conservation analyses.

AB  - We used Ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) to describe wild goat's niche in Agh-Dagh protected area and to identify key factors shaping its distribution and to describe its niche structure. Habitat suitability modeling showed that the species distribution is restricted to the marginal habitats principally because of repulsive factors such as human settlements and road networks. Meanwhile we found that the occurrence of the species was positively correlated with variables related to topographical features including elevation, scape terrain and slope. Since this area is the most important protected area in the province, immediate conservational actions should be done for managing repulsive factors.

AB  - In this study, we combine species distribution models with a reserve selection approach to assess the degree of representation of xenarthrans in the existing protected area network of Argentina, and to identify conservation priority areas that may help expand the current system. Species distribution models were developed from species' occurrence records using a maximum entropy algorithm. Maps of species distributions were produced for 15 of the 16 species currently present in the country. To assess the performance of the existing protected area network in representing all modeled species, and to identify priority areas to expand the current reserve system, we used the software Zonation. Overall, all species modeled are represented in the existing protected area network. However, the percentage of their ranges covered by protected areas is very low (average = 6.7%; range = 1.7-17.6%). To represent at least 5% of the distribution of each species, 8.8% of the country's area would be needed, and species with restricted ranges have the greatest increase in representation in this scenario. When 10% of the country is set aside for conservation, species representation increases considerably, again favoring range-restricted species. Most of the areas identified as conservation priorities are under strong anthropogenic pressures, including deforestation, agricultural expansion, and hunting. Our analysis provides a preliminary assessment of conservation priorities for the xenarthrans of Argentina, and we hope will serve as guideline to focus future conservation assessments at more refined scales.

AB  - The Laristan mouflon is the smallest species of the genus Ovis with isolated populations spread mostly in the Laristan region in southern Iran. In recent years, this charismatic species has been considered as a conservation-oriented game species by the Department of Environment of Iran. Designating conservation planning of the Laristan mouflon necessitates identifying suitable habitats of the species and the habitat connectivity among protected areas of the region. In this study, habitat suitability of the species was investigated using species distribution modelling method based on the maximum entropy model. The map of habitat suitability was then used to assess habitat connectivity among protected areas based on least-cost path and circuit theory methods. The results showed that a mixture of undulating grass-shrub covers with proper availability of escaping terrains far from human-dominated areas characterizes suitable ranges for the species. The habitat connectivity analyses revealed that there is a strong connection among the existing protected areas, however, in some parts, due to the development of road networks, the bottleneck in habitat connectivity was observed. Results of this study could be considered as a practical tool for the conservation planning of this charismatic species in southern Iran.

AB  - An analysis of the extent of overlap between habitats of the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus during summer and winter in Iran, and Iranian protected areas, discovered slight overlap between the two. Our study aimed to survey suitable habitats of the Egyptian Vulture during summer and winter in Iran using MaxEnt, a species distribution modelling method, and compare the results with the locations and span of protected areas. Model fitness was assessed using the area under the ROC-plot and True Skill Statistics. We found that habitat suitability in Iran varies for the Egyptian Vulture during summer and winter. Summer visitors are scattered in the north and west of Iran, concentrated along the Zagros and Alborz mountain ranges. Winter visitors and residents are scattered in coastal areas in the south. Habitat protection for winter visitors was the greatest, with 10% of suitable habitat covered, while less than 10% of suitable habitat for residents and summer visitors fell within protected areas. The Egyptian Vulture is categorised as 'Endangered' on the IUCN Red List. Different environmental factors influence the suitability of habitat for the species. While some factors such as NDVI and anthropogenic disturbance influence all visitors in a similar way, the effects of others such as elevation and distance from protected areas vary for summer and winter visitors. Since designation of protected areas in Iran is mainly determined by the distribution of mammal species, protection of bird habitats is often overlooked. Suitable habitat for the species should be considered when selecting protected areas in future.

AB  - With over 35,000 higher plants recorded, China is among the countries with the highest plant diversity. However, due to increasing human population, land-use intensification, and economic development, the habitat of most species is under considerable threat. Here we develop conservation priority maps covering all of China based on plant species distribution models in combination with spatially explicit decision making tools for systematic conservation planning. Our aim was to find spatial scenarios that maximize the success of conservation goals while minimizing the required land area to achieve these goals, so that economic development can proceed with minimal damage to existing biodiversity resources. We built species distribution models for 7427 vascular plant species at a 10 x 10' resolution covering whole China, using geo-referenced herbarium collections and detailed environmental data, corrected for spatial bias using a null model. Based on these models we mapped: (1) species richness centers for common species (3535), endemic species (1965) and Chinese red list species (1927); (2) priority areas for conservation, distinguishing between conservation targets for common species (15% of the predicted suitable habitat), endemic species (25% the predicted suitable habitat) and red list species (35% the predicted suitable habitat); and (3) downscaled land-use pattern in each priority area for conservation. Clear priorities for the development of a sustainable and feasible biodiversity conservation strategy can now be provided based on our maps at national and regional levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding patterns of species distribution and diversity plays a vital role in biodiversity conservation. Such documentation is frequently lacking for bats, which are relatively little studied and often threatened. The Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in peninsular India is a bat hotspot with 63 species. We conducted a comprehensive bat survey across the southern Western Ghats and used maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) to model the potential distribution of 37 bat species for which sufficient data were available. We generated binary maps of each species using species-specific thresholds to estimate suitable habitat areas and overlaid binary maps of species to produce bat hotspots (we use the term "bat hotspot" for regions that were suitable for more than 25 bat species). We also estimated species richness across protected area networks in the southern Western Ghats to assess the level of protection. The highest levels of species richness were found mainly along the southmost Periyar-Agastyamalai landscape. The study also identified a 1,683 km(2) area of potential bat hotspot and 726 km(2) (43%) of the total bat hotspots are currently within the protected area network. However, more than 50% of suitable habitats for each of the 37 species remain unprotected. Therefore, conservation decisions are needed to take into account both bat hotspots and species with restricted distributions.

AB  - Enlarging protected area networks (PANs) is critical to ensure the long-term population viability of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), which are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Strict policies of PAN enlargement that focus on wildlife conservation have failed largely due to difficulties in encouraging stakeholder participation and meeting the elephant habitat requirement. A co-management policy that promotes sustainable resource use, wildlife conservation, and stakeholder participation may have greater feasibility than the strict policies in a developing world. Here, we identified the suitable habitat of elephants using maximum entropy models and examined whether habitat suitability is indirectly associated with local economic development in human-dominated landscapes. We found that (1) the suitable habitat was mainly in areas of forest matrix (50% natural forest cover) with multiple land-use practices rather than relatively intact forest and near communities (mean distance two km) and (2) habitat suitability was negatively associated with local economic development (r(p) = -0.37, P = 0.04). From the standpoint of elephant habitat and its socio-economic background, our results indicate that co-management will be more effective than the currently strict approaches of enlarging PAN. Additionally, our results provide on-ground information for elephant corridor design in southern China.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) relate species information to environmental conditions to predict potential species distributions. The majority of SDMs are static, relating species presence information to long-term average environmental conditions. The resulting temporal mismatch between species information and environmental conditions can increase model inference's uncertainty. For SDMs to capture the dynamic species-environment relationships and predict near-real-time habitat suitability, species information needs to be spatiotemporally matched with environmental conditions contemporaneous to the species' presence (dynamic SDMs). Implementing dynamic SDMs in the marine realm is highly challenging, particularly due to species and environmental data paucity and spatiotemporally biases. Here, we implemented presence-only dynamic SDMs for four migratory baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean (SO): Antarctic minke, Antarctic blue, fin, and humpback whales. Sightings were spatiotemporally matched with their respective daily environmental predictors. Background information was sampled daily to describe the dynamic environmental conditions in the highly dynamic SO. We corrected for spatial sampling bias by sampling background information respective to the seasonal research efforts. Independent model evaluation was performed on spatial and temporal cross-validation. We predicted the circumantarctic year-round habitat suitability of each species. Daily predictions were also summarized into bi-weekly and monthly habitat suitability. We identified important predictors and species suitability responses to environmental changes. Our results support the propitious use of dynamic SDMs to fill species information gaps and improve conservation planning strategies. Near-real-time predictions can be used for dynamic ocean management, e.g., to examine the overlap between habitat suitability and human activities. Nevertheless, the inevitable spatiotemporal biases in sighting data from the SO call for the need for improving sampling effort in the SO and using alternative data sources (e.g., passive acoustic monitoring) in future SDMs. We further discuss challenges of calibrating dynamic SDMs on baleen whale species in the SO, with a particular focus on spatiotemporal sampling bias issues and how background information should be sampled in presence-only dynamic SDMs. We also highlight the need to integrate visual and acoustic data in future SDMs on baleen whales for better coverage of environmental conditions suitable for the species and avoid constraints of using either data type alone.

AB  - Resource limitations often prevent the active management required to maintain habitat quality in protected areas. Because restrictions in access or allowable public activities are the sole conservation measure in these locations, an important question to consider is whether species of conservation concern truly benefit from parcels that are shielded from human disturbance. Here, we assess the conservation benefit of protecting birds from human recreation on over 204 km of sandy beaches by (a) estimating the total area of beach-nesting bird habitat that has been created by conservation protections; (b) quantifying the change in nesting habitat extent should further conservation protections be implemented; and (c) providing data to inform future protected area expansion. We use a maximum entropy species distribution modeling approach to estimate the extent and quality of suitable habitat for four beach-nesting bird species of conservation concern under the existing management regime and compare it to scenarios in which the entire study area is either unprotected of fully protected from human disturbance. Managing humans has dramatic conservation returns for least terns and piping plovers, creating extensive nesting habitat that otherwise would not exist. There is considerable scope for conservation gains, potentially tripling the extent of nesting areas. Expanding conservation footprints for American oystercatchers and black skimmers is predicted to enhance the quality of existing nesting areas. The work demonstrates the utility of modeling changes in habitat suitability to inform protected area expansion on ocean beaches and coastal dunes.

AB  - Efficient threatened species prioritisation and management is critical to the overall success of biodiversity conservation. Insufficient species information can make it challenging to accurately assess a species' extinction risk and develop appropriate management strategies. In this study we undertook field surveys and spatial data analysis to better understand the habitat and distribution of the threatened annual grass Arthraxon hispidus (Thunb.) Makino (Hairy Jointgrass) within its north coast New South Wales range. We developed and tested a high-resolution maximum entropy (Maxent) model, using field survey population mapping and freely available spatial data (e.g. soil, topography, foliage cover, hydrology) to identify its landscape distribution drivers, to predict its suitable habitat areas and to estimate its abundance. The model indicated that A. hispidus habitat occurs in non-woody vegetation in areas of high topographic wetness and persistent moisture, particularly in and around drainage lines or on south-facing slopes. We found that A. hispidus appears to be much more widespread than previously known, with high rates of occurrence at predicted but previously unsurveyed sites, and approximately 15 % of the study area projected to be suitable habitat for the species. We estimated that the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy of the species exceeded vulnerable species listing criteria thresholds within IUCN guidelines. This study demonstrates how species distribution modelling can add to existing resources to provide cost-effective data to inform and streamline conservation planning.

AB  - The Asian Houbara is vulnerable species, the population of which is dwindling. Its protection must be prioritized in conservation programs. In this study, maximum entropy models were developed in four seasons to evaluate habitat suitability and factors affecting Asian Houbara in the Center and East Iran. Environmental variables used in modeling and evaluating the niche consisted of 24 environmental and climate variables for Gharetapeh hunting prohibited region and 36 environmental and climate variables for Petregan protected area. Also, seasonal overlap area was obtained using the ENM TOOLS software. The results showed that the most important factors affecting habitat suitability of the Asian Houbara in all seasons included the ratio of distance to the type of Artemisia sieberi-Zygophyllum eurypterum, distance to the slope 2-5%, distance to the type of Seidlitzia rosmarinus in the Gharetapeh hunting prohibited region, distance to the type of Artemisia aucheri, distance to the land passion, and distance to the dry land farming in the Petregan region. In summer and fall-winter, the most suitable habitat is Gharetapeh but is Petergan during fall-winter. There is maximum overlap in fall and winter, and the least overlap in the spring in these areas.

AB  - We used Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) to describe the niche of Wild Bezoar Goat (Capra aegagrus Erxleben, 1777) in the Agh-Dagh Protected Area and to identify key factors that shape its distribution. The habitat suitability modelling showed that the species distribution is restricted to the marginal habitats, principally because of some repulsive factors, such as the human settlements and road networks. Furthermore, we found that the occurrence of the species is positively correlated with variables related to the topographical features, including elevation, scape terrain and slope characteristics. Since this area is the most important protected area in the province, immediate conservational actions should be undertaken for managing the repulsive factors.

AB  - Species distributional data has very important roles in management and conservation of wildlife, especially for rare species. In this study, we used the MaxEnt model to predict the potential distribution of the grey-shanked douc langur (Pygathrix cinerea Nadler, 1997) which is endemic to Vietnam and listed as one of the most endangered primate species in the world. We collected 158 independent localities and 16 environmental variables from different sources were used for analysis. The projection habitat suitability shows that the suitable areas are approximately from 14 degrees N-16 degrees N. The precipitation of driest month (bio14) had the highest percentage contribution to the model output with 27.7%. The total suitable area is 16,680.52 km(2). The areas of high and very high suitability account for 19%, and 2% respectively. The potential distribution area of the species is not much found in the existing protected area. Priorities for conservation and survey efforts should be given to the forested areas in Quang Ngai (Ba To district), Kon Tum (Kon Plong district), Binh Dinh (An Lao district), Gia Lai (K 'Bang district) and Quang Nam provinces. Conservation efforts should also be prioritized for areas beyond the boundary of protected areas, especially for areas that have been proposed as biodiversity corridors.

AB  - Recent studies show that light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived habitat variables significantly increase the performance and accuracy of species distribution models (SDMs). In particular, the structure of complex habitats such as forest can be accurately parametrized by an area-wide, LiDAR-based vegetation profile. However, evidence of specific applications of such models in real-world conservation management still remains sparse. Here, we developed a resource selection SDM for hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia L.) in a Swiss nature park with the aim to map habitat suitability and to inform the park management about habitat improvement measures. We used remote sensing, particularly LiDAR to derive ecologically relevant forest vegetation characteristics at the local scale and used them as predictors in an ensemble SDM approach. The predicted habitat suitability was mainly affected by local, fine grained vegetation structure. Average vegetation height, shrub density and canopy height variation contributed most to the habitat quality for hazel grouse. This clearly shows how LiDAR provides the means to develop ecologically interpretable predictor variables of forest habitat structure and that these predictors can be used to reliably map local-scale habitat quality, indicated by high model performance scores (median AUC of 0.918). This improves spatial conservation planning, and at the same time, provides meaningful information to derive habitat improvement measures that can be implemented in the field by foresters. Hazel grouse occurrence in the park is restricted to a few highly suitable, disjunct habitat patches. Therefore, conservation management should increase the connectivity of suitable habitat with the aim to stimulate an increase and better exchange of individuals in the regional hazel grouse population. Habitat improvements can be achieved by forestry measures that regularly integrate early successional forest stages into production forests. They should contain stands with a shrub density of around 30% as well as heterogeneous stands in terms of vegetation height.

AB  - Dalbergia latifolia Roxb., commonly known as rosewood, is one of the highly valuable tropical timber species of Nepal. The tree species was widely distributed in the past, however, over exploitation of natural habitat, deforestation, forest conversion for agriculture, illegal logging and the invasion of alien species resulted in the classification of this species as vulnerable by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) category. So, the prediction of habitat suitability and potential distribution of the species is required to develop restoration mechanisms and conservation interventions. In this study, we modelled the suitable habitat of D. latifolia over the entire possible range of Nepal using a Maxent model. We compiled 23 environmental variables (19 bioclimatic, 3 topographic and a vegetative layer), however, only 12 least correlated variables along with 43 spatially representative presence locations were retained for model prediction. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the model's performance and a Jackknife procedure to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables. The model was statistically significant with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.969. The internal Jackknife test indicated that elevation was the most important variable for the model prediction with 71.3% contribution followed by mean temperature of driest quarter (9.8%). The most (>0.6) suitable habitat for the D. latifolia was 235 484 hectares with large sections of area in two provinces whereas, the western most provinces were not suitable for D. latifolia as per Maxent model. The information presented here can provide a framework for nature conservation planning, monitoring and habitat management of this rare and endangered species.

AB  - Ongoing loss of biodiversity requires identifying large-scale conservation priorities, but the detailed information on the distribution of species required for this purpose is often missing. We present a systematic reserve selection for 1223 African mammals and amphibians in which habitat suitability models are used as estimates of the area occupied by species. In the framework of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Amphibian Assessment and IUCN Global Mammal Assessment, we collected the geographic range (extent of occurrence) and habitat preferences for each species. We used the latter to build species-specific habitat suitability models inside geographic ranges, and for 181 species we verified the models by comparing suitability levels to presence-absence data collected in the field. We then used the suitable areas as estimators of the area of occupancy and compared the results of systematic reserve selection based on geographic ranges to those based on estimated areas of occupancy. Our results showed that the reserve system would need a 30-100% expansion to achieve minimal conservation targets, concentrated in the tropics, where species richness reaches a maximum. Comparative analyses revealed that using geographic ranges, which overestimate the area occupied by species, underestimates the total amount of area that needs to be conserved. The area selected for conservation doubled when we used the estimated area of occupancy in place of the geographic ranges. This happened because the suitable areas potentially occupied by each species overlapped less than their geographic ranges. As a result, any given protected area contained fewer species than predicted by the analysis of ranges. Because species are more specialized than our estimates of distribution based on extent of occurrence suggest, we propose that this is a general effect in systematic conservation planning.

AB  - This paper investigates the use of using remotely sensed observation and full coverage hydroacoustic datasets to quantify habitat suitability for a marine demersal fish, the blue-throated wrasse. Because of issues surrounding the detection of species using remotely sensed video techniques, the application of presence-only techniques are well suited for modeling demersal fish habitat suitability. Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis is used to compare analyses conducted using seafloor variables derived from hydroacoustics at three spatial scales: fine (56.25 m(2)), medium (506.25 m(2)) and coarse (2756.25 m(2)), to determine which spatial scale was most influential in predicting blue-throated wrasse habitat suitability. The coarse scale model was found to have the best predictive capabilities with a Boyce Index of 0.80 +/- 0.26. The global marginality and specialization values indicated that, irrespective of spatial scale, blue-throated wrasse prefer seafloor characteristics that are different to the mean available within the study site, but exhibit a relatively wide niche. Although variable importance varied over the three spatial scale models, blue-throated wrasse showed a strong preference for regions of shallow water, close to reef, with high rugosity and maximum curvature and low HSI-B values. Generally the spatial patterns in habitat suitability were well represented in the Marine National Park compared to adjacent waters. However, some significant differences in spatial patterns were observed. Interspersion and Juxtaposition Indexes for unsuitable and highly suitable habitat were significantly smaller inside the Marine National Park, while the Mean Shape Index of unsuitable habitat in the Marine National Park was significantly larger.

AB  - For the successful conservation of a species, habitat loss and fragmentation must be controlled through a protected area network that adequately covers its habitat. Here the suitable habitats of all of Trinidad and Tobago's endemic plant species are determined and used to perform a gap analysis of a proposed protected area network. Data from a recently completed botanical survey, the WorldClim 2 environmental parameters, and a range of other sources were used to determine the habitat of each species using the species distribution model MaxEnt. Modelled habitat suitability for each species was combined and used to create maps showing endemic richness, weighted endemism and corrected weighted endemism, and to rank areas by conservation value using Zonation. The coverage of the proposed protected area network and a land use map were overlaid on these modelled distributions. We identified data limitations which meant that more than half of the 66 endemic species could not be modelled with confidence. For the remaining species, we found that the proposed protected area network contains just 13 +/- 7% of the total modelled habitat of the endemic species. For eight endemic species > 25% of the suitable habitat is degraded. Model analysis indicated that elevation and temperature seasonality are the most important drivers of endemism. Based on a gap analysis the inclusion of high elevation areas of Trinidad's Northern Range in the proposed protected area network would expand the coverage to include > 25% of the total modelled habitat of the endemic species, thus greatly increasing the long-term sustainability of the endemic species populations.

AB  - The development of species distribution models (SDMs) can help conservation efforts by generating potential distributions and identifying areas of high environmental suitability for protection. Our study presents a distribution and habitat map for lowland tapir in South America. We also describe the potential habitat suitability of various geographical regions and habitat loss, inside and outside of protected areas network. Two different SDM approaches, MAXENT and ENFA, produced relative different Habitat Suitability Maps for the lowland tapir. While MAXENT was efficient at identifying areas as suitable or unsuitable, it was less efficient (when compared to the results by ENFA) at identifying the gradient of habitat suitability. MAXENT is a more multifaceted technique that establishes more complex relationships between dependent and independent variables. Our results demonstrate that for at least one species, the lowland tapir, the use of a simple consensual approach (average of ENFA and MAXENT models outputs) better reflected its current distribution patterns. The Brazilian ecoregions have the highest habitat loss for the tapir. Cerrado and Atlantic Forest account for nearly half (48.19%) of the total area lost. The Amazon region contains the largest area under protection, and the most extensive remaining habitat for the tapir, but also showed high levels of habitat loss outside protected areas, which increases the importance of support for proper management.

AB  - Effective conservation planning requires biotic data across an entire region. In data-poor ecosystems conservation planning is informed by using environmental surrogates (e.g. temperature) predominantly in two ways: to develop habitat classification schemes (1) or develop species distribution models (2). We test the utility of both approaches for conservation planning of marine ecosystems, and rank environmental surrogates, such as depth and distance from shore, according to their power to predict the distribution and abundance of biotic species. Specifically, we compared a habitat classification scheme; based on coarse levels of habitat types derived from depth and distance from shore; against species distribution models, which predict fish abundance and prevalence as a function of environmental surrogates (depth, distance from shore, latitude, reef area, zoning, and several metrics of habitat structural complexity). We consistently set conservation target levels to 21% of each conservation feature, following global standards and a sensitivity analyses. Thus when running scenarios to protect fish species we aimed to protect at least 21% of each species, and when running scenarios of habitat classes, we aimed to protect at least 21% of each habitat class. We found that when aiming to protect 21% of the chosen conservation targets, distribution models protected 21% of the predicted abundance/occurrence of all modelled species and functional groups, but did not protect most habitats. Contrastingly, using a habitat classification scheme protected 21% of all habitat types and 34% of all species and functional groups, but required protecting three times more area. Thus, using only distribution models as targets in data-poor ecosystems could be a risky conservation planning strategy. Ultimately the best conservation outcomes were achieved by incorporating local knowledge to synthesize the conservation outcomes of both scenarios.

AB  - Protected areas and ecotourism are both conservation measures for plant resources, but for one specific plant species, the priority of them needs a reasonable planning. The suitable habitat distribution of species is the basis for planning, and the impact of climate change on habitat distribution should also be considered. Based on maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), we assessed the current and future suitable habitat distributions of seven species of genus Rhododendron in Northeast China. Combined with the distributions of existing protected areas and tourist attractions, the conservation planning is recommended. Our results showed that: (1) the suitable habitat areas of R. redowskianum and R. aureum were mainly distributed in the Changbai Mountains covering only 2.05% and 3.84% of the total area of Northeast China, and showed decreasing trends in the future. (2) The suitable habitat areas for R. schlippenbachii were mainly distributed in the southeast and southwest of Liaoning Province, with a cover of 4.29% in Northeast China. For R. mucronulatum and R. micranthum, suitable habitat areas were mainly distributed in the east and west of Liaoning Province, covering 14.27% and 7.95% respectively. For R. dauricum and R. lapponicum, suitable habitat areas were mainly distributed in the Greater Khingan Range, Lesser Khingan Range, and Changbai Mountains, covering 43.76% and 22.24% respectively. Moreover, they all showed increasing trends in the future. (3) Therefore, protected area was recommended for R. redowskianum and R. aureum, while ecotourism or both protected area and ecotourism was recommended for R. schlippenbachii, R. mucronulatum, R. micranthum, R. dauricum, and R. lapponicum. This study provides planning suggestions for the conservation of Rhododendron and is a reference for the conservation of other plant species.

AB  - Habitat loss leads to habitat fragmentation. Habitat connectivity, however, could mitigate effects of habitat fragmentation on wildlife populations. This study was carried out to assess habitat suitability and connectivity of a brown bear population located along the Iran-Iraq border in the Zagros Mountains, at the southernmost extreme of the species range. A total of 34 presences of brown bear and seven environmental variables were used for habitat modeling using MaxEnt, and connectivity among habitat patches was assessed by electrical-circuit methods using Circuitscape. Distance from villages, elevation, slope, and distance from roads were respectively the most important variables in habitat modeling of the brown bear in the study area. In total, 33 habitat patches were identified for the brown bear, which covered about 12% of the study area. Results of connectivity revealed high connectivity among habitat patches in the Iran section, whereas in the Iraq section, only low connectivity was observed in areas close to the Iran-Iraq border. Systematic monitoring is recommended to assess potential habitat patches and habitat connectivity of the brown bear in future research as a first step towards cooperative management efforts between wildlife managers of Iran and Iraq. Moreover, establishing a transboundary protected area is highly recommended along the Iran-Iraq border to provide safety and connectivity for the brown bear in this region and reduce the effect of the country border as a separating factor.

AB  - Background: Detailed knowledge of a species' autecology as well as information on the availability of suitable habitats and the impacts of climate change on the species and its habitat are requirements for adequate conservation planning. For this purpose, species distribution modelling has been suggested as an effective tool to assess the potential geographic distributions of species under different climate scenarios.
   Aims: The aim of this study was to generate suitability maps and predictive maps based on scenarios of climate change to identify areas with the most value for conservation for the western Iberian endemics Silene acutifolia, S. foetida subsp. foetida and S. foetida subsp. gayana.
   Methods: Maxent software was used to model and predict the distribution of the species based on environmental variables under climate change scenarios.
   Results: Our analysis indicated that the models performed well, predicting with high accuracy the current distributions of the species. Under two scenarios of increasing CO2, the species were predicted to be susceptible to a major reduction of suitable habitat; both S. foetida subspecies were shown to be at risk of extinction.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the inclusion of S. foetida in national conservation and long-term monitoring programmes must be considered.

AB  - Natural Community Conservation Plans (NCCPs) represent the most powerful tool in statute for regional and systematic conservation planning for species at risk in California. This study examines the use of species conceptual models (SCMs) and species distribution models (SDMs) in such planning. Eighteen Natural Community Conservation Plans (NCCPs) were analyzed to determine if or how explicit connections were made between both types of models for a covered species and key components of its conservation strategy. Results indicate plans were strong in the use of SDMs, however, each deferred preparing or using SCMs to later management and monitoring phases. A more effective best planning practice for developing a conservation strategy is to explicitly integrate SCMs and SDMs during plan preparation.

AB  - Evaluations of the coastal and marine conservation require detailed maps of types of communities that occur in the zone. This paper describes how distribution models are used to develop benthic distribution maps with biological data collected from surveys, and environmental variables derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), including different indices of terrain complexity. We compared the success of two algorithms, Maxent and ENFA, commonly used in the marine environment to identify best suited methods to modelling the distributions of six benthic communities identified in the marine protected area of La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain). The environmental variables depth, slope, type of substrate, Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) and Vector Ruggedness Measure (VRM) were the variables with higher influence on the distribution of communities. The distribution models of both techniques were coincident and congruent, although Maxent produced more constrained predictions than ENFA, highlighting the significantly better performance of the Maxent models for communities with fewer presences, in this study, black coral and brown garden eels. The resulting distribution maps were evaluated and reclassified and they were represented in a unique map that summarises all of the individual maps. Given that the distribution models were made on the same study area and based on presences data collected at the same time, it was possible to make a preliminary analyse of the interactions between the studied communities.

AB  - Introduction: Huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus Molina) is the most threatened flag species of Southern Patagonia, where conservation efforts were not effective to avoid the retraction of its distribution area. Habitat quality modeling can assist to design better management strategies for regional conservation planning. The objective was to elaborate one habitat suitability map for huemul, defining the environmental characteristics at landscape level, and determining the distribution of the suitable habitat inside the current natural reserve network.
   Methods: We used a database of 453 records and explored 40 potential explanatory variables (climate, topographic, and landscape variables including human-related ones) to develop one habitat suitability map using the Environmental Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) for Santa Cruz province (Argentina). We combined the outputs in a GIS project using different shapes, including the current natural reserve network.
   Results: We defined the potential habitat for huemul, where forest edges and ecotone zones (e.g., mainly alpine environments) were the most important environmental variables, as well as some forest types (e.g., Nothofagus pumilio). Habitat losses were found in the extreme potential distribution areas (northern and southern areas), probably related to the increasing ranch activities. The current natural reserve network maintains approximately half of the huemul potential habitat in Santa Cruz province, where National Parks presented the similar conservation importance than the Provincial natural reserves.
   Conclusions: Habitat suitability model for huemul can be used as a decision support system for new management strategies at different landscape levels to improve the current conservation efforts.

AB  - Aim: Large carnivores are currently recolonizing parts of their historical ranges in Europe after centuries of persecution and habitat loss. Understanding the mechanisms driving these recolonizations is important for proactive conservation planning. Using the brown bear (Ursus arctos) and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) as examples, we explore where and when large carnivores are likely to expand into human-dominated landscapes and how varying levels of resistance due to human pressure might impact this recolonization process.
   Location: Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods: We used ensembles of species distribution models to relate species occurrence data to climate, topography and satellite-based land-cover predictors at a 10 km spatial resolution. Resulting predictions of suitable habitat areas were fed into a dispersal model to simulate range expansion over the 10 time-steps for different human pressure scenarios. Finally, we overlaid predictions with protected areas to highlight areas that are likely key for future connectivity, but where human pressures might hamper dispersal.
   Results: We found widespread suitable habitat for both species (bear: 30,000 km(2), lynx: 170,000 km(2)), yet human pressure limits potential range expansions. For brown bears, core habitats between the Cantabrian and Pyrenean populations remained unconnected despite suitable habitat in between. For lynx, we predicted higher range expansion potential, although high human pressures in southern coastal Spain negatively affected expansion potential.
   Main conclusions: Our results highlight that the recolonization potential of brown bears and lynx in the Iberian Peninsula is likely more constrained by lower permeability of landscapes due to human pressure than by habitat availability, a situation likely emblematic for large carnivores in many parts of the world. More generally, our approach provides a simple tool for conservation planners and managers to identify where range expansion is likely to occur and where proactively managing to allow large carnivores to safely disperse through human-dominated landscapes can contribute to viable large carnivore populations.

AB  - Aim For many deep-sea fisheries, there is an urgent management requirement for information on the presence of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs). Gathering deep-sea data using conventional techniques can be expensive and time-consuming. One way to provide a relatively rapid assessment of VME presence is to use data from fisheries by-catch and historical scientific observations. Our aim was to predict suitable habitat for octocorals around South Georgia and to estimate the extent to which octocoral habitat is currently protected by fisheries management measures. In addition, we attempted to determine the types of terrain in which octocorals and fishing activities occur.
   Location South Georgia, sub-Antarctic.
   Methods A terrain map of South Georgia was created using Benthic Terrain Modeler (BTM). Georeferenced octocoral data were combined with environmental layers to create an octocoral habitat suitability map using ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA).
   Results Most octocoral by-catch samples originated from narrow crest (an area representing shelf break and moraines) and steep (continental) slope terrains. Calcite saturation state and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) were the most influential environmental parameters in determining highly suitable octocoral habitat. The ENFA model highlighted shelf-break areas to be highly suitable habitat for octocorals and that 38% of this habitat around South Georgia lies within areas currently protected by fisheries management; a further 20% is below the 2000-m fishing depth, meaning effectively that 58% of predicted highly suitable octocoral habitat is currently protected. Although these results indicate protection levels for octocoral habitat well above international standards/targets, the fishery remains active within a relatively concentrated shelf area at 700-2000 m, potentially having a large impact on the 42% of highly suitable octocoral habitat predicted to lie at these depths.
   Main conclusions This research demonstrates the potential for using fisheries by-catch data to create habitat suitability maps that can inform fisheries management and future research.

AB  - In face of increasing anthropogenic disturbance in the deep sea, it is a priority to better understand the regional distribution of cold-water corals (CWC). These organisms create some of the most species-rich habitats in the deep sea and, for this reason, they must be properly protected and managed. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable habitat for multiple CWC taxa off the Brazilian continental margin and compare their environmental niches. Habitat suitability models were developed using the Maxent approach, which allowed for the prediction of species distribution and for the identification of potential 'hot spot' areas that may be important for biodiversity conservation. Ecological niches were determined by a PCA-env approach, and niche similarity and equivalence were evaluated based on niche overlap using the Schoener's D metric. Potentially suitable habitat for Octocorallia covered a broad latitudinal range encompassing nearly the entire Brazilian continental margin, whereas Scleractinia had greater potentially suitable habitat in the Central and Southern areas. Scleractinian species were observed to slightly differ in their environmental niche, with non-reef-forming species being more tolerant to a wider range of environmental conditions in comparison with reef-forming species, inhabiting a wider area of the South American continental margin. Due to the high potential suitability for several CWC species, the Central and Southern parts of the Brazilian continental margin should be considered as potential areas high CWC diversity. Considering the current state of the art and strategic assessment tools, these areas are important targets for conservation, management, and environmental impact assessment. Most reef-forming species had similar but not directly equivalent ecological niches, indicating that mapping efforts and management planning should consider CWCs at the species level.

AB  - Understanding cetacean distribution is essential for conservation planning and decision-making, particularly in regions subject to rapid environmental changes. Nevertheless, information on their spatiotemporal distribution is commonly limited, especially from remote areas. Species distribution models (SDMs) are powerful tools, relating species occurrences to environmental variables to predict the species' potential distribution. This study aims at using presence-only SDMs (MaxEnt) to identify suitable habitats for fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) on their Nordic and Barents Seas feeding grounds. We used spatial-block cross-validation to tune MaxEnt parameters and evaluate model performance using spatially independent testing data. We considered spatial sampling bias correction using four methods. Important environmental variables were distance to shore and sea ice edge, variability of sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity, and depth. Suitable fin whale habitats were predicted along the west coast of Svalbard, between Svalbard and the eastern Norwegian Sea, coastal areas off Iceland and southern East Greenland, and along the Knipovich Ridge to Jan Mayen. Results support that presence-only SDMs are effective tools to predict cetacean habitat suitability, particularly in remote areas like the Arctic Ocean. SDMs constitute a cost-effective method for targeting future surveys and identifying top priority sites for conservation measures.

AB  - Aim In this study we test molecular-based biogeographical hypotheses of Pleistocene persistence and recolonization in a North Atlantic rocky intertidal invertebrate assemblage using species distribution modelling. Location North Atlantic coastlines. Methods We develop a novel application of species distribution models for intertidal taxa by using both oceanographic and terrestrial environmental variables recently made available at biologically relevant pixel resolutions. We use these model-based distribution estimates to test alternative hypotheses of late Pleistocene history across six amphi-Atlantic taxa whose hypothesized Pleistocene distributions are constructed from previous population genetic inferences. Results Species distribution models correctly estimate all six current amphi-Atlantic distributions on both sides of the Atlantic. Models hindcasted to the Last Glacial Maximum estimate trans-Atlantic distributional persistence in three of six taxa, and conversely indicate no suitable habitat on the North American coastline in the other three taxa. These results are consistent with the histories inferred from population genetic data for five of six of the taxa, the exception being Nucella lapillus, whose hindcasted trans-Atlantic persistence at the Last Glacial Maximum contrasts with the mitochondrial DNA-based estimates of post-glacial expansion from Europe to North America. Main conclusions Marine and terrestrial distribution models are broadly concordant with known contemporary distributions and fail to reject five of six historical distributional hypotheses based on population genetic inferences. This demonstrated utility suggests that this technique could be expanded to examine how Pleistocene and contemporary climate change might play a role in intertidal species distributions across the entire community. Future application and development of these marine and terrestrial distribution models will strengthen inferences regarding the processes generating intertidal community assembly and population divergence, and may assist in conservation planning and the design of marine reserves.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) provide robust inferences about species-specific site suitability and are increasingly used in systematic conservation planning (SCP). SDMs are subjected to intrinsic uncertainties, and conservation studies have generally overlooked these. The integration of SDM uncertainties in conservation solutions requires the development of a suitable optimization algorithm. Exact optimization algorithms grant efficiency to conservation solutions, but most of their implementations generate a single binary and indivisible solution. Therefore, without variation in their parameterization, they provide low flexibility in the implementation of conservation solutions by stakeholders. Contrarily, heuristic algorithms provide such flexibility, by generating large amounts of sub-optimal solutions. As a consequence, efficiency and flexibility are implicitly linked in conservation applications: mathematically efficient solutions provide less flexibility, and the flexible solutions provided by heuristics are sub-optimal. To avoid this trade-off between flexibility and efficiency in SCP, we propose a reserve-selection framework, based on exact optimization combined with a post-selection of SDM outputs. This reserve-selection framework provides flexibility and addresses the efficiency and representativeness of conservation solutions. To exemplify the approach, we analyzed an experimental design, crossing pre- and post-selection of SDM outputs versus heuristics and exact mathematical optimizations. We used the Mediterranean Sea as a biogeographical template for our analyses, integrating the outputs of eight SDM techniques for 438 fish species.

AB  - Data on geographical ranges are essential when defining the conservation status of a species, and in evaluating levels of human disturbance. Where locality data are deficient, presence-only ecological niche modelling (ENM) can provide insights into a species' potential distribution, and can aid in conservation planning. Presence-only ENM is especially important for rare, cryptic and nocturnal species, where absence is difficult to define. Here we applied ENM to carry out an anthropogenic risk assessment and set conservation priorities for three threatened species of Asian slow loris (Primates: Nycticebus).
   Borneo, Java and Sumatra, Southeast Asia.
   Distribution models were built using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) ENM. We input 20 environmental variables comprising temperature, precipitation and altitude, along with species locality data. We clipped predicted distributions to forest cover and altitudinal data to generate remnant distributions. These were then applied to protected area (PA) and human land-use data, using specific criteria to define low-, medium- or high-risk areas. These data were analysed to pinpoint priority study sites, suitable reintroduction zones and protected area extensions.
   A jackknife validation method indicated highly significant models for all three species with small sample sizes (n = 10 to 23 occurrences). The distribution models represented high habitat suitability within each species' geographical range. High-risk areas were most prevalent for the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) on Java, with the highest proportion of low-risk areas for the Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis) on Borneo. Eighteen PA extensions and 23 priority survey sites were identified across the study region.
   Discriminating areas of high habitat suitability lays the foundations for planning field studies and conservation initiatives. This study highlights potential reintroduction zones that will minimize anthropogenic threats to animals that are released. These data reiterate the conclusion of previous research, showing MaxEnt is a viable technique for modelling species distributions with small sample sizes.

AB  - Species ranges are changing in response to human-related disturbances and often management and conservation decisions must be based on incomplete information. In this context, species distribution models (SDMs) represent the most widely used tool, but they often lack any reference to demographic performance of the population under study, spatial structure of the habitat patches, or connectivity at the landscape level.
   Combining a multi-state SDM with a landscape pattern analysis and a mortality model, we developed a spatially-explicit, integrated model to assist and inform conservation planning for the Apennine brown bear in central Italy. We identified 15 critical habitat areas, potentially hosting 76 adult female bears. Many of these areas are, however, characterized by high levels of human-related mortality, making them attractive sink-like areas. Structural connectivity was higher in the northern part of the study area while only limited connectivity characterizes the core area, where most of the bears currently live.
   Our integrated model indicates that the conservation of this relict and isolated bear population is a realistic conservation goal, as we estimated that 192-270 bears could live across the Apennines. Our modelling framework enhances the biological realism of traditional SDMs and provides a conservation planning tool that integrates habitat suitability, mortality risk (as a component of the total demographic performance) and structural connectivity among habitat patches at the landscape scale. It is particularly suited for endangered species living in a human-modified landscapes where establishing a realistic and spatially explicit conservation goal would facilitate pro-active management.

AB  - Conservation planning analyses often employ data on biodiversity and sometimes vulnerability and these data are generally assumed to be accurate and correct. Here, different ways of exploring uncertainty associated with typical input data used for conservation planning are illustrated. First the uncertainty associated with predicted species distribution data is measured, summarised, and visualised. Second the uncertainty associated with the choice of vulnerability model is evaluated using Bayesian Model Averaging and the implication of this uncertainty on inference about key relationships associated with native forest conversion is assessed. The approaches used to assess uncertainty are applicable to any conservation planning exercise and such assessments will increase confidence in the products developed and reduce the risk that conservation effort is misdirected.

AB  - Mammals can serve as an indicator of global climate change impacts on species' distributions due to the wide range of ecological niches they utilize. Tropical Asia encompasses several biodiversity hotspots, is the largest reservoir of mammalian diversity on earth, and has already experienced the extinction of several mammal species either regionally or locally. Global climate change could become a significant driver of species extinction, either directly or synergistically with other factors, such as habitat loss, agricultural expansion, overexploitation, and land use change. Despite the variability of climatic regimes across tropical Asia, the potential impacts of climate change on continental-scale distributions of mammals have not been examined. To address this issue, we developed habitat suitability models for four threatened large mammals (Ursus thibetanus, Elephas maximus, Hoolock hoolock, and Panthera tigris tigris), across their entire distributions in Asia. We used presence-only distribution records and nine bioclimatic and environmental variables and built species-specific habitat suitability models using a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). We used a moderate and an extreme climate scenario (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) and three time steps: current, 2050, and 2070. Our results suggest that changes in annual precipitation, annual mean temperature, precipitation, and temperature seasonality could reduce suitable habitat for these mammals and therefore increase their extinction risks. However, several patches of stable habitat are projected to persist through the late twenty-first century, and these climate change refugia areas can be managed as an important strategy for conservation of the mammal species and the maintenance of biodiversity in the face of ongoing climate change. In this context, we recommend the following steps for the conservation of global mammal populations: (i) define the spatial extent (local, regional, or continental scale) of the target mammals, (ii) identify and prioritize climate change refugial areas following ecological niche models or other methods based on biological data, and (iii) implement management actions by analyzing current management tools and the strategies required (e.g., habitat restoration or assisted migration for prioritized species) to achieve long-term conservation goals.

AB  - Context Climate refugia-areas that remain suitable for species during periods of climate disruption-have played an important role in species persistence over time. Identifying and protecting these refugia is a key climate change adaptation approach for conservation planning. Objectives To identify climate refugia for Australian tropical/sub-tropical rainforest flora, from the Last Glacial Maximum to 2070. Methods Habitat suitability models were calibrated for 30 species using Maxent, and projected onto climate data for: Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, similar to 22,000 ybp); mid-Holocene (MH, similar to 6000 ybp); current period; and 2070. The intersection of suitable habitat over consecutive periods was assessed, identifying: current refugia (LGM-MH-Current); future refugia (Current-Future); and High Value Refugia (HVR, suitable over all four periods). Refugial hotspots (regions suitable for at least 15 species) were also identified. Results Suitable habitat was generally projected to span the greatest area in the current period. Four current refugial hotspots were identified: Wet Tropics, Central Mackay Coast, South Eastern Queensland, and North Coast (New South Wales). While suitable habitat for most species may decline in the future, HVRs will likely be retained for all species to at least 2070, although restricted in size. Future refugia was also projected in areas beyond species' dispersal ranges. Conclusions HVRs are highly important for the conservation of these rainforest species, given their generation times, limited dispersal capabilities and additional anthropogenic barriers to movement. This study assists in understanding long-term spatial shifts in rainforest flora in response to climate change and in designing future conservation strategies.

AB  - The Endangered red-shanked douc Pygathrix nemaeus is a charismatic Asian colobine endemic to Vietnam, Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). The largest population is found in central-eastern Lao PDR but it has never been quantified. We conducted line-transect surveys in Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area in 2011-2012. We used distance sampling combined with a habitat suitability model to estimate group density and group abundance in the area. Our analysis yielded a density of 2.8 (range 1.9-4.1) groups per km2 and c. 4,420 groups within the predicted c. 1,600 km2 of suitable habitat in Nakai-Nam Theun. These are the only available data for P. nemaeus in Lao PDR to date. We discuss the limitations of our survey, which involved potential violations of the distance sampling method, and highlight the challenges of using this method for primates. We also consider the importance of assessing limitations in distance sampling studies, to evaluate reliability and facilitate comparisons. The population of P. nemaeus in Lao PDR is under threat from illegal hunting and is not the focus of any specific conservation action. To avoid a repetition of the decline the species has already experienced in Vietnam, and to secure the species' global survival, conservation projects need to target the population in Nakai-Nam Theun. A long-term conservation and research project in this key biodiversity area will also benefit other threatened and unique co-existing species.

AB  - Information and data on the distribution of wildlife species become important when strategizing the management and conservation of the species. Species distribution models have increasingly been used as a predictive tool in wildlife conservation planning and management. This research assessed the distribution of the sun bear and identified the relevant distribution descriptive variables in the Krau Wildlife Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA). Marginality and specialization factors showed that the sun bear habitat is very specific compared to the entire study area and its niche breadth was slightly narrow. Among all the habitat suitability algorithms available in Biomapper software package, median with the extreme optimum algorithm was found to have the best predictive capabilities by means of a continuous Boyce index. Results showed that sun bear can rarely be found in high altitudes, prefers lowland Dipterocarp, and avoids Mountain Ericaceous and Mixed Hill Dipterocarp forests. It also prefers to live nearby rivers, tends to avoid villages and prefers regions with fine silty-clay and loamy textures soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim The distribution of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the deep sea is poorly understood. This has led to the emergence of modelling methods to predict the occurrence of suitable habitat for conservation planning in data-sparse areas. Recent global analyses for cold-water corals predict a high probability of occurrence along the slopes of continental margins, offshore banks and seamounts in the north-eastern Atlantic, but tend to overestimate the extent of the habitat and do not provide the detail needed for finer-scale assessments and protected area planning. Using Lophelia pertusa reefs as an example, this study integrates multibeam bathymetry with a wide range of environmental data to produce a regional high-resolution habitat suitability map relevant for marine spatial planning.
   Location Irish continental margin (extended continental shelf claim).
   Methods Maximum entropy modelling was used to predict L. pertusa reef distribution at a spatial resolution of 0.002 degrees. Coral occurrences were assembled from public databases, publications and video footage, and filtered for quality. Environmental predictor variables were produced by re-sampling of global oceanographic data sets and a regional ocean circulation model. Multi-scale terrain parameters were computed from multibeam bathymetry.
   Results Suitable habitat was predicted on mound features and in canyon areas along a narrow band following the slopes of the Irish continental margin, the Rockall Bank and the Porcupine Bank. Standard deviation of the seabed slope (54%), temperature (28%) and bottom shear stress (9%) were the most important variables to predict coral distribution.
   Main conclusions This is the first regional coral habitat suitability modelling study to incorporate full coverage multibeam bathymetry in the deep sea. The use of high-resolution environmental data and quality-controlled distribution data significantly reduces habitat overestimation demonstrated by global-scale analyses and produces detailed maps to support marine protected area network design. The strong response of the corals to local-scale terrain variability highlights the need to protect the seabed from anthropogenic impacts that may reduce its complexity, such as bottom trawling.

Species distribution models (SDMs) can help identify critical habitat for reserve design and selection, and have quickly advanced to the fore of ecological inquiry. Such models are typically dominated by abiotic factors, following the Eltonian Noise Hypothesis (ENH) that physical features set the limits of species distributions. Nevertheless, recent studies challenge this notion and highlight the importance of biotic interactions. Resolving this discrepancy could have significant implications for conservation and ecological understanding. To test these ideas, we built distribution models for two large herbivores, muskoxen (Ovibos muschatus) and Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi), systematically observed across a vast spatial extent 65 islands spanning 800,000 km(2) in the Canadian High Arctic. To test the ENH we fit SDMs with two sets of predictors: (1) abiotic only (i.e. topographic, climatic) and (2) abiotic thorn biotic (i.e. vegetation communities, distance-to-heterospecifics). We evaluated these models and spatially estimated habitat suitability for each species. We found both sets of models had good predictive ability, although biotic variables (i.e. proportion of grass-lichen-moss) improved model performance and substantially narrowed areas of high habitat suitability. Niche overlap between caribou and muskoxen was moderate and highly suitable areas were spatially disjunct between species and largely outside protected areas. These results fail to support the ENH. Our study implies that biotic features, although often overlooked, may be important to the performance of SDMs and vital in identifying priority areas for conservation. For these large herbivores, reflecting trophic interactions in SDMs was essential when estimating areas of conservation value. Our approach helps prepare the way for improved projections regarding the prospects for wildlife while laying the foundation for biologically relevant protected areas. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Deciding which areas to protect, and where to manage and how, are no easy tasks. Many protected areas were established opportunistically under strong political and economic constraints, which may have resulted in inefficient and ineffective conservation. Systematic conservation planning has helped us move from ad-hoc decisions to a quantitative and transparent decision-making process, identifying conservation priorities that achieve explicit objectives in a cost-efficient manner. Here we use Finnish butterflies to illustrate different modeling approaches to address three different types of situations in conservation planning at three different spatial scales. First, we employ species distribution models at the national scale to construct a conservation priority map for 91 species at the resolution of 10x10 km. Species distribution models interpolate sparse occurrence data to infer variation in habitat suitability and to predict species responses to habitat loss, management actions and climate change. Second, at the regional scale we select the optimal management plan to protect a set of habitat specialist species. And third, at the landscape scale, we use a metapopulation approach to manage a network of habitat patches for long-term persistence of a single butterfly species. These different modeling approaches illustrate trade-offs between complexity and tractability and between generality and precision. General correlation-based models are helpful to set priorities for multiple species at large spatial scales. More specific management questions at smaller scales require further data and more complex models. The vast numbers of insect species with diverse ecologies provide a source of information that has remained little used in systematic conservation planning.

AB  - Alaska has one of the most rapidly changing climates on earth and is experiencing an accelerated rate of human disturbance, including resource extraction and transportation infrastructure development. Combined, these factors increase the state's vulnerability to biological invasion, which can have acute negative impacts on ecological integrity and subsistence practices. Of growing concern is the spread of Alaska's first documented freshwater aquatic invasive plant Elodea spp. (elodea). In this study, we modeled the suitable habitat of elodea using global and state-specific species occurrence records and environmental variables, in concert with an ensemble of model algorithms. Furthermore, we sought to incorporate local subsistence concerns by using Native Alaskan knowledge and available statewide subsistence harvest data to assess the potential threat posed by elodea to Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and whitefish (Coregonus nelsonii) subsistence. State models were applied to future climate (2040-2059) using five general circulation models best suited for Alaska. Model evaluations indicated that our results had moderate to strong predictability, with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values above 0.80 and classification accuracies ranging from 66 to 89 %. State models provided a more robust assessment of elodea habitat suitability. These ensembles revealed different levels of management concern statewide, based on the interaction of fish subsistence patterns, known spawning and rearing sites, and elodea habitat suitability, thus highlighting regions with additional need for targeted monitoring. Our results suggest that this approach can hold great utility for invasion risk assessments and better facilitate the inclusion of local stakeholder concerns in conservation planning and management.

AB  - Aim Systematic conservation planning is vital for allocating protected areas given the spatial distribution of conservation features, such as species. Due to incomplete species inventories, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used for predicting species' habitat suitability and species' probability of occurrence. Currently, SDMs mostly ignore spatial dependencies in species and predictor data. Here, we provide a comparative evaluation of how accounting for spatial dependencies, that is, autocorrelation, affects the delineation of optimized protected areas. Location Southeast Australia, Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf, Danube River Basin. Methods We employ Bayesian spatially explicit and non-spatial SDMs for terrestrial, marine and freshwater species, using realm-specific planning unit shapes (grid, hexagon and subcatchment, respectively). We then apply the software gurobi to optimize conservation plans based on species targets derived from spatial and non-spatial SDMs (10%-50% each to analyse sensitivity), and compare the delineation of the plans. Results Across realms and irrespective of the planning unit shape, spatially explicit SDMs (a) produce on average more accurate predictions in terms of AUC, TSS, sensitivity and specificity, along with a higher species detection probability. All spatial optimizations meet the species conservation targets. Spatial conservation plans that use predictions from spatially explicit SDMs (b) are spatially substantially different compared to those that use non-spatial SDM predictions, but (c) encompass a similar amount of planning units. The overlap in the selection of planning units is smallest for conservation plans based on the lowest targets and vice versa. Main conclusions Species distribution models are core tools in conservation planning. Not surprisingly, accounting for the spatial characteristics in SDMs has drastic impacts on the delineation of optimized conservation plans. We therefore encourage practitioners to consider spatial dependencies in conservation features to improve the spatial representation of future protected areas.

AB  - The well-being of a species fundamentally rests on understanding its biology, home range, and distribution. The highly seasonal distribution of kobs poses conservation and management difficulties, particularly because of the capricious nature of the ever-changing ecological and vegetation dynamics of the ecosystem. Assessing the distribution of kobs and their associated vegetation provides insight into the vulnerability and conservation status of the species. Species distribution and habitat suitability maps were developed and created respectively for the management of kobs in the Shai Hills Resource Reserve. Kob presence data collected was analyzed using the spatial analyst and Hawth's tool in the ArcGIS software where the gradients of kob distribution within the protected area landscape were plotted and mapped. Seven environmental variables including location, land cover/use, slope/elevation, nearness to dams and rivers, temperature, and rainfall were considered to have effect on kob distribution pattern and as such used in the development of species distribution and habitat suitability maps. The results indicated that kobs in the Shai Hills Resource Reserve (SHRR) assume a clumped or contagious distribution pattern where individual kobs are aggregated in patches. Rainfall, temperature, nearness to dams and rivers, slope/elevation, and land cover/use had influence in kob distribution. Of all the cataloged habitats, 86, 13, and 1% were moderately suitable, suitable, and unsuitable, respectively. Long-term survival of species depends on adequately large areas of suitable habitats and opportunities for home range activities between such areas. As such, it is recommended that suitable habitats for kobs be dedicated and designated as conservation areas, especially areas along the western boundary.

AB  - Delineating a species range is challenging because many factors interact at multiple spatial scales to affect a species distribution. Species distribution models (SDM) can be used to identify factors most associated with a species presence and, therefore, potentially define a range edge. We evaluated the utility of two popular SDM approaches, maximum entropy models (e.g., MaxEnt) and generalized linear models (GLM), for determining the range edge for the threatened Blanding's Turtles, Emydoidea blandingii, in northeastern New York, USA. Using the mapping and analysis software ArcGIS, we constructed and validated SDMs using presence/absence records (GLM) and presence/background records (MaxEnt) with 11 environmental predictor variables. Because of the limits imposed by the low number of absences, we found that GLM was not as successful as MaxEnt at predicting habitat suitability for rare and cryptic species like E. blandingii. Our results also indicated that a distinct environmentally induced range edge is associated with factors related to elevation. Both GLM and MaxEnt models also projected the presence of suitable habitat outside of the current range, including locations with known disjunct populations. We conclude that a presence/background SDM approach such as MaxEnt is valid when accurate data on locational absences are lacking, as is typical for rare, cryptic species. Using SDM to understand factors that shape the range edge can aid in planning habitat conservation and management of threatened species such as E. blandingii.

AB  - The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is one of the most important of all conservation indicators, but most developing countries do not have enough information with which to make assessments. The use of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict habitat suitability, both currently and in the future under the effects of climate change, offers a potential solution for estimating extinction risk. With a set of validated observations, we used SDMs to make preliminary evaluations of the risk of extinction for 114 Egyptian medicinal plants based on IUCN Red-List Criteria and Categories. Using MaxEnt and eleven environmental variables, distributions were projected for 2020, 2050, and 2080 under two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no dispersal. The IUCN assessments used the predicted distributions as well as the actual records to measure both extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). There was a positive correlation between EOO estimates based on actual records and those based on SDMs, demonstrating the ability of SDMs to compensate for a lack of data. Most species could be classified as Least Concern (LC) at the current time, whilst in the future under climate change, many species face some risk of extinction, depending on assumptions. We conclude that it is possible to make regional risk assessments even in data-sparse countries, in order to plan conservation management in the future. Using species distribution modelling together with IUCN Red-List assessment is a good method for countries where data are sparse in order to conserve and protect threatened species.

AB  - This paper presents a species distribution model (SDM) to quantify relationships between environmental variables and habitat suitability using unbalanced presence-absence data common in ecology. The proposed model applies a stratified sample balancing scheme for the random forest classifier where every classification tree receives a balanced sample of presence and absence. The model is applied to the Australian coast's seagrass habitats, where seagrass populations have been on the decline. Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) seagrass presence-absence data is used to train the model. Seagrasses are observed at 97.6% of the survey locations, and seagrass absence is recorded at only 2.4% of the survey locations. The proposed model's accuracy is validated with an independent dataset on seagrass presence from the Coastal and Marine Resources Information System (CAMRIS). The environmental variables used in the analysis are obtained from the Ecological Marine Units (EMU) dataset. The variables on human-driven stressors to seagrass habitats due to ship traffic are obtained from World Port Index. The proposed model predicts seagrass absence at a recall rate of 80%, whereas the random forest recall rate is 24%. The model's variable importance profile aligns with the main drivers behind seagrass habitats reported in the literature. A case study is conducted for quantifying the impacts of two proposed ports in the Gulf of Carpenteria on the local seagrass habitats. Results show that balancing improves the explanatory and predictive capabilities of an SDM to define conditions resulting in a species' absence, aiding conservation planning with realistic species distributions.

AB  - Climate-driven shifts of coastal species' ranges constitute a key factor shaping both the vegetation composition and biodiversity of coastal ecosystems. Although phylogeographic studies relying on genetic data have shed light on the evolutionary history of macroalgae along the Northwest Pacific (NW-Pacific) coast, their distribution dynamics are less understood and require interdisciplinary examination. Here, we used a combination of species distribution models (SDMs) and genetic data to explain the causes of population persistence and genetic differentiation and their consequences for the brown seaweed Sargassum horneri in the NW-Pacific. In this region, the phylogeographic structure of S. homeri was analyzed by screening 72 populations spawning across the entire coastal distribution and obtaining their mtDNA cox3 data. Population genetic structure and SDMs based on paleoclimatic data consistently revealed that southern coasts of the Sea of Japan, North-Pacific-Japan, and the northern part of Okinawa Trough might have served as potential refugia for S. horneri during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Furthermore, we projected the distribution dynamics of S. horneri under future climate scenarios. The range of S. homeri was predicted to move northward, with a significant loss of suitable habitat, under the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). By contrast, projected range shifts were minimal under the low emissions scenario (RCP 2.6). Furthermore, North-Pacific-Japan was projected to be long-term persistence habitat for S. horneri under future climatic conditions, thus including this area in conservation planning could help mitigate for climate change implications. Our results enable a better understanding of the impacts of climate change on the spatio-temporal distribution of macroalgae and how this can inform coastal management and marine conservation planning.

AB  - Species distribution models have been used to predict the distribution of invasive species for conservation planning. Understanding spatial transferability of niche predictions is critical to promote species-habitat conservation and forecasting areas vulnerable to invasion. Grain size of predictor variables is an important factor affecting the accuracy and transferability of species distribution models. Choice of grain size is often dependent on the type of predictor variables used and the selection of predictors sometimes rely on data availability. This study employed the MAXENT species distribution model to investigate the effect of the grain size on model transferability for an invasive plant species. We modelled the distribution of Rhododendron ponticum in Wales, U.K. and tested model performance and transferability by varying grain size (50 m, 300 m, and 1 km). MAXENT-based models are sensitive to grain size and selection of variables. We found that over-reliance on the commonly used bioclimatic variables may lead to less accurate models as it often compromises the finer grain size of biophysical variables which may be more important determinants of species distribution at small spatial scales. Model accuracy is likely to increase with decreasing grain size. However, successful model transferability may require optimization of model grain size.

AB  - Asian Houbara Chlamydotis macqueenii is a vulnerable flagship species specific to steppe, desert and semi-desert habitats of the Middle East and Central Asia. Iran provides a critical corridor in the middle of Asian Houbara's migratory route and also hosts a relatively large proportion of wintering and breeding populations. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution and habitat suitability of both wintering and breeding populations of Asian Houbara in Iran and evaluate the effectiveness of the existing protected area network for long-term protection of the species. For this purpose, 644 occurrence points for wintering and 216 points for breeding birds were collected from 17 Iranian provinces during 2015 to 2017. We then used a consensus species distribution modelling (SDM) approach using 11 uncorrelated environmental variables to explore the distribution of Asian Houbara habitats. Results showed that climatic and topographic variations have the most significant influence on the regional-scale distribution of Asian Houbara. Of the suitable habitats recognised for the wintering and breeding populations, 40.6% and 29.6% respectively overlapped with the extent of the protected network. A high level of spatial niche similarity (78%) was observed between wintering and breeding populations. The central, eastern and south-central Iranian semi-arid regions and desert landscapes hosted the majority of both wintering and breeding houbara occurrences. Results of this study could be used for adopting direct management planning and raising the protection level of important no-hunting areas.

AB  - Climate change risk assessments are essential for the successful conservation and management of species under future climates. However, many management plans fail to include such assessments when evaluating threats to species or ecological communities. Species distribution models (SDMs) are versatile tools that can estimate species exposure to shifts in climate, but they lack information on the response capacity of species to climate change. Functional traits can be used in conjunction with SDMs to understand aspects of species biology that would suggest sensitivity to climate change. We illustrate how exposure to climate change and sensitivity of species based on their traits can be combined to generate predictions of climate change risk in four species listed as threatened (under state and federal legislation) and four unlisted plant species from the endemic Australian genus Persoonia (Proteaceae). We develop distribution models for each species using two emissions scenarios and assess four traits and two range metrics that are recognized as limiting factors in four potential climate change responses (reproduction, movement capability, habitat specialization, and spatial coverage) to assess the sensitivity of these eight species to climate change. Listed and unlisted species varied in niche breadth, environmental envelopes, and the percent contribution of variables to the model building process. Our models project a significant decline in habitat suitability under future climates at current occurrence locations for all species, and a 32-95% reduction in the total area (km2) of suitable habitat for all species by 2060, with significantly greater decline under the higher emissions scenario. Seven out of the eight species assessed ranked high for overall climate sensitivity therefore listing status may be a poor indicator of climate change risk to plant species. This has important implications for the continued focus on threatened taxa in conservation planning, particularly for hyper-diverse groups like plants and invertebrates where a species listing status is influenced by an oftenslow progress towards comprehensive assessments of threat status.

AB  - Mountain ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots that are increasingly threatened by climate and land use/land cover changes. Long-term biodiversity monitoring programs provide unique insights into resulting adverse impacts on plant and animal species distribution. Species distribution models (SDMs) in combination with satellite remote sensing (SRS) data offer the opportunity to analyze shifts of species distributions in response to these changes in a spatially explicit way. Here, we predicted the presence probability of three different rove beetles in a mountainous protected area (Gran Paradiso National Park, GPNP) using environmental variables derived from Landsat and Aster Global Digital Elevation Model data and an ensemble modelling approach based on five different model algorithms (maximum entropy, random forest, generalized boosting models, generalized additive models, and generalized linear models). The objectives of the study were (1) to evaluate the potential of SRS data for predicting the presence of species dependent on local-scale environmental parameters at two different time periods, (2) to analyze shifts in species distributions between the years, and (3) to identify the most important species-specific SRS predictor variables. All ensemble models showed area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics values above 0.7 and true skills statistics (TSS) values above 0.4, highlighting the great potential of SRS data. While only a small proportion of the total area was predicted as highly suitable for each species, our results suggest an increase of suitable habitat over time for the species Platydracus stercorarius and Ocypus ophthalmicus, and an opposite trend for Dinothenarus fossor. Vegetation cover was the most important predictor variable in the majority of the SDMs across all three study species. To better account for intra- and inter-annual variability of population dynamics as well as environmental conditions, a continuation of the monitoring program in GPNP as well as the employment of SRS with higher spatial and temporal resolution is recommended.

AB  - Fishing and habitat degradation have increased the extinction risk of sharks, and conservation strategies recognize that survival of juveniles is critical for the effective management of shark populations. Despite the rapid expansion of marine protected areas (MPAs) globally, the paucity of shark-monitoring data on large scales (100s-1000s km) means that the effectiveness of MPAs in halting shark declines remains unclear. Using data collected by baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS) in northwestern Australia, we developed generalized linear models to elucidate the ecological drivers of habitat suitability for juvenile sharks. We assessed occurrence patterns at the order and species levels. We included all juvenile sharks sampled and the 3 most abundant species sampled separately (grey reef [Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos], sandbar [Carcharhinus plumbeus], and whitetip reef sharks [Triaenodon obesus]). We predicted the occurrence of juvenile sharks across 490,515 km(2) of coastal waters and quantified the representation of highly suitable habitats within MPAs. Our species-level models had higher accuracy (k >= 0.69) and deviance explained (>= 48%) than our order-level model (k = 0.36 and deviance explained of 10%). Maps of predicted occurrence revealed different species-specific patterns of highly suitable habitat. These differences likely reflect different physiological or resource requirements between individual species and validate concerns over the utility of conservation targets based on aggregate species groups as opposed to a species-focused approach. Highly suitable habitats were poorly represented in MPAs with the most restrictions on extractive activities. This spatial mismatch possibly indicates a lack of explicit conservation targets and information on species distribution during the planning process. Non-extractive BRUVS provided a useful platform for building the suitability models across large scales to assist conservation planning across multiple maritime jurisdictions, and our approach provides a simple for method for testing the effectiveness of MPAs.

AB  - Although reptiles are the most diverse group of terrestrial vertebrates, crucial data on their extinction risks are lacking. The reptile species assessed by IUCN are only a fraction of those at risk of extinction. Thus, conservation planning and management decisions are hindered by the lack of ecological information on the species' distribution patterns and their habitat requirements. Pleske's racerunner (Eremias pleskei) is a rare and critically endangered species known to occur exclusively in the eastern Anatolian Montane Steppe ecoregion. In this study, we used ten species distribution model algorithms and 62 climate change scenarios (from 19 global climate models under four representative concentration pathways) to predict future habitat suitability for Pleske's racerunner in the Anatolian Montane Steppe ecoregion. Our results indicate that this species may in future migrate from its current distribution range towards the central and western areas of the Anatolian Montane Steppe ecoregion. Our results also show that the variation in the temperature-related variables in suitable habitats will increase in future as compared with the current conditions. It seems that due to climate change, in future, deserts will be appropriate for this species. The same mechanisms, however, will make some of its current habitats unsuitable. Dealing with uncertainties in climate change and species distribution modeling is a major challenge when planning strategies for species' conservation. We recommend conservation measures to be implemented to make sure that E. pleskei's current habitats remain suitable for it also in future.

AB  - Conservation biology has much more attention for biodiversity hot spots than before. In order to recognize the hotspots for Iranian terrestrial mammal species that are listed in any red list, nationally or globally, ten Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been applied. The SDMs evaluation results based on the TSS and AUC values showed that all ten models of habitat suitability perform significantly better than the random selection for all studied species. According to the results, biodiversity hotspots for threatened mammal species are located in north, west and central of Iran, along the Zagros and Alborz mountain range. Therefore, habitats for threatened mammal species have been limited to small parts of Iran (approximately 27% of the country). These areas are severely fragmented and only 57% of them have been announced protected by the current conservation system. The suggestion is that, as the sustainability of these habitats would strongly depend on maintaining dispersal corridors to facilitate the movement of animals among the habitat fragments, conservation efforts should focus on those hotspots which are not formally protected under conservation laws.

AB  - Apex predators play an important role in regulating ecological interactions, and therefore their loss can affect biodiversity across trophic levels. Large carnivores have experienced substantial population and range declines across Africa, and future climate change is likely to amplify these threats. Hence it is important to understand how future environmental changes will affect their long- term habitat suitability and population persistence. This study aims to identify the factors limiting the distribution of the endangered African wild dog, Lycaonpictus, and determine how biotic interactions and changing climate and land cover will affect future range suitability. We use Species Distribution Models ( SDMs) to predict the current and future distribution of suitable conditions for L. pictus and its dominant competitor Pantheraleo. We show that range suitability for L. pictus is limited by climatic and land cover variables, as well as high niche and range overlap with P.leo. Although both species are predicted to experience range contractions under future climate change, L. pictus may benefit from release from the effect of interspecific competition in eastern and central parts of its range. Our study highlights the importance of including land cover variables with corresponding future projections and incorporating the effects of competing species when predicting the future distribution of species whose ranges are not solely limited by climate. We conclude that SDMs can help identify priority areas for the long-term conservation of large carnivores, and therefore should be used to inform adaptive conservation management in face of future climate change.

AB  - Most existing protected area networks are biased to protect charismatic species or landscapes. We hypothesized that conservation networks designed to include unseen biodiversity-species rich groups that consist of inconspicuous taxa, or groups affected by knowledge gaps-are more efficient than networks that ignore these groups. To test this hypothesis, we generated species distribution models for 3006 arthropod species to determine which were represented in three networks of different sizes and biogeographic origin. We assessed the efficiency of each network using spatial prioritization to measure its completeness, the increment needed to achieve conservation targets, and its specificity, the extent to which proposed priority areas to maximize unseen biodiversity overlap with existing networks. We found that the representativeness of unseen biodiversity in the studied protected areas, or extrinsic representativeness, is low, with similar to 40% of the analyzed unseen biodiversity species being unprotected. We also found that existing networks should be expanded similar to 26% to 46% of their current area to complete targets, and that existing networks do not efficiently conserve the unseen biodiversity given their low specificity (as low as 8.8%) unseen biodiversity. We conclude that information on unseen biodiversity must be included in systematic conservation planning approaches to design more efficient and ecologically representative protected areas.

AB  - Aim
   The knowledge of both potential distribution and habitat suitability is fundamental for conservation planning and management of a variety of taxa world-wide. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied as predictive tools for these purposes. Such models are based on the concept of ecological niche and assume that species distribute themselves based on niche spaces defined by climate and habitat features. However, this assumption can be violated due to the existence of pure spatial range constraints, a factor rarely accounted for in SDMs, particularly for highly mobile species. We analyse whether pure distance effects, niche-based environmental responses or a combination of both factors can play an important role in limiting the large-scale distribution of highly mobile species.
   Location
   Spain, southern Europe.
   Methods
   We modelled the spatial distribution of an expanding raptor species, the marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus, in Spain. We implemented one conventional statistical method (generalized linear model) and one nonparametric technique (maximum entropy, Maxent) using a large dataset on marsh harrier occurrence (n=1586) in two different periods of the annual cycle, that is breeding and wintering seasons. We developed models that included environmental variables and that either ignored or incorporated spatial constraints using spatial eigenvector mapping (spatial filters).
   Results
   By comparing model accuracy, we found evidence that the distribution of marsh harriers in Spain was spatially constrained beyond environmental variables and that the effect of spatial constraints varies depending on the period of their annual cycle.
   Main conclusions
   Contrary to the equilibrium postulate, our results support the prediction that environmental specializations do not necessarily result in complete habitat matching due to dispersal limitations. Thus, ignoring spatial constraints in SDMs can lead to misunderstandings of the ecological mechanisms that explain species range limits.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning has a substantial theoretical underpinning that allows optimization of tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation and other socioeconomic goals. However, this theory assumes perfect spatial information about the locations of biodiversity features (e.g., species distributions). In practice, planners represent well-known taxa and other biodiversity "surrogates" in protected area systems, hoping that unmapped species will also be conserved. However, empirical research finds that surrogates predict species presence imperfectly, and sometimes rather poorly, at scales relevant to planning, and existing theory provides no further guidance. We developed new theory, explicitly incorporating aspects of spatial scale, for the representation problem when the locations of species distributions are unknown. Using probability theory and simulated and real species distributions, we found that the probability of adequately representing an unmapped species in a protected area system will be low unless the total fraction of the region being protected is larger than the species representation target. Furthermore, successful conservation depended critically on the relative sizes of the species distribution and of the individual protected areas; fewer, larger protected areas allowed the entire species distribution to fall into an unprotected gap. This scale-dependence varied with the configuration of the protected area system, with the conservation objective most likely to be attained if the individual protected areas were hyperdispersed (evenly spaced across the planning region). Using these results, we developed three design principles for representing unmapped species in protected areas: (1) The fraction of the region placed in protected areas should be substantially larger than the species-level representation target; (2) Individual protected areas must be at least one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the unmapped species' distribution; and (3) Protected areas should be evenly dispersed over geographic space. We also performed preliminary investigations of the effects of surrogates and socio-economic cost data on the probability of adequately representing unmapped species, finding that the primary effect of surrogates may simply be to promote hyperdispersion of protected areas across the planning region, and that seeking to minimize opportunity costs gives poorer conservation results than random protected area placement.

AB  - The main role of conservation planning is to design reserve networks to protect biodiversity in situ. Research within the field of conservation planning has focused on the development of theories and tools to design reserve networks that protect biodiversity in an efficient and representative manner. Whilst much progress has been made in this regard, there has been limited assessment of the sensitivity of conservation planning outcomes to uncertainty associated with the datasets used for conservation planning. Predicted species distribution data are commonly used for conservation planning because the alternatives (e.g. survey data) are incomplete or biased spatially. However, there may be considerable uncertainty associated with the use of predicted species distribution data, particularly given the variety of approaches available to generate a dataset from such predictions for use in conservation planning. These approaches range from using the probabilistic data directly to using a threshold identified a priori or a posteriori to convert the probabilistic data to presence/absence data. We assess the sensitivity of conservation planning outcomes to different uses of predicted species distribution data. The resulting reserve networks differed, and had different expected species representation. The choice of approach will depend on how much risk a conservation planner is willing to tolerate and how much efficiency can be sacrificed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Choice of variables, climate models and emissions scenarios all influence the results of species distribution models under future climatic conditions. However, an overview of applied studies suggests that the uncertainty associated with these factors is not always appropriately incorporated or even considered. We examine the effects of choice of variables, climate models and emissions scenarios can have on future species distribution models using two endangered species: one a short-lived invertebrate species (Ptunarra Brown Butterfly), and the other a long-lived paleo-endemic tree species (King Billy Pine). We show the range in projected distributions that result from different variable selection, climate models and emissions scenarios. The extent to which results are affected by these choices depends on the characteristics of the species modelled, but they all have the potential to substantially alter conclusions about the impacts of climate change. We discuss implications for conservation planning and management, and provide recommendations to conservation practitioners on variable selection and accommodating uncertainty when using future climate projections in species distribution models.

KW  - SCALE
AB  - Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are an iconic conservation species, but despite significant research effort, do we understand what they really need? Estimating and mapping suitable habitat play a critical role in conservation planning and policy. But if assumptions about ecological needs are wrong, maps with misidentified suitable habitat will misguide conservation action. Here, we use an information-theoretic approach to analyse the largest, landscape-level dataset on panda habitat use to date, and challenge the prevailing wisdom about panda habitat needs. We show that pandas are associated with old-growth forest more than with any ecological variable other than bamboo. Other factors traditionally used in panda habitat models, such as topographic slope, are less important. We suggest that our findings are disparate from previous research in part because our research was conducted over a larger ecological scale than previous research conducted over more circumscribed areas within individual reserves. Thus, extrapolating from habitat studies on small scales to conservation planning on large scales may entail some risk. As the Chinese government is considering the renewal of its logging ban, it should take heed of the panda's dependency on old growth.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has caused drastic changes in urban ecosystems, resulting in various urgent management needs from mitigating biodiversity loss to preventing human-wildlife conflicts. Using species distribution modeling to understand urban species??? distributional patterns and predict their future changes is thus important to support decision-making. Raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) that previously inhabited Shanghai had been extirpated from the metropolitan area but recently returned to and expanded in almost all districts, causing hundreds of human-raccoon dog conflicts. In this study, we initiated a citizen science project, identified factors associated with raccoon dog habitat selection, and predicted its current suitable habitat as well as potential future ranges under different city development scenarios. By constructing an ensemble modeling using data from camera trap surveys, interviews and rescuing records, we found that raccoon dog distribution was positively associated with several anthropogenic factors including nighttime light, human population, and percentage area of buildings. We predicted a 156,024 ha suitable habitat for raccoon dogs throughout Shanghai, among which only 5,811 ha (3.72 %) was currently occupied. Our results indicated considerable potential of raccoon dogs??? future expansion, which had been consistently ignored in previous management plans. To alleviate the increasing human-raccoon dog conflicts, we found strategies to slow down raccoon dog movement effective tools, and suggest adaptive management to provide fast response and flexible solutions. This is the first study to investigate human-wildlife conflict in China???s urban environment, and our approach has substantial implications for Shanghai as well as other regions where urban species are undergoing rapid expansion.

AB  - Maps of potential biodiversity are prominent tools for regional conservation planning because they allow to quantify the diversity of species that potentially inhabit different habitats. These maps are constructed from modeling species ecological niches based on the association between the geographical localities where species were detected and the environmental variables at those localities. Previous researches addressed the development of MPB for administrative regions using regional species distributions data to modeling ecological niches, which may lead to flawed predictions on potential biodiversity. Our aim is to assess the consequences of failing to include all available records on full species distribution to develop MPB. As a study case, we produced two MPBs for an administrative region of Argentina using RSD and FSD data sets of 14 species of insects and performed Environmental Niche Factor Analysis to model their ecological niches. Our results evidenced that both MPB were not spatially congruent in their predictions on potential biodiversity, because the ecological niches represented by RSD and FSD data were different in their position and volume. We found that the MPB based on RSD data may underpredict the potential biodiversity of distinct habitats at the landscape level, and that the use of this map may underestimate areas with different conservation potential within an administrative region. These results suggest that the choice of the extent of geographic records used to construct the MPB strongly conditions the quality and credibility of these maps.

AB  - P>1. Conservation of declining migratory species is a challenging task, as the factors that may have determined their past distribution may not determine their current and future distribution. Saiga antelope Saiga tatarica populations have massively declined due to poaching. The species is now beginning to recover in Kazakhstan and protected areas are being implemented. Using 25 years of aerial monitoring data, we identified changes in the spring distribution and predicted densities of saiga to prioritize areas for protection under scenarios of climate change together with changes in disturbance and population size. Conserving the spring distribution is critical as spring calving aggregations are of particular importance to population viability.
   2. The current distribution is strongly influenced by disturbance, whereas climate had a stronger influence in the past. The area of highly suitable habitat has halved and become fragmented in the last decade. The existing and proposed protected areas are relatively complementary and perform well under most scenarios of future change. However there is a need to widen the geographical scope of protected area planning if potential future high suitability areas are to be effectively protected.
   3. Climate change interacts with other factors to determine the distribution of suitable habitat within and outside protected areas. Scenarios in which conservation has increased saiga population size and density tend to show limited impacts of climate change, while scenarios in which the saiga population fails to recover and disturbance continues show, worsening patchiness and reduced suitable habitat.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We provide evidence for changing distribution and density of a migratory species over a large spatio-temporal scale, and suggest that future distribution may be more constrained and spatially heterogeneous. These results have important implications for designing future conservation measures for migratory species, such that areas that robustly show high suitability under a range of potential scenarios of change can be included in protected area expansion plans. Protected area placement based only on current, rather than projected distribution risks wasting opportunities for proactive conservation, particularly for a highly disturbed, recovering species likely to be affected by climate change.

AB  - Aim Terrestrial mammal distribution models typically do not differentiate between sexes when making spatial predictions, which could have important conservation implications. As male carnivores are usually more risk tolerant and travel longer distances, male potential range should be larger and include more human-modified areas than female range. To evaluate if differences between females and males could influence their conservation planning, we quantified sex-specific suitable range for a recolonizing population of American black bears (Ursus americanus). Location We applied this method in Missouri, USA. Methods We collected telemetry data from 57 females and 43 male bears from 2010 to 2018. We used three machine-learning methods (generalized boosted regression, random forest and maximum entropy) to develop sex-specific distribution models, which were combined into a weighted average ensemble model and converted into a binary (presence/absence) model using an optimized threshold. We used 80% of individuals for each sex as training data, and 20% as evaluation data. Results All models had high predictive performance; the greatest uncertainty in model predictions corresponded with the periphery of the distributions, whereas there was high agreement in the core distribution. Male suitable range was 66% larger than female range, and males were predicted to occur in more human-modified areas and more likely to be present in developed land and agriculture. Main conclusions Distribution models based on data from both sexes, or that is male-biased, could overestimate the female (i.e., reproductive) range and potentially misrepresent the biologically relevant species distribution. This bias can potentially lead to misguided decisions and suboptimal use of resources. By improving models when sex-specific data are available, we can better focus resources in areas where there is reproductive potential, leading to more accurate assessments of species' conservation status and better identifying areas vital for species persistence.

AB  - Little is known about the ecology of the rare marbled cat Pardofelis marmorata on Borneo. In addition, the little information that is available on the species often comes from incidental sightings. Here we use the MaxEnt algorithm to produce a habitat suitability map for this species based on a compilation of existing data. We collected 105 marbled cat occurrence records for Borneo, of which 27 (Balanced Model) or 69 (Spatial Filtering Model) were used to estimate potential habitat suitability. The resulting relative habitat suitability map showed key conservation areas in Borneo. According to these results it appears that the most suitable habitats for marbled cat are lowland forests, but these forests are most threatened by deforestation and other anthropogenic activities. It is imperative to develop appropriate conservation strategies for the marbled cat on Borneo, including long-term research and monitoring, reduction of human disturbances in lowland forests, increased data-sharing and research networking, and stakeholder involvement for conservation planning and activities.

AB  - Assumptions about factors such as climate in shaping species' realized and potential distributions underlie much of conservation planning and wildlife management. Climate and climatic change lead to shifts in species distributions through both direct and indirect ecological pressures. Distributional shifts may be particularly important if range overlap is altered between interacting species, or between species and protected areas. The cattle family (Bovidae) represents a culturally, economically, and ecologically important taxon that occupies many of the world's rangelands. In contemporary North America, five wild bovid species inhabit deserts, prairies, mountains, and tundra from Mexico to Greenland. Here, we aim to understand how future climate change will modify environmental characteristics associated with North American bovid species relative to the distribution of extant protected areas. We fit species distribution models for each species to climate, topography, and land cover data using observations from a citizen science dataset. We then projected modeled distributions to the end of the 21st century for each bovid species under two scenarios of anticipated climate change. Modeling results suggest that suitable habitat will shift inconsistently across species and that such shifts will lead to species-specific variation in overlap between potential habitat and existing protected areas. Furthermore, projected overlap with protected areas was sensitive to the warming scenario under consideration, with diminished realized protected area under greater warming. Conservation priorities and designation of new protected areas should account for ecological consequences of climate change.

AB  - The Amur tiger, a flagship species of the boreal forest ecosystem in Russian Far East and northeastern China, has declined dramatically in population and geographic distribution due to human caused habitat fragmentation and poaching over the past century. The fate of this largest feline species will also be influenced by the worsening impacts of climate change. In this paper we assess the possible effects of climate change (three scenarios from the 2007 IPCC Report) on the Amur tiger by integrating species distribution modeling (SDM) and population viability analysis (PVA). We projected the potential and realized suitable habitat distributions to examine the impacts from anthropogenic factors, and evaluated the changes of suitable habitat and extinction risk for 100 years under climate change. The realized suitable habitat was projected to be more severely fragmented than the potential suitable habitat because of human-related factors. The potential suitable habitat would expand northward under all climate change scenarios considered. However, the tiger population would suffer the largest decline and highest extinction risk in the next 100 years under the worst climate change scenario (A1B) even though the size of potential habitat would be greatest. Under climate change, the tiger population could persist for the next century only if the size and quality of current habitat patches would remain intact. In addition, our study demonstrated that using SDM alone could grossly overestimate the geographic distribution of the Amur tiger, and that coupling SDM and PVA could provide important insights into conservation planning to mitigate the effects of climate change.

AB  - This study proposes a two-stage conservation planning approach. Firstly, the Land-Use Pattern Optimization-library is used to maximize the suitability of habitats for target species by optimizing configuration based on the current landscape. Secondly, the systematic conservation planning tool, Marxan is used to identify protected areas based on the estimated species distributions from the optimal landscape configuration. We compared our conservation plan for three target bird species from a highland farm with the conservation plan produced using Marxan alone. Our comparison showed the effectiveness of our approach by selecting a reserve network with higher habitat suitability, better connection, and smaller size after relatively minor landscape modification. The proposed approach advances previous reserve site selection algorithms by considering optimal landscape configuration and potential species distributions for a reserve network design. Our approach yields priority maps to guide the design of a reserve network as well as identify landscape management for conservation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predicting climatic niche of species and projecting their potential range shifts in geographic distribution under future climate scenarios is essential for assessing impacts of climate change. Ecological niche based models are widely used to map habitat suitability of current and future potential distribution of species, using precise coordinates of species occurrences, along with climatic and various environmental variables. Despite the importance of high dependence on forest resources in the Himalayan region, the direct impacts of climate change on major forest tree species is not well-documented. In the present study, we used MaxEnt (or maximum entropy) modelling to predict current distribution and changes in the future distributions of four ecologically and economically dominant forest tree species (Quercus leucotrichophora, Q. semecarpifolia, Q. floribunda, and Pinus roxburghii) in the central Himalayan region. Future predictions were based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for two time periods (2050s and 2070s). We demonstrated the use of MaxEnt by combining different climatic, geomorphologic, and pedologic variables as predictor variables to model the potential climatic niches. We evaluated the model performance with an average AUC value varying as 0.809 (+/- 0.020), 0.982 (+/- 0.008), 0.966 (+/- 0.006), and 0.803 (+/- 0.025) for Q leucotrichophora, Q semecarpifolia, Q floribunda and P. roxburghii, respectively. Depending upon the RCPs, the results show both increase and decrease in suitable habitat range of these species across all future climate scenarios. The shifts in geographic distributions of climatic niches show unusual patterns, implying the need for urgent adaptive forest management strategies. Our approach can be used as a baseline database for broad-scale applicability in forest tree species restoration and conservation planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Testing the efficacy of downscaling in species distribution modelling: a comparison between MaxEnt and favourability function models.- Statistical downscaling is used to improve the knowledge of spatial distributions from broad-scale to fine-scale maps with higher potential for conservation planning. We assessed the effectiveness of downscaling in two commonly used species distribution models: Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and the favourability function (FF). We used atlas data (10 x 10 km) of the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, distribution in southern Spain to derive models at a 1 x 1 km resolution. Downscaled models were assessed using an independent dataset of the species' distribution at 1 x 1 km. The FF model showed better downscaling performance than MaxEnt, and the models that were based on linear combinations of environmental variables performed better than models allowing higher flexibility. The FF model minimized model overfitting compared to the MaxEnt.

AB  - Liziping National Nature Reserve in the Xiaoxiangling Mountain, Sichuan Province, is a core distribution area and critical habitat of the giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Determining a suitable habitat distribution pattern within the protected area is essential to formulate a scientific and reasonable giant pandas' conservation and management plan. Habitat suitability, influencing factors, and habitat selection of giant pandas were surveyed from May 2016 to July 2017 in Liziping National Nature Reserve. These data were assessed using the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and environmental factor evaluation analysis. Results show that the habitat suitable for the giant pandas is mainly concentrated in the east of the reserve, with a coverage of about 127.19 km(2) (26.58% of the total area). Meanwhile, the model results show that factors including road interference, average annual temperature, altitude, and slope gradient greatly influence giant pandas' distribution. In this region, habitat selection results show wild giant pandas prefer areas far from anthropogenic interference with an average annual temperature of 10-11 degrees C, gentle slope, and high altitude. The findings provide a reference for scientists to formulate practical habitat conservation and management measures for giant pandas in the reserve.

AB  - Multiple studies have used species distribution models to identify human-wildlife conflict drivers. An important application of these models is spatial conflict resolution by accounting for habitat suitability and corridors. We used distribution and connectivity models to identify habitats and corridors for brown bear Ursus arctos in southwestern Iran with high risk of bear damages, and evaluated the effects of landscape composition and configuration on the predicted conflict hotspots. We used 154 locations of bear damage incidents along with a suit of predictors to develop risk models. To prepare predictive variables, we used brown bear occurrence data and a number of covariates to develop a suitability model. We then converted the suitability map into a resistance surface and used a connectivity model to predict corridors. Finally, the bear damages risk map, habitats and corridors were overlaid to prioritize conflict hotspots, corridors and habitats, and conflict-prone corridors. Proportion of suitable habitats, distance to village, density of forest patches, conservation areas and corridor bottlenecks were the main predictors contributing to bear damages risk. A total of 38.73% of habitats, and 6.24% of corridors across the 124 000-km(2) study area were identified as areas with high risk of bear damages. The risk of bear damage was also spatially associated with forests fragmentation and patchiness of habitat. Our results highlight the importance of landscape configuration and corridors when investigating the spatial patterns of bear damages. Our findings showed how the combination of distribution models and connectivity analysis can guide carnivore conservation planning aiming at reducing the risk of carnivore-inflicted damages.

AB  - The genus Anthrax Scopoli is a well-known genus of bee flies, with 16 species recorded from Egypt, out of about 250 species known worldwide. Six of these species seem to be endangered or threatened (at least in a part of their distribution range) as they disappeared from most of their Egyptian localities which faced severe changes in the floral and faunal composition during the last 50 years. These changes may be attributed to urbanization or modern agricultural activities that caused severe degradation of natural habitats of these species. Maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling was used to predict the potential climatic niches of these six Anthrax species, namely: Anthrax aethiops, Anthrax chionanthrax, Anthrax dentate, Anthrax melanista, Anthrax lucidus, and Anthrax trifasciatus. The Maxent model performed better than random for the six species, with an average test AUC value of 0.95 for A. aethiops bezzii, 0.83 for A. chionanthrax, and 0.98 for A. dentate, 0.86 for A. melanista, 0.96 for A. lucidus and 0.99 for A. trifasciatus. A set of four variables were selected for each species from 19 bioclimatic and 3 topographic variables, based on correlation analyses. The study showed that the current distributions of A. dentata, A. lucidus and A. trifasciatus were largely explained by the altitude, but A. chionanthrax and A. melanista were so far dominated by temperature, whereas on A. aethiops bezzii was strongly related to precipitation variables. St. Catherine protected area showed high habitat suitability for all species except A. lucidus. The suitable habitat for A. trifasciatus was restricted to this protected area, however, future scenarios of climatic changes through the area predict a great degradation in habitat suitability for this species. These results can be used for making powerful conservation management decisions in St. Catherine Protectorate to incorporate these Anthrax spp. in any present or future conservation programs.

AB  - The basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) is an endangered species in the north-east Atlantic, having been historically over exploited. Whilst near-shore aggregation hotspots in the UK have been identified, robust knowledge on species distribution and abundance outside these areas remains limited. Research techniques, such as habitat modelling, could however be used to gain a greater knowledge of the species distribution to inform management plans to aid population recovery. For large mobile species gathering wide-scale distribution data can be financially and logistically challenging. In lieu of conducting an expensive UK-wide strategic survey for basking sharks, we use data from two regional-scale surveys, which were conducted in southwest England and western Scotland, in an Ensemble Ecological Niche Model (EENM) to produce a spatially-explicit map of habitat suitability. When compared against a similar to 20-year database of public sightings of basking sharks across UK coastal seas (to 6 nautical miles offshore), patterns of habitat suitability yielded a statistically significant agreement with areas known to support basking shark sightings. EENMs could be used to advise Marine Protected Area (MPA) selection, as well as to inform environmental impact assessments for offshore developments. The application of EENM outputs could be wide-reaching and benefit not only basking sharks but other large mobile marine species in the north-east Atlantic.

AB  - Determining the spatial scale at which landscape features influence population persistence is an important task for conservation planning. One challenge is that sampling biases confound factors that influence species occurrence and survey effort. Recent developments in Point Process Models (PPMs) enable researchers to disentangle the sampling process from ecological drivers of species' distributions. Land-cover change is a driver of decline for the western spadefoot (Spea hammondii), which has been extirpated from much of its range in California. Assessing this species' status requires information on the current distribution of suitable habitat within its historical range, but little is known about the effect of the landscape surrounding breeding ponds on spadefoot occurrence. Critically, surveys for western spadefoots often occur along roads, potentially biasing data used to fit species distribution models. We created PPMs integrating historical presence/non-detection and presence-only data for western spadefoots and land-cover data at multiple spatial scales to model the distribution of this species while removing the influence of sampling bias. There was spatial sampling bias in presence-only data; records were more likely to be reported near roads and urban centers and PPMs that removed sampling bias outperformed models that ignored sampling bias. The occurrence of western spadefoots was positively related to the proportion of grassland within a 2000 m buffer. The remaining habitat for western spadefoots is largely found in the foothills surrounding California's Central Valley. Our study illustrates how PPMs can improve projections of habitat suitability and our understanding of the drivers of species' distributions.

AB  - In response to the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, habitat network conservation and restoration has become a central objective in conservation planning. Evaluating landscape functional connectivity and mapping habitat networks are key steps for implementing effective actions, but both remain challenging. Habitat suitability models (HSM) and spatial graphs provide conservation managers with useful information for landscape planning. To tackle their respective drawbacks, we proposed to combine HSM and spatial graphs in a four-step methodological framework: (i) collect and prepare input data; (ii) model habitat suitability using MaxEnt to map the species' habitat suitability index (HSI); (iii) transform the HSI map into spatial graph inputs using GIS; and, (iv) perform spatial graph connectivity analysis using Graphab. The outputs of this species-specific and quantitative approach were maps of the species' habitat network. Habitat patches and dispersal linkages were ranked according to their importance for overall habitat availability and landscape connectivity. This prioritization identified locations where conservation biologists and landscape planners should focus conservation and restoration efforts. This framework is illustrated here with a case study on the woodlark (Lullula arborea) - a bird species - in a French Mediterranean area, and the method's limitations and alternatives are discussed. The quantitative-based graphical outputs of the framework can valuably support decision-making for landscape planning, complement local expert opinion, and encourage appropriate stake-holders to cooperate at regional scale.

AB  - It is difficult to map and quantify biodiversity at landscape level in areas with low data availability, despite demand from decision-makers. We propose a methodology to determine potential biodiversity pattern using habitat suitability maps of the understory plant species with highest cover and occurrence frequency in the three different forests types of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina). We used a database of vascular plants from 535 surveys from which we identified 35 indicative species. We explored more than 50 potential explanatory variables to develop habitat suitability maps of the indicative species, which were combined to develop a map of the potential biodiversity. Correlation among environmental, topographic and forest landscape variables were discussed, as well as the marginality and the specialization of the indicative species. We detected differences in the niches of the species prevailing in the three forest types. The developed map of potential biodiversity uncovered hotspots of biodiversity in the ecotone of Nothofagus pumilio and N. antarctica as well as in the wettest part of the mixed N. pumilio-N. betuloides forests. It allowed thus to identify forest areas with different conservation potential and can be readily used as a decision support system for conservation and management strategies at different scales including the identification of land-use conflicts (e.g. of biodiversity with timber production and livestock) and the development of a network of protected areas, which currently does not cover the forests of highest conservation value.

AB  - Spatial prioritization in systematic conservation planning has traditionally been developed for several to many species and/or habitats, and single-species applications are rare. We developed a novel spatial prioritization model based on accurate estimates of remotely-sensed data and maps of threats potentially affecting long-term species persistence. We used this approach to identify priority areas for the conservation of the Endangered Greek meadow viper Vipera graeca, a cold-adapted species inhabiting mountaintops in the Pindos Mountains of Greece and Albania. We transformed the mapped threats into nine variables to estimate conservation value: habitat suitability (climate suitability, habitat size, occupancy, vegetation suitability), climate change (future persistence, potential for altitudinal range shift) and land-use impact (habitat alteration, degradation, disturbance). We applied the Zonation systematic conservation planning tool with these conservation value variables as biodiversity features to rank the areas currently occupied by the species and to identify priority areas where the chances for population persistence are highest. We found that 90% of current habitats will become unsuitable by the 2080s and that conservation actions need to be implemented to avoid extinction as this is already a threatened species with a narrow ecological niche. If threats are appropriately quantified and translated into variables of conservation value, spatial conservation planning tools can successfully identify priority areas for the conservation of single species. Our study demonstrates that spatial prioritization for single umbrella, flagship or keystone species is a promising approach for the conservation of species for which few data are available.

AB  - Threatened species are inadequately represented within protected areas (PAs) across the globe. Species conservation planning may be improved by using public species-occurrence databases, but empirical evidence is limited of how that may be accomplished at local scales. We used the Three Parallel Rivers Region of China as a case to investigate the utility of public species data in improvement in conservation planning. We mapped the distribution of each species as suitable habitat ranges using species distribution models (for 261 plants and 29 animals with >= 5 occurrences) or as point locations (for 591 plants and 328 animals with <5 occurrences). Systematic conservation planning was then applied to identify three optimized portfolios of priority conservation areas (PCAs) for achieving increasing targets of 17, 31, and 50% of the total study area. We then compared the distributions of PCAs in this study with those in two existing PCA datasets. PCAs in this study covered greater areas in the southeastern highly-disturbed regions and along valleys of great rivers than two existing datasets that had a focus on intact ecosystems in remote mountain areas. The three portfolios of PCAs had some overlap with two existing PCA datasets, with the overlapping area accounting for 26.4-39.0% of the total areas of our PCAs. Our PCAs could complement existing PCAs by identifying more priority areas in developed landscapes; this is critical for protecting biodiversity in such areas as they face greater pressures. PCAs in this study received a much lower PA coverage (32.9-43.1%) than existing PCAs (60.2-60.8%) because of biased PA distribution toward mountain areas. Our results suggest that conservation planning based on limited public species data could improve local-scale priority-setting practices. The analysis supports effective integration of species targets in China's new national park system by identifying optimized networks of PCAs.

AB  - Identification of species' Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) is fundamental to conservation planning and species distribution models (SDMs) are a powerful tool commonly used to do this. Presence-only data are increasingly being used to develop SDMs to aid the conservation decision-making process. The application of presence-only SDMs for marine species' is particularly attractive due to often logistical and economic costs of obtaining systematic species' distribution data. However, robust model validation is important for conservation management applications that require accurate and reliable species' occurrence data (e.g., spatially explicit risk assessments). This is commonly done using a random subset of the data and less commonly with fully independent test data. Here, we apply a spatial block cross-validation (CV) approach to validate a MaxEnt presence-only model using independent presence/absence survey data for a highly mobile, marine species (humpback whale,Megaptera novaengliae) in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). A MaxEnt model was developed using opportunistic whale sightings (2003-2007) and then used to identify areas differing in habitat suitability (low, medium, high) to conduct a systematic, line-transect, aerial survey (2012) and derive a density surface model. A spatial block CV buffering strategy was used to validate the MaxEnt model, using the opportunistic sightings as training data and independent aerial survey sightings data as test data. Moderate performance measures indicate MaxEnt was reliable in identifying the distribution patterns of a mobile whale species on their breeding ground, indicated by areas of high density aligned to areas of high habitat suitability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MaxEnt models can be useful and cost-effective for designing a sampling scheme to undertake systematic surveys that significantly reduces sampling effort. In this study, higher quality information on whale reproductive class (calf vs. non-calf groups) was obtained that the presence-only data lacked, while sampling only 18% of the GBR World Heritage Area. The validation approach using fully independent data provides greater confidence in the MaxEnt model, which indicates significant overlap with the main breeding ground of humpback whales and the inner shipping route. This is important when evaluating presence-only models within certain conservation management applications, such as spatial risk assessments.

AB  - Knowledge about spatial biodiversity patterns is a basic criterion for reserve network design. Although herbarium collections hold large quantities of information, the data are often scattered and cannot supply complete spatial coverage. Alternatively, herbarium data can be used to fit species distribution models and their predictions can be used to provide complete spatial coverage and derive species richness maps. Here, we build on previous effort to propose an improved compositionalist framework for using species distribution models to better inform conservation management. We illustrate the approach with models fitted with six different methods and combined using an ensemble approach for 408 plant species in a tropical and megadiverse country (Ecuador). As a complementary view to the traditional richness hotspots methodology, consisting of a simple stacking of species distribution maps, the compositionalist modelling approach used here combines separate predictions for different pools of species to identify areas of alternative suitability for conservation. Our results show that the compositionalist approach better captures the established protected areas than the traditional richness hotspots strategies and allows the identification of areas in Ecuador that would optimally complement the current protection network. Further studies should aim at refining the approach with more groups and additional species information. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental regulations often require wildlife surveys prior to habitat disturbance to avoid impacts or as the basis for planning mitigation, yet project-level surveys may not provide the insights needed to guide long-term management. Management of the red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) has largely been based on such surveys. As an alternative approach, we evaluated distribution patterns using frequency of red tree vole occurrence and habitat suitability models to guide conservation planning. We developed a suite of models based on subsets of covariates from two previously developed models and evaluated the extent to which spatial covariates improved the models. We used presence-absence data that were collected from 364 randomly selected 1-ha Current Vegetation Survey and Forest Inventory and Analysis plots to develop models and describe occurrence patterns. The best models included a spatial covariate, maximum tree diameter, distance from suitable habitat, forest age class, and the interaction between maximum tree diameter and forest age class. We compared performance of the previously published models, our best model, and an ensemble model that used predictions from all three models. Under the ensemble model, correct classification rates were relatively high and considerably improved, suggesting that the application of all three models provided greater accuracy than any individual model. We argue that habitat models, coupled with spatial patterns of the frequency of occurrence, can provide useful tools for addressing species management and may provide more insight than project-level surveys. The use of habitat suitability models can therefore be closely tied to red tree vole management decisions and conservation strategies, as well as reducing survey costs that otherwise often make projects infeasible.

AB  - At the European level, the Natura 2000 habitat network is the main instrument for preserving and protecting species and habitats. However, protected areas are fixed in location, and environmental conditions continually subject to change. Changing conditions force species to shift their geographic distribution or to adapt to new conditions, ultimately causing a change in the composition of the habitats' species. We modelled the response of two important alpine EU habitat types (6150, 6170) in the Styrian Eastern Alps to increasing temperatures using two representative concentration pathways (rcp 4.5 and rcp 8.5) of the regional climate model CCLM4-8-17 CLMcom. Our results confirmed that climate change within the next several decades will have an immediate and profound impact on the Alpine flora and their habitats. The niche models indicate a dramatic reduction in the habitat suitability of 15 habitat diagnostic species before the end of the twenty-first century. Habitat change was found to be slower inside protected areas in the first half of the twenty-first century, while in the second half of the twenty-first century, suitable habitat conditions either remained constant for the lower temperature scenario (rcp 4.5) or shifted to "outside" current protected areas in the severe scenario (rcp 8.5). Regions of rapidly changing habitat suitability and subsequently shifting species composition can be found both inside and outside of the protected area network. These developments may lead to the deterioration of the conservation status of habitat types and challenge the aims of the EU habitat directive.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most difficult of challenges to conserving biodiversity, especially for countries with few data on the distributions of their taxa. Species distribution modelling is a modern approach to the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on biodiversity, with the great advantage of being robust to small amounts of data. Taking advantage of a recently validated dataset, we use the medicinal plants of Egypt to identify hotspots of diversity now and in the future by predicting the effect of climate change on the pattern of species richness using species distribution modelling. Then we assess how Egypt's current Protected Area network is likely to perform in protecting plants under climate change. The patterns of species richness show that in most cases the A2a 'business as usual' scenario was more harmful than the B2a 'moderate mitigation' scenario. Predicted species richness inside Protected Areas was higher than outside under all scenarios, indicating that Egypt's PAs are well placed to help conserve medicinal plants.

AB  - One of the primary reason of species extinction especially rare species with very specific requirements, is habitat destruction. To protect these species, habitat suitability evaluation plays a central role. Hence, an attempt is made in this study to evaluate the suitability of sand cat's habitat in a sand dune-dominated landscape in Iran. Four Landsat-derived indices including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Weighted Difference Vegetation Index, Brightness Index (BI) and Salinity Index were combined to characterize sand cat's habitat requirements through a land use land cover (LULC) map. Furthermore, a set of landscape metrics were employed to explore the spatial pattern LULC classes. Sand cat's habitat suitability map was generated by linear combination of the standardized and relatively weighted NDVI and BI indices and then categorized into five classes of most suitable, highly suitable, moderately suitable, least suitable and not suitable. The results showed that about 75% of the total area is suitable for sand cat. Although this region is rich in biodiversity, it has not yet been subject to any conservation planning and should be granted more conservation attentions.

AB  - The use of statistical models to predict species distributions and suitable habitat has become an essential tool for wildlife management and conservation planning. Models have been especially useful with rare and endangered wildlife species. One such species is the mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni), a spiral-horned antelope endemic to the Ethiopian highlands. The full range of the species has never been adequately defined and recent discoveries of new populations suggest that others may exist undetected. To identify potential mountain nyala occurrences, we used classification tree analysis to predict suitable habitat using 76 climatic, topographical and vegetative variables. Three model evaluation methods showed a strong performance of the final model with an overall accuracy of 90%, Cohen's maximised kappa of 0.80 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.89. Minimum temperature and maximum precipitation generally had the greatest predictive contributions to suitable mountain nyala habitat. The predicted habitat covered an area of 39378 km(2), with the majority occurring in remote forests on the southern escarpment of the Bale Mountains. Other areas within the predicted range may be too impacted by human and livestock populations to support mountain nyala; however, the model will be useful in directing future surveys for new populations while offering clues to the species historical range.

AB  - Primula boveana Decne ex Duby is a threatened paleo-endemic plant in St. Catherine Protected Area (SCPA), south Sinai, Egypt which represents the remaining evidence from the Tertiary relict floras. Listed by IUCN Red List in 2014 as Critically Endangered, and there are urgent needs to carry out on-ground conservation actions. In this research we present steps to conserve Primula boveana through in-situ practices from planning to implementation, respectively through: a) evaluating the current conservation status through IUCN Red List and determining the environmental factors controlling the distribution of the species that are necessary for establishing the recovery program, b) determine the potential species habitat suitability under the current climate conditions using Maxent software, and c) based on the previous two steps, and in an experiment that is the first in this area, an attempt was done to cultivate dormant treated seeds directly in the suitable habitat for recovery. All of these steps aim to increase population size, Extent of Occurrence (EOO), and Area of Occupancy (AOO), which will contribute to minimize the impact of threats on the target species and reducing the risk of extinction. Environmental factors controlling the distribution of the P. boveana and habitat suitability range were extracted in detail using IUCN Red List Assessment and Species Distribution Model (SDM). Despite the low survival rates of seedlings, which reached 1% of the germinated seeds after 8 months from germination, about 140 new individuals were obtained to be added to the current population as a result of this step with an increase of more than 25 %. Also, the geographical range (EOO) after adding the recovery sites has increased by 230 %, which, if continued, could help reduce pressures on the species as well as the risk of extinction. During this study, we emphasized that the target species is marching toward extinction very quickly and needs rapid intervention to try to save it from the imminent extinction risk due to drought and climate change. Carrying out ex-situ conservation practices has become urgent due to the difficulty in ensuring the success of the in-situ conservation process in the future. Collecting and storing seeds, along with cultivation in greenhouses and botanical gardens, will aid in the conservation of the plant if it is extinct in the wild.

AB  - The identification of breeding habitat is essential for the implementation of conservation efforts for threatened species. Using seven natural and anthropogenic variables, and based on 27 nesting attempts over 17 yr, we created a species distribution model for Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja) breeding habitat across 5636 km(2) in the Pacific Region of Darien Province, Panama. Highly suitable habitat had high forest cover, low elevation, and a relatively low distance to rivers. We identified specific breeding habitat associations for Harpy Eagles and found that 34% of the area analyzed contained highly suitable breeding habitat. At the regional level, highly suitable habitat was found predominantly in the northern portion of the study area in the four watersheds occurring there, and along the Pacific Coast. The Jurado watershed in the south contained relatively little habitat, owing to a high amount of mountainous terrain. Among three protected areas in the region, Darien National Park contained an equal amount of habitat as the relatively smaller and neighboring Chepigana Forest Reserve and Serrania de Bagre Biological Corridor, a fact that highlights the importance of northern forests for the conservation of Harpy Eagles in Darien. Generally speaking, areas with the greatest amount of human influence were associated with greater forest loss and less suitable habitat. We therefore propose that community-based strategies for sustainable resource management are needed to mitigate forest disturbance levels in areas where the Harpy Eagle coexists with humans. Considering the high importance of the breeding habitat for the Harpy Eagle in the Serrania de Bagre Biological Corridor and Chepigana Forest Reserve, we recommend a revision of the legislation that governs the extractive use of the natural resources in these two protected areas.

AB  - Most countries have committed to protect 17% of their terrestrial area by 2020 through Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, with a focus on protecting areas of particular importance for biodiversity. This means national-scale spatial conservation prioritisations are needed to help meet this target and guide broader conservation and land-use policy development. However, to ensure these assessments are adopted by policy makers, they mist also consider national priorities. This situation is exemplified by Guyana, a corner of Amazonia that couples high biodiversity with low economic development. In recent years activities that threaten biodiversity conservation have increased, and consequently, protected areas are evermore critical to achieving the Aichi targets. Here we undertake a cost-effective approach to protected area planning in Guyana that accounts for in-country conditions. To do this we conducted a stakeholder-led spatial conservation prioritisation based on meeting targets for 17 vegetation types and 329 vertebrate species, while minimising opportunity costs for forestry, mining, agriculture and urbanisation. Our analysis identifies 3 million ha of priority areas for conservation, helping inform government plans to double the current protected area network from 8.5 to 17%. As part of this, we also develop a new technique to prioritise engagement with local communities whose lands are identified as important to conservation. Our study both provides a scientifically robust, politically acceptable protected area expansion strategy for Guyana, and illustrates the importance of conservation planning at the country-scale to translate international commitments into national action.

AB  - Deep-sea fisheries provide an important source of protein to Pacific Island countries and territories that are highly dependent on fish for food security. However, spatial management of these deep-sea habitats is hindered by insufficient data. We developed species distribution models using spatially limited presence data for the main harvested species in the Western Central Pacific Ocean. We used bathymetric and water temperature data to develop presence-only species distribution models for the commercially exploited deep-sea snappers Etelis Cuvier 1828, Pristipomoides Valenciennes 1830, and Aphareus Cuvier 1830. We evaluated the performance of four different algorithms (CTA, GLM, MARS, and MAXENT) within the BIOMOD framework to obtain an ensemble of predicted distributions. We projected these predictions across the Western Central Pacific Ocean to produce maps of potential deep-sea snapper distributions in 32 countries and territories. Depth was consistently the best predictor of presence for all species groups across all models. Bathymetric slope was consistently the poorest predictor. Temperature at depth was a good predictor of presence for GLM only. Model precision was highest for MAXENT and CTA. There were strong regional patterns in predicted distribution of suitable habitat, with the largest areas of suitable habitat (> 35% of the Exclusive Economic Zone) predicted in seven South Pacific countries and territories (Fiji, Matthew & Hunter, Nauru, New Caledonia, Tonga, Vanuatu and Wallis & Futuna). Predicted habitat also varied among species, with the proportion of predicted habitat highest for Aphareus and lowest for Etelis. Despite data paucity, the relationship between deep-sea snapper presence and their environments was sufficiently strong to predict their distribution across a large area of the Pacific Ocean. Our results therefore provide a strong baseline for designing monitoring programs that balance resource exploitation and conservation planning, and for predicting future distributions of deep-sea snappers.

AB  - Iran has a diverse range of mammals. Climate change can alter the species' range, leading to expansion or contraction and affect the IUCN threatened species' distribution. We assessed the effects of climate change on the climatic niche and coverage of the protected areas for 16 threatened mammal species in Iran. The species' presence-only occurrence records, four predictor variables, two future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and 8.5) and two time steps (current and 2070) were used to build species distribution models by applying the ensemble approach in BIOMOD2. Species' responses to climate change under current condition showed different results: 8 of the 16 species are likely to gain climatically suitable space, but six species will probably lose climate range by 2070. Persian fallow deer and marbled polecat respond positively to the RCP 2.6 but will experience a range reduction in the RCP 8.5. Coverage of the protected area network will increase in both scenarios for six mammals. The coverage will maximize in RCP 2.6 for four species and decrease RCP 8.5 for another four species and vice versa. According to our model, the coverage will decrease for two species in both future scenarios. The overlap of the protected areas with the distribution pattern showed that in the next 50 years, climate change will negatively affect 60% of Iranian threatened mammals. The species' current and future distribution range and the designated refugia for climate change can be considered protected areas for conservation plans.

AB  - Aim A number of assumptions underpinning the use of species distribution models to predict biological responses to climate change are violated for temperate and boreal tree species that are widespread, long-lived and genetically adapted to local climate conditions. To address this situation, we propose a methodology to account for the potential effects of genetic structure, adaptive potential and limited migration capacity. Location British Columbia, Canada. Methods Similar to the widely used no migration' and unlimited migration' scenarios, we employ more refined biological response scenarios to evaluate the potential effects of genetic adaptation to local environments and the capacity of species to adapt and migrate. These scenarios are realized by two sets of geographic delineations that partition the species range into multiple populations and that subdivide the study area into smaller landscape units. Results In a case study for British Columbia, we demonstrate how the approach can be used to evaluate the adequacy of a reserve system of 906 protected areas to ensure long-term maintenance of forest genetic resources for 48 tree species. We find that between 35% and 85% of locally adapted populations in protected areas are maintained under a median climate change scenario until the end of the century. A sensitivity analysis shows that assumptions about migration and adaptation capacity of species have a major effect on the projected conservation status. Main conclusions We propose that the results of species distribution models have practical value for conservation planning if the focus is on maintenance rather than loss of suitable habitat. Accounting for genetic structure, adaptive potential and migration capacity through best-case and worst-case scenarios provide important information to effectively allocate limited resources available for conservation action.

AB  - Monitoring for species occupancy is often carried out at local scales, reflecting specific targets, available logistics, and funding. Problematically, conservation planning and management operate at broader scales and use information inventories with good scale coverage. Translating information between local and landscape scales is commonly treated in an ad hoc manner, but conservation decision-making can benefit from quantifying spatial-knowledge relationships. Fauna occupancy monitoring, in particular, suffers from this issue of scale, as there are many different survey methods employed for different purposes. Rather than ignoring how informative these methods are when predicting regional distributions, we describe a statistical approach that identifies survey combinations that provide the greatest additive value in mammal detection across different scales. We identified minimal sets of survey methods for 53 terrestrial mammal species across a large area in Australia (New South Wales (NSW), 800,000km(2)) and for each of the 18 bioregions it encompasses. Utility of survey methods varied considerably at a landscape scale. Unplanned opportunistic sightings were the single largest source of species information (35%). The utility of other survey methods varied spatially; some were retained in minimal sets for many bioregions, while others were spatially restricted or unimportant. Predator scats, Elliot and pitfall trapping, spotlighting, and diurnal herpetofauna surveys were the most frequently included survey methods at a landscape scale. Use of our approach can guide identification of efficient combinations of survey methods, maximising detection and returns for monitoring. Findings and methodologies are easily transferable and are globally applicable across any taxa. They provide guidelines for managing scarce resources for regional monitoring programs, and improving regional strategic conservation planning.

AB  - Organisms adapted to life at high elevations are particularly threatened by climate change, which can cause them to become isolated on mountain tops, yet their responses may vary according to their position in the food chain and their ecological flexibility. Predicting the future distributions of such organisms requires fine-tuned species-specific models. Building on a previous ecological niche model, we explored shifts in the suitability of habitats for the Endangered Andean cat Leopardus jacobita, and assessed how these will be represented within existing protected areas in the future. Using a robust set of presence records and corrected climate surfaces, we applied the Maxent algorithm to model habitat suitability for this carnivore and for its preferred prey, the mountain viscacha Lagidium viscacia. Our predictions indicate that the areas climatically suitable for Andean cats could contract by up to 30% by 2080 under the most pessimistic scenario, with an overall upwards shift of 225 m and a polewards displacement of 98-180 km. The predicted range contraction was more pronounced in the species' core range, in the Bolivian and Peruvian Andes, whereas suitable conditions may increase in the southern range in Patagonia. Bolivia and Peru are predicted to suffer the most marked decline in habitat representativeness within protected areas. The southern range appears to be less vulnerable to climate change, offering opportunities for the conservation of this genetically distinct population. We discuss the value and limitations of using species distribution modelling to assess changes in the potential distribution and conservation status of this and other Andean species.

AB  - Giant pandas (Ailltropoda melanoleuca) are now confined to fragmented habitats in western China, with more than 60 % of individuals inhabiting 63 protected areas. Knowledge of the environmental features required by giant pandas is critically important for protected area spatial arrangement and subsequent assessments. Here we developed a distribution model for giant pandas in the Tangjiahe Nature Reserve using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) model. We found that less than 40 % of this key reserve is of high suitability for giant pandas, highly suitable habitat being primarily characterized as coniferous forests away from roads within the reserve. Although there was a clear core zone occupied by giant pandas, which included the vast majority of known giant panda locations, only about 45 % of this zone was classified as highly suitable habitat (suitable and optimal). Therefore, the spatial arrangement within the reserve may need to be modified to effectively manage the remaining population of giant pandas. Of particular concern are several tourism proposals being considered by local government, which, if implemented, will increase the isolation of the local population from those in the surrounding area. Our analysis identifies Caijiaba and Baixiongping as areas that should become conservation priorities. Our approach provides valuable data to advise conservation policy and could be easily replicated across other protected areas.

AB  - Knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of cetaceans is particularly important for conservation and management, but is still limited within Namibian waters. We collated 3211 cetacean records from the Namibian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for the period 2008 to 2016 and applied the principle of minimum cross entropy (MinxEnt) to predict habitat suitability. MinxEnt is a generalised form of maximum entropy modelling that allows incorporation of additional information such as sampling bias. The habitat suitability of 9 cetacean species or species groups (5 odontocete species, 2 mysticete species and 2 taxonomic groups: pilot whales Globicephalus spp. and balaenopterids Balaenopteridae spp.) were predicted per season, in relation to environmental variables likely to drive cetacean presence: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, water depth or distance to shore, seabed slope and habitat complexity. The environmental variable which most frequently influenced habitat suitability was depth, which was the main environmental driver for bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and southern right whales Eubalaena australis. Further, Heaviside's dolphin Cephalorhynchus heavisidii habitat was best predicted by distance to shore in all seasons, while common dolphin Delphinus delphis and the balaenopterid group habitats were best predicted by habitat complexity, and sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus habitats by chlorophyll a concentration. We identify distinct spatial patterns in habitat suitability for different species and provide baseline maps which can be used by managers of wildlife resources.

AB  - Background: The environment and habitat are the important aspects of the forest ecosystem. The continuous changes in the environment due to natural phenomenon or human actions have degraded the forest and wildlife habitat thus causing a decline in their population. Therefore it is important to study wildlife habitat in order to ensure their survival. In this regard, application of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System has been widely accepted as a tool which has immense significance in wildlife habitat suitability modeling and mapping. Maps derived from analysis of remote sensing data and modeling in GIS are highly useful in making the strategies in wildlife management and conservation planning. Objectives: The objectives of the study are to identify the suitable habitat for wild life and conservation hotspot grids were delineated which require immediate attention. Methods/Statistical analysis: The wildlife habitat suitability parameter based on forest cover, agriculture with settlement, forest fires, roads, streams and mines were analyzed. The statistical method such as pairwise comparison was used to evaluate the weightage of each parameter which helped to determine the wildlife habitat suitability modeling and mapping. Findings: The study of wildlife habitat suitability mapping in Saranda forest division reveals 42% of the grid equal to 1898 has very high suitability for wild life. The conservation hotspot reserve grid based on contiguous patch was identified within the very high wildlife suitability habitat was found to be 925 (49%). Application/Improvements: Conservation effort can be focused based on the above study and will assist in policy related decision making.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation threatens biodiversity, causes population isolation and reduces the availability of resources. When species ranges span geopolitical borders, management of transboundary populations and securing their connectivity can be compromised by different conservation priorities and juridical efforts. Using a combination of species distribution modelling and circuit theory, we modelled suitable habitats for four conservation-dependent mammalian megafauna in northeastern Iran, bordering Turkmenistan and Afghanistan which is part of the larger Kopet Dag Ecoregion in central Asia. Our multispecies approach aimed to identify key habitats and potential national and international corridors for Persian leopard (Panthera pardus), bezoar goat (Capra aegagrus), urial (Ovis orientalis) and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) based on environmental variables. Between 18 to 34% of the study area was identified as suitable habitat for each species with a moderate variability in coverage by conservation network, ranging between 14 to 43%). Importantly, we identified three key landscapes which can enhance the connectivity between main populations of the species in northeastern Iran as well as neighboring countries. Most of the suitable landscapes along the Iran-Turkmenistan borderlands are protected on the Iranian side, providing a source for landscape connectivity across the border. In contrast, the main suitable landscapes for megafauna in northeastern Iran are located far from the Afghan border. Our multispecies approach provided an empirical framework for spatial conservation planning for the mammalian megafauna across the Kopet Dag Ecoregion and can direct future survey efforts to identify critical wildlife areas in Turkmenistan and Afghanistan, two countries with scarce data on biodiversity.

AB  - All four chimpanzee sub-species populations are declining due to multiple factors including human-caused habitat loss. Effective conservation efforts are therefore needed to ensure their long-term survival. Habitat suitability models serve as useful tools for conservation planning by depicting relative environmental suitability in geographic space over time. Previous studies mapping chimpanzee habitat suitability have been limited to small regions or coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we used Random Forests regression to downscale a coarse resolution habitat suitability calibration dataset to estimate habitat suitability over the entire chimpanzee range at 30-m resolution. Our model predicted habitat suitability well with an r(2) of 0.82 (+/-0.002) based on 50-fold cross validation where 75% of the data was used for model calibration and 25% for model testing; however, there was considerable variation in the predictive capability among the four sub-species modeled individually. We tested the influence of several variables derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) that included metrics of forest canopy and structure for four three-year time periods between 2000 and 2012. Elevation, Landsat ETM+ band 5 and Landsat derived canopy cover were the strongest predictors; highly suitable areas were associated with dense tree canopy cover for all but the Nigeria-Cameroon and Central Chimpanzee sub-species. Because the models were sensitive to such temporally based predictors, our results are the first to highlight the value of integrating continuously updated variables derived from satellite remote sensing into temporally dynamic habitat suitability models to support near real-time monitoring of habitat status and decision support systems.

AB  - The management of protected areas (PAs) is widely used in the conservation of endangered plant species under climate change. However, studies that have identified appropriate PAs for endangered fern species are rare. To address this gap, we must develop a work flow to plan appropriate PAs for endangered fern species that will be further impacted by climate change. Here, we used endangered fern species in China as a case study, and we applied conservation planning software coupled with endangered fern species distribution data and distribution modeling to plan conservation areas with high priority protection needs under climate change. We identified appropriate PAs for endangered fern species under climate change based on the IUCN protected area categories (from la to VI) and planned additional PAs for endangered fern species. The high priority regions for protecting the endangered fern species were distributed throughout southern China. With decreasing temperature seasonality, the priority ranking of all endangered fern species is projected to increase in existing PAs. Accordingly, we need to establish conservation areas with low climate vulnerability in existing PAs and expand the conservation areas for endangered fern species in the high priority conservation regions.

AB  - Focusing conservation efforts on priority areas is crucial for maximizing the effects of the limited available resources. Unfortunately, there is often a conflict between the optimal spatial scale for conservation measures and data available for planning. We tested the potential contribution of LiDAR data in providing high-resolution environmental predictors for conservation planning. We used detailed samples of ground beetles communities and high-resolution environmental data (i.e. land morphology, forest structure, and water availability) for modeling the habitat suitability for each species. All the specific models were combined to define priority areas for the conservation of carabids at the local level and to clarify the effect of each environmental feature on the forest suitability for ground beetles. The highest levels of suitability were obtained in less steep and north facing zones and in those where trees are taller, total volume of trees is larger, and tree density is lower. These parameters should be taken into account in sustainable forest management options aimed to preserve carabid communities. Moreover, our approach allowed to find exactly where, within the considered forest stands, the adoption of these measures would be particularly efficient. Our study is a demonstrative case that can be adapted to different taxa and different areas for improving the efficacy of forest management and of biodiversity conservation initiatives.

AB  - Habitat models serve three main purposes: First, to predict species occurrences on the basis of abiotic and biotic variables, second to improve the understanding of species-habitat relationships and third, to quantify habitat requirements. The use of statistical models to predict the likely occurrence or distribution of species based on relevant variables is becoming an increasingly important tool in conservation planning and wildlife management. This article aims to provide an overview of the current status of development and application of statistical methodologies for analysing the species-environment association, with a clear emphasis on aquatic habitat. It describes the main types of univariate and multivariate techniques available for analysis of species-environment association, and specifically focuses on the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the available statistical methods to estimate habitat suitability. A second objective of this article is to propose new approaches using existing statistical methods. A wide array of habitat statistical models has been developed to analyse habitat-species relationship. Generally, physical habitat is dependent on more than one variable (e.g. depth, velocity, substrate, cover) and several suitability indices must be combined to define a composite index. Multivariate approaches are more appropriate for the analysis of aquatic habitat as they inherently consider the interrelation and correlation structure of the environmental variables. Ordinary multiple linear regression and logistic regression are popular methods often used for modelling of species and their relationships with environment. Ridge regression and Principal component regression are particularly useful when the independent variables are highly correlated. More recent regression modelling paradigms like generalized linear models (GLMs) present advantages in dealing with non-normal environmental variables. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and artificial neural networks are better suited for analysis of non-linear relationships between species distribution and environmental variables. The fuzzy logic approach presents advantages in dealing with uncertainties that often exist in habitat modelling. Appropriate methods for analysis of multi-species data are also presented. Finally, the few existing comparative studies for predictive modelling are reviewed, and advantages and disadvantages of different methods are discussed. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Understanding species' historical ranges can provide important information for conservation planning in the face of environmental change. Cromsigt et al. (this issue) comment on our recent European bison (Bison bonasus) range reconstruction, suggesting that bison were already 8000 years ago a refugee species (i.e. restricted to marginal habitat due to past human pressure) and that species distribution models (SDM) are generally of limited use for refugee species conservation. While we welcome this discussion, we find no evidence for the claim that human pressure prior to 8000 BP determined where bison occurred. More importantly, as human pressure is generally high and increasing, attempts to restore species across their former range may fail where the factors that relegated species into refugee status are still at play or where their optimal habitat has vanished. Identifying areas where human pressure is low and where refugee species have persisted over the last millennia is crucial, and SDM based on historical data are important for doing so. Refugee species suffer from the shifting baseline syndrome, but careful reality checks are needed and all available data should be considered before determining the baseline that should inform conservation planning.

AB  - Effective conservation planning often requires difficult decisions when at-risk species inhabit economically valuable landscapes or if the needs of multiple threatened species do not align. In the agriculture-dominated landscape of eastern Ontario and southwestern Quebec, Canada, conflicting habitat requirements exist between threatened grassland birds benefiting from certain agriculture practices, and those of a diverse woodland bird community dependent on forest recovery. Using multi-scale species distribution models with data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), we assessed habitat suitability for 8 threatened grassland and forest specialists within this region. We also identified landscapes that jointly maximize occurrence of the 8 focal species and diversity of the full avian community. Influential habitat associations differed among species at the territory (200 m radius) and landscape level (1 km), highlighting the importance of considering multiple spatial scales. Species diversity was maximized when forest or grassland/pasture cover approached 40-50%, indicating a positive response to land cover heterogeneity. We identified species diversity hotspots near Lake Huron, as well as along the shore and southeast of the St. Lawrence River. These areas represent mosaic landscapes, balancing forest patches, wetland, grassland/pasture, and row crops such as corn, soybean, and cereals. Despite drastic landscape changes associated with agroecosystems, we demonstrate that targeted habitat protection and enhancement that prioritizes land cover diversity can maximize protection of bird communities with directly contrasting needs. We highlight multiple pathways to achieve this balance, including forest retention or separating row crops with hedgerows and wooded fence-lines, improving flexibility in conservation approaches.

AB  - Examining the suitability of landscape patches for endangered species enhances critical insights and indicators into the processes of population structure, community dynamics, and functioning in ecosystems particularly in protected areas (PAs). While PAs are the cornerstone in biodiversity conservation, there is debate on their efficacy to retain their conservation superiority over unprotected areas under climate change. In the present study, we examined the spatial and temporal effectiveness of PAs at maintaining suitable habitat for the "vulnerable" Southern Ground-hornbill (SGH), Bucorvus leadbeateri compared with the unprotected areas in Zimbabwe. We used a landscape-scale analysis of 182 PAs, their surrounding buffer zones, and unprotected areas coupled with three machine learning models (maximum entropy: MaxEnt, random forest, and support vector machines) to simulate SGH habitat suitability. Bioclimatic, vegetation seasonality and terrain variables were used as predictors against SGH "presence-only" observations and the models were projected for 2050 as future climatic scenarios (i.e. representative concentration pathways: RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The true skill statistic (TSS) and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the modeling framework. Our results show that the PAs network in Zimbabwe is extremely relevant for the conservation of SGH, with 8% of the suitable habitat within PAs projected to become unsuitable by 2050. Higher levels of protection status resulted in higher levels of suitable habitat for the SGH while the suitability of eastern-based PAs showed a decrease and the western-based PAs will potentially increase in suitability. Thus, conservation strategies should take the eastern PAs range contraction and associated westward shift into account. The established potential increase in suitability outside the PAs network (23%-31%) might increase conflicts between agriculture and conservation. We, therefore, suggest an expanded cross-boundary institutional alliance and policy development with all stakeholders to implement a holistic conservation plan. Our work demonstrates the importance of combining multi-source remotely sensed data in predicting habitat suitability for endangered species such as the SGH as key indicators of biological conservation and PAs' effectiveness.

AB  - Baseline data on the distribution and extent of biogenic habitat-forming species at a high spatial resolution are essential to inform habitat management strategies, preserve ecosystem integrity, and achieve effective conservation objectives in the nearshore. Model-based approaches to map suitable habitat for these species are a key tool to address this need, filling in gaps where observations are otherwise unavailable and remote sensing methods are limited by turbid waters or cannot be applied at scale. We developed a high resolution (35 m) ensemble species distribution model to predict the distribution of eelgrass (Zostera marina) along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, Canada where the observational coverage of eelgrass occurrence is sparse and nearshore waters are optically complex. Our ensemble model was derived as a performance-weighted average prediction of 7 different modeling methods fit to 6 physical predictors (substrate type, depth, wave exposure, slope, and two bathymetric position indices) and evaluated with a 5-fold spatially-blocked cross-validation procedure. The ensemble model showed moderate predictive performance (Area Under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) = 0.803 +/- 0.061, True Skill Statistic (TSS) = 0.531 +/- 0.100; mean +/- SD), high sensitivity (92.0 +/- 4.5), and offered some improvement over individual models. Substrate type, depth, and relative wave exposure were the most influential predictors associated with eelgrass occurrence, where the highest probabilities were associated with sandy and sandy-mud sediments, depths ranging 0 m - 4 m, and low to intermediate wave exposure. Within our study region, we predicted a total extent of suitable eelgrass habitat of 38,130 ha. We found suitable habitat was particularly extensive within the long narrow inlets and extensive shallow flats of the South Shore, Eastern Shore, and Bras d'Or Lakes. We also identified substantial overlap of eelgrass habitat with previously identified Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas that guide regional conservation planning while also highlighting areas of greater prediction uncertainty arising from disagreement among modeling methods. By offering improved sensitivity and insights into the fine-scale regional distribution of a habitat-forming species with associated uncertainties, our ensemble-based modeling approach provides improved support to numerous nearshore applications including conservation planning and restoration, marine spatial and emergency response planning, environmental impact assessments, and fish habitat protection.

AB  - In recent years, brown bear Ursus arctos populations in Iran have experienced a clear trend of reduction and the species is now officially listed as threatened under provincial legislation. Anthropogenic habitat alteration and increasing human access to previously remote landscapes are potential source of stress for this species in Iran. Therefore, land cover changes in the Chelcheli protected area were mapped for 1991-2013 using time sequential Landsat TM and ETM at 30 meters resolution. Moreover, Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling was used to investigate habitat selection of brown bear. The results showed that suitable patches overlapped with forest areas (Hyrcanian forest) and rivers. Our results also indicate that the brown bear habitat suitability is negatively influenced by human disturbance (e.g., roads, settlements). Increased human disturbance in brown bear habitat in recent decades may cause bears to avoid the disturbed areas. Therefore, the management plans should focus on reducing the human infrastructures around brown bear habitat. A suggestion is to place the core secure areas for brown bear inside the suitable habitat close to rivers where the human access is restricted. Promoting awareness of biodiversity conservation among tourism should also be one of the major focuses of management plans.

AB  - Statistical modelling of species presence/absence data in relation to mapped environmental predictors has been widely used to predict distributions of species for use in regional conservation planning. This paper evaluates the extent to which predictive mapping of habitat suitability might be refined by modelling relative abundance or density of a species instead of presence/absence. We use data collected at field survey sites in north-east New South Wales to develop models predicting the abundance of vascular plant and vertebrate fauna species as a function of regional-scale environmental variables. The predictive accuracy of these models is then evaluated using survey data collected at independent evaluation sites. A number of 'direct' abundance modelling techniques were evaluated including generalised linear and generalised additive Poisson regression, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. We also evaluated the performance of predicted probability of occurrence generated by logistic regression modelling as an 'indirect' index of abundance. Both the direct and indirect modelling techniques generally failed to provide consistently reliable predictions of abundance. Reasonably accurate models were produced for only 12 of the 44 species evaluated. A further key finding was that, for all 12 of these species, predictions from direct abundance models performed no better as a relative index of abundance than predicted probabilities of occurrence generated by logistic regression modelling. Implications of these results for the use of predictive modelling in regional conservation planning are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predictive distribution models generally use data from multiple individuals each associated with a unique observation location, coupled with environmental parameters, to define the overall suitable area where the species could occur. Whether the use of multiple locations from few individuals is similarly efficient to model species distribution is not yet known. If so, the method could bring valuable inputs to identify priority conservation areas for rare or elusive species, especially those large vertebrates tracked with telemetry. Satellite tracking of long-distance migrants often produces numerous locations of surveyed individuals across their wintering ranges. We examined such wintering tracks to test if the wintering locations obtained from few tracked individuals could be useful to model the full species wintering range, using habitat suitability models. We aimed at predicting the wintering distribution of West European Black Storks Ciconia nigra. We used tracks of 9 storks, retaining one location per winter day per individual for a total of 972 different locations. Combined with bioclimatic and land cover data in habitat suitability modelling within an ensemble forecast framework, we obtained a probabilistic distribution which largely matched the previously reported wintering range of the species in western and central Africa. Using tracks of the six individuals with more than 100 locations each, we obtained a distribution range closely matching the nine-bird range. A range similar to the nine-bird range could be predicted by models using data from less numerous individuals and by considering a lower threshold value. Habitat suitability models using wintering record locations of satellite-tracked migrant birds can therefore help to get a better picture of the wintering distribution range, and hence provide more accurate information for conservation planning on African wintering grounds.

AB  - Quantifying habitat use is important for understanding how animals meet their requirements for survival and provides information for conservation planning. Currently, assessments of range-wide habitat use that delimit species distributions are incomplete for many taxa. The Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja) is a raptor of conservation concern, widely distributed across Neotropical lowland forests, that currently faces threats from habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we use penalized logistic regression to identify species-habitat associations and predict habitat suitability based on a new International Union for the Conservation of Nature range metric, termed Area of Habitat. From the species-habitat model, we performed a gap analysis to identify areas of high habitat suitability in regions with limited coverage in the key biodiversity area (KBA) network. Range-wide habitat use indicated that Harpy Eagles prefer areas of 70%-75% evergreen forest cover, low elevation, and high vegetation species richness. Conversely, Harpy Eagles avoid areas of >10% cultivated landcover and mosaic forest, and topographically complex areas. Our species-habitat model identified a large continuous area of potential habitat across the pan-Amazonia region, and a habitat corridor from the Choco-Darien ecoregion of Colombia running north along the Caribbean coast of Central America. Little habitat was predicted across the Atlantic Forest biome, which is now severely degraded. The current KBA network covered 18% of medium to high Harpy Eagle habitat exceeding a target biodiversity area representation of 10%, based on species range size. Four major areas of high suitability habitat lacking coverage in the KBA network were identified in north and west Colombia, western Guyana, and north-west Brazil. We recommend these multiple gaps of habitat as new KBAs for strengthening the current KBA network. Modeled area of habitat estimates as described here is a useful tool for large-scale conservation planning and can be readily applied to many taxa.

AB  - Freshwater fish and mussel diversity is declining at an alarming rate across North America. Human land uses and disturbances within watersheds have been implicated as the primary cause of declines. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of land use/land cover (LULC) variables in species distribution modeling and conservation planning using a straightforward multiscale approach for prioritizing freshwater fish and mussel conservation areas in the upper Green River catchment (Ohio River basin, USA). We developed distribution and species richness models for 10 uncommon fishes and 14 rare mussels using multiscale landscape data and boosted regression tree (BRT) analyses based on LULC composition and pattern, geology composition, and soil composition data. We then used probability of occurrence, endemicity, prevalence, trend and range of individual species to estimate the conservation value of each stream reach. Conservation areas were defined for three spatial scales nested within the catchment management zone (focal areas, riparian management buffer and subcatchment management zone) using a simple optimization technique. Priority conservation areas were located primarily in the eastern (upper Green River) and southern (upper Barren River) portions of the catchment. We found that focal species richness is explained most by soil composition in the subcatchment. However, nested within the subcatchment scale focal species richness responded positively to percent forest and negatively to patch density of developed/exposed land in the reach buffer. For both the reach and riparian buffers, retaining forested tracts of land and limiting the level of development and fragmentation would benefit the focal species.

AB  - In the last 40 years, Italy has seen important changes: human pressure is increasing in flat and coastal areas while internal mountainous areas are being abandoned and naturally reforested. These changes have substantial impacts on the biodiversity of the region but no conservation strategy has ever explicitly considered them, and no systematic assessment of the existing protected areas has been carried out. We used a combination of distribution models and extents of occurrence to perform a gap analysis and an irreplaceability analysis. We evaluated the effectiveness of the protected areas for the conservation of terrestrial vertebrates, and we identified regions, species, and strategies that appear to be priorities for expanding and consolidating the existing network. The existing protected areas cannot be considered fully representative, and this is especially true for Sardinia where many of the gap species are located. The Alps and the Apennines represent the strongholds of species diversity, but most of the species of conservation interest are concentrated in the Mediterranean part of the peninsula, as well as in small areas of the plains, where human pressure is higher. Biodiversity and human presence are functionally linked through traditional agriculture and pasture and the only option for conservation is that of considering human presence and activities as an integral part of the system. In a human dominated landscape, protected areas must be planned and managed in conjunction with the matrix in which they are embedded and in the context of the environmental history of the region.

AB  - Monitoring protected areas (PAs) is essential for systematic evaluation of their effectiveness in terms of habitat protection, preservation and representativeness. This study illustrates how the use of species distribution models that combine remote sensing data and information about biodiversity surrogates can contribute to develop a systematic protocol for monitoring PAs. In particular, we assessed the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 (N2000) network, for conserving and preserving the representativeness of seven raptor species in a highly-dynamic landscape in northwest Spain between 2001 and 2014. We also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the N2000 network by using the total area under protection as a proxy for conservation costs. Overall, the N2000 network was found to poorly represent the habitats of the raptor species. Despite the low representativeness, this network showed a high degree of effectiveness due to increased overall habitat availability for generalist and forest specialist species between 2001 and 2014. Nevertheless, additional protected areas should be established in the near future to increase their representativeness, and thus ensure the protection of open-habitat specialist species and their priority habitats. In addition, proactive conservation measures in natural and semi-natural ecosystems (in particular, montane heathlands) will be essential for long-term protection of Montagu's harrier (species listed in the Annex I of the Bird Directive), and thus complying with the current European Environmental Legislation. This study sheds light on how the development and application of new protected area indices based on the combined use of freely-available satellite data and species distribution models may contribute substantially to the cost-efficiency of the PA monitoring systems, and to the 'Fitness Check' process of EU Nature Directives.

AB  - Species distribution data provide critical baseline information for conservation planning and decision making. However, in many of the Earth's most biodiverse regions, such data are lacking for many species. Here, we used ecological niche modeling and connectivity analyses to model distributions of endangered species and protected area connectivity across the Upper Guinea Forest (UGF) Global Conservation Hotspot of West Africa. We estimated the current distributions of African forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis (Vulnerable), western chimpanzee Pan troglodytes verus (Critically Endangered), and pygmy hippopotamus Choeropsis liberiensis (Endangered) across the region and optimized connectivity in two main forest complexes in the region. We used occurrence data for the period 2010-2016 for the three species from two well-sampled national parks in Liberia (Sapo National Park and Gola National Park), and remotely sensed MODIS enhanced vegetation index data for the period 2010-2015. Our models predicted a total of 75,157km(2) of suitable habitat for chimpanzees in the region, 79,400km(2) for elephants, and 290,696km(2) for hippos. Of these areas, for chimpanzees, 30% of the area predicted falls within the boundaries of proposed or designated protected areas, and likewise 30% for elephants, and 19% for hippos. Liberia had the largest blocks of contiguous forest suitable for these species compared to other countries in the region but this forest was largely unprotected. This study identifies priority areas for biodiversity conservation and forest connectivity in the region, and reemphasizes the practicality of these tools to optimize conservation planning and implementation.

AB  - We present a novel system of drifting pelagic baited stereo-video cameras that operate in deep-water, topographically complex environments typically considered inaccessible for sampling. The instruments are portable, semi-autonomous and inexpensive, allowing the recording of high-definition video footage in near-real time and over broad stretches of ocean space. We illustrate their benefits and potential as non-extractive monitoring tools for offshore marine reserves with a pilot study conducted within the newly established Perth Canyon Commonwealth Marine Reserve, southwestern Australia (32 degrees S, 115 degrees E). Using occupancy and maximum entropy models, we predict the distribution of midwater fishes and sharks and show that their most suitable habitat encompasses a wider fraction of the canyon head than is covered by park boundaries. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates that drifting pelagic stereo-video cameras can serve as appropriate field platforms for the construction of species distribution models with implications for ocean zoning and conservation planning efforts.

AB  - Modelling and mapping habitat suitability of species in a given study area has become a popular method to assess biogeographical questions on the habitat requirements of species, and to study the effects of land use or climate change on species distributions. Beside purely academic aims, model projections are increasingly used for devising conservation and management strategies and they are an established tool in conservation planning. Species distribution models (SDMs) link geographic presence records of species with environmental conditions found at these locations, and extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of species throughout the study area. While the modelling framework is similar in the terrestrial, marine and freshwater realms, each realm comprises specific challenges for combining the spatial scale, the environmental data and the species records for building reliable models. In this paper, we focus on these key issues from a stream ecology perspective and highlight three critical challenges to be kept in mind when building SDMs in stream ecosystems: (1) the spatial configuration in terms of the hierarchical structure of catchments and dendritic stream networks; (2) obtaining relevant and spatially continuous environmental predictors along the stream network, sourcing from three interfaces (stream vs. atmosphere, catchment area, groundwater) and (3) species detectability and thus the challenge of obtaining freshwater species occurrence data along the stream network. To depict freshwater species distributions at the stream level in the best possible way, multi-scale models are recommended, which account for scale dependence, a stronger integration of various environmental data types and sources, and heterogeneous species data. While model projections have the potential to serve as reliable tools for conservation and management purposes, this is only true if these relevant factors are considered in the modelling framework.

AB  - Urbanization adversely impacts biodiversity by reducing the quantity and quality of natural habitat areas. Additionally, the quality of natural habitat depends on its bio-physical characteristics (e.g., natural cover, impervious surfaces, urban tree canopy) as well as the functional traits of species inhabiting them (e.g., breeding/foraging habitat requirements). To better plan conservation of regional biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is therefore critical to assess the relationship between the landscape and the response of key Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) of species. To identify different FTGs of 116 avian species in the urbanized landscape of the Toronto region (Canada), we conducted a Functional Trait Analysis (FTA) using RLQ-fourth corner analysis. We focused on four species traits (diet, foraging, nesting, and territoriality) to identify the FTGs and their association with natural cover and landscape characteristics (landcover types, patch quality, habitat connectivity). Then, to predict FTG presence in relation to the landscape characteristics, we performed a Habitat Suitability Analysis (HSA). From this analysis, we found 21 avian FTGs with different habitat suitability values that correspond to forested patches and wetlands. The HSA for tree canopy, forest insectivore, and ground-nesting birds (or FTGs) have higher suitability values within forest patches, while aerial insectivores have higher suitability values in older residential neighborhoods indicating the value of the urban tree canopy. This methodological approach shows that by mapping habitat suitability by FTG one can identify strategic conservation areas that target multiple species, shifting efforts from a single species to a community-based functional focus. Our study highlights the conservation value of remnant and/or restored habitat patches in near urban and urban landscapes that help to maximize the persistence of regional avian biodiversity.

AB  - Conservation planning is the process of locating, configuring, implementing and maintaining areas that are managed to promote the persistence of biodiversity and other natural values. Conservation planning is inherently spatial. The science behind it has solved important spatial problems and increasingly influenced practice. To be effective, however, conservation planning must deal better with two types of change. First, biodiversity is not static in time or space but generated and maintained by natural processes. Second, humans are altering the planet in diverse ways at ever faster rates.

AB  - Aim Biodiversity conservation relies in part on enduring habitat in protected areas. In fire-prone ecosystems, shifts in species' ranges will result both from changes in climate and fire-catalysed vegetation change, which could lead to niche contraction and undermine protected-area efficacy. We explored these dynamics for three forest species with varied niches representative of other taxa and different hypothesized responses to fire-regime change (black-backed woodpecker, Picoides arcticus; North American marten, Martes spp.; and red squirrel, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). We asked: How do the extent and spatial pattern of these species' distributions change during the 21st century based on the independent and joint effects of climate and vegetation? Location Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Wyoming, USA). Methods For each species, we developed separate distribution models based on climate and forest attributes, projected under four climate-fire scenarios (a 2 x 2 design with moderate and high temperature and precipitation change). A spatially explicit forest landscape model calibrated for Greater Yellowstone was used to project fire and forest dynamics through 2100, and climate suitability was estimated with MaxEnt. Results Suitable habitat for all three species based on climate or vegetation alone frequently did not overlap on the landscape, and habitat patches became simpler in shape and farther apart. Climatically suitable habitat for the black-backed woodpecker increased in all scenarios, and suitable forest structure expanded by a factor of 30 in dry scenarios with more fire. Climatically suitable habitat for martens declined with warming and drying; the area of suitable vegetation fell >80% with fire-driven losses of mature forest. Red squirrel habitat was maintained in all scenarios, but was sensitive to aridity, and patches were redistributed and compacted. Main conclusions Projections based on climate alone may misrepresent future species distributions, especially where disturbances accelerate vegetation change. Our results identify important consequences of fire-regime change for wildlife in forests dominated by obligate-seeder or fire-sensitive conifers.

AB  - The delineation of essential fish habitats is necessary to identify, design and prioritize efficient marine protected area (MPA) networks with fishery objectives, capable, in addition to other possible objectives and functions of MPAs, of sustaining the renewal of marine living resources. Both the methods available to map essential fish habitats and the usefulness of these maps are discussed in this paper.
   Generally, the first step to obtain maps of essential fish habitats consists in choosing one of the numerous existing statistical approaches to build robust habitat suitability models linking relevant descriptors of the marine environment to the spatial distribution of fish presence or density. When these descriptors are exhaustively known, i.e. maps are available for each of them, geo-referenced predictions from these models and their related uncertainty may be imported into Geographic Information Systems for the quantitative identification and characterization of key sites for the marine living resources.
   The second part of this paper deals with the usefulness of such quantitative maps for management purposes. These maps allow for the quantitative identification of the different habitats that are required for these marine resources to complete their life cycles and enable to measure their respective importance for population renewal and conservation. The consequences of anthropogenic pressures not only fishing but also land reclamation, aggregate extractions or degradation of habitat quality (e.g. nutrient excess or xenobiotics loadings, invasive species or global change) on living resources, may also be simulated from such habitat models. These quantitative maps may serve as input in specific conservation planning software based on the systematic conservation approach. Fish habitat maps thus may help decision makers to select relevant protection areas and design coherent MPA networks which objectives are to sustain fishing resources and fisheries.

AB  - Climate change affects both habitat suitability and the genetic diversity of wild plants. Therefore, predicting and establishing the most effective and coherent conservation areas is essential for the conservation of genetic diversity in response to climate change. This is because genetic variance is a product not only of habitat suitability in conservation areas but also of efficient protection and management. Phellodendron amurense Rupr. is a tree species (family Rutaceae) that is endangered due to excessive and illegal harvesting for use in Chinese medicine. Here, we test a general computational method for the prediction of priority conservation areas (PCAs) by measuring the genetic diversity of P. amurense across the entirety of northeast China using a single strand repeat analysis of twenty microsatellite markers. Using computational modeling, we evaluated the geographical distribution of the species, both now and in different future climate change scenarios. Different populations were analyzed according to genetic diversity, and PCAs were identified using a spatial conservation prioritization framework. These conservation areas were optimized to account for the geographical distribution of P. amurense both now and in the future, to effectively promote gene flow, and to have a long period of validity. In situ and ex situ conservation, strategies for vulnerable populations were proposed. Three populations with low genetic diversity are predicted to be negatively affected by climate change, making conservation of genetic diversity challenging due to decreasing habitat suitability. Habitat suitability was important for the assessment of genetic variability in existing nature reserves, which were found to be much smaller than the proposed PCAs. Finally, a simple set of conservation measures was established through modeling. This combined molecular and computational ecology approach provides a framework for planning the protection of species endangered by climate change.

AB  - Species distribution models are commonly used to predict species responses to climate change. However, their usefulness in conservation planning and policy is controversial because they are difficult to validate across time and space. Here we capitalize on small mammal surveys repeated over a century in Yosemite National Park, USA, to assess accuracy of model predictions. Historical (1900-1940) climate, vegetation, and species occurrence data were used to develop single- and multi-species multivariate adaptive regression spline distribution models for three species of chipmunk. Models were projected onto the current (1980-2007) environmental surface and then tested against modern field resurveys of each species. We evaluated models both within and between time periods and found that even with the inclusion of biotic predictors, climate alone is the dominant predictor explaining the distribution of the study species within a time period. However, climate was not consistently an adequate predictor of the distributional change observed in all three species across time. For two of the three species, climate alone or climate and vegetation models showed good predictive performance across time. The stability of the distribution from the past to present observed in the third species, however, was not predicted by our modeling approach. Our results demonstrate that correlative distribution models are useful in understanding species' potential responses to environmental change, but also show how changes in species-environment correlations through time can limit the predictive performance of models.

AB  - Populations of large mammals have declined at alarming rates, especially in areas with intensified land use where species can only persist in small habitat fragments. To support conservation planning, we developed habitat suitability models for the Walia ibex (Capra walie), an endangered wild goat endemic to the Simen Mountains, Ethiopia. We calibrated several models that differ in statistical properties to estimate the spatial extent of suitable habitats of the Walia ibex in the Simen Mountains, as well as in other parts of the Ethiopian highlands to assess potentially suitable areas outside the current distribution range of the species. We further addressed the potential consequences of future climate change using a climate model with four emission scenarios. Model projections estimated the potential suitable habitat under current climate to 501-672 km(2) in Simen and 6,251-7,732 km(2) in other Ethiopian mountains. Under projected climate change by 2,080, the suitable habitat became larger in Simen but smaller in other parts of Ethiopia. The projected expansion in Simen is contrary to the general expectation of shrinking suitable habitats for high-elevation species under climate warming and may partly be due to the ruggedness of these particular mountains. The Walia ibex has a wide altitudinal range and is able to exploit very steep slopes, allowing it to track the expected vegetation shift to higher altitudes. However, this potential positive impact may not last long under continued climate warming, as the species will not have much more new space left to colonize. Our study indicates that the current distribution range can be substantially increased by reintroducing and/or translocating the species to other areas with suitable habitat. Indeed, to increase the viability and prospects for survival of this flagship species, we strongly recommend human-assisted reintroduction to other Ethiopian mountains. Emulating the successful reintroduction of the Alpine ibex that has spread from a single mountain in Italy to its historical ranges of the Alps in Europe might contribute to saving the Walia ibex from extinction.

AB  - Biological invasions are a main threat to biodiversity and natural resources, which calls for studies that identify the regions that present the greatest invasion risks. We assessed the potential distribution of two non-native rose species, Rosa canina and Rosa rubiginosa, in mountain environments in mid-western Argentina, using species distribution models and dynamic simulations. We first fitted the model for one protected area, Villavicencio Nature Reserve, and then we made predictions on the distribution of these species for other protected areas in the same region, where the presence of these species was observed but where there are no systematic surveys on their distribution. We also modeled the invasion dynamics of these species based on habitat suitability, considering the dispersal distance and the growth rate of the invaded area. High and very high suitability sites were detected in all the protected areas studied, suggesting high invasion risk in these protected areas. Our simulations of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the rose invasion in Villavicencio indicated that the spread depends strongly on the average seed dispersal distance, that the spread has been gradual since the rose introduction into the protected area, and that 150 years after the introduction even the areas identified as having low suitability are expected to have been invaded. This is the first study of this type for the region, where these invasive rose species are a serious problem. Taken together, our results may be useful to identify areas vulnerable to invasion and thus help generate effective preventive, monitoring, and control practices.

AB  - Rosa arabica Crep. is a perennial shrub belonging to the family Rosaceae. It is endemic to the high mountain area of St. Catherine Protected Area (SCPA) in southern Sinai, Egypt, and is listed as one of the most 100 threatened plants in the world. Recently, it has been listed as critically endangered by IUCN Red List due to its small extent of occurrence and tiny population size. We reported the continuous decline in habitat quality for this species and the urgent need to carry out on-ground conservation actions. So, this research aims to conserve Rosa arabica through in situ practices by implementing the following steps, respectively: a) evaluate the current conservation status through IUCN Red List to extract the environmental factors controlling the species' distribution necessary for establishing the recovery program, b) determine the potential species habitat suitability under the current climate conditions using Maxent, and c) based on the previous two steps, the translocation process for R. arabica in the suitable habitat will be done after the simple layering process as one of the most effective traditional vegetative methods for wild cultivation for this species. These steps aimed to reduce the impact of threats and the risk of extinction through increasing the population size, the Extent of Occurrence (EOO), and the Area of Occupancy (AOO). We extracted the environmental factors controlling the target species' distribution and habitat suitability range using the IUCN Red List assessment and Species Distribution Model (SDM). The most suitable habitat for R. arabica is predicted in the middle northern parts of SCPA, with the highest suitability in the High Mountains. Precipitation of driest quarter, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation of coldest quarter, and aspect are the highest mean contributors determining the distribution of R. arabica in SCPA. Rosa arabica potential distribution covers 324.4 km(2) (7.46%) of the total SCPA area (4350 km(2)). This area is divided into: 18.1 km(2) high probability, 124.3 km(2) moderate probability, and 182 km(2) low probability. After one year of the simple layering process, ten branches rooted and were translocated into three sites that had been previously identified to cover three habitat suitability ranges (high, moderate, and low suitability). After a year of translocation in the wild, the survival rate ranged from 66% to 100%, the geographical range increased by 65%, and the population size by 6.8%. Therefore, if the new individuals continue to grow and adapt it may lead to the expansion of other environmental factors such as climatic and topographical factors that probably increase the resilience of the global population of the species to adverse events. Detailed information is provided in this research about the recovery program, from planning to implementation and monitoring, and recommendations for best practices.

AB  - Ardeotis nigriceps, commonly known as Great Indian Bustard (GIB), is a Critically Endangered, Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Threatened (EDGE) and endemic species to the Indian subcontinent. GIB is under tremendous threat in its last strongholds and sliding inextricably towards extinction. The GIB sanctuary in Maharashtra (India) is one of the last refuges of the bird constituting an area of 8496 km(2) spread over in seven talukas of Solapur and Ahemednagar districts. Major portion of the sanctuary (94.3 %) consists of privately owned lands under a variety of economic vocations and large number of villages and townships. In view of the legal restrictions relating to Protected Area under the Wildlife (Protection) Act of India 1972, the inhabitants of villages and townships faced a very difficult situation regarding use of their lands, development of properties and deriving benefits from planned local and regional development. This created conflict between local people and the forest department over the use of land, which necessitated the rationalization of the sanctuary. The objective of the present study was to map the suitable habitat of GIB in GIB Wildlife Sanctuary as an input for the realignment of the GIB Sanctuary by identifying areas that are important for the GIB. Main parameters considered for the habitat suitability assessments are, habit and habitat of GIB, slope, minimum patch size and disturbance sources. Based on the criteria derived for the ecological and biological requirements of GIB, binary deductive habitat suitability modeling has been done using remote sensing and GIS and prioritized the potential habitats of GIB. The net area of important suitable habitat of GIB in GIB sanctuary is 2304.99 km(2) out of 8496.44 km(2). The output of the present study has been used as an input by the committee (set by Honorable Supreme court of India) on rationalization of the GIB Sanctuary and the sanctuary has been rationalized with an area of 1222 km(2).

AB  - Predicting the distribution of suitable habitats for species under climate change is essential for conservation planning. In the past three decades, the number of Persian squirrels (Sciurus anomalus) and the area covered by the Persian oak (Quercus brantii) have decreased due to various factors such as habitat degradation. Habitat suitability of the above interacting species was assessed under the current conditions and future (2050) climate change scenarios in western Iran, using a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). The model performed well with an average area under the curve of above 0.9 for the two species. Precipitation in winter was the factor that contributed most to habitat suitability of both species. The MaxEnt projection for the year 2050 revealed a reduction in the area of suitable habitats for both species. Based on the outputs from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research Coupled Model (HadCM) scenarios, the fundamental niche (the range of environmental conditions in which the species can survive) of the Persian squirrel will reduce by between 0.12 and 1.1%. However, under the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques Coupled Model scenarios, small gains in potential habitats may be observed. The area of suitable habitats for the oak was reduced under all scenarios except HadCM (representative concentration pathway 2.6). The results showed that the loss of suitable habitats for both species was more evident in the northern part of the range where the best habitats currently exist. In contrast, small gains in suitable habitats may be observed in the southern and eastern part of the range.

AB  - Many habitat patches in tropical landscapes have become less suitable for wildlife due to an increase in anthropogenic disturbances. An index of habitat suitability based on the ecological factors that collectively determine the suitability of an organism's habitat is important for conservation planning. However, a widely accepted and comprehensive multi-criteria habitat suitability index for umbrella species is still lacking, particularly in areas where information related to the biology and ecology of the species of interest is not available. Therefore we develop preliminary habitat maps and measure the degree of habitat suitability for large mammals, focusing on four umbrella species in the State of Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia: Panthera tigris jacksoni (Malayan tiger), Tapirus indicus (Malayan tapir), Helarctos malayanus malayanus (Malayan sun bear), and Rusa unicolor cambojensis (sambar deer). The former two are endangered and the latter two are vulnerable according to the IUCN Red List. The suitability of habitat patches for each species was measured across the entire study area as well as in nine wildlife protected areas by integrating GIS data and expert opinion. Expert opinions were used as the source of information regarding the stresses faced by the species because there was insufficient information available from ground surveys.
   We developed an index and maps of habitat suitability for each species, which were then integrated to represent a combined index (ranging from 0 to 27) and spatially explicit maps of the area's habitat suitability for large mammals. The average large mammal habitat suitability index value of the State of Selangor (9) indicates that many habitat patches have become unsuitable for such species. Of the nine wildlife protected areas, Fraser's Hill (22), Sungai Dusun (22), and Bukit Kutu (21) are very suitable; Klang Gate (20) and Templers Park (17) are suitable; and the remaining four are unsuitable for large mammals. We assume that this preliminary habitat suitability index and mapping are useful for conservation planning of wildlife habitats at both landscape and regional scales, as well as providing an initial foundation for revision by future research with significant new information.

AB  - Knowledge about the spatial distribution of seabirds at sea is important for conservation. During marine conservation planning, logistical constraints preclude seabird surveys covering the complete area of interest and spatial distribution of seabirds is frequently inferred from predictive statistical models. Increasingly complex models are available to relate the distribution and abundance of pelagic seabirds to environmental variables, but a comparison of their usefulness for delineating protected areas for seabirds is lacking. Here we compare the performance of five modelling techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, Random Forest, boosted regression trees, and maximum entropy) to predict the distribution of Balearic Shearwaters (Puffinus mauretanicus) along the coast of the western Iberian Peninsula. We used ship transect data from 2004 to 2009 and 13 environmental variables to predict occurrence and density, and evaluated predictive performance of all models using spatially segregated test data. Predicted distribution varied among the different models, although predictive performance varied little. An ensemble prediction that combined results from all five techniques was robust and confirmed the existence of marine important bird areas for Balearic Shearwaters in Portugal and Spain. Our predictions suggested additional areas that would be of high priority for conservation and could be proposed as protected areas. Abundance data were extremely difficult to predict, and none of five modelling techniques provided a reliable prediction of spatial patterns. We advocate the use of ensemble modelling that combines the output of several methods to predict the spatial distribution of seabirds, and use these predictions to target separate surveys assessing the abundance of seabirds in areas of regular use.

AB  - Estimating species distributions requires species presence data of sufficient quantity from reputable sources that are geographically representative of the species' space use. Collecting presence data that meets these standards can be costly and is often complicated by limited land access. Citizen science projects are an appealing alternative source of presence data as these data are freely available and collected globally. Websites such as eBird have become increasingly large repositories of citizen science data. The vulnerable lesser prairie-chicken (LPC; Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is a species well-represented in the eBird database, with presence observations from 140 unique locations from 2012 to 2014. During that same period, a distribution-wide, standardized aerial survey with state and federal support recorded 106 LPC detections. Our objective was to compare species distribution models (SDMs) made with eBird data to models made with aerial survey data to determine the potential for citizen science data to contribute to conservation planning. We used maximum entropy modeling to create SDMs based on eBird data, aerial survey data, and a combination of both data sets using variables of biological significance to LPCs. We obtained comparable model performance using aerial survey data only [standardized test omission rate (STO): 23.4%, test AUC: 0.76] and with eBird data only (STO: 23.8%, AUC: 0.76). The I statistic confirmed a very high degree of similarity between the outputs of the two model sets (I = 0.929). However, a road bias existed within both data sets (positive and negative biases), potentially confounding some environmental correlates. Despite this bias, our combined model predicted an increase of 1,732,500 ha of unique area suitable for the LPC. Our results indicated that eBird data could be used as a low-cost source for species occurrence data to create species distribution models, though biases in these datasets should be assessed to guide interpretability of the predicted outputs.

AB  - Javan deer (Rusa timorensis) is a protected species in Indonesia and considered to be vulnerable under IUCN list. Nevertheless, its native geographic distribution remains unclear, and the impact of abiotic and biotic factors on this species are mostly unknown. We predicted the potential range of Javan deer in Java and Bali Islands using ten environmental variables, occurrence data of native (76 before 1965, and 653 after 1965) and introduced populations (559), and MaxEnt modelling. We evaluated the effects of habitat loss due to current land use, ecosystem availability, and importance of Indonesian protected areas into the models. Our predictive map significantly improved the IUCN assessment and described for the first time the spread of Javan deer out of its native range within Indonesia. The model of environmental suitability estimated a potential of 3,784.43 km(2) natural occurrence in Java and Bali and 36,352.61 km(2) for introduced populations in protected areas of West Nusa Tenggara to Papua. The most critical environmental predictors for both populations are the mean annual precipitation and the conservation status of land. Then, 45.66 % of the distribution of native populations overlaps with protected areas, 18.96 % with production forests, 11.07 % with non-protected areas, 10.10 % with limited production forests and 4.20 % with industrial oil palm plantations. Only 22.88 % of the distribution of introduced populations overlaps with protected areas. Our study provides reliable information on places where conservation efforts must be prioritized, both inside and outside the protected area network, to safeguard one of the remaining Indonesian large deer.

AB  - Modern species distribution modelling (SDM) began in 1984 with the launch of the BIOCLIM program in Australia. With more than 900 papers mentioning 'species distribution model' published around the world to date, SDM is one of the most active areas of global ecology. Three books published in 2009, 2011 and 2017 have reviewed SDM, and the closely related areas of ecological niche modelling and habitat suitability modelling. All three books provide excellent introductions to these topics, but give very little information on the role that BIOCLIM played in laying the foundation for these research areas. Understanding the history of BIOCLIM is vital because it was the first package to implement the basic SDM process in an easy-to-use integrated system. It provided what are still the most commonly used set of 19 bioclimatic variables and contributed to the development of the interpolation routines used to prepare the most commonly used source of bioclimatic data (WorldClim). Early BIOCLIM studies investigated important issues such as ecological niche, invasion risk, conservation planning and impacts of climate change. Although all three books acknowledge that the BIOCLIM package was important in early SDM research, they all deal with the pioneering work very briefly and omit important details which are described here. Virtually all current SDM studies owe something to the pioneering BIOCLIM work, but this is rarely acknowledged.

AB  - 1. Large-scale conservation planning requires the identification of priority areas in which species have a high likelihood of long-term persistence. This typically requires high spatial resolution data on species and their habitat. Such data are rarely available at a large geographical scale, so distribution modelling is often required to identify the locations of priority areas. However, distribution modelling may be difficult when a species is either not recorded, or not present, at many of the locations that are actually suitable for it. This is an inherent problem for species that exhibit metapopulation dynamics.
   2. Rather than basing species distribution models on species locations, we investigated the consequences of predicting the distribution of suitable habitat, and thus inferring species presence/absence. We used habitat surveys to define a vegetation category which is suitable for a threatened species that has spatially dynamic populations (the butterfly Euphydryas aurinia), and used this as the response variable in distribution models. Thus, we developed a practical strategy to obtain high resolution (1 ha) large scale conservation solutions for E. aurinia in Wales, UK.
   3. Habitat-based distribution models had high discriminatory power. They could generalize over a large spatial extent and on average predicted 86% of the current distribution of E. aurinia in Wales. Models based on species locations had lower discriminatory power and were poorer at generalizing throughout Wales.
   4. Surfaces depicting the connectivity of each grid cell were calculated for the predicted distribution of E. aurinia habitat. Connectivity surfaces provided a distance-weighted measure of the concentration of habitat in the surrounding landscape, and helped identify areas where the persistence of E. aurinia populations is expected to be highest. These identified successfully known areas of high conservation priority for E. aurinia. These connectivity surfaces allow conservation planning to take into account long-term spatial population dynamics, which would be impossible without being able to predict the species' distribution over a large spatial extent.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Where species location data are unsuitable for building high resolution predictive habitat distribution models, habitat data of sufficient quality can be easier to collect. We show that they can perform as well as or better than species data as a response variable. When coupled with a technique to translate distribution model predictions into landscape priority (such as connectivity calculations), we believe this approach will be a powerful tool for large-scale conservation planning.

AB  - Climate variability is the most influential driver altering the natural habitats of species leading to worldwide biodiversity loss. Understanding the climatic niche of vulnerable species and predicting its shift due to impending climate change is highly important to assess the damage. It also helps to plan and implement long term ex-situ or in-situ strategies to protect the species and its fragile habitats. Though, various important species of Himalayas are exploited for their economic and medicinal benefits, yet the impact of climate change on species have not been efficiently documented. Present study, is an attempt to understand the impact of climate vulnerability on habitat suitability of Hippophae salicifolia, a multipurpose species that grows particularly on the riparian fronts of river Ganga in Central Himalayas, using species distribution modeling. The Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model with field observed occurrence locations of the species and CMIP5 (Couple Model Inter-comparison Project) derived bioclimatic variables were used for the study. The predictions were done on the geographic area of Central Himalayas in Uttarakhand state of India according to four IPCC RCPs (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, Representative Concentration Pathways) for the future periods 2050 and 2070. Our results show that the estimated potential (threshold-1) area along the riparian fronts is around 2050 km(2) for the current period. Whereas, for the future years, the suitable area is likely to be lost by 87% for all climate change scenarios making H. salicifolia highly vulnerable in it' s actual habitats. An upward shift in the habitat of the species by 1700 m amsl (2800-4500 m amsl) is also predicted. Shift of species from its micro-habitats due to climate reflects unusual patterns and demands the vital need of applying climate adaptive management for habitat conservation. Present study presents a baseline database for broad-scale applicability of riparian front restoration for species conservation.

AB  - With many species predicted to respond to a changing climate by shifting their distribution to climatically suitable areas, the effectiveness of static protected areas (PAs) is in question. The Madagascan PA network area has quadrupled over the past 15 years, and, although conservation planning techniques were employed to prioritise suitable areas for protection during this process, climate change impacts were not considered. We make use of species distribution models for 750 Madagascan vertebrate species to assess the potential impacts of climate change on (1) species richness across Madagascar, (2) species gain, loss and turnover in Madagascar's PAs and (3) PA network representativeness. Results indicate that Madagascar is predicted to experience substantial shifts in species richness, with most PAs predicted to experience high rates of species turnover. Provided there are no barriers to species movements, the representativeness of the current PA network will remain high for the species that are predicted to survive changes in climate by 2070, suggesting that little benefit will be gained from establishing new PAs. However, this rests on the assumption of mobility through areas currently characterised by fragmentation and anthropogenic activity, something that will require considerable expansion in conservation efforts in order to achieve.

AB  - Different methodologies had been developed for species management and conservation based on modelling of potential biodiversity at regional scales. However, most of these models were fitted for umbrella species (e.g. big mammals) rather than micro-fauna. Beetles should be included to improve conservation strategies due to their functional roles and vulnerability in arid environments. The maps of potential biodiversity (MPB) based on different potential habitat suitability (PHS) maps are useful to indicate high biodiversity areas. Firstly, we aim to elaborate a MPB of darkling beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) based on 10 species PHS maps inhabiting Santa Cruz Province (Argentina). Then, we analysed the MPB an environmental gradients and land-use variables. We explored 41 potential variables to develop PHS maps. The MPB was included into a GIS project, and was analysed considering climatic and topographic variables, ecological areas and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, also sheep density, desertification and protected area network. The modelled showed great variability in their habitat requirements (e.g. temperature), where marginality (PHS differs from the available conditions) and specialization (environmental condition range of PHS) determined three species groups. MPB increased from grasslands in the NE to shrublands in the SE, and was higher with SOC, sheep density and desertification degree. Protection areas included lower MPB for darkling beetles, where provincial reserves have a major conservation role compared with national parks. MPB allowed us to understand the potential trade-offs with the environment and human uses. This gave us a tool to development new strategies (e.g. land-sparing) for management and conservation.

AB  - Context Habitat loss and fragmentation are main drivers of biodiversity loss and are occurring at an accelerating rate globally. Carnivores are often subject to persecution and conflict with humans, typically reside in low densities and require large areas for core habitat and dispersal, which makes them especially vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Objectives This paper identifies, maps and analyses habitat core areas and connectivity linkages for three mountain-residing carnivore species of high conservation importance in Iran: Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) and Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul). Methods We used ensemble habitat suitability modeling, and compared the accuracy of ensemble models with seven separate models based on AUC and TSS. We applied resistant kernel and factorial least-cost path analyses to identify population core areas and corridors across the full distributions of the three species in Iran. Results Mean annual temperature, vegetation greenness (NDVI), and slope were among the most important predictor variables for all three species. We found ensemble modeling outcompeted all single-method models in terms of AUC. We found low overlap between predicted corridor locations of our modeled species with Protected Areas. Conclusions Given the fragmented populations of our studied species in Iran, conserving them will require integrated landscape-level management to protect corridors and enhance connectivity, especially outside of Protected Areas. Optimized landscape management to conserve these species will likely promote conservation of montane landscapes and their inhabitants in Iran.

AB  - Background Understanding the impacts of past and contemporary climate change on biodiversity is critical for effective conservation. Amphibians have weak dispersal abilities, putting them at risk of habitat fragmentation and loss. Both climate change and anthropogenic disturbances exacerbate these risks, increasing the likelihood of additional amphibian extinctions in the near future. The giant spiny frog (Quasipaa spinosa), an endemic species to East Asia, has faced a dramatic population decline over the last few decades. Using the giant spiny frog as an indicator to explore how past and future climate changes affect landscape connectivity, we characterized the shifts in the suitable habitat and habitat connectivity of the frog. Results We found a clear northward shift and a reduction in the extent of suitable habitat during the Last Glacial Maximum for giant spiny frogs; since that time, there has been an expansion of the available habitat. Our modelling showed that "overwarm" climatic conditions would most likely cause a decrease in the available habitat and an increase in the magnitude of population fragmentation in the future. We found that the habitat connectivity of the studied frogs will decrease by 50-75% under future climate change. Our results strengthen the notion that the mountains in southern China and the Sino-Vietnamese transboundary regions can act as critical refugia and priority areas of conservation planning going forward. Conclusions Given that amphibians are highly sensitive to environmental changes, our findings highlight that the responses of habitat suitability and connectivity to climate change can be critical considerations in future conservation measures for species with weak dispersal abilities and should not be neglected, as they all too often are.

AB  - Systematic conservation initiatives attempt to cater to the needs of many species via the integration of multiple species distribution models (SDMs), or via the integration of Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) software, such as Zonation. Unfortunately, due to limited data and knowledge, it is often difficult to select the most suitable model for specific species, let alone an appropriate ensemble modeling method for multiple species. In general, model selection criteria are based on either model performance or consensus. The former integrates the highest-performing SDM for all focal species, whereas the latter integrates multiple SDM outputs based on consensus. While higher-performing ensemble models presumably identify high-quality habitats better, many have argued that high consensus ensemble models have less uncertainty originating from sporadic model variability. This study develops and validates seven ensemble-modeling strategies for integrating outputs of the systematic conservation tool Zonation. First, we considered the distributions of 11 bird species via 100 runs of five SDMs across Taiwan. Second, we evaluated the local and global uncertainty of all five models. Third, we used Zonation to obtain conservation priorities. We then used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to quantify different sources of uncertainty. Finally, we used independent third-party habitat data to validate each strategy. On average, the 'best model' strategy (based on the highest ADC value) performed best. Based on our modeling exercise we present a comprehensive framework for conservation prioritization, validation and the quantification of uncertainty intrinsic to SDMs according to different conservation scenarios and goals.

AB  - Ecuador will experience a significant expansion of the oil industry in its Amazonian region, one of the most biodiverse areas of the world. In view of the changes that are about to come, we explore the conflicts between oil extraction interests and biodiversity protection and apply systematic conservation planning to identify priority areas that should be protected in different oil exploitation scenarios. First, we quantified the current extent of oil blocks and protected zones and their overlap with two biodiversity indicators: 25 ecosystems and 745 species (whose distributions were estimated via species distribution models). With the new scheme of oil exploitation, oil blocks cover 68% (68,196 km(2)) of the Ecuadorian Amazon; half of it occupied by new blocks open for bids in the southern Amazon. This region is especially vulnerable to biodiversity losses, because peaks of species diversity, 19 ecosystems, and a third of its protected zones coincide spatially with oil blocks. Under these circumstances, we used Marxan software to identify priority areas for conservation outside oil blocks, but their coverage was insufficient to completely represent biodiversity. Instead, priority areas that include southern oil blocks provide a higher representation of biodiversity indicators. Therefore, preserving the southern Amazon becomes essential to improve the protection of Amazonian biodiversity in Ecuador, and avoiding oil exploitation in these areas (33% of the extent of southern oil blocks) should be considered a conservation alternative. Also, it is highly recommended to improve current oil exploitation technology to reduce environmental impacts in the region, especially within five oil blocks that we identified as most valuable for the conservation of biodiversity. The application of these and other recommendations depends heavily on the Ecuadorian government, which needs to find a better balance between the use of the Amazon resources and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Habitat loss is one of the main threats to wildlife, particularly large mammals. Estimating the potential distribution of threatened species to guide surveys and conservation is crucial, primarily because such species tend to exist in small fragmented populations. The Endangered huemul deer Hippocamelus bisulcus is endemic to the southern Andes of Chile and Argentina. Although the species occurs in the Valdivian Ecoregion, a hotspot for biodiversity, we have no information on its occupancy and potential distribution in this region. We built and compared species distribution models for huemul using the maximum entropy approach, using 258 presence records and sets of bioclimatic and geographical variables as predictors, with the objective of assessing the potential distribution of the species in the Valdivian Ecoregion. Annual temperature range and summer precipitation were the predictive variables with the greatest influence in the best-fitting model. Approximately 12,360 km(2). of the study area was identified as suitable habitat for the huemul, of which 30% is included in the national protected area systems of Chile and Argentina. The map of potential distribution produced by our model will facilitate prioritization of future survey efforts in other remote and unexplored areas in which huemul have not been recorded since the 1980s but where there is a high probability of their occurrence.

AB  - One of the most important tools in conservation biology is information on the geographic distribution of species and the variables determining those patterns. We used maximum-entropy niche modeling to run distribution models for 222 amphibian and 371 reptile species (49% endemics and 27% threatened) for which we had 34,619 single geographic records. The planning region is in southeastern Mexico, is 20% of the country's area, includes 80% of the country's herpetofauna, and lacks an adequate protected-area system. We used probabilistic data to build distribution models of herpetofauna for use in prioritizing conservation areas for three target groups (all species and threatened and endemic species). The accuracy of species-distribution models was better for endemic and threatened species than it was for all species. Forty-seven percent of the region has been deforested and additional conservation areas with 13.7% to 88.6% more native vegetation (76% to 96% of the areas are outside the current protected-area system) are needed. There was overlap in 26 of the main selected areas in the conservation-area network prioritized to preserve the target groups, and for all three target groups the proportion of vegetation types needed for their conservation was constant: 30% pine and oak forests, 22% tropical evergreen forest, 17% low deciduous forest, and 8% montane cloud forests. The fact that different groups of species require the same proportion of habitat types suggests that the pine and oak forests support the highest proportion of endemic and threatened species and should therefore be given priority over other types of vegetation for inclusion in the protected areas of southeastern Mexico.

AB  - A major challenge in conservation biology is to identify the factors driving abundance and demographic regeneration of rare species populations. We assess habitat suitability within a protected area for Armeria arenaria (Pers.) Schuh. (Plumbaginaceae), a small perennial polycarpic plant and keystone species of a threatened plant community on the rocky crystalline coastline of South-East France. The factors associated with the occurrence and abundance of adult plants and juveniles of this species were investigated by an "Outlier Mean Index analysis" (OMI). A second census was conducted three years later to test the reliability of inferences about habitat suitability. The results underline the importance of fine scale habitat heterogeneity to understand the variation of abundance. Moreover only a portion of the habitat of Armeria arenaria is suitable for regeneration, underlying the necessity to consider both abundance and regeneration to set conservation and management priorities.

AB  - We determined the effects of past and future climate changes on the distribution of the Montivipera raddei species complex (MRC) that contains rare and endangered viper species limited to Iran, Turkey and Armenia. We also investigated the current distribution of MRC to locate unidentified isolated populations as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of the current network of protected areas for their conservation. Present distribution of MRC was modeled based on ecological variables and model performance was evaluated by field visits. Some individuals at the newly identified populations showed uncommon morphological characteristics. The distribution map of MRC derived through modeling was then compared with the distribution of protected areas in the region. We estimated the effectiveness of the current protected area network to be 10%, which would be sufficient for conserving this group of species, provided adequate management policies and practices are employed. We further modeled the distribution of MRC in the past (21,000 years ago) and under two scenarios in the future (to 2070). These models indicated that climatic changes probably have been responsible for an upward shift in suitable habitats of MRC since the Last Glacial Maximum, leading to isolation of allopatric populations. Distribution will probably become much more restricted in the future as a result of the current rate of global warming. We conclude that climate change most likely played a major role in determining the distribution pattern of MRC, restricting allopatric populations to mountaintops due to habitat alterations. This long-term isolation has facilitated unique local adaptations among MRC populations, which requires further investigation. The suitable habitat patches identified through modeling constitute optimized solutions for inclusion in the network of protected areas in the region.

AB  - The endangered Euphrates soft-shelled turtle, Rafetus euphraticus, is endemic to the Mesopotamian River Basin in the Middle East. Within recent decades, populations of this aquatic species have been heavily depleted and severely fragmented owing to habitat alteration and destruction by drainage and hydroelectricity dam constructions. Continuing habitat loss and fragmentation are considered the main drivers for the population decline of R. euphraticus.Intraspecific genetic variability was investigated using two mitochondrial gene fragments for 31 specimens covering most of the distributional range of the species. Habitat suitability models were computed using a combination of bioclimatic and remote sensing variables as environmental predictors to assess habitat suitability, habitat fragmentation and coverage by designated protected areas across the range of R. euphraticus.Beyond single substitutions in two sequences, no significant genetic variation could be detected in R. euphraticus. Models show habitat suitability to be high throughout the range of the species, although only a fraction is currently covered by reserves. Habitat suitability and coverage of reserves is highly variable among countries. South-western Iran appears to be of major importance for future conservation strategies. Suitability models are in concordance with the habitat selection patterns of R. euphraticusThe existing reserve system is considered insufficient and has to be significantly improved in order to sustain viable populations of R. euphraticus. To counter continuing fragmentation and alteration by dam construction, future conservation measures should focus on highlighted priority areas. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background
   Climate change has been widely accepted as one of the major threats for global biodiversity and understanding its potential effects on species distribution is crucial to optimise conservation planning in future scenarios under global change. Integrating detailed climatic data across spatial and temporal scales into species distribution modelling can help to predict potential changes in biodiversity. Consequently, this type of data can be useful for developing efficient biodiversity management and conservation planning. The provision of such data becomes even more important in highly biodiverse regions, currently suffering from climatic and landscape changes. The Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Meseta Iberica (BRMI; Portugal-Spain) is one of the most relevant reserves for wildlife in Europe. This highly diverse region is of great ecological and socio-economical interest, suffering from synergistic processes of rural land abandonment and climatic instabilities that currently threaten local biodiversity.
   Aiming to optimise conservation planning in the Reserve, we provide a complete dataset of historical and future climate models (1 x 1 km) for the BRMI, used to build a series of distribution models for 207 vertebrate species. These models are projected for 2050 under two climate change scenarios. The climatic suitability of 52% and 57% of the species are predicted to decrease under the intermediate and extreme climatic scenarios, respectively. These models constitute framework data for improving local conservation planning in the Reserve, which should be further supported by implementing climate and land-use change factors to increase the accuracy of future predictions of species distributions in the study area.
   New information
   Herein, we provide a complete dataset of state-of-the-art historical and future climate model simulations, generated by global-regional climate model chains, with climatic variables resolved at a high spatial resolution (1 x 1 km) over the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Meseta Iberica. Additionally, a complete series of distribution models for 207 species (168 birds, 24 reptiles and 15 amphibians) under future (2050) climate change scenarios is delivered, which constitute framework data for improving local conservation planning in the reserve.

AB  - Southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiforrnis; SWWP) is a conifer species that occurs at mid to high elevations in the mountains of Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico. A key component of mixed conifer forests in the region, SWWP is an important species for wildlife and biodiversity. The dual threats of the non-native fungal pathogen that causes white pine blister rust (WPBR) and a warmer, drier projected future climate have created an uncertain future for SWWP. In this study, we used a novel multi-scale optimization approach including an ensemble of four species distribution modeling methods to explore the relationship between SWWP occurrence and environmental variables based on climate, soil, and topography. Spatial projections of these models reflecting the present climate provide an improved range map for this species that can be used to guide field data collection and monitoring of WPBR outbreaks. Future projections based on two emissions scenarios and an ensemble of 15 general circulation models project a large range shift and range contraction by 2080. Changes in the future distribution were particularly extreme under the higher emissions scenario, with a more than 1000 km northerly shift in the mean latitude and 500 m increase in the mean elevation of the species' suitable habitat. This coincided with a range contraction of over 60% and a significant increase in habitat fragmentation. The ability of SWWP to realize its projected future range will depend on colonization at the leading edge of the range shift, including dispersal dynamics, resistance to WPBR, competition with other species, and genetic adaptations to local climate. Our results provide information that can be used to guide monitoring efforts and inform conservation planning for this keystone species.

AB  - The spatial and temporal aspects of the habitat suitability of the European souslik (Sper-mophilus citellus L.) in an area of Sredna Gora Mountain (Bulgaria) were studied. We used Landsat satellite imagery data to model changes in the habitat suitability of the species from 1985 to 2018. The obtained results demonstrate that the habitat suitability of the Eu-ropean souslik increased during the studied period, presumably due to raised tempera-tures and the accompanying drought during summertime, as well as the human-caused modifications in pasture livestock breeding. Based on statistical modelling, the employed procedure applies to long-term monitoring and assessment of the role of land cover change because of climate change and human activity on the habitat suitability of the European souslik. This approach can be useful for conservation planning.

AB  - Land-use change can strongly affect wildlife populations, typically via habitat loss and degradation where land use expands, and also via increasing potentially available habitat where land use ceases. Large mammals are particularly sensitive to land-use change, because they require large tracts of habitat and often depend on habitat outside protected areas unless protected areas are very large. Our research question was thus how land-use change around protected areas affects large mammals' habitat. Russia experienced drastic land-use change after the breakdown of the Soviet Union and - fortunately - wildlife data has been collected continuously throughout this time inside protected areas. We used long-term winter track count data for wild boar (Sus scrofa), moose (Alces alces), and wolf (Canis lupus) to assess habitat change inside and outside of Okslcy State Nature Reserve from 1987 to 2007 using a time-calibrated species distribution model. Our results showed a constantly high share (at least 89%) of suitable habitat within the protected area's core zone for each species, yet also substantial habitat increases of up to 23% within the protected buffer zone, and similarly, up to 27% outside the protected area. Of the variables we evaluated, post-Soviet land-use change, particularly farmland abandonment, was the main driver of this expansion of potential habitat for the three species we assessed. Our study highlights that strictly protected areas have been playing an important role in preserving wildlife in European Russia since 1991, and also that their surroundings provide much suitable habitat for large mammals.

AB  - Climate change is a driving force of changes to biodiversity worldwide and presents considerable management challenges for the resource-constrained environmental management sector. Effective management of biodiversity requires information about what species are present, how species respond to environmental conditions and which species are likely to be able to persist in the presence of ongoing change. Species distribution models are commonly used to predict future suitable habitat for particular species and areas of interest but a consistent nationwide approach is needed to understand how climate change will affect Australia's biodiversity. Here we describe a modelling approach that uses a consistent workflow and expert vetting to create current and future species distributions for 1872 terrestrial and freshwater vertebrate species. We used two emission scenarios, 18 General Circulation Models and seven time points into the future to explore how individual species distributions and taxa richness in Australia are predicted to change due to climate change. The maps are publicly available online and stakeholders can download them for post hoc analyses to assist in both regional and national management and protection of biodiversity assets and conservation planning for the future.

AB  - Designating protected areas remains a core strategy in biodiversity conservation. Despite high endemism, montane forests across the island of Java are under-represented in Indonesia's protected area network. Here, we document the montane biodiversity of Gunung Slamet, an isolated volcano in Central Java, and provide evidence to support its increased protection. During September-December 2018, we surveyed multiple sites for birds, primates, terrestrial mammals, reptiles, amphibians and vegetation. Survey methods included transects, camera traps and targeted searches at six sites, at altitudes of 970-2,512 m. We used species distribution models for birds and mammals of conservation concern to identify priority areas for protection. We recorded 99 bird species (13 globally threatened), 15 mammals (five globally threatened) and 17 reptiles and amphibians (two endemic). Our species distribution models showed considerable cross-taxon congruence between important areas on Slamet's upper slopes, generally above 1,800 m. Particularly important were records of the endemic subspecies of the Endangered Javan laughingthrush Garrulax rufifrons slamatensis, not recorded in the wild since 1925, the Endangered Javan gibbon Hylobates moloch and Javan surili Presbytis comata, and the Vulnerable Javan lutung Trachypithecus auratus and Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas. Recent forest loss has been modest, at least 280 km(2) of continuous forest remain above 800 m, and our surveys show that forest habitats are in good condition. However, the mountain is widely used by trappers and hunters. Given its importance for biodiversity conservation, we discuss different options for improving the protection status of Gunung Slamet, including designation as a National Park or Essential Ecosystem.

AB  - In a perfect world, systematic conservation planning would use complete information on the distribution of biodiversity. However, information on most species is grossly incomplete. Two main types of distribution data are frequently used in conservation planning: observed and predicted distribution data. A fundamental question that planners face is - which kind of data is better under what circumstances? We used simulation procedures to analyse the effects of using different types of distribution data on the performance of reserve selection algorithms in scenarios using different reserve selection problems, amounts of species distribution known. conservation targets and costs. To compare these scenarios we used occurrence data from 25 amphibian and 41 reptile species of the Iberian Peninsula and assumed the available data represented the whole truth. We then sampled fractions of these data and either used them as they were, or converted them to modelled predicted distributions. This enabled us to build three other types of species distribution data sets commonly used in conservation planning: "predicted", "transformed predicted" and "mixed". Our results suggest that reserve selection performance is sensitive to the type of species distribution data used and that the most cost-efficient decision depends most on the reserve selection problem and on how much we have of the species distribution data. Choosing the most appropriate type of distribution data should start by evaluating the scenario circumstances. While there is no one best approach for every scenario, we discovered that using a mixed approach usually provides an acceptable compromise between species representation and cost.

AB  - Extending assessments of climate change-induced range shifts via correlative species distribution models by including species traits is crucial for conservation planning. However, comprehensive assessments of future distribution scenarios incorporating responses of biotic factors are poorly investigated. Therefore, the aim of our study was to extend the understanding about the combined usage of species traits data and species distribution models for different life stages and distribution scenarios. We combine global model predictions for the 2050s and thermal performances of Salmo trutta and Salmo salar under consideration of different life stages (adults, juveniles, eggs), timeframes (monthly, seasonally, yearly), and dispersal scenarios (no dispersal, free dispersal, restricted dispersal). We demonstrate that thermal performances of different life stages will either increase or decrease for certain time periods. Model predictions and thermal performances imply range declines and poleward shifts. Dispersal to suitable habitats will be an important factor mitigating warming effects; however, dams may block paths to areas linked to high performances. Our results emphasize enhanced inclusion of critical periods for species and proper dispersal solutions in conservation planning.

AB  - Climate change and habitat degradation are recognized as serious threats for wildlife and an important aspects to be considered in conservation biology. However, little is known about how such environmental changes might impact crocodylians inhabiting the Neotropics and the effectiveness of Protected Areas (PAs) for long-term species conservation. To fill this gap, we used the Yacare Caiman (Caiman yacare) as a model to explore how climate change and habitat degradation might affect its distribution by 2050 and the effectiveness of current PAs for species conservation in response to future environmental changes. To this end, we estimated C. yacare suitable habitat using an ensemble modeling and consensus approach and assessed the species distribution variation inside and outside PAs as a consequence of two greenhouse emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways [RCPs] 4.5 and 8.5), and three General Circulation Models (GCMs; ACCESS1-0, CANESM2, and MRI-CGCM3) for 2050. We estimated the current suitable habitat for C. yacare to be 854,494 km(2) divided across five countries: Brazil (396,476 km(2)), Bolivia (377,853 km(2)), Paraguay (38,288 km(2)), Argentina (35,423 km(2)), and Peru (6,451 km(2)). Of these countries, Peru is the only one that can be considered "potential" because the species has not been registered there yet. We found that currently only 26.8% (228,835 km(2)) of C. yacare suitable habitat is under any type of protection of the IUCN Protected Area Categories System, which is currently well preserved from habitat degradation with only 1.9% reduced due to deforestation. We predicted that on average 56.2% of the current species range might be lost because of climate change and habitat degradation and only 14.7% of its suitable range could be preserved based on the current PAs system. Based on our assessment, we showed that future climate change scenarios and habitat degradation processes will require the establishment of additional PAs as well as the implementation of sustainable management strategies emphasizing corridors and suitable habitat linkages. These integrative approaches can be implemented in several ecoregions including the Pantanal flooded savannas, Cerrado woodlands and savannas, Beni savanna, Chiquitano dry forests, and Amazon moist forests, which we predict will be relatively well-preserved under most of the future climate change scenarios and constituting as priority regions for the long-term conservation of the species and tropical biodiversity.

AB  - The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove ecosystem in the world, is under threat from historical and future human exploitation and sea level rise. Limited scientific knowledge on the spatial ecology of the mangroves in this world heritage ecosystem has been a major impediment to conservation efforts. Here, for the first time, we report on habitat suitability analyses and spatial density maps for the four most prominent mangrove species - Heritiera fomes, Excoecaria agallocha, Ceriops decandra and Xylocarpus mekongensis. Globally endangered H. fomes abundances declined as salinity increased. Responses to nutrients, elevation, and stem density varied between species. H. fomes and X. mekongensis preferred upstream habitats. E. agallocha and C. decandra preferred down-stream and mid-stream habitats. Historical harvesting had negative influences on H. fomes, C. decandra and X. mekongensis abundances. The established protected area network does not support the most suitable habitats of these threatened species. We therefore recommend a reconfiguration of the network to include these suitable habitats and ensure their immediate protection. These novel habitat insights and spatial predictions can form the basis for future forest studies and spatial conservation planning, and have implications for more effective conservation of the Sundarbans mangroves and the many other species that rely on them.

AB  - AimEcological niche modelling is one of the main tools that allows for the incorporation of climate change effects into conservation planning. For example, ecological niche model predictions can be used to rank species by degree of predicted future habitat loss. While many studies have considered how different modelling decisions contribute to uncertainty in niche model outputs, here we evaluate how metrics used to rank species by conservation risk respond to the choice of global climate models, greenhouse gas emission scenarios, suitable versus unsuitable threshold values, and the degree of model complexity.
   LocationCalifornia, USA.
   MethodsWe built ecological niche models for 153 species of reptiles and amphibians. Reduced complexity models were compared to default complexity models using AICc to select climate variables and tune Maxent' s built-in regularization parameter. We predicted the distribution of climatically suitable habitat under future (2041-2060) climate conditions according to 11 global climate models, four representative concentration pathways, and three threshold values. Two metrics to rank species by predicted future loss of climatically suitable habitat were calculated for each set of modelling decisions. To determine the effects of modelling decisions on rankings, we used mixed models.
   ResultsOur results indicate that while individual modelling decisions had relatively small effects on species ranks alone, in combination, they lead to very different conservation assessments.
   Main conclusionsWe recommend that a wide range of modelling decisions be explored and that variation in ranks across runs be reported as a first step in identifying the uncertainty in rank metrics used for assessing conservation risk under changing, but uncertain climate predictions.

AB  - Background: The knowledge of both potential distribution and habitat suitability is fundamental in spreading species to inform in advance management and conservation planning. After a severe decline in the past decades, the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) is now spreading its breeding range towards the northwest in Spain and Europe. Because of its key ecological function, anticipated spatial knowledge is required to inform appropriately both vulture and ecosystem management.
   Methodology/Findings: Here we used maximum entropy (Maxent) models to determine the habitat suitability of potential and current breeding distribution of the griffon vulture using presence-only data (N = 124 colonies) in north-western Spain. The most relevant ecological factors shaping this habitat suitability were also identified. The resulting model had a high predictive performance and was able to predict species' historical distribution. 7.5% (similar to 1,850 km(2)) of the study area resulted to be suitable breeding habitat, most of which (similar to 70%) is already occupied by the species. Cliff availability and livestock density, especially of sheep and goats, around 10 km of the colonies were the fundamental factors determining breeding habitat suitability for this species.
   Conclusions/Significance: Griffon vultures could still spread 50-60 km towards the west, increasing their breeding range in 1,782 km(2). According to our results, 7.22% of the area suitable for griffon vulture will be affected by wind farms, so our results could help to better plan wind farm locations. The approach here developed could be useful to inform management of reintroductions and recovery programmes currently being implemented for both the griffon vulture and other threatened vulture species.

AB  - Biodiversity and ecosystem services are two main focuses in conservation planning. Considering both biodiversity and ecosystem services is beneficial when designing protected area networks. We demonstrated the relationship between these two concepts using the giant panda in China as a case study. We assessed the spatial relationship between giant panda habitat suitability and three key ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, water retention, and soil retention. We conducted spatial correlation and then used MARXAN to propose areas to target for new protected areas in the future that consider both goals. Results showed that the habitat suitability was positively correlated with ecosystem services in the entire study area. Panda habitats covered 77.7%, 72.0%, and 66.6% of carbon sequestration, water retention, and soil retention supplies, respectively. However, in nature reserves, which encompassed 31.0% of the whole study area and contained 33.6% of panda habitat, there was only 26.1-29.7% coverage of all ecosystem services. This result implied that nature reserves represented panda habitats well but did not adequately represent the three key ecosystem services. We identified conservation priority areas combining both panda habitat and ecosystem services and then proposed new protected areas. Our results inform conservation policies such as giant panda national park planning in this region. Our study also has implications for the role of protected area systems in the conservation of both flagship species and key ecosystem services in other places.

AB  - Aim The management and restoration of ecological processes mediated by biotic interactions is now broadly advocated and may be achieved by targeting restoration towards key agents. Although theoretically examined, a practical approach to incorporating the physiology and energetics of insects into restoration planning is poorly articulated. I aimed to provide a case study using the thermal biology and energetics of beetles to identify the distribution of habitat suitability in a large restoration landscape. Location South-west Western Australia. Methods I modelled the thermal performance of metabolic rates of thirteenPhyllococerus purpurascens,and twentyColpochila"species 2," measured repeatedly at seven temperatures between five and 40 degrees C using flow-through respirometry. Thermal constraints were used to inform a species distribution model of each species at extremely high spatiotemporal resolution, projecting the physiological state of each species for every hour at 5 '' resolution across a 152-km(2)restoration landscape in south-western Australia to estimate the habitat suitability for beetles. Results Both species' metabolic rates increased exponentially to a critical point, followed by rapid decline, but the thermal tolerance thresholds were different for each species. Both had strikingly high-thermal tolerance relative to their nocturnal habits and local climatic conditions. The models of beetle prevalence estimated both species to be active and able to access the entire project area for all of the austral spring, summer and autumn. Main conclusions The results reported here suggest ubiquitous habitat suitability for flower beetles in disturbed landscapes. Incorporation of similar mechanistic models for other species at high resolution offers potential insight into habitat suitability for a broad range of ectotherms.

AB  - Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) have become an essential tool in conservation and restoration planning. Given the current threats to freshwater biodiversity, it is of fundamental importance to address scale effects on the performance of niche-based SDMs of freshwater species' distributions. The scale effects are addressed here in the context of hierarchical catchment ordering, considered as counterpart to coarsening grain-size by increasing grid-cell size. We combine fish occurrence data from the Danube River Basin, the hierarchical catchment ordering and multiple environmental factors representing topographic, climatic and anthropogenic effects to model fish occurrence probability across multiple scales. We focus on 1st to 5th order catchments. The spatial scale (hierarchical catchment order) only marginally influences the mean performance of SDMs, however the uncertainty of the estimates increases with scale. Key predictors and their relative importance are scale and species dependent. Our findings have useful implications for choosing proper species dependent spatial scales for river rehabilitation measures, and for conservation planning in areas where fine grain species data are unavailable.

AB  - Baobab species are representative of the high biodiversity and endemism rates that place Madagascar in the top three of the countries with the highest biodiversity in the world. In this study, we estimated the vulnerability of three endangered Malagasy baobab species (Adansonia grandidieri Baill., Adansonia perrieri Capuron and Adansonia suarezensis H. Perrier) to climate change and the effectiveness of the protected area network (PAN) for the future conservation of these species. To estimate the environmental niche of the species, we used an original data-set based on satellite image analysis to detect species presence and an ensemble modelling approach using three species distribution models (GLM, GAM and MaxEnt). We projected the species distribution in 2050 and 2080 using an ensemble forecasting approach combining the three species distribution models and three global circulation models for climate projections. Measures of connectivity were employed to assess the present and future effectiveness of the existing PAN. Among the three baobab species studied, two are severely threatened by climate change (A. perrieri and A. suarezensis), in part because the present PAN does not overlap with future species distribution areas. Recently, strong efforts have been made in designing an optimised PAN to conserve Madagascar outstanding biodiversity. Nevertheless, its future effectiveness is questioned by the potential shifts in species distributions due to predicted changes in climate. In the context of climate change, alternative strategies such as ecological restoration would also have to be adopted to conserve biodiversity in Madagascar. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Biodiversity loss and habitat degradation are big challenges to be tackled by conservation planning since their effects on both ecological and social-economic systems are remarkably detrimental. Efforts to limit anthropogenic impacts on species and habitats need to be assisted by tools for biodiversity monitoring. Effective monitoring tools could help bridge the gap between science and policy, better assess trade-offs between biodiversity and other services, and potentially reduce the associated social costs of conservation. Here, we assessed the feasibility of monitoring habitat quality for bird communities in Central Italy using the InVEST Habitat Quality model. InVEST was parameterized using outputs from species distribution models (SDMs) and expert-based models to explore their viability to support conservation planning. Our results highlight that InVEST parameterized by SDMs produced habitat quality maps that correlated highly with spatial patterns of observed species richness, while the expert-derived InVEST outcomes showed lower correlation. However, the latter approach proved useful as a first-line analysis to identify large-scale areas of conservation concern, where field data and modeling approaches such as SDMs are needed to assess fine-scale conservation value. We show SDM-informed habitat quality maps can accurately identify conservation priority areas, though their applicability is overall limited by data availability. On the other hand, expert-based habitat quality maps can be used as a surrogate approach for preliminary and/or exploratory studies, especially in contexts characterized by poor data availability/quality and budgetary constraints.

AB  - Applicability of modeling tools to tackle conservation problems is key for conservation planning. However, modeling papers regarding real-world conservation issues are scarce. Here, we combined two modeling tools to identify priority areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, focusing on the last large-bodied frugivorous bird in the region, the red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii). We used population viability analysis (PVA) to determine (1) the minimum viable population size under different hunting scenarios; and (2) the minimum critical forest patch size required to maintain viable populations. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to identify remnants that retain suitable environmental conditions to ensure the long-term persistence of this species. We overlapped the outputs from PVA and ENM models to identify priority areas for curassows. Under our best-case scenario, 56 individuals would suffice to maintain a viable population and 71 forest patches located within the species' known range are above the critical size of 3141 ha. In the worst-case scenario, at least 138 individuals would be required to maintain a viable population in forest patches larger than 9500 ha, corresponding to only 20 Atlantic Forest fragments within the species range. Among these, 17 presented median habitat suitability values higher than 0.70, eight of which were selected as priority areas for law enforcement and nine as priority areas for reintroduction. We encourage conservation biologists and land managers to combine modeling tools which can be guided by our conservation planning framework. This approach is promising to inform long-term conservation planning of a flagship species and its entire ecosystem. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conservation in Europe (including the establishment of protected areas) is undertaken mainly through legislation and on densely populated private land. Consequently, conflicts of interest arise between human economic activities and biodiversity conservation. We used a systematic approach to conservation planning to explore different conservation scenarios for the Apennine populations of wolves (Canis lupus) and bears (Ursus arctos marsicanus) in Italy. The conservation measures we considered were electrified fences and guard dogs to prevent wolves and bears from preying on sheep. We used habitat suitability models of the two species as an estimate of their distributions. Across the study area, we estimated the potential intensity of conflict caused by predation on sheep and the cost of the antipredator measures. We examined scenarios for the conservation of wolves and bears that identified systems of sites where antipredator measures should be applied to either minimize the economic cost of the plan or tackle a predetermined amount of conflict. The overall cost of the conservation plans ranged between (sic)1,486,000 and (sic)16,876,000, depending on the scenario and on the size of the conservation target. Because potential conflict intensity (i.e., potential predation) and cost of conflict resolution were correlated, the scenarios that minimized cost also minimized the amount of conflict that was addressed. Conserving these two species by addressing their predation on sheep was up to 4.36 times more expensive than conserving them by providing suitable habitat in areas of low conflict. Yet avoiding conflicts is not always desirable because it can drastically reduce the options for conservation. Choosing a conservation plan requires consideration of the level of threat to the target species and their sensitivity to conflicts.

AB  - Modelling tree habitat suitability (HS) is a common practice to assess tree species distribution across a broad range of spatial scales. However, it is seldom used to test the extent that modelled HS-scores (probability of species occurrence) can represent on-the-ground measures of species-structural characteristics. In this study, we compare four parametric and non-parametric models generated with the R-package, sdm, to assess the potential for these models to estimate tree species distribution of balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] in naturally-growing forests across an extensive landscape. Central to this development are inventory plot data of species presence-absence and four abiotic factors linked to plant growth and distribution. The study's abiotic factors include: (1) photosynthetically active radiation; (2) growing degree-days; (3) relative extractable soil water content; and (4) near-surface wind speed, all expressed spatially at 30-m resolution. To gauge whether modelled HS can explain structural characteristics in balsam fir-dominated stands, field-based estimates of site index (SI) and cumulative aboveground biomass (ABG) were compared against independently-derived HS-scores. The results showed that: (i) random forest was the most successful at representing species distribution of balsam fir among the four methods considered; (ii) overall growing conditions for balsam fir was observed to be most favourable on north-facing slopes, particularly in the northwest part of the target landscape, where near-surface air temperatures are cooler, soils are moderately wetter, and wind speeds are lower; (iii) tree-based calculations of SI were partially characterised by patterns in modelled HS-scores, due to scale differences (i.e., from individual tree to 30-m grid cells) and an inadequate number of sample trees; and (iv) patterns of cumulative AGB were more accurately represented by species HS. Modelled HS-scores, as potential indicators of tree species habitat preference, AGB, and species distribution, can offer key ecological information essential to inform forest management and conservation planning at the landscape level.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) offer great potential for inclusion into the toolbox of today's marine environmental manager, especially with regard to marine conservation and planning. The application of SDMs in the marine environment over recent years has been varied but there are still relatively few examples in comparison with terrestrial application, and this is especially true in deep-sea marine ecosystems. This short article builds upon two recent review articles concerning the application of species distribution modelling studies in the marine realm, offering additional practical considerations for discussion. Recommendations for progressing the improved application of SDMs to support marine conservation planning are given, including combining model outputs with other data layers, metadata standards and model error. SDMs have both an urgent and long term contribution to make to marine conservation planning globally, and it is hoped that this article, in combination with developing research on marine SDMs, will contribute to some much needed discussion and inform best practice and new research to enable these models to be of greater use to marine managers.

AB  - The impact of climate change on Malagasy amphibians remains poorly understood. Equally, deforestation, fragmentation, and lack of connectivity between forest patches may leave vulnerable species isolated in habitat that no longer suits their environmental or biological requirements. We assess the predicted impact of climate change by 2085 on the potential distribution of a Critically Endangered frog species, the golden mantella (Mantella aurantiaca), that is confined to a small area of the central rainforest of Madagascar. We identify potential population distributions and climatically stable areas. Results suggest a potential south-eastwardly shift away from the current range and a decrease in suitable habitat from 2110 km(2) under current climate to between 112 km(2) - 138 km(2) by the year 2085 - less than 7 % of currently available suitable habitat. Results also indicate that the amount of golden mantella habitat falling within protected areas decreases by 86 % over the same period. We recommend research to ascertain future viability and the feasibility of expanding protection to newly identified potential sites. This information can then be used in future conservation actions such as habitat restoration, translocations, re-introductions or the siting of further wildlife corridors or protected areas.

AB  - Identifying waterfowl habitat suitability under changing environments, especially land-use change, is crucial to make waterfowl habitat conservation planning. We took Wetland Nature Reserve of Liaohe Estuary, the largest breeding area of Saunders's Gulls (Larus saundersi) in the world, as our study area, generated land-use-type maps through interpretation of satellite images from four different years (1988, 2000, 2009, 2017), and predicted the potential breeding habitat of Saunders's Gulls by MaxEnt model based on the land-use map, along with other environmental variables (NDVI, distance to roads and artificial facilities, distance to rivers and water bodies, DEM and distance to shoreline) for the four years, respectively. The models were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). We analyzed the changes of the breeding habitat from 1988 to 2017 and utilized RDA to explore the relationships among the changes of suitable habitat of Larus saundersi and the dynamics of land uses. Our results showed that the most suitable habitat decreased by 1286.46 ha during 1988-2009 and increased by 363.51 ha from 2009 to 2017. The suitable habitat decreased by 582.48 ha from 1988 to 2009 and then increased to 1848.96 ha in 2017, while the unsuitable habitat increased by 2793.87 ha during 1988-2009 and then decreased by 178.83 ha from 2009 to 2017. We also found that land use, distance to the coastline, distance to artificial facilities, distance to rivers, distance to roads, and NDVI had certain degrees of impact on the Larus saundersi distribution. The contribution of land use ranged from 16.4% to 40.3%, distance to coastline from 34.7% to 48.0%, distance to artificial facilities from 5.9% to 11.1%, distance to rivers from 5.5% to 11.0%, distance to roads from 3.9% to 12.5%, and NDVI from 0.3% to 6.3%. The change in suitable habitat of Larus saundersi has a positive relationship with the change of seepweed marsh. Human-induced changes in seepweed marsh and coastline position are the main factors influencing the potential breeding habitat of Saunders's Gulls. We suggest strict conservation of seepweed marsh and implementation of habitat management practices to better protect Saunders' Gull's breeding habitat.

AB  - Anthropogenic threats drive species to extinction and are the focus of extinction risk analyses and conservation planning. Threats are often quantified through higher level proxies, such as the human footprint (HF). We tested the effects that multiple methods of representing species' distribution and different quantifications of a HF map have on threat measurement, and how these influence conservation decisions. We quantified the magnitude of HF for 901 Southeast Asian mammals according to several methods. We ranked the species according to the measured HF value, and produced priority lists of top-impacted species. The different representations of species' distribution caused significant disagreement in HF calculations. HF values were on average lower when calculated in species' suitable habitat or occurrence points in comparison to the whole geographic range. Biases were non-linear and dependent on distal factors, such as the proportion of suitable habitat within species' range and species' habitat specialism. Using different HF quantifications also yielded disagreement, with 2-56% difference observed in species membership among priority lists. Threatened species were best predicted, and significantly placed in the top-ranking, when measuring their proportion of range exposed to high levels of HF. We thus show that the HF extent, not only its average value, determines species extinction risk. A well-framed global conservation strategy must address the quantification of human impact on biodiversity. The selection of quantification methods has implications for how such impact is evaluated. Improving techniques to quantify biodiversity threats will enhance the effectiveness of extinction risk analyses and conservation decisions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between the geographical distribution of taxa and their environmental conditions is a key concept in ecology and conservation. The use of ensemble modelling methods for species distribution modelling (SDM) have been promoted over single algorithms such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). Nevertheless, we suggest that in cases where data, technical support or computational power are limited, for example in developing countries, single algorithm methods produce robust and accurate distribution maps. We fit SDMs for 114 Egyptian medicinal plant species (nearly all native) with a total of 14,396 occurrence points. The predictive performances of eight single-algorithm methods (maxent, random forest (rf), support-vector machine (svm), maxlike, boosted regression trees (brt), classification and regression trees (cart), flexible discriminant analysis (fda) and generalised linear models (glm)) were compared to an ensemble modelling approach combining all eight algorithms. Predictions were based originally on the current climate, and then projected into the future time slice of 2050 based on four alternate climate change scenarios (A2a and B2a for CMIP3 and RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for CMIP5). Ensemble modelling, MaxEnt and rf achieved the highest predictive performances based on AUC and TSS, while svm and cart had the poorest performance. There is high similarity in habitat suitability between MaxEnt and ensemble predictive maps for both current and future emission scenarios, but lower similarity between rf and ensemble, or rf and MaxEnt. We conclude that single-algorithm modelling methods, particularly MaxEnt, are capable of producing distribution maps of comparable accuracy to ensemble methods. Furthermore, the ease of use, reduced computational time and simplicity of methods like MaxEnt provides support for their use in scenarios when the choice of modelling methods, knowledge or computational power is limited but the need for robust and accurate conservation predictions is urgent.

AB  - Although spatial scale is important for understanding ecological processes and guiding conservation planning, studies combining a range of scales are rare. Habitat suitability modelling has been used traditionally to study broad-scale patterns of species distribution but can also be applied to address conservation needs at finer scales. We studied the ability of presence-only species distribution modelling to predict patterns of habitat selection at broad and fine spatial scales for one of the rarest mammals in the UK, the grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus). Models were constructed with Maxent using broad-scale distribution data from across the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) and fine-scale radio-tracking data from bats at one colony. Fine-scale model predictions were evaluated with radio-tracking locations from bats from a distant colony, and compared with results of traditional radio-tracking data analysis methods (compositional analysis of habitat selection). Broad-scale models indicated that winter temperature, summer precipitation and land cover were the most important variables limiting the distribution of the grey long-eared bat in the UK. Fine-scale models predicted that proximity to unimproved grasslands and distance to suburban areas determine foraging habitat suitability around maternity colonies, while compositional analysis also identified unimproved grasslands as the most preferred foraging habitat type. This strong association with unimproved lowland grasslands highlights the potential importance of changes in agricultural practices in the past century for wildlife conservation. Hence, multi-scale models offer an important tool for identifying conservation requirements at the fine landscape level that can guide national-level conservation management practices.

AB  - Climate change and its effect on life is a big challenge for scientists all over the world. Global biodiversity has diminished in recent years because of climate change, human developments and some other factors. One reason for wildlife population loss is habitat degradation caused by climate change. Predicting habitat suitability can help wildlife managers to protect wildlife more effectively. Accordingly, in this study, we used present habitat suitability of five species of wild Bovidae in Iran to predict climate change effects on their habitats for a future condition over 62years. To predict this, four RCPs and one GCM in four CC scenarios were used. Our results revealed that climate variables are important to predict suitable habitats. This study showed that at present time suitable habitats for wild goat, Urial wild sheep, Armenian wild sheep, goitered gazelle and jebeer in Iran's total area are 5.5%, 5.8%, 5.9%, 4.9% and 5.2%, respectively. The results also reveal that in the future 59.83%, 60.89%, 59.18%, 53.57%, 69.86% of current suitable habitats will be lost for each species, respectively, over 62years. Based on the result of our study, it seems more than 60% of suitable habitat for the studied species will be destroyed over this time period. In our opinion, wildlife managers should consider the remaining suitable habitats as some parts of a protected area before the conditions get irreversible.

AB  - Distribution and connectivity of suitable habitat for species of conservation concern is critical for effective conservation planning. Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), an umbrella species for biodiversity conservation, is increasingly threatened because of habitat loss and fragmentation.
   We assessed the impact of drastic changes in forest management in the Carpathian Mountains, a major stronghold of capercaillie in Europe, on habitat distribution and connectivity.
   We used field data surveys with a forest disturbance dataset for 1985-2010 to map habitat suitability, and we used graph theory to analyse habitat connectivity.
   Climate, topography, forest proportion and fragmentation, and the distance to roads and settlements best identified capercaillie presence. Suitable habitat area was 7510 km(2) in 1985; by 2010, clear-cutting had reduced that area by 1110 km(2). More suitable habitat was lost inside protected areas (571 km(2)) than outside (413 km(2)). Habitat loss of 15 % reduced functional connectivity by 33 % since 1985.
   Forest management, particularly large-scale clear-cutting and salvage logging, have substantially diminished and fragmented suitable capercaillie habitat, regardless of the status of forest protection. Consequently, larger areas with suitable habitat are now isolated and many patches are too small to sustain viable populations. Given that protection of capercaillie habitat would benefit many other species, including old-growth specialists and large carnivores, conservation actions to halt the loss of capercaillie habitat is urgently needed. We recommend adopting policies to protect natural forests, limiting large-scale clear-cutting and salvage logging, implementing ecological forestry, and restricting road building to reduce forest fragmentation.

AB  - The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) lives in alpine ecosystems in Central Asia, where it could face intensive climate change and is thus a major conservation concern. We compiled a dataset of 406 GPS-located occurrences based on field surveys, literature, and the GBIF database. We used Random Forest to build different species distribution models with a maximum of 27 explanatory variables, including climatic, topographical, and human impact variables, to predict potential distribution for the snow leopard and make climate change projections. We estimated the potential range shifts of the snow leopard under two global climate models for different representative concentration pathways for 2050 and 2070. We found the distribution center of the snow leopard may move northwest by about 200 km and may move upward in elevation by about 100 m by 2070. Unlike previous studies on the range shifts of the snow leopard, we highlighted that upward rather than northward range shifts are the main pathways for the snow leopard in the changing climate, since the landform of their habitat allows an upward shift, whereas mountains and valleys would block northward movement. Conservation of the snow leopard should therefore prioritize protecting its current habitat over making movement corridors.

AB  - Aim Indigenous communities involved in conservation planning require spatial datasets depicting the distribution of culturally important species. However, accessing datasets on the location of these species can be challenging, particularly when the current distribution no longer reflects areas with the full range of suitable growing conditions because of past logging. We test whether using occurrence data from community-based field surveys and archaeological records in species distribution models can help predict the distribution of monumental western redcedar trees (Thuja plicata)-large, high-quality trees suitable for cultural purposes such as carving dug-out canoes, totem poles and traditional houses. This species is critically important to indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest of North America, but trees suitable for traditional carving and building are diminishing in abundance due to logging. Location Our analysis covers the spatial extent of the traditional territory of the Heiltsuk First Nation, which encompasses a portion of the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, Canada. Methods We built and compared species distribution models using the machine learning program, Maxent, based on occurrence data from field surveys and archaeological records of culturally modified trees. Results Our findings highlight similarities and differences between the predictions from these species distribution models. When validating these models against occurrences from an independent dataset, the archaeological record model performs better than the field survey model. These findings may arise because the independent dataset was collected on an unlogged island-an environment that aligns more closely with the historic forest conditions revealed by the archaeological records than the current distribution revealed by the field surveys. Main conclusions We demonstrate and discuss the utility of using archaeological data in species distribution modelling and conservation planning when the target species is associated with shifting environmental baselines, data limitations and an important cultural resource.

AB  - Many wader populations around the world are declining as a consequence of habitat degradation or loss. It is therefore important to identify species-specific habitat demands accurately and to define the important factors explaining species distribution, in order to develop tools that can be used in conservation planning. The aim of this study is to create reliable, functional and ecologically interpretable predictive distribution models for five breeding wader species.
   The archipelago of SW Finland in the Baltic Sea.
   We used multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to create single-species and multiresponse distribution models based on 525 study islands and 12 abiotic and biotic environmental variables. Model evaluation was carried out on independent data not used in model building (100 + 116 islands). The models were tested for discrimination with receiver-operating characteristic statistics and for calibration with Millers calibration statistics (MCS).
   The single-species models for the turnstone (Arenaria interpres), redshank (Tringa totanus) and oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) showed good predictive abilities, regarding both discrimination and calibration, when evaluated on independent data. The multiresponse models for the less prevalent species, common sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) and the common ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula) had better discriminative abilities than the single-species models. The most influential predictor overall was occurrence of small larids. Exposure, area of forest and low and flat areas were also important, as well as shore habitats.
   We found that the ability of MARS to fit non-linear and multiresponse models makes it a useful method to quantitatively relate species occurrence to environmental characteristics of a complex environment.

AB  - The archives of species range polygons developed under comprehensive assessments of the conservation status of species, such as the IUCN's Global Assessments, are a significant resource in the analysis of biodiversity for conservation planning. Species range polygons obtained from these studies are known to exhibit omissions (because of knowledge gaps) and imprecision in their boundaries. In this work, we present a method to refine those species range polygons in order to create more realistic representations of species geographic ranges. Using range polygons of four species of mammals in South America and environmental variables at a 1 km resolution, combined with a set of GIS algorithms, a procedure was developed to map the confidence that sub-polygon elements belong to a logical species range. The confidence map is then used as a weight for a Mahalanobis typicality empirical modelling procedure to generate a map of species-weighted typicalities that is then thresholded to generate the refined species range map. Methods for variable selection and quality assessment of the refined range are also included in the procedure. Analysis using independent validation data shows the power of this methodology to redefine species ranges in a more biophysically reasonable way. The quality of the final-range map depends on the habitat suitability threshold used to define the species range. The report of quality assessment produced is useful for identifying not only the threshold that produces the highest match to the original expert range but also for flagging those ranges with higher discrepancies, facilitating the identification of ranges that need further revision.

AB  - The article presents results of the brown bear habitat suitability and distribution modelling. conducted in the Central Forest Nature Reserve and its buffer zone (West-European Russia. Tver region) using the MaxEnt approach. The basic rules for performing such a study, approaches and modelling techniques were reviewed briefly. Vegetation indices, morphometric characteristics of the relief, proximity rasters and land cover types were used as predictors. The occurrence points of the studied species were recorded on permanent routes using a GPS navigator during 2008-2018. Eight models with different combinations of input data (occurrence points and environment parametres) were chosen as final set. We used two main modelling approaches. In the first approach, for modelling we used only occurrence points reflecting the relationships of the species with the habitat (feeding places mainly). On the basis of them, habitat suitability models were built. In the second approach, we used all occurrence points of the studied species. On the basis of them, distribution models were built. The set of brown bear occurrence points registered by forest rangers and researchers was used as an independent test data set. The scenarios of the influence of anthropogenic food sources (abandoned apple orchards and oat fields) were modelled separately. The obtained AUCtest values ranged from 0.61 to 0.73. The maximum TSStest was 0.50. The continuous Boyce index ranged from 0.63 to 0.99. The models correctly recognised from 68% to 82% of independent points. The predictor of anthropogenic food sources largely contributed to all models, where it was presented, and highly distorted the overall picture of suitability and distribution. In other cases, grasslands. NDVI, and young deciduous forests had the highest contribution. In the study area, brown bears preferred grasslands, concentrated on moraine-kama ridges, which provided them with food throughout the wakeful period, as well as forest glades, scarce forests, young deciduous and mixed forests with dense undergrowth and nemoral spruce forests. The study area of the partially disturbed buffer zone was more suitable for brown bears than the intact areas of the Protected Area (66-67% and 51% of suitable habitats, respectively). We identified main omissions in the applied method of occurrence point's registration. This could lead to incorrect estimates of the contribution of some predictors (underestimations of boreal spruce forests, raised bogs and floodplain meadows).

AB  - The Neotropical region currently harbors 8 recognized species of small cats, including the margay (Leopardus wiedii) and jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi). These similar-sized species have broad geographic distributions and commonly occur in sympatry. We constructed species occurrence databases and used the maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling approach to develop models of habitat suitability for each of these species. We identified the environmental predictors with the highest importance for species occurrence and evaluated how they influence habitat suitability for both wild cats. Variables related to temperature and precipitation were good predictors of species occurrence, with both cats responding similarly to them. However, margay showed higher variation in habitat suitability depending on local climatic predictors. The estimated models indicated high niche similarity (>76%) between these cats, but despite this we identified different areas with the most favorable conditions for each species' occurrence. Approximately 50% and 72% of the entire suitable area were estimated as being moderately to highly suitable for margay and jaguarundi, respectively, with the margay model comprising a higher proportion of forest environments in comparison to that of the jaguarundi. These findings will be relevant in the context of conservation planning when indicating the priority areas for their long-term preservation.

AB  - Several recent studies have investigated the use of the conservation planning software Marxan to design Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks in UK waters. The systematic conservation planning approach embodied by Marxan has a number of advantages, but these studies have highlighted the need for guidance and advice on best practice. Here, we discuss two broad topics that we feel should inform future developments in the UK and elsewhere in the European Union. First, several technical issues need to be addressed to ensure the scientific defensibility of any conservation planning project. These include identifying which conservation features should be represented in an MPA system, developing a system for setting representation targets, and identifying which data should be included to minimize conflict with human uses of the sea. Second, it is necessary for researchers to engage at an early stage with those responsible for implementation and recognize that reserve selection should be part of a broader conservation planning process centred on a stakeholder-developed implementation strategy. A more-inclusive approach will make use of technical outputs, such as those generated by Marxan, as part of the process of policy development.

AB  - Background: Determining the distribution of species and of suitable habitats is a fundamental part of conservation planning. We used slope and ruggedness of the terrain, forest type and distance to the nearest village to construct habitat suitability maps for three mountain ungulates (barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), Himalayan goral (Naemorhedus goral) and Himalayan serow (Capricornis thar)) in the midhills of western Nepal. We used locations of sightings and signs of presence of these mountain ungulates collected during surveys along transect to derive a suitability value for each variable using Jacob's index. A multiplication approach was used to combine environmental variables and produce a habitat suitability map for each of the three species. An independent dataset was used to evaluate the maps using Boyce's index. This approach provides an overview of the probable distributions of the species in question.
   Results: We predict that of the total area studied, 57% is suitable for M. muntjak, 67% for N. goral and 41% for C. thar. Although there are suitable habitats for all three species throughout the study area, the availability of high-quality habitats for these species varied considerably.
   Conclusions: Suitable habitats for N. goral and C. thar were fragmented and mostly confined to the southern and northern parts of the study area. This study provides important baseline information for conservation biologists concerned with maintaining biodiversity in the midhills of Nepal.

AB  - A central tenet of landscape conservation planning is that natural communities can be supported by a connected landscape network that supports many species and habitat types. However, as the planning environment, ecological conditions, and risks and stressors change over time, the areas needed to support landscape connectivity may also shift. We demonstrate an approach designed to assess functional and structural connectivity of an established protected area network that has experienced landscape and planning changes over time. Here we present an approach designed to inform adaptive planning for connectivity with a complementary suite of analytical techniques. Using existing occurrence, movement, and genetic data for six focal species, we create a spatially explicit connectivity assessment based on landscape resistance, paired with a landscape feature geodiversity analysis. Although factors such as cost, conservation goals, and land management strategies must be taken into account, this approach provides a template for leveraging available empirical data and robust analyses to evaluate and adapt planning for protected area networks that can preserve and promote both functional and structural connectivity in dynamic landscapes.

AB  - After the dramatic eutrophication-induced decline of intertidal seagrasses in the 1970s, the Wadden Sea has shown diverging developments. In the northern Wadden Sea, seagrass beds have expanded and become denser, while in the southern Wadden Sea, only small beds with low shoot densities are found. A lack of documentation of historical distributions hampers conservation management. Yet, the recovery in the northern Wadden Sea provides opportunity to construct robust habitat suitability models to support management. We tuned habitat distribution models based on 17years of seagrass surveys in the northern Wadden Sea and high-resolution hydrodynamics and geomorphology for the entire Wadden Sea using five machine learning approaches. To obtain geographically transferable models, hyperparameters were tuned on the basis of prediction accuracy assessed by non-random, spatial cross-validation. The spatial cross-validation methodology was combined with a consensus modelling approach. The predicted suitability scores correlated amongst each other and with the hold-out observations in the training area indicating that the models converged and were transferable across space. Prediction accuracy was improved by averaging the predictions of the best models. We graphically examined the relationship between the consensus suitability score and independent presence-only data from outside the training area using the area-adjusted seagrass frequency per suitability class (continuous Boyce index). The Boyce index was positively correlated with the suitability score indicating the adequacy of the prediction methodology. We used the plot of the continuous Boyce index against habitat suitability score to demarcate three habitat classes - unsuitable, marginal and suitable - for the entire international Wadden Sea. This information is valuable for habitat conservation and restoration management. Divergence between predicted suitability and actual distributions from the recent past indicates that unaccounted factors limit seagrass development in the southern Wadden Sea.Synthesis and applications. Our methodology and data enabled us to produce a robust and validated consensus habitat suitability model. We identified highly suitable areas where intertidal seagrass meadows may establish and persist. Our work provides scientific underpinning for effective conservation planning in a dynamic landscape and sets monitoring priorities.

AB  - 1. Natura 2000 network (N2000) and national protected areas (NPAs) are recognised as the most important core units' for biological conservation in Europe. 2. Species distribution models (SDMs) were developed to detect the potential distribution of the rare and threatened cerambycid beetle Rosalia alpinaL. in Europe, and the amount of suitable habitat within the N2000 network [special areas of conservation (SACs) and special protection areas (SPAs)], NPAs (e.g. national parks, regional parks, state reserves, natural monuments and protected landscapes) and the overall European protected area network (EPAN) (N2000+NPAs) was quantified. 3. According to this analysis, the suitable habitat for R. alpina in Europe amounts to c.754171km(2) and stretches across substantially uninterrupted areas from Portugal to Romania (west to east) and from Greece to Germany (south to north). The overlay between the existing system of conservation areas in Europe (N2000 and NPAs) and the binary map for R. alpina showed that only c. 42% of potential habitat is protected. SACs and SPAs protect c. 25% and 21% of potential habitat, respectively. However, because the two site types often spatially overlap, when taken together the entire N2000 network protects c. 31% of potential habitat. Instead, NPAs offer a degree of protection of c.29%. Overall, almost 60% of the area potentially suitable for the species is unprotected by the EPAN, an aspect that should be considered carefully when planning the conservation of this beetle at a large scale. 4. These results may also help to focus field surveys in selected areas where greater chances of success are encountered to save resources and increase survey effectiveness.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are the primary tools currently available for assessing vulnerability to climatic change. Most past projections of the effects of climate change on species distribution have ignored biological interactions. We evaluated to what degree incorporating prey availability into climatic-based SDMs would change the predicted future distribution of the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) and the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor). We projected climate niches using (1) only the climatic variables; (2) both climatic and prey availability data. When we based inferences on models that did not account for prey availability, we predicted that the range of the Asiatic cheetah would contract by 42% between current and future under a low-emissions scenario, whereas the range of the Persian leopard would expand by 9%. Adding the effects of prey availability into the model did not affect predictions for the Asiatic cheetah (41% range contraction), but did alter predictions for the Persian leopard, whose range was expected to contract by 25%. Persian leopards are predicted to be less affected by climate change when the analysis considers climatic variables only, but when models are integrated with the prey data, large habitat losses are predicted. Our results show that there can be complex and large interactions between climate change and other limiting ecological resources which must be accounted for in SDMs. It is therefore important to integrate biotic interactions and the temporal dynamics of species distribution induced by climate change into conservation planning to optimally plan the spatial distribution of conservation areas.

AB  - The Philippines is a global biodiversity hotspot, with a large number of threatened bird species, one of which is the 'Critically Endangered' Negros Bleeding-heart Gallicolumba keayi. The aim of this study was to investigate the habitat preference of the Negros Bleeding-heart and undertake species distribution modelling to locate areas of conservation importance based on identified suitable habitat. A survey of 94 point-counts was undertaken and eight camera traps were deployed from May to August 2018 in the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park, Panay, Philippines. Habitat variables (canopy cover, understorey cover, ground cover, elevation, presence of rattan Calamus or Daemonorops spp. and pandan Pandanus sp., tree diameter at breast height, and branching architecture were measured in 5 m-radius quadrats. To identify areas of potentially suitable habitat for the Negros Bleeding-heart, species distribution was modelled in MaxEnt using tree cover and elevation data on Panay and Negros. Using a Generalised Linear Model, Negros Bleeding-heart presence was found to be significantly positively associated with dense understorey cover and dense canopy cover. Species distribution modelling showed that the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park is currently the most suitably located protected area for Negros Bleeding-heart conservation, while protected areas in Negros require further law enforcement. It is imperative that protection is continued in the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park, and more survey effort is needed to identify other critical Negros Bleeding-heart populations, around which deforestation and hunting ban enforcement is strongly recommended.

AB  - Mountain ungulates around the world have been decimated to small, fragmented populations. Restoring these species often is limited by inadequate information on where suitable habitat is found, and which restoration measures would help to increase and link existing populations. We developed an approach to spatially target threat-specific restoration actions and demonstrate it for bezoar goats (Capra aegagrus) in the Caucasus. Using a large occurrence dataset, we identified suitable habitat patches and evaluate them in terms of connectivity, protection status, and competition with other mountain ungulates. We found extant bezoar goat populations to be highly isolated, yet with widespread areas of suitable, unoccupied habitat between them. Many unoccupied habitat patches were well-connected to extant populations, were at least partly protected, and have low potential for competition with otherCapraspecies. This signals substantial pressure on bezoar goats, likely due to poaching, which currently prevents natural recolonization. Our study shows how restoration planning is possible in the face of multiple threats and scarce data. For bezoar goats in the Caucasus, we pinpoint priority patches for specific restoration measures, including reintroductions and anti-poaching action. We highlight that many patches would benefit from multiple interventions and that transboundary restoration planning is needed, a situation likely similar for many mountain ungulates around the world.

AB  - Methods for habitat modeling based on landscape simulations and population viability modeling based on habitat quality are well developed, but no published study of which we are aware has effectively joined them in a single, comprehensive analysis. We demonstrate the application of a population viability model for ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) that is linked to realistic landscape simulations using a GIS-based habitat suitability index (HSI) model. We simulated potential future characteristics of a hardwood forest in southern Missouri under two tree harvest scenarios using LANDIS. We applied three different versions of the HSI model (lower, best, and upper estimates) to output from the landscape simulations and used RAMAS GIS to link estimates of temporally dynamic habitat suitability, through fecundity and carrying capacity, to ovenbird population viability. Abundances and viability differed more between the upper and lower HSI estimates than between the two forest management scenarios. The viability model was as sensitive to the relationship between reproductive success and habitat suitability as it was to rates of first-year survival and reproductive success itself. Habitat-based viability models and the wildlife studies they support, therefore, would benefit greatly from improving the accuracy and precision of habitat suitability estimates.
   Combining landscape, habitat, and viability models in a single analysis provides benefits beyond those of the individual modeling stages. A comprehensive modeling approach encompasses all components and processes of interest, allows direct comparison of the relative levels of uncertainty in each stage of modeling, and allows analysis of the economic benefits and costs of different land use plans, which may be affected by landscape management, habitat manipulation, and wildlife conservation efforts. Using population viability, habitat suitability, and landscape simulation models in an integrated analysis for conservation planning is an important advancement because habitat quality is a critical link between human land use decisions and wildlife population viability.

AB  - Predicting species' suitable habitats is critical to biodiversity conservation planning and implementation. Species habitat distribution is closely linked to environmental and bioclimatic variables which are widely used for estimating habitat suitability (HS) from species distribution models (SDMs). Integration of environmental parameters derived from satellite remote sensing, bioclimatic variables, and edaphic properties has created an advanced way to improve the SDM performance. The objective of this study is to assess the performance for predicting the potential HS of the arid plant species using Maximum Entropy (MaxENT) species distribution model based on an ecological niche machine-learning algorithm. Prosopis cineraria (Ghaf) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was selected for the model simulation. The Ghaf tree is a keystone species to prevent desertification and improve soil fertility in arid environments. We have selected 33 environmental parameters, including satellite remote sensing data (MODIS NDVI, LST, and PET), WorldClim bioclimate variables and static edaphic properties (topography, elevation, soil quality) along with 100 field observations. Collinearity within the bioclimatic variables was eliminated using Pearson correlation. The variables with zero percentage contribution were eliminated for the final model simulation. To evaluate the contribution of environmental parameters to the performance of MaxEnt, we used three scenarios: a) All key predictor variables, b) Only bioclimatic variables, and c) without remote sensing variables. With scenario a) model simulation has substantially improved the potential HS prediction with mean AUC value 0.98, indicating a better predictive accuracy in the integration of satellite remote sensing data. MaxENT results showed that elevation, precipitation of coldest quarter, NDVI, and precipitation of warmest quarte had a significant contribution to the potential HS of Ghaf trees in the UAE. Model results showed that the spatial proportions of the potential HS in the UAE consisted of high (2%), medium (3.7%) and low (94.3%) suitability classes.

AB  - The Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus) is vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures and has undergone an extensive decline through much of its range in Southeast Asia. However, little is known about the changing distribution of Green Peafowl in China through historical periods. We described a 5000-6000 years distribution change of Green Peafowl in China by using historical archives. We examined the present distributions of Green Peafowl by using camera traps and transect surveys and predicted the suitable habitat to support future conservation planning for this species. Although Green Peafowl was once widely distributed across China, the species experienced a southward range retreat over the past 5000-6000 years and is now restricted to a small part of Yunnan. The results of prediction from maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) showed that the size of suitable habitat of Green Peafowl in Yunnan was 17,132 km(2). The suitable habitat concentrated in nine prefectures of Yunnan and Pu'er, Chuxiong, and Yuxi accounted for 48.64%, 27.39% and 15.83%, respectively. These results suggest that central Yunnan can cover most of the current larger and more contiguous populations of Green Peafowl in China and should be protected. Moreover, some areas in southern Yunnan, such as Xishuangbanna, can be a candidate for reestablishing populations, given that the species disappeared in this region less than 20 years ago and has a large remaining habitat.

AB  - Creative approaches to identifying umbrella species hold promise for devising effective surrogates of ecological communities or ecosystems. However, mechanistic niche models that predict range or habitat overlap among species may yet lack development. We reviewed literature on taxon-centered Bayesian belief network (BBN) models to explore a novel approach to identify umbrella taxa identifying taxonomic groups that share the largest proportion of habitat requirements (i.e., states of important habitat variables) with other wetland-dependent taxa. We reviewed and compiled published literature to provide a comprehensive and reproducible account of the current understanding of habitat requirements for freshwater, wetland-dependent taxa using BBNs. We found that wetland birds had the highest degree of shared habitat requirements with other taxa, and consequently may be suitable umbrella taxa in freshwater wetlands. Comparing habitat requirements using a BBN approach to build species distribution models, this review also identified taxa that may not benefit from conservation actions targeted at umbrella taxa by identifying taxa with unique habitat requirements not shared with umbrellas. Using a standard node set that accurately and comprehensively represents the ecosystem in question, BBNs could be designed to improve identification of umbrella taxa. In wetlands, expert knowledge about hydrology, geomorphology and soils could add important information regarding physical landscape characteristics relevant to species. Thus, a systems-oriented framework may improve overarching inferences from BBNs and subsequent utility to conservation planning and management.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDM) are increasingly used in conservation planning to identify priority areas for the establishment of protected areas. Nevertheless, the quality of SDM varies widely and may compromise the effectiveness of protected areas. Here we reviewed whether SDM overprediction is considered in spatial conservation prioritization exercises and evaluated how model overprediction influences the effectiveness and the spatial arrangement of priority areas. To do so, we carried out a systematic review to analyze how researchers have handled SDM overprediction when identifying priority areas for conservation. To show how spatial conservation prioritization outcomes are affected by SDM overprediction, we used SDM of native palm at three geographic scales (Neotropics, Amazon ecoregion, and Ecuadorian Amazon). We found that only 10% of the evaluated manuscripts accounted for model overprediction. Our spatial conservation prioritization based on SDM with overprediction conferred high priority rank values in a region where species do not occur, underestimated the efficiency of selected priority areas, and over or underestimated the efficiency of current protected areas. Such effects were lower at smaller geographic extents. Our findings highlight the importance of improving future spatial conservation prioritization studies through the correction of SDM overprediction, resulting in the detection of more adequate areas for species conservation, especially at broader extents.

AB  - Knowledge of a species' potential distribution and the suitability of available habitat are fundamental for effective conservation planning and management. However, the quality of information on the distribution of species and their required habitats is highly variable in terms of accuracy and availability across taxa and regions, particularly in tropical landscapes where accessibility is especially challenging. Species distribution models (SDMs) provide predictive tools for addressing gaps for poorly surveyed species, but they rarely consider biases in geographical distribution of records and their consequences. We applied SDMs and variation partitioning analyses to investigate the relative importance of habitat characteristics, human accessibility, and their joint effects in the global distribution of the Critically Endangered Blue-throated Macaw Ara glaucogularis, a species endemic to the Amazonian flooded savannas of Bolivia. The probability of occurrence was skewed towards more accessible areas, mostly secondary roads. Variability in observed occurrence patterns was mostly accounted for by the pure effect of habitat characteristics (76.2%), indicating that bias in the geographical distribution of occurrences does not invalidate species-habitat relationships derived from niche models. However, observed spatial covariation between land-use at a landscape scale and accessibility (joint contribution: 22.3%) may confound the independent role of land-use in the species distribution. New surveys should prioritise collecting data in more remote (less accessible) areas better distributed with respect to land-use composition at a landscape scale. Our results encourage wider application of partitioning methods to quantify the extent of sampling bias in datasets used in habitat modelling for a better understanding of species-habitat relationships, and add insights into the potential distribution of our study species and opportunities for its conservation.

AB  - The application of species distribution models (SDMs) in ecology and conservation biology is increasing and assuming an important role, mainly because they can be used to hindcast past and predict current and future species distributions. However, the accuracy of SDMs depends on the quality of the data and on appropriate theoretical frameworks. In this study, comprehensive data on the current distribution of the Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis) were used to i) determine the species' ecogeographical constraints, ii) hindcast a climatic model for the last glacial maximum (LGM), relating it to inferences derived from molecular studies, and iii) calibrate a model to assess the species future distribution trends (up to 2080). Our results showed that the climatic factor (in its pure effect and when it is combined with the land-cover factor) is the most important descriptor of the current distribution of the Iberian hare. In addition, the model's output was a reliable index of the local probability of species occurrence, which is a valuable tool to guide species management decisions and conservation planning. Climatic potential obtained for the LGM was combined with molecular data and the results suggest that several glacial refugia may have existed for the species within the major Iberian refugium. Finally, a high probability of occurrence of the Iberian hare in the current species range and a northward expansion were predicted for future. Given its current environmental envelope and evolutionary history, we discuss the macroecology of the Iberian hare and its sensitivity to climate change.

AB  - Background - Biodiversity loss is a problem that needs to be urgently addressed, particularly with the uncertainties of climate change. Current conservation policies principally focus on endangered species but they often give little consideration to the evolutionary processes, genetic diversity, or the rarity of non-endangered species. Endemic species occurring in rocky habitats that arc undergoing exceptional habitat loss appear to be one of the most important candidates for conservation. The aim is to establish in situ and ex situ conservation recommendations for the Mediterranean endemic species Arenaria balearica.
   Material and methods -Arenaria balearica is a species endemic to the Mediterranean with a disjunct distribution range throughout Majorca, Corsica, Sardinia, and other small Tyrrhenian islands. A combination of molecular techniques (AFLPs and plastid DNA) was employed to determine genetic diversity and rarity across populations and to calculate the Relevant Genetic Units for Conservation (RGUCs). Moreover, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) were developed to assess the potential current distribution and the expected situation under future climatic scenarios.
   Key results - To preserve the genetic diversity and rarity of the species, in situ conservation is proposed for six populations as RGUCs. Moreover, as the RGUCs can only account for a part of the phylogeographic signal, ex situ conservation is also suggested for some additional populations. According to the results, the habitat suitability in the 2050 scenario is limited and suitable areas for A. balearica could have disappeared by 2070. Therefore, the persistence of the species could be in danger in a short period of time and conservation planning becomes necessary.

AB  - Collared mongoose Herpestes semitorquatus is known to inhabit Borneo, Sumatra and possibly the Philippines. It occurs widely in Borneo, possibly with the exception of South Kalimantan. It is very likely to occur in Brunei, although no explicit records have been traced. The pelage is typically brown or reddish-brown, with a few strongly reddish-orange individuals recorded in Sabah. It has never been studied in the field, so information on its ecology is limited. We used MaxEnt niche distribution modelling to predict the current distribution of collared mongoose in Borneo. We collected a total of 117 occurrence records from all regions, except Brunei and South Kalimantan. To reduce possible negative effects of uneven search-effort, 27 records were used in the Balanced Model and 77 in the Spatial Filtering Model to map habitat suitability. Our habitat suitability index model predicted that a large proportion of Borneo, mostly the lowland and upland forests in the interior encompassing large blocks of both national and transboundary protected area networks, is suitable for collared mongoose. Increased survey effort is warranted in areas predicted to be suitable but lack data, such as northern Central Kalimantan, central East Kalimantan, South Kalimantan and south-central Sarawak. To understand the effects of logging on collared mongoose, further investigations are required.

AB  - Conservation planning for at-risk species requires understanding of where species are likely to occur, how many individuals are likely to be supported on a given landscape, and the ability to monitor those changes through time.
   We developed a distribution model for northern spotted owls that incorporates both habitat suitability and probability of territory occupancy while accounting for interspecies competition.
   We developed range-wide habitat suitability maps for two time periods (1993 and 2012) for northern spotted owls that accounted for regional differences in habitat use and home range size. We used these maps for a long-term demographic monitoring study area to assess habitat change and estimate the number of potential territories based on available habitat for both time periods. We adjusted the number of potential territories using known occupancy rates to estimate owl densities for both time periods. We evaluated our range-wide habitat suitability model using independent survey data.
   Our range-wide habitat maps predicted areas suitable for territorial spotted owl presence well. On the demographic study area, the amount of habitat declined 19.7% between 1993 and 2012, while our estimate of the habitat-based carrying capacity declined from 150 to 146 territories. Estimated number of occupied territories declined from 94 to 57.
   Conservation and recovery of at-risk species depends on understanding how habitat changes over time in response to factors such as wildfire, climate change, biological invasions, and interspecies competition, and how these changes influence species distribution.

FX  - Funding for monitoring spotted owl populations was primarily provided by USDA Forest Service and USDI Bureau of Land Management as agreed upon under the Northwest Forest Plan. This study was facilitated by over two decades of spotted owl monitoring data that were collected through a large group effort focused on monitoring the effectiveness of the NWFP. Our work would not have been possible without the continued hard work of many dedicated biologists who annually collect the spotted owl data used to train and test our habitat models. We thank the state (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Department of Forestry) and federal (USDA Forest Service, USDI Bureau of Land Management, USDI National Parks Service) agencies for providing spotted owl data to evaluate our models. J. Reid facilitated and graciously responded to questions regarding spotted owl data for the Tyee study area.

AB  - When climate changes, species' distributions may either shift spatially or expand/contract around continuously-occupied refugia, altering the effectiveness of previously-fixed conservation reserve networks.
   We characterise the nature of climate-induced changes in species' distributions and the extent of protected habitat, using a topographically diverse, subtropical case-study region.
   Bioclimatic species' distribution models were developed for 13 representative forest-dependent species spanning four vertebrate classes. We used a fine-scale 0.25 km grid with nine environmental and eight climatic predictor variables, selected for biological and land-use realism and statistical independence. Downscaled climate data for future climate regimes were quantified from regional climate data together with the IPCC A1FI predictions for 2040 and 2090.
   Range limits and centroids of individual species' modelled habitat areas changed little between present (2000) and future climates. However the total amount of suitable habitat shrank within the initial range limits. Species with the greatest habitat reductions had the smallest proportions of their present habitat areas in refugia (habitat areas suitable under present and future climates), but the largest proportions of their future habitat areas. The absolute areas of species' habitat protected by legislation decreased, whereas the proportions that were protected changed little.
   Regional-scale climate change is likely to cause substantial species declines, together with reduced areas of protected suitable habitat. The observed nature of distributional change indicates that long-term regional species conservation will depend more on identifying, protecting, and restoring habitat refugia than on actions to facilitate larger-scale movements.

AB  - Mediterranean marine protected areas (MPAs), designed to achieve long-term nature conservation, are progressively conquered by invasive species of tropical origin, posing novel challenges for managers and policymakers of the 21st century. In this study, we assessed the vulnerability of 142 coastal Mediterranean MPAs to nine of the most invasive fishes under current and future climatic conditions. We predicted invasive species' habitat suitability using an ensemble modelling approach, calibrating models on the entire distribution of the species. We categorized three risk levels for Mediterranean MPAs, based on the assumption that more suitable habitat conditions make protected areas more prone to invasion. Future projections forecasted an increase of suitable areas for all considered species in the Mediterranean basin. In the Levantine Sea, almost all MPAs are at high risk of invasion by the considered species both in the current and future scenarios. MPAs located in the other Mediterranean sectors have currently a low suitability for most invasive species, but their risk level will increase overall by 2050, especially in the South Adriatic Sea and off South Western Italy. By identifying spatial priorities in a global change context, we fill critical information gaps on the vulnerability of MPAs to the future expansion of warm-water invaders.

AB  - The use of indicator species in forest conservation and management planning can facilitate enhanced preservation of biodiversity from the negative effects of forestry and other uses of land. However, this requires detailed and spatially comprehensive knowledge of the habitat preferences and distributions of selected focal indicator species. Unfortunately, due to limited resources for field surveys, only a small proportion of the occurrences of focal species is usually known. This shortcoming can be circumvented by using modeling techniques to predict the spatial distribution of suitable sites for the target species. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and other remote sensing (RS) techniques have the potential to provide useful environmental data covering systematically large areas for these purposes. Here, we focused on six bird of prey and woodpecker species known to be good indicators of boreal forest biodiversity values. We used known nest sites of the six indicator species based on nestling ringing records. Thus, the most suitable nesting sites of these species provide important information for biodiversity-friendly forest management and conservation planning. We developed fine-grained, that is, 96 x 96 m grid cell resolution, predictive maps across the whole of Finland of the suitable nesting habitats based on ALS and other RS data and spatial information on the distribution of important forest stands for the six studied biodiversity indicator bird species based on nesting-habitat suitability modeling, that is, the MaxEnt model. Habitat preferences of the study species, as determined by MaxEnt, were in line with the previous knowledge of species-habitat relations. The proportion of suitable habitats of these species in protected areas (PAs) was considerable, but our analysis also revealed many potentially high-quality forest stands outside PAs. However, many of these sites are increasingly threatened by logging because of increased pressures for using forests for bioeconomy and forest industry based on National Forest Strategy. Predicting habitat suitability based on information on the nest sites of indicator species provides a new tool for systematic conservation planning over large areas in boreal forests in Europe, and a corresponding approach would also be feasible and recommendable elsewhere where similar data are available.

AB  - Conservation planning for wildlife species requires mapping and assessment of habitat suitability across broad areas, often relying on a diverse suite, or stack, of geospatial data presenting multidimensional controls on a species. Stacks of univariate, independently developed vegetation layers may not represent relationships between each variable that can be characterized by multivariate modeling techniques, leading to inaccurate inferences on the distribution of suitable habitat. In this paper, we examine the role of variable combining in mapping multiple dimensions of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus, GRSG) habitat as a basis for GRSG conservation in the great basin ecoregion within southeastern Oregon. We compare two modeling approaches: a univariate random forest regression model (RF regression) and a multivariate random forest nearest neighbor (RFNN) imputation model , across an array of variables. These include five GRSG habitat descriptor variables: percent cover of trees, juniper, sagebrush, and GRSG food forbs, and the proportion of grasses that are exotic annuals. We also model species distributions of 51 common species in the sage steppe and combine these predictions to estimate alpha diversity. Our results show that RF regression and RFNN can yield univariate predictions with similar performance, but RF regression predictions tend to contain slightly more bias at broader spatial scales. Stacking univariate predictions from RF regression yields covariance errors that manifest as logical errors (juniper cover > tree cover), biases in estimates of GRSG habitat area, and biases in estimates of alpha diversity. Combining variables from the RFNN model does not introduce covariance errors. We conclude that multivariate modeling approaches are better suited to map multidimensional habitat niches at broader spatial scales, and also better suited to provide information for defining multivariable adaptive management triggers at the population level or above.

AB  - Context. Tropical ecosystems are widely recognised for their high species richness and outstanding concentrations of rare and endemic species. Previous studies either focussed on the effects of deforestation or climate change, whereas studies on the combined effects of these two major threats are limited.
   Aims. This research aimed to model current and future distributions of medium-to large-sized mammal species on the basis of different land-use and climate-change scenarios in 2050 and to assess whether the predicted effects of land-use change are greater than those of climate change and whether the combined effects of these drivers are greater than those of either individual driver.
   Methods. The present article demonstrates a method for combining nationwide wildlife-inventory data, spatially explicit species-distribution models, current and predicted future bioclimatic variables, other biophysical factors and human disturbance to map distributions of mammal species on the basis of different land-use and climate-change scenarios and to assess the role of protected areas in conservation planning.
   Key results. Seventeen medium-to large-sized mammal species were selected for modelling. Most selected species were predicted to lose suitable habitat if the remaining forest cover declines from the current level of 57% to 50% in 2050. The predicted effects of deforestation were stronger than the effects of climate change. When climate and land-use change were combined, the predicted impacts were more severe. Most species would lose suitable habitat and the average shift in species distribution was greater than 40%.
   Conclusions. The predicted effects were positive for only a few species and negative for most species. Current and future centres of mammal-species richness were predicted in large and contiguous protected forests and the average contribution of existing and proposed protected areas in protecting the focal species will increase from 73% to 80% across all scenarios.
   Implications. The present research advances the current understanding of the ecology of 17 medium-to large-sized mammal species with conservation relevance and the factors that affect their distributions at the landscape scale. In addition, the research demonstrated that spatially explicit models and protected areas are effective means to contribute to protection of mammal species in current and future land-use and climate-change scenarios.

AB  - Resources in the ocean are ephemeral, and effective management must therefore account for the dynamic spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystems and species of concern. We focus on the South Taranaki Bight (STB) of New Zealand, where upwelling generates productivity and prey to support an important foraging ground for blue whales that overlaps with anthropogenic pressure from industrial activities. We incorporate regional ecological knowledge of upwelling dynamics, physical-biological coupling and associated lags in models to forecast sea surface temperature (SST) and net primary productivity (NPP) with up to 3 weeks lead time. Forecasted environmental layers are then implemented in species distribution models to predict suitable blue whale habitat in the STB. Models were calibrated using data from the austral summers of 2009-2019, and ecological forecast skill was evaluated by predicting to withheld data. Boosted regression tree models skilfully forecasted SST (CV deviance explained = 0.969-0.970) and NPP (CV deviance explained = 0.738-0.824). The subsequent blue whale distribution forecast models had high predictive performance (AUC = 0.889), effectively forecasting suitable habitat on a daily scale with 1-3 weeks lead time. The spatial location and extent of forecasted blue whale habitat were variable, with the proportion of petroleum and mineral permit areas that overlapped with daily suitable habitat ranging from 0% to 70%. Hence, the STB and these forecast models are well-suited for dynamic management that could reduce anthropogenic threats to whales while decreasing regulatory burdens to industry users relative to a traditional static protected area. Synthesis and applications. We develop and test ecological forecast models that predict sea surface temperature, net primary productivity and blue whale suitable habitat up to 3 weeks in the future within New Zealand's South Taranaki Bight region. These forecasts of whale distribution can be effectively applied for dynamic spatial management due to model foundation on quantified links and lags between physical forcing and biological responses. A framework to operationalize these forecasts through a user-driven application is in development to proactively inform conservation management decisions. This framework is implemented through stakeholder engagement, allows flexibility based on management objectives, and is amenable to improvement as new knowledge and feedback are received.

AB  - Plant species play an important role in maintaining the stability of arid ecosystems. Due to low biodiversity, species distribution patterns and richness are infrequently investigated in arid lands. Here, we take the Xinjiang Urgur Autonomous Region (Province), a large area in arid northwest China, as a case to investigate the patterns of woody species diversity and their relationship to environmental factors. At the same time, we aim to evaluate the current protected areas network and improve conservation planning based on woody plant diversity of Xinjiang. In this study, we sampled 133 woody forest species and 220 woody xerophytic species, which are about 10% of the plant species and near 80% of woody species in this region, and modeled current and last glacial maximum (LGM) distributions of these species using the method of species distribution modeling (SDM). Based on the results of SDMs, species richness and LGM refugia were estimated for forest and xerophytic species. Then, we assessed correlations between current species richness and environmental variables as well as glacial refugia. Finally, we applied the digital approach of systematic conservation planning to determine priority areas based on patterns of species diversity. Precipitation variables and glacial refugia have influenced the distribution patterns of woody species diversity for forest and xerophytic species in this province. In our proposed network for biodiversity conservation, high priority areas mostly coincided with zones having low species diversity, and many of these concerned areas fall outside of the ranges of the current existing conservation network.

Within physical planning, environmental impact assessment (EIA) and strategic environmental assessment (SEA) play important roles in the prediction and assessment of biodiversity-related impacts from planned developments. However, adapted prediction tools to forecast and quantify potential impacts on biodiversity components are lacking. This study tested and compared four different CIS-based habitat models and assessed their relevance for applications in environmental assessment. The models were implemented in the Stockholm region in central Sweden and applied to data on the crested tit (Parus cristatus), a sedentary bird species of coniferous forest. All four models performed well and allowed the distribution of suitable habitats for the crested tit in the Stockholm region to be predicted. The models were also used to predict and quantify habitat loss for two regional development scenarios. The study highlighted the importance of model selection in impact prediction. Criteria that are relevant for the choice of model for predicting impacts on biodiversity were identified and discussed. Finally, the importance of environmental assessment for the preservation of biodiversity within the general frame of biodiversity conservation is emphasised. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The rapid ecological shifts that are occurring due to climate change present major challenges for managers and policymakers and, therefore, are one of the main concerns for environmental modelers and evolutionary biologists. Species distribution models (SDM) are appropriate tools for assessing the relationship between species distribution and environmental conditions, so being customarily used to forecast the biogeographical response of species to climate change. A serious limitation of species distribution models when forecasting the effects of climate change is that they normally assume that species behavior and climatic tolerances will remain constant through time. In this study, we propose a new methodology, based on fuzzy logic, useful for incorporating the potential capacity of species to adapt to new conditions into species distribution models. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to include different behavioral responses of species when predicting the effects of climate change on species distribution. Favorability models offered in this study show two extremes: one considering that the species will not modify its present behavior, and another assuming that the species will take full advantage of the possibilities offered by an increase in environmental favorability. This methodology may mean a more realistic approach to the assessment of the consequences of global change on species' distribution and conservation. Overlooking the potential of species' phenotypical plasticity may under- or overestimate the predicted response of species to changes in environmental drivers and its effects on species distribution. Using this approach, we could reinforce the science behind conservation planning in the current situation of rapid climate change.

AB  - Jajroud Protected Area Complex is one of the main habitats of Alborz Red Sheep (Ovis gmelini x O. vignei) in Iran. Being close to Tehran, this habitat has been reduced and fragmented due to the human constructions. This study was designed with the aim of identifying the summer and fall habitat patches and the suitability of the matrix by means of Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA). Cost-distance function was then used to calculate the cost of moving among the patches and the corridors with the least cost was identified using Least-cost path analysis. Results showed that, in both seasons, the species inhabits a narrow niche and is very sensitive to habitat changes. Overall, a suitable habitat for this species is at an elevation of more than 1535 m, with a lower average temperature than average of the habitat, with suitable escape terrain, and away from villages. Military areas, based on their specific use, can have different effects on the habitat suitability. This species selects corridors which are close to escape terrain, with a slope of about 15 percent and low slope fluctuation.

AB  - Species Distribution Models (SDM) are currently common currency as proxies of species distribution range, and using consensus among different algorithms is becoming the latest tendency. This information is frequently used to estimate conservation status or for conservation planning. Nonetheless, different algorithms have huge variation in the outcomes. Usually experts determine whether or not a model is accurate, often followed by a trimming process. However, this accuracy estimation cannot be reproduced. Using Mexican endemic amphibians we evaluate the performance of nine modelling algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks, Classification Tree Analysis, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Generalised Boosting Model, Generalised Linear Models, Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines, MaxEnt, RandomForest, Surface Range Envelope), their strict geographic consensus, locality records and simple convex-hull areas through comparison of: (1) their presence/absence within Mexico's governmental protected areas, (2) range sizes projected, and (3) differences in estimated richness by all methods. We conducted all good practices prior modelling but removed the trimming factor after modelling to make the process repeatable. Presence-absence threshold was determined through the use of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC). Presence within conservation network of strict consensus and locality records was similar which indicates an over-fitting of the former, the rest of the algorithms performed similarly, with exception of Surface Range Envelope. Richness patterns varied greatly among algorithms. Distribution borders were the areas with higher sensitivity. MaxEnt obtained the highest performance in omission but consensus performed best in correctly predicting species ranges. Closer interaction between curators and modelers would increase SDMs accuracy, which would improve conservation planning effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - ContextAccurate spatiotemporal modeling of roadkill hotspots is essential for the assessment of high risk roadkill locations. Increasing the spatiotemporal resolution of models may facilitate greater cost-effective solutions for roadkill mitigation strategies.ObjectiveThis study develops a novel spatiotemporal roadkill distribution model to simulate roadkill probability. Moreover, we systematically identify top prioritized road segments by the most frequent roadkill occurrence for multiple focal species.MethodsBased on the theory of the Poisson process, the proposed spatiotemporal roadkill distribution model with seasonal effects is validated with four focal reptilian species. The model simulates spatiotemporal roadkill patterns and addresses uncertainty by referencing ensemble species distribution models. Finally, we systematically prioritize road segments by the most frequent roadkill occurrence for multiple focal species.ResultsThe efficacy of the proposed spatiotemporal roadkill distribution model which is validated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accurate proportions. The AUC values based independent roadkill data tests ranged from 0.73 to 0.84. Both the efficacy of the proposed model, and the increases in uncertainty are attributable to decreasing seasonal sampling size and variation. Based on the independent roadkill data, more than 70% of roadkill events occurred within the top 30% priority segments by our approaches.ConclusionsThe proposed model is successfully applied in simulation of spatiotemporal roadkill probability. The seasonal effects benefit identification of high roadkill probability. Through the systematic identification and the proposed model, our approach provides useful information for the design of cost-effective surveys and appropriate conservation planning and mitigation strategies.

AB  - This study aimed to use the applications of Ensemble Species Distribution Modelling (eSDM), Geographical Information Systems (GISs), and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for the design of a protected area (PA) for the critically endangered yellow-spotted mountain newt, Neurergus derjugini, by tracking and excluding the effects of climate and landscape changes in western Iran and northeastern Iraq. Potential recent and future distributions (2050 and 2070) were reconstructed by eSDM using eight algorithms with MRI-CGCM3 and CCSM4 models. The GIS-based MCDA siting procedure was followed inside habitats with high eSDM suitability by eliminating the main roads, cities, high village density, dams, poor vegetation, low stream density, agricultural lands and high ridge density. Then, within the remaining relevant areas, 10 polygons were created as "nominations" for PAs (NPAs). Finally, for 10 different NPAs, the suitability score was ranked based on ratings and weights (analytical hierarchy process) of the number of newt localities, NPA connectivity, NPA shape, NPA habitat suitability in 2070, NPA size, genetic diversity, village density and distance to nearest PAs, cities, and main roads. This research could serve as a modern realistic approach for environmental management to plan conservation areas using a cost-effective and affordable technique.

AB  - The identification of priority sites that ensure the achievement of conservation goals is key to direct conservation efforts. An estimation of the level of vulnerability of each priority area allows the identification of sites that need urgent conservation action. We present a systematic reserve selection for 1654 African mammals and amphibians that uses habitat suitability models as estimates of the area occupied by each species. These are based on the geographic range and habitat preferences for each species, which we collected in the framework of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Amphibian Assessment and IUCN Global Mammal Assessment. Our results showed that in addition to existing protected areas, approximately 2.8 million km(2) of land is irreplaceable to achieve the protection of 10% of the area occupied by all amphibians and mammals. This figure is higher than previous estimates from other studies. Most irreplaceable sites are located in the sub-Saharan region. More than half (55%) of the irreplaceable sites have high human population density; for only 17% the human population density is low. African amphibians and mammals have therefore to be conserved in densely populated areas where innovative management policies will be required to accommodate conservation successfully (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim The purpose of this study was to create predictive species distribution models (SDMs) for temperate reef-associated fish species densities and fish assemblage diversity and richness to aid in marine conservation and spatial planning.
   Location California, USA.
   Methods Using generalized additive models, we associated fish species densities and assemblage characteristics with seafloor structure, giant kelp biomass and wave climate and used these associations to predict the distribution and assemblage structure across the study area. We tested the accuracy of these predicted extrapolations using an independent data set. The SDMs were also used to estimate larger scale abundances to compare with other estimates of species abundance (uniform density extrapolation over rocky reef and density extrapolations taking into account variations in geomorphic structure).
   Results The SDMs successfully modelled the species-habitat relationships of seven rocky reef-associated fish species and showed that species' densities differed in their relationships with environmental variables. The predictive accuracy of the SDMs ranged from 0.26 to 0.60 (Pearson's r correlation between observed and predicted density values). The SDMs created for the fish assemblage-level variables had higher prediction accuracies with Pearson's r values of 0.61 for diversity and 0.71 for richness. The comparisons of the different methods for extrapolating species densities over a single marine protected area varied greatly in their abundance estimates with the uniform extrapolation (density values extrapolated evenly over the rocky reef) always estimating much greater abundances. The other two methods, which took into account variation in the geomorphic structure of the reef, provided much lower abundance estimates.
   Main conclusions Species distribution models that combine geomorphic, oceanographic and biogenic habitat variables can reliably predict spatial patterns of species density and assemblage attributes of temperate reef fishes at spatial scales of 50m. Thus, SDMs show great promise for informing spatial and ecosystem-based approaches to conservation and fisheries management.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are becoming increasingly important tools in the conservation of cetaceans. This has led to an interest in the use of species distribution models to predict where cetacean species are likely to occur based on the distribution of environmental variables. However, relationships between cetacean distribution and environmental variables are generally assumed to reflect the environmental preferences of their prey. Thus, understanding the distribution of prey may increase our ability to identify important areas for cetaceans. Here, we describe the diet of Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus) by analysing stomach contents of individuals stranded in Scotland over the last twenty years. Next, we use habitat modelling to test whether Rissos's dolphin distribution in Scottish waters, as inferred from sightings, is related to the distribution of its main prey, the octopus Eledone cirrhosa. While good models of the relationship between the distribution of E. cirrhosa and environmental variables were obtained, there was no evidence of a relationship between modelled octopus distribution and the occurrence of Risso's dolphins. These results suggest that identifying key areas for its main prey species is unlikely to help identify potential MPAs for Risso's dolphin, at least at the spatial resolution used in this study.

AB  - Bayesian networks (BN) have been increasingly used for habitat suitability modeling of threatened species due to their potential to construct robust models with limited survey data. However, previous applications of this approach have only occurred in countries where human and budget resources are highly available, but the highest concentrations of threatened vertebrates globally are located in the tropics where resources are much more limited. We assessed the effectiveness of Bayesian networks in generating habitat suitability models in Thailand, a biodiversity-rich country where the knowledge base is typically sparse for a wide range of threatened species. The Bayesian network approach was used to generate habitat suitability maps for 52 threatened vertebrate species in Thailand, using a range of evidence types, from relatively well-documented species with good local knowledge to poorly documented species, with few local experts. Published information and expert knowledge were used to define habitat requirements. Focal species were categorized into 22 groups based on known habitat preferences, and then habitat suitability models were constructed with outcomes represented spatially. Models had a consistent structure with three major components: potential habitat, known range, and threat level. Model classification sensitivity was tested using presence-only field data for 21 species. Habitat models for 12 species were relatively sensitive (>70% congruency between observed and predicted locations), three were moderately congruent, and six were poor. Classification sensitivity tended to be high for bird models and moderate for mammals, whereas sensitivity for reptiles was low, presumably reflecting the relatively poor knowledge base for reptiles in the region. Bayesian network models show significant potential for biodiversity-rich regions with scarce resources, although they require further refinement and testing. It is possible that one detailed ecological study is sufficient to develop a model with reasonable sensitivity, but BN models for species groups with no quantitative data continue to be problematic.

AB  - Habitat suitability is often used as a surrogate for demographic responses (i.e., abundance, survival, fecundity, or population viability) in the application of habitat suitability index (HSI) models. Whether habitat suitability actually relates to demographics, however, has rarely been evaluated. We validated HSI models of breeding habitat suitability for wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) and yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) in Missouri, USA. First, we evaluated HSI models as a predictor of 3 demographic responses: within-site territory density, site-level territory density, and nest success. We demonstrated a link between HSI values and all 3 types of demographic responses for the yellow-breasted chat and site-level territory density for the wood thrush. Second, we evaluated support for models containing HSI values, models containing measured habitat features (e. g., tree age, tree species, ecological land type), and models containing management treatments (e. g., even-aged and uneven-aged forest regeneration treatments) for each demographic response using model selection. Models containing HSI values received more support, in general, than models containing only habitat features or management treatments for all 3 types of wildlife response. The assumption that changes in habitat suitability represent wildlife demographic response to vegetation change is supported by our models. However, differences in species ecology may contribute to the degree to which HSI values are related to specific demographic responses. We recommend validation of HSI models with the particular demographic data of interest (i.e., density, productivity) to increase confidence in the model used for conservation planning.

AB  - Human-induced environmental changes, particularly climate change, pose a threat to many tropical montane species, making the identification of optimal future habitat a conservation priority. Here we used maximum entropy (Maxent) and boosted regression trees to predict suitable habitat of the threatened Bornean highland endemic Hose's civet (Diplogale hosei), that is currently available, and for future time periods (2050s and 2080s), considering future land cover and climate change predictions. Next, we identified areas that were consistently suitable under current and future model predictions as forest refuges. Our analysis predicted that Hose's civet is restricted mainly to the highlands of Borneo to an area less than 20,000 km(2) (about 2% of the entire island of Borneo). Changes in land cover have little impact on predicted suitable area for the species. However, we predicted habitat loss due to climate change to approximate 86% by 2080, except under a "green economy scenario" which showed stable or increasing suitable habitat. Refuges were small, about 11% of 2010 habitat, and mostly restricted to lower montane forest. About 28-35% of refuges lie within the current protected area network though much is designated as commercial forests within the proposed Heart of Borneo (HoB). For the conservation of Hose's civet and likely other Bornean highland endemics, we recommend increased wildlife and forest law enforcement in identified protected refuges and sustainable timber harvesting practices in surrounding commercial forests, both within the HoB and the extensions we identified. Results of our green model showed that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will likely contribute immensely to the long-term conservation of highland species such as Hose's civet.

AB  - We used endangered orchid species as a case study for establishing priority protected areas (PPAs). We conducted a detailed investigation of 2,884 plots in northeastern China and selected 6 nationally protected orchid species (the number of plots for each species a parts per thousand yen5) to plan PPAs in order to conserve these endangered plants. First, we estimated the potential habitat distributions of 6 orchid species using species distribution models (in the program Maxent). Second, we identified PPAs using the results of both Maxent and systematic conservation planning software (Zonation). We found that the PPAs we identified were all distributed in the eastern, northeastern, and northern parts of the study region on which we focused. We observed that existing nature reserves in those areas were much smaller than the PPAs we identified, suggesting the need for expansion of these zones. Finally, we identified some recommended protection areas based on our PPAs, which we believe are suitable areas of in situ conservation. These areas could assist in the formulation of protection policies for these endangered orchid species. Our results have broad implications for conservation biology and the redefinition of protective zones for at-risk species.

AB  - Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) can help conservation planning by forecasting environmental suitability for an endangered species. Here, SDMs were constructed for stone crayfish (Austropotamobius torrentium) and white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes s. str.) to identify catchments in south-western Germany where environmental conditions are favourable for reintroduction. Maximum-entropy modelling (Maxent) was used with presence-only data to forecast environmental suitability for the two crayfish species based on five climate variables, slope, land cover, and a human impact index. SDMs showed good to excellent performance and were able to capture the range of both Austropotamobius species. Presence probabilities were mostly determined by climate variables, and climate niches partly overlap, with white-clawed crayfish occurring at conditions with less extreme winter temperatures and lower temperature seasonality than stone crayfish. Human impact contributed between 10 and 27% to the models and was negatively related to presence probabilities. Contribution of land cover was low (5%) but showed a positive relationship with deciduous broadleaf forest in both species. Both SDMs indicated several catchments with high predicted environmental suitability but no present occurrence records. Subsequent crayfish and habitat surveys in these catchments revealed four streams considered suitable for reintroduction and led to discovery of five previously unknown white-clawed crayfish populations. Overall, SDMs proved to be a powerful tool for conservation planning of freshwater crayfish species.

AB  - Detailed and reliable information about the spatial distribution of species provides critical information for effective conservation planning. In Victoria, Australia, this responsibility is held by the Department of Sustainability and Environment, which maintains and curates a database of site records for species: the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas. But the information is provided in point form, and therefore, it does not provide an adequate view of species distributions for all management purposes. By integrating known occurrences of species with environmental GIS data layers using a machine learning algorithm, random forest, we have built species distribution models for 523 vertebrate fauna species across the whole state, providing predictive 'maps' that are available for use in various conservation planning activities. In this paper, we introduce and discuss the methods we developed and implemented for producing these models. Specifically, 26 explanatory variables were used for the modelling; three versions of models were built using different sets of explanatory variables; pseudo-absences were chosen by filtering random points with a profile model; model accuracy was assessed using several measures, especially lift curve-related ones; a threshold was selected for each model to transform continuous result to binary one by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and (pseudo) specificity, which was proved to be valid for presence-only data.

AB  - Conservation planning is crucial for megadiverse countries where biodiversity is coupled with incomplete reserve systems and limited resources to invest in conservation. Using Peru as an example of a megadiverse country, we asked whether the national system of protected areas satisfies biodiversity conservation needs. Further, to complement the existing reserve system, we identified and prioritized potential conservation areas using a combination of species distribution modeling, conservation planning and connectivity analysis. Based on a set of 2,869 species, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and plants, we used species distribution models to represent species' geographic ranges to reduce the effect of biased sampling and partial knowledge about species' distributions. A site-selection algorithm then searched for efficient and complementary proposals, based on the above distributions, for a more representative system of protection. Finally, we incorporated connectivity among areas in an innovative post-hoc analysis to prioritize those areas maximizing connectivity within the system. Our results highlight severe conservation gaps in the Coastal and Andean regions, and we propose several areas, which are not currently covered by the existing network of protected areas. Our approach helps to find areas that contribute to creating a more representative, connected and efficient network.

AB  - Marxan is the most common decision-support tool used to inform the design of protected-area systems. The original version of Marxan does not consider risk and uncertainty associated with threatening processes affecting protected areas, including uncertainty about the location and condition of species' populations and habitats now and in the future. We described and examined the functionality of a modified version of Marxan, Marxan with Probability. This software explicitly considers 4 types of uncertainty: probability that a feature exists in a particular place (estimated based on species distribution models or spatially explicit population models); probability that features in a site will be lost in the future due to a threatening process, such as climate change, natural catastrophes, and uncontrolled human interventions; probability that a feature will exist in the future due to natural successional processes, such as a fire or flood; and probability the feature exists but has been degraded by threatening processes, such as overfishing or pollution, and thus cannot contribute to conservation goals. We summarized the results of 5 studies that illustrate how each type of uncertainty can be used to inform protected area design. If there were uncertainty in species or habitat distribution, users could maximize the chance that these features were represented by including uncertainty using Marxan with Probability. Similarly, if threatening processes were considered, users minimized the chance that species or habitats were lost or degraded by using Marxan with Probability. Marxan with Probability opens up substantial new avenues for systematic conservation planning research and application by agencies.

AB  - The common pheasant is listed as a nationally protected species in Iran because it faces many threats such as habitat destruction, pollution from pesticides and overhunting. The species' habitat selection remains unknown in Iran; consequently, conservation planning for the species is hampered by this lack of information. In this study we used predictor variables including topographic, anthropogenic, land cover and climate and 122 occurrence points to model the distribution of common pheasant (subspecies P. c. talischensis), in Gilan province, Iran. The results showed that distance to agriculture and orchards as well as distance to plantation forests were the most important variables in predicting species distribution. Furthermore, we found that the total potential suitable habitat for the species in Gilan province is 315,990 hectares. We observed a shift of the species to higher altitudes in the province. We recommend raising awareness about the presence of the species especially among private landowners, creating a network of protected areas on private land, and changing land-use policies at the provincial level as essential measures for the conservation of the species in Gilan province. Our results can be applied to management and conservation of the species in other modified or rapidly changing landscapes.

AB  - To accommodate climate-driven changes in biological communities, conservation plans are increasingly making use of models to predict species' responses to climate change. To date, species distribution models have been the most commonly used approach for assessing species' vulnerability to climate change. Biological trait-based approaches, which have emerged recently, and which include consideration of species' sensitivity and adaptive capacity, provide alternative and potentially conflicting vulnerability assessments and present conservation practitioners and planners with difficult choices. Here we discuss the differing objectives and strengths of the approaches, and provide guidance to conservation practitioners for their application. We outline an integrative methodological framework for assessing climate change impacts on species that uses both traditional species distribution modelling approaches and biological trait-based assessments. We show how these models can be used conceptually as inputs to guide conservation monitoring and planning. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concept of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV) and its mapping have become extremely important within the scope of habitat restoration in almost every European country. The aim of this study is to predict the PNV in the sites of Natura 2000 Network 'Sado Estuary' and 'Comporta-Gale' based on the vegetation series and the main environmental variables. The modelling approach is based on the distribution of communities referred to as classification then modelling.
   Subsequently, several statistical model-fitting techniques, such as regression models, machine learning and rule-based, were successfully applied to the survey data (9 vegetation series; and 7 environmental/predictor variables). The spatial database was organized as a Geographic Information System (GIS) and was also used to perform the Species Distribution Models (SDM) at community level. The results show a high correspondence between the vegetation series and the environmental gradients. The predicted PNV maps based on the Maximum Entropy Model were validated with the official map of the PNV of the sites of Natura 2000 Network 'Sado Estuary' and 'Comporta-Gale', and presented an overall accuracy of 86%. Often, conservation planning and biodiversity resource management is carried out at more detailed scales, where SDM allows integration of community direct observations and improve our interpretation of PNV local distributions along environmental gradients VNP in beach and coastal sand dunes environments.

AB  - Many endangered species are distributed in narrow geographic ranges, often at severe risk of extinction. Ecological niche modeling can be used to identify suitable areas, which can be surveyed to detect additional populations. We combined remotely sensed data (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and field sampling to increase distributional knowledge of the species and improve understanding of its conservation status. We identified numerous new sites for a rare plant (Dianthus pseudocrinitus) and tested model-based predictions of its full geographic distribution. Using only eight occurrences, we developed initial models, which guided detailed field sampling: 11 new sites were identified, but models were unable to predict better than random expectations. A second round of models did show significant predictive ability and pointed to a broader geographic and environmental distribution of the species. As a consequence, the conservation status of the species should be upgraded from Critically Endangered to Endangered. We identified six protected areas (Golestan, Ghorkhoud, Miandasht, Salouk, Sarani, Sarigol) that likely hold populations of this species; one area adjacent to Ghorkhoud Protected Area, if protected, would protect the best-known populations of the species. Our results highlight the importance of combining modeling with field sampling in characterizing distributions of rare and endangered species.

AB  - Spatial closures are an important component of regulations to protect cold-water corals and sponges from potential damage by bottom trawling. However, designing spatial closures can be challenging because the distribution of most cold-water coral and sponge habitat is unknown, and closures that overlap with fishing areas may reduce fishing opportunities and landings. In this paper, we examined trade-off relationships between bottom trawl fishery landings and the proportion of coral and sponge habitat protected by alternative spatial closure designs within Hecate Strait, British Columbia, Canada. We selected closures using a spatial optimization procedure involving 3 steps: (1) maximum entropy species distribution modelling to predict habitat suitability for Hexactinellida sponges and Alcyonacea and Pennatulacea corals, (2) matching habitat suitability predictions with spatially explicit estimates of bottom trawl landings value from at-sea observer data, and (3) Marxan spatial optimization to select closures that protect the most suitable coral and sponge habitat while minimizing losses in landings value. Our results suggest that the majority of coral and sponge habitat within Hecate Strait could be protected while maintaining existing fisheries value; spatial closures protecting up to 70% of the most suitable coral and sponge habitat resulted in negligible losses in trawl fishery landings. Protecting 99% of suitable coral and sponge habitats decreased landings value to 63% of its former total. Landings for rockfishes Sebastes and Sebastolobus spp. were the most sensitive to spatial closures, decreasing twice as much as average landings value for all groundfish species. By explicitly revealing potential trade-offs between fisheries and conservation objectives, our analysis provides a concrete starting point towards implementing spatial closures with increased transparency, credibility, and acceptability from stakeholders.

AB  - The extent to which climate change might diminish the efficacy of protected areas is one of the most pressing conservation questions. Many projections suggest that climate-driven species distribution shifts will leave protected areas impoverished and species inadequately protected while other evidence suggests that intact ecosystems within protected areas will be resilient to change. Here, we tackle this problem empirically. We show how recent changes in distribution of 139 Tanzanian savannah bird species are linked to climate change, protected area status and land degradation. We provide the first evidence of climate-driven range shifts for an African bird community. Our results suggest that the continued maintenance of existing protected areas is an appropriate conservation response to the challenge of climate and environmental change.

AB  - Among the greatest challenges facing the conservation of plants and animal species in protected areas are threats from a rapidly changing climate. An altered climate creates both challenges and opportunities for improving the management of protected areas in networks. Increasingly, quantitative tools like species distribution modeling are used to assess the performance of protected areas and predict potential responses to changing climates for groups of species, within a predictive framework. At larger geographic domains and scales, protected area network units have spatial geoclimatic properties that can be described in the gap analysis typically used to measure or aggregate the geographic distributions of species (stacked species distribution models, or S-SDM). We extend the use of species distribution modeling techniques in order to model the climate envelope (or "footprint") of individual protected areas within a network of protected areas distributed across the 48 conterminous United States and managed by the US National Park System. In our approach we treat each protected area as the geographic range of a hypothetical endemic species, then use MaxEnt and 5 uncorrelated BioClim variables to model the geographic distribution of the climatic envelope associated with each protected area unit (modeling the geographic area of park units as the range of a species). We describe the individual and aggregated climate envelopes predicted by a large network of 163 protected areas and briefly illustrate how macroecological measures of geodiversity can be derived from our analysis of the landscape ecological context of protected areas. To estimate trajectories of change in the temporal distribution of climatic features within a protected area network, we projected the climate envelopes of protected areas in current conditions onto a dataset of predicted future climatic conditions. Our results suggest that the climate envelopes of some parks may be locally unique or have narrow geographic distributions, and are thus prone to future shifts away from the climatic conditions in these parks in current climates. In other cases, some parks are broadly similar to large geographic regions surrounding the park or have climatic envelopes that may persist into near-term climate change. Larger parks predict larger climatic envelopes, in current conditions, but on average the predicted area of climate envelopes are smaller in our single future conditions scenario. Individual units in a protected area network may vary in the potential for climate adaptation, and adaptive management strategies for the network should account for the landscape contexts of the geodiversity or climate diversity within individual units. Conservation strategies, including maintaining connectivity, assessing the feasibility of assisted migration and other landscape restoration or enhancements can be optimized using analysis methods to assess the spatial properties of protected area networks in biogeographic and macroecological contexts.

AB  - Large ungulates commonly perform seasonal or annual movements that encompass considerable land area and various habitat types. Effective conservation of these species relies not only on insights on their basic ecology, but also an understanding on their requirements to move across landscapes. To determine the key landscape characteristics of the endangered takin (Budorcas taxicolor), we systematically surveyed for their occurrence in the Northern MinShan Mountains, China, during 2010-2011. We then modeled takin distribution at a regional scale using autologistic regression models, and produced a predictive map for their distribution. The results showed that occurrence probabilities for takin were higher in areas with a larger range of elevation, closer to protected areas, farther from townships, and with more forest coverage. There was a considerable overlap between highly suitable takin habitat and the network of protected forest formed by nature reserves originally established to conserve giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). A broad elevation gradient and the protected area network were essential landscape characteristics in predicting takin distributions and our results suggested that takin should be considered landscape- and conservation-dependent species. The results of this study are applicable to the conservation of large ungulates throughout the mountains bordering the Tibetan Plateau and to a broader suite of mammals that conduct seasonal migrations.

T2  - WILDLIFE: DESTRUCTION, CONSERVATION AND BIODIVERSITY
LA  - English
KW  - CONSERVATION
AB  - The Javan Hawk-Eagle (JHE) is categorized in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (CITES Appendix 2) as one of the world's rarest and most endangered raptors in the remaining original natural forests of Java, Indonesia. Since it is not feasible to conduct complete field surveys for a landscape-scale, this paper proposes a GIS-based extrapolation model based on local-scale model in order to generate a map of potential and present habitat suitability for JHE in the entire landscape. Using autologistic regression, we developed a GIS-based habitat model for JHE in Java Island and subsequently estimated the population number of JHE. The obtained model will be the most useful for the wildlife management conservation planning process in order to help identify "hot spots" that are most likely to harbor JHE. Most of the predicted suitable habitats in Java Island are distributed in the mountainous area. The area with the largest proportion of suitable habitat for JHE is located in East Java, and then followed by West Java and the last in Central Java. Totally, about 41 locations (85%) of 48 historical localities recorded were recognized as suitable habitat. The estimated number of ME pairs based on model extrapolation would place the population size about 108-542 (median = 325) pairs. Although this estimated population is higher compared to other studies, ME had always been described as either rare or very rare. The apparent discrepancy between this estimated population and others, which might not suggest an increase in present ME, may be explained by several reasons such as increased accessibility to formerly unexplored habitat and more recent satellite imageries and GIS techniques application used in estimation of suitable habitat of ME and finally will allow a better population estimate.

AB  - 1. Opportunistically collected species observations contributed by volunteer reporters are increasingly available for species and regions for which systematically collected data are not available. However, it is unclear if they are suitable to produce reliable habitat suitability models (HSMs), and hence if the species-habitat relationships found and habitat suitability maps produced can be used with confidence to advice conservation management and address basic and applied research questions.
   2. We evaluated HSMs with opportunistically collected observations against HSMs with systematically collected observations. We enhanced the opportunistically collected presence-only data by adding inferred species absences. To obtain inferred absences, we asked individual reporters about their identification skills and if they reported certain species consistently and combined this information with their observations. We evaluated several HSM methods using a forest bird species, Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus), in Sweden: logistic regression with inferred absences, two versions of MaxEnt, a model combining presence-absence with presence-only observations and a Bayesian site-occupancy-detection model.
   3. All HSM methods produced nationwide habitat suitability maps of Siberian jay that agreed well with systematically collected observations (AUC: 086-0.88) and were very similar to a habitat suitability map produced from the HSM with systematically collected observations (Spearman rho: 0.94-0.98). At finer geographical scales there were differences among methods.
   4. At finer scale, the resulting habitat suitability maps from logistic regression with inferred absences agreed better with results from systematically collected observations than other methods. The species-habitat relationships found with logistic regression also agreed well with those found from systematically collected data and with prior expectations based on the species ecology.
   5. Synthesis and application. For many regions and species, systematically collected data are not available. By using inferred absences from high-quality, opportunistically collected contributions of few very active reporters in logistic regression we obtained HSMs that produced results similar to those from a systematic survey. Adding high-quality inferred absences to opportunistically collected data is likely possible for many less common species across various organism groups. Well-performing HSMs are important to facilitate applications such as spatial conservation planning and prioritization, monitoring of invasive species, understanding species habitat requirements or climate change studies.

AB  - Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne pathogen that infects the roots of plants, is listed as a Key Threatening Process under Commonwealth and NSW state biodiversity legislation due to its deleterious effects on native flora. In warm temperate eastern Australia, the disease may cause insidious declines in plant species that have slow rates of population turnover, and thereby threaten their long term persistence. Phytophthora cinnamomi has been known to occur in Royal National Park since the 1970s and systematic surveys for the pathogen were carried out a decade ago. Development of effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of the disease requires information on the spatial distribution of risks posed by the disease. In this study, we use limited disease survey data to identify areas that are most at risk. We propose and apply a simple risk model in which risks of disease impact are proportional to the product of habitat suitability for the pathogen and abundance of susceptible biota. We modelled habitat suitability of the pathogen from available survey data and found that soil landscapes and topographic variables were the strongest predictors. Susceptible flora were concentrated on sandstone plateaus. Disease risks were greatest on the sandstone plateaus and lowest in the shale gullies with intermediate levels of risk on shale ridges and the coastal sand plain. The outcomes of this spatially explicit risk assessment will help inform the development of management strategies and priorities for the disease in the Park. Our approach lends itself to broader application to conservation planning in other landscapes and to other threats to biodiversity.

AB  - Ecological niche models (ENMs) have become a practical and key mechanism for filling major gaps in spatial information for targeted conservation planning, particularly when only occurrence data are available. Nonetheless, accounting for abundance patterns in the internal structure of species' ranges, and the role of biotic interactions in such models across broadscale, remains highly challenging. Our study gathered baseline information on abundance data of two Endangered Amazonian primates (Ateles chamek and Lagothrix lagotricha cana) to create geospatial abundance models using two spatial interpolation methods: Inverse distance weight (IDW) and Ordinary kriging (OK). The main goals were to: (i) test whether geospatial abundance models are correlated with habitat suitability derived from correlative ENMs; (ii) compare the strength of the abundance-suitability relationships between original and interpolated abundances; (iii) test whether interspecific competition between the two target taxa constrained abundance over broad spatial scales; and (iv) create ensemble models incorporating both habitat suitability and abundance to identify high-priority areas for conservation. We found a significant positive relationship between habitat suitability with observed and predicted abundances of woolly (L. l. cana) and spider (A. chamek) monkeys. Abundance-suitability correlations showed no significant differences when using original relative abundances compared to using interpolated abundances. We also found that the association between L. l. cana abundance and habitat suitability depended on the abundance of its putative competitor species, A. chamek. Our final models combining geospatial abundance information with ENMs were able to provide more realistic assessments of hotspots for conservation, especially when accounting for the important, but often neglected, role of interspecific competition in shaping species' geographic ranges at broader scales. The framework developed here, including general trends in abundance patterns and suitability information, can be used as a surrogate to identify high-priority areas for conservation of poorly known species across their entire geographic ranges.

AB  - Rapid changes in climate and land use threaten the persistence of wildlife species. Understanding where species are likely to occur now and in the future can help identify areas that are resistant to change over time and guide conservation planning. We estimated changes in species distribution patterns and spatial resistance in five future scenarios for the New England region of the northeastern United States. We present scenario-specific distribution change maps for nine harvested wildlife species, identifying regions of increasing, decreasing, or stable habitat suitability within each scenario. Next, we isolated areas where species occurrence probability is high (p > 0.7) and resistant to change across all future scenarios. Resistance was also evaluated relative to current land protection to identify patterns in and out of Protected Areas (PAs). Generally, species distributions declined in area over the 50-year assessment period (2010-2060), with the greatest average declines occurring for moose (-40.9%) and wild turkey (-22.1%). Species resistance varied considerably across the region, with coyote demonstrating the highest average regional resistance (91.81% of the region) and moose demonstrating the lowest (0.76% of the region). At the state level, average focal species resistance was highest in Maine (the largest state) and lowest in Massachusetts. Many of the focal species showed high overlap in resistance and land protection. Coyote, white-tailed deer, and black bear had the highest probability of resistance, given protection, while moose and wild turkey had the highest probability of protection, given resistance. Overall, relatively small portions of New England-ranging between 0.25% and 21.12%-were both protected and resistant for the focal species. Our results provide estimates of resistance that can inform conservation planning for commonly harvested species that are important ecologically, economically, and culturally to the region. Expanding protected area coverage to include resistant areas may provide longer term benefits to these species.

AB  - Habitat mapping is a useful method for understanding the complex spatial relationships that exist in the marine environment, and is used to evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies, particularly in regards to marine protected areas. This study explored the observed and predicted distribution of an uncommon soft coral species, Dendronephthya australis within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park. Dendronephthya australis was mapped by video operated by a SCUBA diver towing a time synchronised GPS. A species distribution model was created to explore the possible occurrence of D. australis outside of the mapped area, using four environmental parameters: bathymetry, slope of seabed, velocity of tidal currents, and distance from estuary mouth. Dendronephthya australis colonies occurred along the southern shoreline in the Port Stephens estuary between Fly Point and Corlette Point, but no colonies were found within sanctuary (no-take) zones within the marine park. The model illustrated limited habitat suitability for D. australis within a larger section of the estuary, suggesting this species has specific environmental requirements survival. Owing to its current threats (anchor damage and fishing line entanglement), implications from these findings will assist future management and protection decisions, particularly in regard to its protection within a marine park.

AB  - Selection of a modeling approach is an important step in the conservation planning process, but little guidance is available. We compared two statistical and three theoretical habitat modeling approaches representing those currently being used for avian conservation planning at landscape and regional scales: hierarchical spatial count (HSC), classification and regression tree (CRT), habitat suitability index (HSI), forest structure database (FS), and habitat association database (HA). We focused our comparison on models for five priority forest-breeding species in the Central Hardwoods Bird Conservation Region: Acadian Flycatcher, Cerulean Warbler, Prairie Warbler, Red-headed Woodpecker, and Worm-eating Warbler. Lacking complete knowledge on the distribution and abundance of each species with which we could illuminate differences between approaches and provide strong grounds for recommending one approach over another, we used two approaches to compare models: rank correlations among model outputs and comparison of spatial correspondence. In general, rank correlations were significantly positive among models for each species, indicating general agreement among the models. Worm-eating Warblers had the highest pairwise correlations, all of which were significant (P < 0.05). Red-headed Woodpeckers had the lowest agreement among models, suggesting greater uncertainty in the relative conservation value of areas within the region. We assessed model uncertainty by mapping the spatial congruence in priorities (i.e., top ranks) resulting from each model for each species and calculating the coefficient of variation across model ranks for each location. This allowed identification of areas more likely to be good targets of conservation effort for a species, those areas that were least likely, and those in between where uncertainty is higher and thus conservation action incorporates more risk. Based on our results, models developed independently for the same purpose (conservation planning for a particular species in a particular geography) yield different answers and thus different conservation strategies. We assert that using only one habitat model (even if validated) as the foundation of a conservation plan is risky. Using multiple models (i.e., ensemble prediction) can reduce uncertainty and increase efficacy of conservation action when models corroborate one another and increase understanding of the system when they do not.

AB  - Protected areas are important in conserving the rapid decline of biodiversity in the Anthropocene. Yet uncertainty persists whether protected areas will continue to meet conservation goals if climate change causes community or ecosystem shifts. Previous research has proven equivocal with some studies finding protected areas fail conservation objectives and others finding objectives are largely met. The effectiveness of protected area systems within tropical Asia and for insects are particularly under-studied. Using species distribution modeling of 68 butterfly species (15,346 locality records), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of protected areas in Hong Kong, one of the most well-covered (40% land area) protected area systems in the Asian tropics, and projected how the ability to protect biodiversity would change under different climate change scenarios and different conservation target schemes. Under climate change, 15-37% of the modeled species in 2000 were projected to become extirpated by 2050. Under all conservation target schemes, the proportion of species unprotected increased or leveled, by up to as much as 7%. If buffer grids were considered as unprotected, the increase in these gap species was much greater, by up to as much as 22%. These results together indicate that under climate change, the effectiveness of protected areas for butterflies in Hong Kong is likely to decrease despite the territory's relatively high proportion of protected area coverage. We also highlight here the importance of the fortification of partly protected areas in mediating biodiversity loss under the impacts of global change.

AB  - Species distribution models are widely used in conservation planning, but obtaining the necessary occurrence data can be challenging, particularly for rare species. In these cases, citizen science may provide insight into species distributions. To understand the distribution of the newly described and Critically Endangered Amazona lilacina, we collated species observations and reliable eBird records from 2010-2020. We combined these with environmental predictors and either randomly generated background points or absence points generated from eBird checklists, to build distribution models using MaxEnt. We also conducted interviews with people local to the species' range to gather community-sourced occurrence data. We grouped these data according to perceived expertise of the observer, based on the ability to identify A. lilacina and its distinguishing features, knowledge of its ecology, overall awareness of parrot biodiversity, and the observation type. We evaluated all models using AUC and Tjur R-2. Field data models built using background points performed better than those using eBird absence points (AUC = 0.80 +/- 0.02, Tjur R-2 = 0.46 +/- 0.01 compared to AUC = 0.78 +/- 0.03, Tjur R-2 = 0.43 +/- 0.21). The best performing community data model used presence records from people who were able recognise a photograph of A. lilacina and correctly describe its distinguishing physical or behavioural characteristics (AUC = 0.84 +/- 0.05, Tjur R-2 = 0.51 +/- 0.01). There was up to 92% overlap between the field data and community data models, which when combined, predicted 17,772 km(2) of suitable habitat. Use of community knowledge offers a cost-efficient method to obtain data for species distribution modelling; we offer recommendations on how to assess its performance and present a final map of potential distribution for A. lilacina.

AB  - Most current methods to assess connectivity begin with landscape resistance maps. The prevailing resistance models are commonly based on expert opinion and, more recently, on a direct transformation of habitat suitability. However, habitat associations are not necessarily accurate indicators of dispersal, and thus may fail as a surrogate of resistance to movement. Genetic data can provide valuable insights in this respect.
   We aim at directly comparing the utility of habitat suitability models for estimating landscape resistance versus other approaches based on actual connectivity data.
   We develop a framework to compare landscape resistance models based on (1) a genetic-based multi model optimization and (2) a direct conversion of habitat suitability into landscape resistance. We applied this framework to the endangered brown bear in the Cantabrian Range (NW Spain).
   We found that the genetic-based optimization produced a resistance model that was more related to species movement than were models produced by direct conversion of habitat suitability. Certain land cover types and transport infrastructures were restrictive factors for species occurrence, but did not appear to impede the brown bear movements that determined observed genetic structure.
   In this study case, habitat suitability is not synonymous with permeability for dispersal, and does not seem to provide the best way to estimate actual landscape resistance. We highlight the general utility of this comparative approach to provide a comprehensive and practical assessment of factors involved in species movements, with the final aim of improving the initiatives to enhance landscape connectivity in conservation planning.

AB  - Climate-informed spatial planning is urgently needed to guide initiatives aimed at both conserving biodiversity as a whole (e.g. protection of 30% of lands and waters by 2030) and recovering North American avifauna in particular. Various methods for prioritizing conservation areas exist, yet alternative methods may direct managers to different lands for protection, and thus varying recommendations for meeting area-based targets. Here, we used bird species distribution models and landcover projections to systematically evaluate two widely used methods for prioritizing areas most likely to facilitate the persistence of multiple species under climate change: 1) in situ macrorefugia, identified as areas of high predicted species retention; and 2) complementarity-based optimizations, identified using the Zonation conservation planning software. For 17 biogeographical groups in the continental United States, we compared priority areas for bird conservation derived from these two alternatives with respect to their spatial distributions and consensus (i.e. overlap), expected conservation outcomes (e.g. species and functional diversity), predicted climate change exposure, habitat characteristics, landscape configurations and degree of formal protection. Spatial distributions of priority areas differed by biogeographical group and method, with 40.5% consensus on average across groups. Consensus was extensive within mountainous and coastal regions, and limited at high latitudes (e.g. Alaska) and in flat, interior regions (e.g. grasslands). As expected, complementarity-based optimizations more efficiently represented species than retention-based in situ macrorefugia, especially for forest groups, and had greater overall biodiversity value and better habitat condition. Conversely, in situ macrorefugia encompassed higher elevations and larger contiguous patches and were expected to experience less winter-season warming. Formal protection averaged < 50% across biogeographical groups, regardless of prioritization method. Our findings illustrate the value of complementarity-based optimizations for bird conservation under climate change. More broadly, comparing approaches for prioritizing areas for long-term species persistence can reveal critical trade-offs in recommendations for climate-informed protected area planning.

AB  - Three of the four known feline species in Jordan are categorized as critically endangered, according to the latest Red List assessment of mammals in Jordan, of which caracal: Caracal caracal, sand cat Felis margarita, and jungle cat Felis chaus. The fourth species, discussed within this paper - the wild cat Felis silvestris, is a species of least concern. Human activities such as hunting, poisoning, habitat destruction, and fragmentation are among the pressures seriously affecting the small and restricted populations of critically endangered felines. This study is the first to provide predictions on habitat suitability for the four species based on the two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), predictions of how greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, of 2.6 (representing "very stringent" corrections to the number of greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere) and 8.5 (the "business-as -usual" or also known as the "worst -case scenario"). Results showed an alarming decline in suitable habitats for all species. The sand cat is predicted to lose its entire suitable habitats in 2050 and 2070 according to RCP 8.5, while both the caracal and jungle cat are to face the very precarious pressure of declined areas of suitable habitat. Jordan's network of protected areas was deemed inadequate, according to this study, to protect the feline species and maintain their population. As potential solutions to counter the combined anticipated impacts occurring from both human activities and anticipated climate forecasts, it is necessary to strengthen the enforcement of environmental policies intended to protect reserves and natural areas, strengthen ex-situ conservation measures, minimize human pressures, to cope with the predicted habitats loss in the future, and to review the current network of protected areas.

AB  - Aim To assess how the inclusion of predicted climate-change-related range shifts alters the spatial prioritization of habitats and predicted biodiversity benefits from systematic conservation planning under alternative realized climates.
   Location Victoria, Australia.
   Methods We combined predicted distribution patterns of freshwater fish under multiple climate scenarios with marginal benefit conservation planning algorithms to compare conservation outcomes from multiple planning scenarios based on predicted present and future range-shifted distributions. For each of these planning options, we examined the outcomes under a range of possible realized climates.
   Results Expected conservation outcomes under future climate scenarios were always better when potential range shifts were incorporated into the planning process, irrespective of which climate scenario was realized. However, the differences in conservation outcomes between planning strategies were often small, and expected conservation outcomes always were worse under altered climate scenarios than under a stable baseline climate scenario. River segments with variable rankings across planning scenarios reflected areas where risks of maladaptive prioritization are potentially high.
   Main conclusions This study highlights that greatest conservation gains will come from ongoing efforts to limit the degree of global warming. Nevertheless, within the constraints imposed by a changing climate, the inclusion of future range shifts in conservation plans can help insure against ineffective and potentially maladaptive prioritization decisions. The acknowledged caveats around statistical predictions of species distributions and range shifts also need to be considered when acting on the outputs from modelled predictions such as these.

AB  - The Brown bear (Ursus arctos Linnaeus, 1758) occupies contiguous areas in Eastern and Northern Europe. In Western Europe, the largest remnant populations occur in Cantabria, Spain and the Apennines, Italy. Under Italian law the bear and its occupied range are protected. The occupied range of the Apennine brown bear includes Majella National Park. However, information on the distribution within Majella NP is extrapolated and inconsistent, thus precluding evidence-based protected area and species management. To address this lack of information, bear presence records (1996-2010) were collated and corrected for observational bias. Multiple Species Distribution Models (SDMs) were created at 800m resolution to predict year-round and seasonal bear distribution. A hierarchical, stepwise maxent SDM approach was applied using climatic, terrain, vegetation, and anthropogenic predictors of bear distribution. Occupied ranges were identified by point density analysis of bear presence. Our climate-only SDMs predicted bear presence in areas with relatively low snowfall and temperate temperatures. Year-round bear distribution was also accurately predicted by using temperate-montane elevations and mesic, mesotrophic vegetation substrates, irrespective of vegetation. Ski-resorts were negative predictors of year-round bear occurrence. Bears were predicted in autumn and winter by beech forest, in spring by meadows and in summer by a variety of vegetation categories. The regional and our local models predicted bear throughout the south. However, our predicted and occupied range in the north includes the Orta valley and exclude alpine heights, contrary to the regional models. Only our summer bear range is similar to a regional SDM. We demonstrated that multiple maxent SDMs using a modest number of observations and a comprehensive set of environmental variables may generate essential distributional information for protected area and species management where full wildlife and food source censuses are lacking.

AB  - Maintaining connectivity among remaining natural areas has become increasingly important to ameliorate the negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on wildlife populations. Early corridor networks were based on structural connectivity (i.e. habitat structure) and designed to connect protected areas. In recent decades, many methods have been developed to increase the ecological realism of such corridor design to avoid misguided management. However, the multitude and complexity of methods can be a hurdle for conservation planners. Here, we combine a limited set of multiple methods to present a connectivity analysis framework that produces repeatable, intuitive, and ecologically relevant connectivity estimates. We use a modified habitat suitability analysis, accounting for protected area effectiveness, as a starting point for least-cost corridor estimates, and evaluate the network using graph theory. We apply the framework to an existing corridor network in Belize, Central America, by estimating potential functional connectivity for white-lipped peccaries Tayassu pecari between systematically identified core patches. We found that forest productivity and protected area effectiveness were important predictors of habitat suitability for white-lipped peccaries. The graph-theoretic network analyses identified particularly important core areas for overall landscape connectivity and indicated potentially weak links in the existing network, while the least-cost corridor outlines indicated general areas where the implementation of connectivity-enhancing measures could strengthen such weak links. With this study, we provide a framework to improve the scientific rigour, ecological meaningfulness, and conservation relevance of applied corridor network design.

AB  - Efficient conservation planning in managed forest landscapes requires knowledge about the location of functional habitat for specialised species. We explored the importance of different variables to predict habitat suitability for the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos Bechstein), a proposed umbrella species in deciduous forest. Specifically, we tested whether biophysical proxy variables indicating management intensity and the occurrence of natural processes constituted a useful complement to traditional remotely sensed data on tree species composition and forest stand age for modelling the woodpecker's habitat. Presence-absence of the woodpecker during the study period (1986-2006) in southwestern Sweden was explained by the area of edge habitats (forest bordering water or farmland) and wetland forest, and location relative to the historical marine limit. The number of years with occurrence of the woodpecker in a territory was explained by the area of forest bordering water and wetland forest. Among traditional forest variables, the area of deciduous forest had a strong positive effect on both woodpecker presence-absence and the number of years with occurrence. The results support the hypothesis that edge habitats and forest types subject to natural processes favouring deciduous trees and dead wood creation are valuable to the woodpecker and should be prioritised in conservation planning.

AB  - North America has a diverse array of mammalian species. Model projections indicate significant variations in future climate conditions of North America, and the habitats of woodland mammals of this continent may be particularly sensitive to changes in climate. We report on the potential spatial distributions of 13 wide-ranging, relatively common species of North American woodland mammals under future climate scenarios. We examined the potential influence of the mean and seasonal climate variables on the distribution of species. Presence-only occurrence records of species, four predictor variables, two future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5), and two time steps (current and 2070) were used to build species' distribution models using a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). Our results suggested that overall, 11 of the 13 species are likely to gain climatically suitable space (regions where climate conditions will be similar to those of area currently occupied) at the continental scale, but American martenMartes americanaand 'woodland' caribouRangifer tarandusare likely to lose suitable climate range by 2070. Furthermore, climate space is likely to be expanding northwards under future climate scenarios for most of the mammals, and many jurisdictions in the border region between Canada and the USA are likely to lose iconic species, such as mooseAlces alces. We identified regions as potential in situ and ex situ climate change refugia, which are increasingly considered to be important for biodiversity conservation. The model results suggest significant implications for conservation planning for the 13 mammalian species under global climate change, especially at fine spatial scales. Numerous species that are presently common at their southern range edge will be functionally or completely extirpated in 50 years. The potential in situ and ex situ climate change refugia could provide an effective support for adaptive strategies aimed at species conservation planning.

AB  - Unsuitable livestock farming is considered as a main driver of biodiversity loss. In the high elevation areas across the world, many subalpine and alpine natural herbaceous communities are highly sensitive to sheep overgrazing. Such habitats of high biogeographic and conservation value are refugia for slow-growing, locally rare, and cold -adapted species. However, at a regional scale, no maps of these sensitive habitats exist that the authorities could refer to for regulating grazing. We therefore studied the possibility of using habitat suitability modeling (HSM) to map five selected habitats that are potentially threatened by overgrazing in the Northern Alps of the Swiss canton of Fribourg. For each habitat, we defined a group of characteristic species and gathered their occurrences from national data centers. These occurrences were pooled within each group and used as presences to calibrate the HSM. High-resolution predictors (10 m) were used to achieve fine-scale modeling. The models predicted accurate and ecologically relevant distributions for three of the habitats: alpine swards and heaths on exposed ridges and peaks, unstable calcareous screes and vegetated snow patches. These results show that habitats that are topo-graphically and environmentally well-defined can be finely predicted by HSM using distributions of character-istic species for use in spatial conservation planning. In the context of summer pasture management, this helped us to translate the Swiss legal basis onto maps of authorized grazing pressure.

AB  - Borneo harbours more endemic carnivores than does any other island in the world except Madagascar, and almost half of the Bornean carnivore species have been classified by The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as globally threatened. Here, a systematic conservation planning framework highlighted key carnivore landscapes, conservation research and intervention priorities, and gaps in current knowledge of Bornean carnivore ecology. All single-species predictive habitat suitability index (HSI) models presented in this issue (20 species, comprising all carnivores on Borneo except otters [Lutrinae] and sun bear Helarctos malayanus) were standardised by converting HSI values into binary maps, and combined to derive species richness maps to discuss and delineate areas of conservation priority. The highest predicted carnivore species richness (defined here as the sum of the binary threshold maps), corresponds to interior lowland, upland and lower montane forest, whereas areas with lowest predicted species richness correspond to coastal lowlands already largely converted to oil palm plantations. The 12 proposed areas of conservation importance for carnivores focus on large landscapes and connectivity between subunits, many centred around the tri-national Heart of Borneo initiative, with additional areas for wetland/lowland species. A large proportion of these proposed conservation landscapes are being exploited for commercial purposes (e.g., logging concessions) and would, therefore, improve in conservation value if their management became more sustainable. The most important research priorities for Bornean carnivores are species resilience to altered and fragmented landscapes; under-surveyed regions; and the effects and relative intensity of hunting across the island. The most pressing conservation interventions include conservation research on the most threatened Bornean carnivores: the Bornean ferret badger Melogale everetti and Hose's civet Diplogale hosei (highland endemics), and the flat-headed cat Prionailurus planiceps and otter civet Cynogale bennettii (wetland specialists). Targeted conservation research and integration of research findings into decision-making, maintaining and restoring connectivity, raising awareness and improving enforcement and governance are also important conservation interventions. Although more resources are needed for conservation and research, the joint effort of scientists, conservationists and government authorities in the identification of key carnivore landscapes, research priorities and conservation issues which this study presents raises hope that more targeted conservation efforts for Bornean carnivores will follow in the future.

AB  - Climate change conservation planning relies heavily on correlative species distribution models that estimate future areas of occupancy based on environmental conditions encountered in present-day ranges. The approach benefits from rapid assessment of vulnerability over a large number of organisms, but can have poor predictive power when transposed to novel environments and reveals little in the way of causal mechanisms that define changes in species distribution or abundance. Having conservation planning rely largely on this single approach also increases the risk of policy failure. Mechanistic models that are parameterized with physiological information are expected to be more robust when extrapolating distributions to future environmental conditions and can identify physiological processes that set range boundaries. Implementation of mechanistic species distribution models requires knowledge of how environmental change influences physiological performance, and because this information is currently restricted to a comparatively small number of well-studied organisms, use of mechanistic modelling in the context of climate change conservation is limited. In this review, we propose that the need to develop mechanistic models that incorporate physiological data presents an opportunity for physiologists to contribute more directly to climate change conservation and advance the field of conservation physiology. We begin by describing the prevalence of species distribution modelling in climate change conservation, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of both mechanistic and correlative approaches. Next, we emphasize the need to expand mechanistic models and discuss potential metrics of physiological performance suitable for integration into mechanistic models. We conclude by summarizing other factors, such as the need to consider demography, limiting broader application of mechanistic models in climate change conservation. Ideally, modellers, physiologists and conservation practitioners would work collaboratively to build models, interpret results and consider conservation management options, and articulating this need here may help to stimulate collaboration.

AB  - Climate is a core aspect of a species' niche that is frequently incorporated into species distribution models (SDMs). The proliferation of readily accessible climate data is stimulating the increasing use of climate-based species distribution models (CSDMs) in conservation planning and management. However, it is uncertain how sensitive CSDMs are to the choice of climate data used. We compared the performance of maximum entropy-based CSDMs calibrated with seven different climate data sets (WorldClim, Chelsa, TerraClimate, Climate Research Unit Time-Series [CRU-TS], PRISM, StreamCat, and EarthEnv). For each species (four amphibians and two reptiles in California), we used a standardized, objective procedure to select climate predictors from each data set. We then assessed performance with standard metrics, calculated variable importance scores, and compared predicted distributions to historical range maps of the target species. The climate data set used affected CSDM performance, with models based on some data sets overpredicting and others underpredicting distribu-tions compared with historical range maps of each of the species. Critically, for the six species we tested, no one climate data set always performed worst or best. These results indicate that the effects of different climate data sets should be incorporated into model evaluation when developing, applying, and interpreting climate-based SDMs.

AB  - Conservation decisions must be made with limited funding and incomplete information. Ecological surveys can help reduce uncertainty and, in turn, potentially lead to better management decisions. However, conducting surveys can reduce funds available for implementing management actions and, in turn, can potentially lead to worse conservation outcomes. Here we develop a value of information framework to evaluate and optimize survey plans. Our framework evaluates survey plans based on their ability to improve how likely resulting protected area systems are to secure species of interest, and accounts for survey and land acquisition costs. Using an example of eight imperilled plant species in Middlesex County (Ontario, Canada), we assessed our framework against conventional approaches for designing survey plans that involve selecting places with (i) maximal geographic coverage, (ii) diverse environmental conditions, (iii) highly uncertain information, (iv) high imperilled species richness and (v) low protected area establishment costs. We found that optimized survey plans could improve the protected area system by, on average, 57.52% (0.21 SD) (up to 105.25%) over conventional survey approaches. These optimized plans could also improve the protected area system by, on average, 19.91% (up to 32.37%) over simply prioritizing based on existing information. Survey plans designed using conventional approaches, in many cases, led to a worse protected area system than simply using existing information. Such conventional approaches performed the worst when they allocated a large percentage of the available budget to data collection. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that conventional approaches for designing ecological surveys can impede conservation efforts by squandering funds on data that have little chance of improving decision making. Indeed, conventional approaches for designing surveys had the poorest performance under limited budgets, which are typical in real world planning exercises. We recommend that conservation practitioners carefully consider how data collection efforts can potentially improve conservation decisions, and also the costs associated with data collection. By applying the principles of value of information, our framework enables conservation practitioners to cost-effectively collect data in places that will maximize conservation outcomes.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning tools offer powerful and flexible means for addressing the protection of biodiversity in freshwater systems. Tools such as the software Zonation can be used to prioritize streams for protection, restoration, and management of aquatic resources. The flexible nature of these tools allow analyses to be tailored to specific objectives but also introduces uncertainty regarding the effects of selected input options on the rankings of stream segments and the representation of fish species within prioritized streams. The objective of our research was to evaluate the effectiveness of several species distribution modeling techniques (generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, boosted regression trees, and random forest models, including an ensemble based on these techniques) for characterizing distributions of fish communities and to identify the influence of different prioritization options of Zonation conservation planning software within five input classes (species occurrence data, removal rule, species weighting, connectivity, and protected area masking) on both the resulting stream segment rankings and the representation of species within priority streams. All combinations of input options were compared based on the correlation and congruence of stream rankings and the mean richness of species, minimum level of species representation, and representation of rare species within streams across priority levels. Of the distribution modeling types we evaluated, boosted regression trees performed the best, followed closely by random forest models. The use of an ensemble approach allowed for the largest number of species with robust predicted distributions. Our results also suggested that protected area masking had the largest effects on conservation priority results, followed by choice of removal rule, while species occurrence data type had limited impacts. The information contained in this chapter is meant to aid planners in understanding how their selection of conservation planning inputs is likely to impact results.

AB  - Protected areas are the basis of modern conservation systems, but current climate change causes gaps between protected areas and the species distribution ranges. To mitigate the impact of climate change on species distribution ranges, revision of protected areas are necessary. Alternatively, active management such as excluding competitive species or transplanting target species would be effective. In this study, we assessed optimal actions (revision of protected areas or active management) in each geographical region to establish an effective spatial conservation plan in Japan. Gaps between the protected areas and future potential habitats were assessed using species distribution models and 20 future climate simulations. Fagus crenata, an endemic and dominant species in Japan, was used as a target species. Potential habitats within the protected areas were predicted to decrease from 22,122 km(2) at present to 12,309 km(2) under future climate conditions. Sustainable potential habitats (consistent potential habitats both at present and in future) without the protected areas extended to 13,208 km(2), and were mainly found in northeast Japan. These results suggest that, in northeast Japan, revisions to protected areas would be effective in preserving sustainable potential habitats under future climate change. However, the potential habitats of southwestern Japan, in which populations were genetically different from northeastern populations, were predicted to virtually disappear both within and outside of protected areas. Active management is thus necessary in southwestern Japan to ensure intraspecific genetic diversity under future climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land clearance and disturbance in human-dominated landscapes have significant impacts on biodiversity internationally. Conservation planning can play a role in mitigating the effects of human-related activities. One element of conservation planning involves the analysis of the spatial arrangement of areas in a landscape and identifying characteristics that are underrepresented in protected areas. In this study, the distribution of protected areas in Victoria. Australia is assessed in relation to environmental space. We use comprehensiveness, adequacy and representativeness (CAR) criteria as a framework to examine the efficiency of existing protected areas and to define gaps in the current reserve system, based on multivariate environmental space. Our method is based on the conversion of combinations of environmental variables to biodiversity features. The analysis provides a systematic, quantitative gap analysis. Our framework provides feasible tools for involving CAR principles in evaluating the efficiency of reserve areas. Our metrics are transparent, simple to interpret and easy to implement. It is also applicable as a decision support system in land use and conservation planning for analysing future land development scenarios. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim
   Data shortages mean that conservation priorities can be highly sensitive to historical patterns of exploration. Here, we investigate the potential of regionally focussed species distribution models to elucidate fine-scale patterns of richness, rarity and endemism.
   Location
   Eastern Arc Mountains, Tanzania and Kenya.
   Methods
   Generalized additive models and land cover data are used to estimate the distributions of 452 forest plant taxa (trees, lianas, shrubs and herbs). Presence records from a newly compiled database are regressed against environmental variables in a stepwise multimodel. Estimates of occurrence in forest patches are collated across target groups and analysed alongside inventory-based estimates of conservation priority.
   Results
   Predicted richness is higher than observed richness, with the biggest disparities in regions that have had the least research. North Pare and Nguu in particular are predicted to be more important than the inventory data suggest. Environmental conditions in parts of Nguru could support as many range-restricted and endemic taxa as Uluguru, although realized niches are subject to unknown colonization histories. Concentrations of rare plants are especially high in the Usambaras, a pattern mediated in models by moisture indices, whilst overall richness is better explained by temperature gradients. Tree data dominate the botanical inventory; we find that priorities based on other growth forms might favour the mountains in a different order.
   Main conclusions
   Distribution models can provide conservation planning with high-resolution estimates of richness in well-researched areas, and predictive estimates of conservation importance elsewhere. Spatial and taxonomic biases in the data are essential considerations, as is the spatial scale used for models. We caution that predictive estimates are most uncertain for the species of highest conservation concern, and advocate using models and targeted field assessments iteratively to refine our understanding of which areas should be prioritised for conservation.

AB  - Climate change has modified the structure and functions of ecosystems, affecting human well-being. Evergreen plants in the warm-temperate ecosystems will lose climatically suitable habitats under climate change but have not drawn much scholarly interest. Therefore, the present research aimed to predict the future climatic niches of eight coastal warm-adapted evergreen trees under climate change to provide information for an effective management practice. For this purpose, we used the ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) weighted by the TSS value in modelling the climatic niches of those evergreen trees and then ensembled their future distributions predicted under 20 future climate scenarios. Except for Neolitsea sericea (True Skill Statistic (TSS) = 0.79), all projections for the current climatic niches of evergreens showed excellent predictive powers (TSS > 0.85). The results showed that the climatic niches of the four evergreens-Castanopsis cuspidata, Pittosporum tobira, Raphiolepis indica var. umbellate, and Eurya emarginata-would expand to the northern part of the Korean Peninsula (KP) under climate change, but the ones of the remaining four-Kadsura japonica, Neolitsea sericea, Ilex integra, and Dendropanax morbiferus-would shrink. While the climatic niches of Pittosporum tobira showed the rapidest and greatest expansion under climate change, Dendropanax morbiferus was predicted to experience the greatest loss of habitat. On the other hand, regardless of whether the future distributions of climatically suitable habitats would expand or contract, the highly suitable habitats of all species were predicted to decline under climate change. This may indicate that further climate change will degrade habitat suitability for all species within the distribution boundary and restrict continuous habitat expansions of expanding species or accelerate habitat loss of shrinking species. In addition, the future distributions of most coastal evergreens were found to be confined to coastal areas; therefore, sea-level rise would accelerate their habitat loss under climate change. The present study provides primary and practical knowledge for understanding climate-related coastal vegetation changes for future conservation planning, particularly on the Korean Peninsula.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems show more biodiversity loss than terrestrial or marine systems. We present a systematic conservation planning analysis in the Arctic Ocean drainage basin in Ontario, Canada, to identify key watersheds for the conservation of 30 native freshwater fish, including four focal species: lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, brook trout, and walleye. We created species distribution models for 30 native fish species and accounted for anthropogenic impacts. We used the "prioritizr" package in R to select watersheds that maximize species targets, minimize impacts, and meet area-based targets based on the Convention on Biological Diversity commitment to protect 17% of terrestrial and freshwater areas by 2020 and the proposed target to protect 30% by 2030. We found that, on average, 17.4% and 29.8% of predicted species distributions were represented for each of the 30 species in the 17% and 30% area-based solutions, respectively. The outcomes were more efficient when we prioritized for individual species, particularly brook trout, where 24% and 36% of its predicted distribution was represented in the 17% and 30% solutions, respectively. Future conservation planning should consider climate change, culturally significant species and areas, and the importance of First Nations as guardians and stewards of the land in northern Ontario.

AB  - The aim of this study is to predict changes in the distribution and extent of habitat forming species defined as "Priority Marine Habitats" (PMHs) in the North-East (NE) Atlantic under future scenarios of climate-induced environmental change. A Species Distribution Modelling method was used for each PMH to map the potential distribution of "most suitable" habitat. The area and percentage cover was calculated within each country's Exclusive Economic Zone for the baseline (2009) and the projected (2100) years. In addition, a conservation management score was calculated based on the number of PMHs that co-occur in assessment units. Overall, this study reveals the potential for movement and/or change in the extent of some PMHs across the NE Atlantic under an increased ocean temperature scenario (4 degrees C) by 2100. There are regional differences in the predicted changes and some countries will experience greater/different changes than others. The movement of biodiversity hotspots (where one or more PMHs occur in the same broad area) provides both opportunities and risks for conservation management that are discussed. Co-operation between neighbouring countries and marine regions will require substantial enhancement in order to provide a robust adaptive management strategy going forward. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Shengjin Lake wetland is located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. It is a typical lake-type wetland and is also an ideal place for rare cranes to overwintering. The changes of wetland landscape are closely related to the habitat quality of wintering cranes. It is of great significance to study the habitat change of wintering cranes in wetland for wetland ecological restoration and restoration. In this paper, we analyze four kinds of winter cranes and wetland landscape pattern types from the years 1986 to 2015. Also, we adopted the Pearson correlation analysis method to analyze the relationship between wetland landscape types and crane population, and the main landscape types of cranes habitat were obtained. We selected disturbance degree, food richness, vegetation cover, and hydrological condition as the main factors affecting wintering habitat of cranes. We established a habitat suitability index model for wintering cranes and generated habitat suitability assessment maps by ArcGIS. The results show that the change of landscape pattern in Shengjin Lake protected area was obvious, the number of wetland patches increased, the fragmentation degree of landscape increased, the landscape patch difference became smaller, and the diversity index and evenness index increased gradually. From 1986 to 2015, the number of wintering cranes decreased and the habitat suitability index of wintering cranes decreased from 0.845 to 0.465, and the habitat suitability of wintering cranes fell from 13,577.11 to 7424.42ha, which showed the overall habitat deteriorated significantly and had a positive correlation between the crane population and habitat suitability.

AB  - A recent shift in conservation policy from the site scale to the ecosystem or landscape scale requires underpinning by large-scale species distribution data. This poses a significant challenge in conserving small/less charismatic species (SLCS's) whose often cryptic nature can result in spatially restricted sampling, thus preventing landscape scale conservation projects from being realised for these ecologically important groups.
   Species distribution models (SDMs) can provide a powerful tool to bridge this gap. However, in the case of SLCS's (here lichen epiphytes in temperate rainforests of western Scotland are used as a model system), direct predictor variables exist at micro-scales (millimetres to centimetres), which are not extensively available in landscape-scale datasets. Here we identify a group of well-mapped larger-scale 'compound variables' which capture the effect of multiple direct predictors (such as bark pH and topography), and test whether they can be successfully used to predict species distributions at the landscape scale, circumventing the need for direct (micro scale) predictor data.
   By testing the SDMs more widely within western Scotland, accurate predictions of species presence/absence could be made throughout the region for 5 of the 9 lichen epiphytes, making these SDMs extremely valuable as a conservation planning tool.
   Species distribution models utilising compound variables as predictors offer a solution to the paucity of species distributional data for SLCS's, and present a valuable resource in conservation planning for such species. The importance of testing the SDMs outside of a training region to prevent prediction error is highlighted however.

AB  - As native ecosystems are degraded throughout the world, the importance of managing, conserving, and restoring wildlife habitat escalates. We must carefully consider which approach to habitat conservation is optimal, given that resources for habitat conservation are limited. One enticing option involves channeling limited resources to manage for a single umbrella species, assuming that a number of other species within the same ecosystem would also benefit. The danger inherent to this approach is that care must be taken when selecting an umbrella species that maximizes ecosystem-wide benefits. This paper presents a combination of methods to quantitatively evaluate if keystone species, given their integral role in affecting the ecosystem where they reside, can also function as effective umbrellas for habitat management. In a case study, we evaluate two imperiled keystone species, the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) and the red-cockaded woodpecker (Leucontopicus borealis), within a global biodiversity hotspot, the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem of North American coastal plain. We 1) develop spatial habitat models in MaxEnt for 10 terrestrial vertebrate wildlife species of conservation interest across an 11 million hectare region, 2) identify the preferred umbrella candidate with spatially-explicit correlation and range overlap analyses using ENMTools, and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen umbrella species with a testof niche similarity and quantitative habitat suitability comparisons in ArcGIS. Our results suggest the potential for an endemic keystone species to effectively function as an umbrella species. Specifically, we identified the gopher tortoise as the preferred umbrella, given the overlap in suitable habitat for 9 of 10 species evaluated in this ecosystem. These results are significant for habitat management within this region, but most importantly, this application of spatially-explicit modeling to quantitatively measure habitat suitability is an advance in approaches to habitat conservation planning. We encourage others to use these accessible methods and consider evaluating keystone species as umbrellas to optimize their approach for managing, conserving, and restoring ecosystems.

AB  - The ongoing biodiversity crisis is pushing ecologists and conservation biologists to develop models to foretell the effects of human-induced transformation of natural resources on the distribution of species, although ecology and biogeography still lacks a paradigmatic body of theory to fully understand the drivers of biodiversity patterns. Two decades of research on ecological niche models and species distributions have been characterized by technical development and discussions on a plethora of methods or algorithms to infer and predict species distributions. Here we suggest a metaphorical classification scheme for some of the most popular models based on their complexity, interpretability and suitability for specific applications in ecology and conservation biology. Our purpose is not to compare methods by their capacity to accurately predict the observed distribution of species, nor to criticize how they are commonly used in applied studies. Instead, we believe that a simple classification scheme can potentially highlight how some methods are more suited for specific applications in ecology and conservation biology. Envelope and distance-based models are grouped into the "fish bowl" category, for their transparency and simplicity. Statistical models are classified as "turbine" models, because of their hidden complexity and general applicability. Finally, machine-learning models are classified as "vault" models, for their high complexity and lack of interpretability of fit parameters. We conclude that the diversity of species distribution models used today is expected for a young research field, but the choice of modeling strategy depends on the purpose of the study. We provide some general guidelines for choosing models for studies of conservation planning and climate change mitigation and suggest models of intermediate complexity for conservation planning and forecast of climate change effects on biodiversity as they provide a good balance between interpretability, predictive power and robustness to model over-fit.

AB  - Conservation planning at broad spatial scales facilitates coherence between local land management and objectives set at the state or provincial level. Habitat suitability models are commonly used to identify key areas for conservation planning. The challenge is that habitat suitability models are data hungry, which limits their applicability to species for which detailed information exists, but managers need to address the needs of all at-risk species. We propose a modeling approach useful for regional-scale conservation planning that accommodates limited species knowledge, and identifies what managers should aim for at the local scale. For twenty at-risk bird species, we built models to identify potential habitat using both literature information and empirical data. Species occupancy within potential habitat depends on the presence of intrinsic elements, which we identified for each species so that managers can enhance these elements as appropriate. For most species, the estimated amount of habitat needed to meet population targets was <10% of the mapped potential habitat, with notable exceptions for Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis; 100%), Brown Thrasher (Toxostoma rufum; 63.7%), and Veery (Catharus fuscescens; 17.9%). Model validation showed that interior forest species models performed best. Our modeling framework allowed us to build potential habitat models to various endpoints for different species, depending on the information available, and revealed a number of species for which basic natural history data are missing. Our potential habitat models provide regional perspective and guide local habitat management, and assist in identifying research priorities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Inventoried roadless areas (IRAs) in national forests in the contiguous United States (CONUS) are public lands that are ecologically intact and could be prime candidates for addition to the protected-area system, thereby contributing to the goal of protecting 30% of the Earth by 2030. Despite calls both to protect roadless areas and to downgrade them, we know surprisingly little about the importance of IRAs as habitat for vulnerable wildlife species. We assessed the importance of IRAs-in total and individually-as habitat for wildlife species of conservation concern (SCCs) and, for context, compared their habitat value to that of other national forest lands and CONUS lands in general. We also quantified how well the protected-area system would provide habitat for wildlife SCCs if all unprotected IRAs were added to it. Of the 537 wildlife SCCs in CONUS, 308 species (57%) have at least some suitable habitat in one or more IRAs. The median IRA contains suitable habitat for 10 wildlife SCCs, with a maximum of 62 wildlife SCCs. Despite their geographic and elevational clustering and predominance of a single biome type, IRAs provide a larger proportion of suitable habitat for multiple wildlife SCCs than non-IRA CONUS lands. The median number of wildlife SCCs' suitable habitat per 900-m2 pixel is also slightly higher in IRAs than in most national forest wilderness areas, national monuments, and other currently protected areas. If all IRAs were added to the protected-area system in CONUS, there would be a substantial decrease (-38) in the number of wildlife SCCs that are currently considered "poorly represented" in protected areas. In this study we provide quantitative information about the importance of IRAs as habitat for vulnerable wildlife species so that stakeholders, agency staff, and lawmakers can make informed choices about where to invest limited resources for conservation.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the biggest threats to amphibian populations and anthropogenic climate change may exacerbate these. The response of Iran's amphibians to climate change is uncertain and yet making an accurate prediction of how the species will respond is critical for conservation. We assessed how expected future climate scenarios before the years 2050 and 2070 might influence the geographic distribution and habitat connectivity of the Lorestan Mountain Newt (Neurergus kaiseri). We examined presence data (2010-2018) of the species according to environmental and anthropogenic factors, and created an ensemble model of habitat suitability based on eight species distribution models (SDMs). Then, we used the concept of circuit theory to estimate potential linkages between the habitat patches. We applied the ensemble calibrated models and quantified spatial connectivity to assess the influence of climate change on the species range for the years 2050 and 2070 under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of three general circulation models (GCMs). Models using current climate predicted that 6.8% of the 267,609 km(2 )study area has suitable conditions for the species, but only about 7% of these climatically suitable landscapes are covered by conservation areas. Temperature and precipitation-related climatic variables made the largest contribution to the distribution model. Under projected climate conditions, we found a decline of 56-98% of the suitable habitat and predicted a potential for distributional shifts towards higher elevations by 2050 and 2070. Although there is relatively good connectivity between many habitat patches today, models predict that suitable areas available to the newt will become increasingly fragmented under projected climate change scenarios. Our findings support the hypothesis that projected climatic shifts will negatively influence suitable habitats of amphibians and likely cause upward shifts in elevation in range of some species. Identifying potentially suitable habitats and important linkages between habitat patches under different climate scenarios are crucial steps in conservation planning for the Lorestan Mountain Newt.

AB  - There is an increasing need to model the distribution of species and habitats for effective conservation planning, but there is a paucity of models for the marine environment. We used presence (131) and absence (219) records of the marine angiosperm Zostera marina L from the archipelago of SW Finland, northern Baltic Sea, to model its distribution in a 5400 km(2) area. We used depth, slope, turbidity, wave exposure and distance to sandy shores as environmental predictors, and compared a presence-absence method: generalised additive model (GAM), with a presence only method: maximum entropy (Maxent). Models were validated using semi-independent data sets. Both models performed well and described the niche of Z marina fairly consistently, although there were differences in the way the models weighted the environmental variables, and consequently the spatial predictions differed somewhat. A notable outcome from the process was that with relatively equal model performance, the area actually predicted in geographical space can vary by twofold. The area predicted as suitable for Z marina by the ensemble was almost half of that predicted by the GAM model by itself. The ensemble of model predictions increased the model predictive capability marginally and clearly shifted the model towards a more conservative prediction, increasing specificity, but at the same time sacrificing sensitivity. The environmental predictors selected into the final models described the potential distribution of Z. marina well and showed that in the northern Baltic the species occupies a narrow niche, typically thriving in shallow and moderately exposed to exposed locations near sandy shores. We conclude that a prediction based on a combination of model results provides a more realistic estimate of the core area suitable for Z. marina and should be the modelling approach implemented in conservation planning and management.

AB  - AimSpecies and ecosystems may be unable to keep pace with rapid climate change projected for the 21st century. We evaluated an underexplored dimension of the mismatch between climate and biota: limitations to forest growth and succession affecting habitat suitability. Our objective was to inform continental-scale conservation for boreal songbirds under disequilibria between climate, vegetation and fauna.
   LocationBoreal and southern arctic ecoregions of North America.
   MethodsWe used forest inventory and avian survey data to classify 53 species by seral-stage affinity and applied these to generate alternative projections of changes in species' core habitat distributions based on different vegetation lag-time assumptions. We used our seral stage-modified refugia approach and the Zonation algorithm to identify multispecies boreal conservation priorities over the 21st century. We evaluated the sensitivity of land rankings to seral-stage affinity and species' weights and assessed the conservation value of the existing protected areas network compared to Zonation results.
   ResultsEnd-of-century projected changes in songbird distribution were reduced by up to 169% when vegetation lags were considered. Zonation land rankings based on unconstrained climate projections were concentrated at high latitudes, whereas those based on strict and modified refugia scenarios were concentrated in coastal and high-elevation areas, as well as biome transition zones, which were fairly consistent over time and species weights. The existing protected areas network covering 14% of the study area was estimated to conserve 12-14% of baseline avian biodiversity across time periods and scenarios, compared to 16-25% for top-ranked Zonation areas.
   Main conclusionsFor some boreal songbirds, limits to forest growth and succession may result in dramatic reductions in suitable habitat over the next century. Our seral stage-adjusted approach provides conservative and efficient boreal conservation priorities anchored around climatic macrorefugia that are robust to century-long climate change and complement the current protected areas network.

AB  - The huge conservation interest that mammals attract and the large datasets that have been collected on them have propelled a diversity of global mammal prioritization schemes, but no comprehensive global mammal conservation strategy. We highlight some of the potential discrepancies between the schemes presented in this theme issue, including: conservation of species or areas, reactive and proactive conservation approaches, conservation knowledge and action, levels of aggregation of indicators of trend and scale issues. We propose that recently collected global mammal data and many of the mammal prioritization schemes now available could be incorporated into a comprehensive global strategy for the conservation of mammals. The task of developing such a strategy should be coordinated by a super-partes, authoritative institution (e.g. the International Union for Conservation of Nature, IUCN). The strategy would facilitate funding agencies, conservation organizations and national institutions to rapidly identify a number of short-term and long-term global conservation priorities, and act complementarily to achieve them.

AB  - BackgroundThe Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus muta japonica lives in the alpine zones of central Japan, which is the southern limit of the global distribution for this species. This species is highly dependent on alpine habitats, which are considered vulnerable to rapid climate change. This study aimed to assess the impact of climate change on potential L. muta japonica habitat based on predicted changes to alpine vegetation, to identify population vulnerability under future climatic conditions for conservation planning. We developed species distribution models, which considered the structure of the alpine ecosystem by incorporating spatial hierarchy on specific environmental factors to assess the potential habitats for L. muta japonica under current and future climates. We used 24 general circulation models (GCMs) for 2081-2100 as future climate conditions.ResultsThe predicted potential habitat for L. muta japonica was similar to the actual distribution of the territories in the study area of Japan's northern Alps (36.25-36.5 degrees N, 137.5-137.7 degrees E). Future potential habitat for L. muta japonica was projected to decrease to 0.4% of the current potential habitat in the median of occurrence probabilities under 24 GCMs, due to a decrease in alpine vegetation communities. Some potential habitats in the central and northwestern part of the study area were predicted to be sustained in the future, depending on the GCMs.ConclusionsOur model results predicted that the potential habitats for L. muta japonica in Japan's northern Alps, which provides core habitat for this subspecies, would be vulnerable by 2081-2100. Small sustainable habitats may serve as refugia, facilitating the survival of L. muta japonica populations under future climatic conditions. Impact assessment studies of the effect of climate change on L. muta japonica habitats at a nationwide scale are urgently required to establish effective conservation planning for this species, which includes identifying candidate areas for assisted migration as an adaptive strategy.

AB  - For species that are increasingly threatened by the combined impacts of habitat loss and climate change, the identification of priority regions for conservation planning efforts is urgently required. In the case of specialist folivores, consideration of the effects of climate change on the distributions of their essential food resources should be a key component of conservation planning. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) was listed in 2012 as vulnerable under Australian Commonwealth Government law. Here, we incorporate species distribution models for the koala, an arboreal marsupial, and its specialized food resources, to identify broad-scale priority conservation regions. We demonstrate a spatial prioritization approach that informs conservation planning and that links the shifting distribution of this declining species and its critical food resources under climate change. We find that the inclusion of food plants affected the identification of priority regions for conserving koalas, and that priority regions for the conservation of this species are predicted to shift considerably, often outside the current range of this species, posing additional challenges for its conservation.

AB  - Species distribution models provide habitat mapping tools and produce scalable information to inform policy decisions. Integrating spatial statistical modelling with bioclimatic information identifies the contribution of the most critical variable in species occurrence and distribution. In the present study a suitable bioclimatic model, MaxEnt modelling algorithm is used for Dipterocarpus indicus, an endemic and endangered species by incorporating field inventory data.This model predicted a high probability of potential distribution area in the forests of Uttara Kannada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga and Kannur. The highly suitable habitats are distributed in protected areas, namely Kudremukh, Mookambika, Pushpagiri, Sharavathi Valley, Shettihalli, Someshwara, Parambikulam, Peechi-Vazhani, Shendurney, Thattekadu Bird, Indira Gandhi (Anamalai), Kalakad, Mundanthurai and Kanyakumari. The Area Under Curve value for the potential distribution of species is observed at 0.894 for training data. The highest fractional predicted area was in the low elevation tropical wet evergreen forest region between 50 and 700 m. The contributions of the climatic variables in the model showed that precipitation in the coldest quarter was the most influential, followed by annual mean temperature and annual precipitation. This study aids in long-term conservation planning, monitoring, and managing potential habitats of endemic and endangered tree species.

AB  - Change in future climate will either expand, contract or shift the climatic niche of many species and this could lead to shifting of their geographical ranges. Species distribution models identify habitat over a specified area that may have similar ecological characteristics of a species in question. We modelled current and future distribution of endangered Himalayan Musk Deer (Moschus chrysogaster), referred here as HMD, in Nepal Himalaya based on two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the year 2050 and 2070 using MaxEnt and MIROC5 global climate models (GCM). Annual mean temperature, altitude, isothermality and land cover were the major contributing variables to the model with area under ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve (AUC) being 0.975. Almost 7.7% (11,342 km(2)) area of the country is currently suitable for HMD. The model shows that a majority of current suitable habitat will remain stable under both RCPs in the future though 29.47% of the current suitability will be decreased by 2070 under RCP4.5, mostly in the western and far western regions. Overall, the shift of habitat shows a longitudinal pattern. Existing protected areas (PM) account for 52.6% of the total suitable habitat area, and shows variability of changes in suitability under both RCPs in the future. Initiation of trans-boundary conservation programs could offset the likely climate change impact on HMD habitat in Nepal and adjoining native Himalayan ranges.

AB  - Aim Estimate the current and future distribution of brown trout and identify priority areas for conservation of the species. Location Rhone River basin and Mediterranean streams. Methods We first developed a spatially explicit species distribution model to estimate the current and future distribution of brown trout for three time horizons (2030, 2055 and 2080) and two climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). We then performed a prioritization analysis to identify priority areas for brown trout conservation, accounting for: (a) spatial dependencies along the riverine system, (b) several sources of uncertainty arising from climate-related forecasts and (c) different protected area scenarios by comparing hypothetical, optimal protected networks to an actual protected network designed by regional fish experts. Results Future projections of brown trout densities exhibited a general trend towards a gradual range contraction, with a significant risk of extirpation across mountainous regions of low to mid-elevation. Overall, the projected current and future distributions were well-covered by the existing protected network. In addition, up to 70% of the river reaches included in this expert-based protection network were also priorities in the optimal priority set (e.g. the best set of areas to maximize biodiversity protection). Finally, a large proportion of these reaches were invariably identified regardless of climate change scenarios and uncertainties or spatial dependencies. Main conclusions Our analytical approach highlighted priority areas for brown trout conservation which were robust to a set of climate and connectivity assumptions. This core priority network could be further refined by taking into account key fine-scale processes like thermal refugia. Therefore, we advocate for combining computational and expert-based approaches in conservation planning of riverine ecosystems to achieve a relevant consensus between regional-scale management and fine-grain ecological knowledge.

AB  - In this study, scenario development based on changes in key socioeconomic drivers (namely, the prices of conventional food products, rural development policies and agro-environmental regulations) was used together with resource-based habitat suitability models to develop plausible visions of future pathways of agricultural land use and evaluate their potential consequences on conservation of target species. Analyses focused on three steppe bird species in a protected Natura 2000 area, located in the Iberian Peninsula. Our results showed that changes in land use composition under different scenarios can have important effects on habitat suitability, but that the size of those effects would vary depending on species-specific requirements and spatial distribution of land use changes. Positive effects of some new crops in the study area (grain legumes and aromatic plants) on studied species were suggested by our analyses. A positive effect of aggregation of land use changes was also found for two of the studied species. Scenario building and forecasting using transferable inter-disciplinary knowledge can therefore improve our capability to anticipate future changes and provide timely advice towards long-term conservation planning in agricultural systems.

AB  - As marine predators experience increasing anthropogenic pressures, there is an urgent need to understand their distribution and their drivers to inform spatial conservation planning. We used an ensemble modelling approach to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis) in relation to a variety of ecogeographical and anthropogenic variables in Coffin Bay, Thorny Passage Marine Park, South Australia. Further, we evaluated the overlap between current spatial management measures and important dolphin habitat. Dolphins showed no distinct seasonal shifts in distribution patterns. Models of the entire study area indicate that zones of high probability of dolphin occurrence were located mainly within the inner area of Coffin Bay. In the inner area, zones with high probability of dolphin occurrence were associated with shallow waters (2-4 m and 7-10 m) and located within 1,000 m from land and 2,500 m from oyster farms. The multimodal response curve of depth in the models likely shows how the different dolphin communities in Coffin Bay occupy different embayments characterized by distinct depth patterns. The majority of areas of high (> 0.6) probability of dolphin occurrence are outside sanctuary zones where multiple human activities are allowed. The inner area of Coffin Bay is an important area of year-round habitat suitability for dolphins. Our results can inform future spatial conservation decisions and improve protection of important dolphin habitat.

AB  - 1. The combined effects of climate change and other factors, such as land-use change or fire disturbance, pose daunting challenges for biodiversity conservation world-wide.
   2. We predicted the future effectiveness of the Natura 2000 (N2000), the current network of protected areas (PA) in Europe, at maintaining and representing suitable environmental conditions for a set of 79 bird species between 2000 and 2050 in a fire-prone area, strongly affected by land abandonment processes in North East Spain. We then compared PA performance with a set of alternative priority areas for conservation, which consider fire-vegetation dynamics, selected by using a conservation planning tool (MARXAN). Fire-vegetation dynamics were modelled using a process-based model (MEDFIRE MODEL) under alternative fire management and climate change scenarios. Bird communities were predicted using the spatially explicit species assemblage modelling framework (SESAM) and species distribution models that hierarchically integrate climate change and wildfire-vegetation dynamics.
   3. The amount of suitable environmental conditions within the N2000 network was predicted to fall by around 15%, on average, over the next decades in relation to the initial conditions but could be partially modulated by fire management policies in future. The efficiency of the current PA system was predicted to decrease from 17.4% to 15% between 2000 and 2050. However, a more efficient PA system could be achieved with a conservation planning approach that explicitly considers fire-vegetation dynamics and their management.

AB  - Conservation of native populations such as Gulf-strain striped bass Morone saxatilis is a priority for preserving historic fisheries and maintaining biodiversity. Habitat alteration is thought to be the primary driver of native striped bass decline in Mississippi coastal rivers, so it is a priority to understand current habitat suitability as part of a comprehensive restoration plan. A bioenergetics model is a useful tool to examine habitat suitability by using growth rate potential as an indicator of habitat quality. The purpose of this study was to develop a habitat suitability model for Gulf-strain striped bass that incorporates seasonal and spatial variability in temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen in an index river system along the Gulf of Mexico coast, Mississippi. Environmental data collected with a stratified-random survey during fall, winter, spring, and summer of 2008-2009 were incorporated into a spatially explicit bioenergetics model. Model-predicted growth rates were analyzed by season and salinity zone in a geographical information system framework. Model results suggested that growth rate patterns significantly differed spatially and between summer and the other seasons. Habitat suitability is greatly reduced during summer and concentrated in specific parts of the river system, suggesting the existence of habitat hot spots that are potentially important to population viability. Gulf-strain striped bass appear to be nonmigratory; therefore, high summer temperatures in the river system make upper thermal tolerance the most important factor limiting summer distributions and growth of these fish. Additional laboratory studies on Gulf-strain striped bass' environmental tolerances and habitat use are needed. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates the value of habitat suitability assessment as a tool for fish conservation planning.

AB  - Global biodiversity priorities are primarily addressed through the establishment or expansion of conservation areas (CAs). Spatial prioritization of these CAs can help minimize biodiversity loss by accounting for the uneven distribution of biodiversity and conservation considerations (e.g., accessibility, cost, and biodiversity threats). Furthermore, optimized spatial priorities can help facilitate the judicious use of limited conservation resources by identifying cost effective CA designs. Here, we demonstrate how key species and ecosystems can be incorporated into systematic conservation planning to propose the expansion and addition of new CAs in the biodiversity-unique and data-poor region of Qinghai Plateau, China. We combined species distribution models with a systematic conservation planning tool, MARXAN to identify CAs for biodiversity on Qinghai Plateau. A set of 57 optimal CAs (273,872 km(2), 39.3 % of this Province) were required to achieve the defined conservation targets in Qinghai Province. We also identified 29 new CAs (139,216 km(2), 20% of Qinghai Province) outside the existing nature reserve (NRs) that are necessary to fully achieve the proposed conservation targets. The conservation importance of these 29 new CAs was also indicated, with 10 labeled as high priority, 11 as medium priority, and 8 as low priority. High priority areas were more abundant in the eastern and southeastern parts of this region. Our results suggest that many species remain inadequately protected within the Qinghai Plateau, with conservation gaps in eastern and northwestern regions. The proposed more representative and effective CAs can provide useful information for adjusting the existing NRs and developing the first National Park in China.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to be a major threat for biodiversity and, from a conservation prospective, it is important to understand how ecosystems may respond to that change. Predicted climate change effects on the distribution of meadows in the arid and semi-arid Argentinean Patagonia by 2050 were assessed for change trends and areas of desertification vulnerability using species distribution models (SDM) and climate-change models. Four modelling techniques composed an ensemble-forecasting approach. Suitable areas for meadows will decrease by 7.85% by 2050 given predicted changes in climate. However, there were two contrasting trends: severe reduction of suitable areas for meadows in north-west Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego Island, and an expansion of suitable areas for meadows in the south and a small section in the north-west. Meadows in Patagonia will likely be impacted by climate change, probably due to changes in precipitation regimes, and consequently many species that rely on meadows in an arid environment will also be impacted. Given the low level of protection of meadows in Patagonia, such information on meadow distribution and vulnerability to climate change will be important for increasing and improving the network of conservation areas through conservation planning.

AB  - Many studies have overestimated species' range shifts under climate change because they treat climate as the only determinant while ignoring biotic factors. To assess the response of giant pandas to climate change, we incorporated spatial effects in modeling bamboo distributions, which in turn was incorporated to represent giant panda-bamboo biotic interactions in predicting giant panda distribution. Our study revealed potential tolerance of giant pandas to climate change. We found significant residual spatial correlation in the bamboo models. The biotic interactions with bamboo understories and anthropogenic activities had large effects on panda distribution, which lowered the relative importance of climatic variables. Our results are fundamentally different from previous studies that used climate-only and nonspatial approaches, which may have overestimated the effects of climate change on panda and lead to inappropriate conservation recommendations. We strongly advocate that giant panda conservation planning continues to focus on protecting bamboo forest and reducing anthropogenic interferences.

AB  - Museum records have great potential to provide valuable insights into the vulnerability, historic distribution, and conservation of species, especially when coupled with species-distribution models used to predict species' ranges. Yet, the increasing dependence on species-distribution models in identifying conservation priorities calls for a more critical evaluation of model robustness. We used 11 bird species of conservation concern in Brazil's highly fragmented Atlantic Forest and data on environmental conditions in the region to predict species distributions. These predictions were repeated for five different model types for each of the 11 bird species. We then combined these species distributions for each model separately and applied a reserve-selection algorithm to identify priority sites. We compared the potential outcomes from the reserve selection among the models. Although similarity in identification of conservation reserve networks occurred among models, models differed markedly in geographic scope and flexibility of reserve networks. It is essential for planners to evaluate the conservation implications of false-positive and false-negative errors for their specific management scenario before beginning the modeling process. Reserve networks selected by models that minimized false-positive errors provided a better match with priority areas identified by specialists. Thus, we urge caution in the use of models that overestimate species' occurrences because they may misdirect conservation action. Our approach further demonstrates the great potential value of museum records to biodiversity studies and the utility of species-distribution models to conservation decision-making. Our results also demonstrate, however, that these models must be applied critically and cautiously.

AB  - Climate change has already impacted ecosystems and species and substantial impacts of climate change in the future are expected. Species distribution modeling is widely used to map the current potential distribution of species as well as to model the impact of future climate change on distribution of species. Mapping current distribution is useful for conservation planning and understanding the change in distribution impacted by climate change is important for mitigation of future biodiversity losses. However, the current distribution of Chinese caterpillar fungus, a flagship species of the Himalaya with very high economic value, is unknown. Nor do we know the potential changes in suitable habitat of Chinese caterpillar fungus caused by future climate change. We used MaxEnt modeling to predict current distribution and changes in the future distributions of Chinese caterpillar fungus in three future climate change trajectories based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs: RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 6.0) in three different time periods (2030, 2050, and 2070) using species occurrence points, bioclimatic variables, and altitude. About 6.02% (8,989 km(2)) area of the Nepal Himalaya is suitable for Chinese caterpillar fungus habitat. Our model showed that across all future climate change trajectories over three different time periods, the area of predicted suitable habitat of Chinese caterpillar fungus would expand, with 0.11-4.87% expansion over current suitable habitat. Depending upon the representative concentration pathways, we observed both increase and decrease in average elevation of the suitable habitat range of the species.

AB  - AimUnderstanding the spatial and temporal variation in the distribution of migratory species is critical for management and conservation efforts. However, challenges in observing mobile marine species throughout their migratory pathways can impede the identification of critical habitat, linkages between these habitats and threat-mitigation strategies. This study aimed to gain insight into the long-term residency and movement patterns of the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) and to reveal important habitat in the context of R.typus usage of existing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).
   LocationSouth-eastern Indian Ocean.
   MethodsSatellite telemetry was used to remotely track the long-term movements of 29 R.typus, and to quantify shark usage of the existing MPA network. From the tracking data and environmental predictors, nonlinear models were developed to predict suitable R.typus habitat throughout the south-eastern Indian Ocean.
   ResultsThis study includes the first documented complete return migrations by R.typus to Ningaloo Marine Park, which was found to be an important area for R.typus all year-round. We found that while existing MPAs along Australia's west coast do afford some protection to R.typus, telemetry-based habitat models revealed large areas of suitable habitat not currently protected, particularly along the Western Australian coast, in the Timor Sea, and in Indonesian and international waters.
   Main conclusionsAnimal-borne telemetric devices allowed the gathering of long-term spatial information from the elusive and highly mobile R.typus, revealing the spatial scale of their migration in the south-eastern Indian Ocean. Suitable habitat was predicted to occur inside conservation areas, but our findings indicate that the current MPA network may not sufficiently protect R.typus throughout the year. We suggest that telemetry-based habitat models can be an important tool to inform conservation planning and spatial management efforts for migratory species.

AB  - Each species is uniquely influenced by anthropogenic climate change. Change in temperature and precipitation due to climate change may lead to species adaptation or extinction, or in some cases, a range shift. To know the influence of climate change on a restricted and endemic bird species of the Western Ghats (WG), White-bellied Sholakili (WBS) Sholicola albiventris (Blanford, 1868), we conducted a study by using species distribution modelling. We considered 73 spatial bias-corrected occurrence points of WBS along with environmental variables like the mean temperature of coldest quarter (Bio 11), precipitation of driest month (Bio 14) and mean pre-cipitation of warmest quarter (Bio 18). We used the MaxEnt application with ENM evaluate tool in R statistical package for developing a climate model for WBS. Bio 11 was observed to be the most crucial climate variable shaping the habitat of WBS. The current study predicts that only 2823km2 in WG is suitable for WBS. One-third of this area falls under the protected area network, of which 52% is becoming unsuitable to this narrow endemic due to climate warming. The model also predicts 26% to 45% habitat loss under different climate change sce-narios by the 2050s.

AB  - P>1. Protected area networks for river ecosystems must account for the highly connected nature of river habitats and the fact that conditions in distant locations can influence downstream habitats and biota. We used Marxan conservation planning software to address the unique constraints of reserve design in river ecosystems and structure a reserve network to overcome key challenges to freshwater conservation.
   2. The range limits of 63 fish species in Mesoamerica were predicted and used in Marxan to design a network of conservation focal areas that encompasses 15% of the range of each species in areas with low risk of environmental degradation. Upstream risk intensity was estimated by propagating landscape-based sources of stress downstream along the direction of flow in GIS. We constrained Marxan solutions to account for basin divides, and we defined critical management zones to include important habitats that contribute to species persistence and mitigate threats.
   3. The proposed reserve network encompassed 11% of the study area, half of which was contained within existing protected areas. Our exercise also identified important gaps in protection. Because terrestrial-based environmental risks were propagated through the river network and considered in the solution, focal areas were constrained to catchments with low levels of upstream human activity. Addition of critical management zones - riparian buffers and fish migration corridors - expanded the network area by one-fifth.
   4. Our application of Marxan allowed longitudinal connectivity and topographic barriers to species movement to be considered. Adding critical management zones expanded the size of the reserve network, but is crucial to the network's conservation efficacy. We call for an evaluation of the added management capacity needed to conserve critical management zones and suggest ways to further improve the reserve design process.

AB  - Predictions of future species' ranges under climate change are needed for conservation planning, for which species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used. However, global climate model-based (GCM) output grids can bias the area identified as suitable when these are used as SDM predictor variables, because GCM outputs, typically at least 50X50 km, are biologically coarse. We tested the assumption that species ranges can be equally well portrayed in SDMs operating on base data of different grid sizes by comparing SDM performance statistics and area selected by four SDMs run at seven grid sizes, for nine species of contrasting range size. Area selected was disproportionately larger for SDMs run on larger grid sizes, indicating a cut-off point above which model results were less reliable. Up to 2.89 times more species range area was selected by SDMs operating on grids above 50X50 km, compared to SDMs operating at 1 km(2). Spatial congruence between areas selected as range also diverged as grid size increased, particularly for species with ranges between 20 000 and 90 000 km(2). These results indicate the need for caution when using such data to plan future protected areas, because an overly large predicted range could lead to inappropriate reserve location selection.

AB  - The prediction of species distribution is emerging as an important tool for conservation and rehabilitation planning of economically important plant species including medicinal and aromatic plants. Paris polyphylla, an economically and high valued medicinal plant of Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) is reported to lose its habitat area due to over-exploitation. In this study, attempts were made to understand vegetation pattern and find the potential distribution of Paris polyphylla, using MaxEnt in Pindar Valley (2000-4000 m ASL), Bageshwar district of Uttarakhand state, India. MaxEnt is a machine learning data mining technique that estimates a species distribution by finding the distribution of maximum entropy, based on existing knowledge. Phytosociological studies revealed the varying density of target species ranging from 0.50 ind/m(2) (P1; 2000 m asl) to 2.00 ind/m(2) (P6; 2500 m asl). Among the different geographical provinces of Uttarakhand, MaxEnt predicted wider potential distribution of P. polyphylla in temperate forest with an overall estimated area of 790.85 km(2) as suitable. It was found that Precipitation, Elevation and Vegetation type were the most important variables for predicting the habitat suitability. Dwali (ca. 2500 m ASL) site was predicted as a potential distribution area of P. polyphylla with ground-based validation and further suggested this area as a potential reintroduction site. The results of this study can be used to plan protection and re-introduction of P. polyphylla in the region. MaxEnt approach is thus a very promising tool in species conservation planning and in predicting the potential distribution of other high valued medicinal plants of IHR.

AB  - Aim Using survey data for North American birds, we assess how well historical patterns of species richness are explained by stacked species distribution models and macroecological models. We then describe the degree to which projections of future species richness differ, employing both modelling approaches across multiple emissions scenarios.
   Location USA and Canada.
   Methods We use Audubon Christmas Bird Count and North American Breeding Bird Survey data to estimate current and future species richness of birds using two distinct approaches. In the first, we model richness by stacking predictions from individual species distribution models. In the second, we model richness directly, ignoring the contributions of specific taxa to richness estimates.
   Results The two modelling approaches show similar accuracies when validated with historical observations, particularly winter observations, and result in similar patterns of richness when projected onto current and future climate spaces. Patterns of projected change in species richness differed markedly between winter and summer seasons regardless of modelling approach. Our models suggest that bird species richness in winter will increase or remain stable across much of North America. In contrast, species richness in summer is projected to decrease over much of North America, except part of northern Canada, suggesting that climate may constrain many breeding bird species and communities in the future.
   Main conclusions Stacked species distribution models and macroecological models produce similar estimates of current and future species richness for each of two seasons despite being built on different concepts of community assembly. Our results suggest that, although the mechanisms that shape geographical variation in biodiversity remain uncertain, these limitations do not impede our ability to predict patterns of species richness at broad scales. Congruence of species richness projections across modelling approaches is encouraging for conservation planning efforts that focus on retaining biodiversity into the future.

AB  - Aim The critically endangered Cross River gorilla is a patchily distributed taxon for which habitat selection has been modelled only at coarse spatial scales, using remotely sensed landscape data and large-scale species distribution maps. These coarse-scale models fail to explain why Cross River gorillas (CRG) display a highly fragmented distribution within what appears to be a large, continuous area of suitable habitat. This study aimed to refine our understanding of CRG habitat use to inform conservation planning both for the subspecies and for other fragmented species of conservation concern.
   Location Cross River gorillas occur only in a discontinuous distribution in the southern portion of the Cameroon-Nigeria border region, an area that represents one of Africa's biodiversity hotspots. This study was carried out in the Northern Mone-Mt. Oko region, part of the Mone/Mbulu forest system located in the Manyu division of the South-west Province of Cameroon.
   Methods We used resource selection functions to understand habitat use by CRG at multiple scales. Specifically, we employed generalized additive models at the scale of the annual subpopulation range and conditional logistic regression at the scale of individual movements.
   Results Cross River gorillas habitat selection is highly scale dependent. Localized measures of habitat quality strongly influenced selection at the subpopulation or landscape scale, while human activity and food availability were the best predictors of selection at finer scales.
   Main conclusions Understanding why CRG do not occur in seemingly suitable habitat is crucial for designating critical habitat both within and between CRG subpopulations. Our results indicate that conservation planning to maintain critical habitat and connectivity among CRG populations will require an integrative, multi-scale planning approach incorporating large-scale landscape characteristics, human use patterns and CRG food availability.

AB  - Considered as a hotspot for biodiversity in the upstream of Yangtze River, many vegetation habitats have been seriously damaged in Upper Reaches of Min River located in Sichuan Province, China due to the continuous deterioration of ecosystems. This work aims to define important protected areas with higher vegetation habitat suitability index. Through integrating the spatial distribution of vegetation habitat suitability (HS) index into systematic conservation planning, this study constructed spatial priority conservation areas of vegetation habitat under different protection targets in the Upper Reaches of Min River, China. In this regard, effective information regarding vegetation HS and its priority conservation planning responded to conservation target level changes and boundary length effect provide useful support for diverse stakeholders in vegetation habitat planning, management and policies. The southeastern places played an important role in the priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat, and there were more conservation areas located in east of study site than west. As increasing of target levels (ranged 10%-90% percentages of summing amount for vegetation HS index at watershed scale), the spatial priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat gradually extended from the south to the north. The spatial structure of priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat with boundary length effect was more compact than that without boundary length effect. The total priority conservation areas with boundary length effect were approximate to those without boundary length effect, but the total boundary length of former was far less than that of latter. It suggested that integrating boundary length effect to systematic conservation planning of vegetation habitat could produce more aggregated conservation patches and increase connectivity among patches. The total priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat were traded off against total boundary length of reserve networks. It indicated that this tradeoff information could help stakeholder to reasonably allocate investment to maintain reserve network under different target levels. The proposed approach could provide useful information to assess the responses of priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat to different protected targets and boundary length effect, and also guarantee ecosystem sustainability across watershed.

AB  - Climate change affects plant phenology, spatial distribution, and even extinction of vulnerable species. Dipterocarpus turbinatus, locally known as garjan, is a valuable but vulnerable native tree species of Bangladesh whose spatial distribution under future climate change scenarios is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of present and future climatic scenarios on spatiotemporal distribution of D. turbinatus. We used maximum entropy species distribution modeling to perform the present and future habitat suitability of garjan under different climate scenarios. The representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 were considered for bioclimatic variables from the Global Climate Model - Hadley Global Environment Model 2 Atmosphere-Ocean. The predictive accuracy of the model was more than 97% in both the training and test data. The prediction results suggest that compared to present areas (7624 km(2)) under moderate habitat class it will be 2755 km(2) and 1239 km(2), respectively, in 2050 and 2070 under RCP2.6 scenario and decreases more rapidly under RCP8.5 scenario. Besides, the prediction also indicates that the habitat of the species will shift toward the high altitudinal south-eastern corner of the country whereas local extinction might occur in the north-eastern part during 2070.

AB  - Hose's civet Diplogale hosei is one of the world's least known carnivores and is endemic to Borneo. We collected 43 records of which only 20 (Balanced Model) or 24 (Spatial Filtering Model) were used to model potential habitat suitability. We predicted habitat suitable for Hose's civet to be largely restricted to the central spine of the mountainous interior, corresponding to much of the northern half of the 'Heart of Borneo' complex. Although protected areas are scattered throughout this complex, many are poorly managed, facing threats from illegal logging and mining, poaching and encroachment. The surrounding matrix of logging concessions face conversion to monoculture plantations, in which there is no evidence that the species can persist. To ensure the conservation of the species, further research is urgently required, both in-depth ecological studies and basic inventory work using camera-traps across Borneo. More intensive surveys in all habitats are needed to improve current models so they can inform conservation planning more effectively. Pending sufficient information, sensible precautionary measures need to be taken such as increased enforcement including patrolling activities in key protected areas, encouraging sustainable forestry in the surrounding logging concessions and maintaining forested corridors to support movement and gene flow between sub-populations.

AB  - Existing marine bioregions covering the Pacific Ocean are conceptualised at spatial scales that are too broad for national marine spatial planning. Here, we developed the first combined oceanic and coastal marine bioregionalisation at national scales, delineating 262 deep-water and 103 reef-associated bioregions across the southwest Pacific. The deep-water bioregions were informed by thirty biophysical environmental variables. For reef-associated environments, records for 806 taxa at 7369 sites were used to predict the probability of observing taxa based on environmental variables. Both deep-water and reef-associated bioregions were defined with cluster analysis applied to the environmental variables and predicted species observation probabilities, respectively to classify areas with high taxonomic similarity. Local experts further refined the delineation of the bioregions at national scales for four countries. This work provides marine bioregions that enable the design of ecologically representative national systems of marine protected areas within offshore and inshore environments in the Pacific.

AB  - In a world with poor biological inventorying and rapid land-use change, predicting the spatial distribution of species is fundamental for the effective management and conservation of threatened taxa. However, on a regional scale, predicting the distribution of rare terrestrial mammals is often unreliable and/or impractical, especially in tropical forests. We apply a recently developed analytic process that integrates density estimation (kernel smoothing), niche-analysis and geostatistics (regression-kriging) to model the occupancy and density distribution of a threatened population of white-lipped peccaries Tayassu pecari in a Brazilian Atlantic forest. Locations (n = 45) within a protected area of the Serra-do-Mar state park were obtained from diurnal line transect census (233 km), camera-trapping (751 camera-trap days) and surveys (4626 km) conducted by park rangers. Niche modelling (environmental niche-factor analysis and MAXENT) revealed a restricted niche compared with the available habitat as defined by seven environmental variables. From the occupancy model obtained from regression-kriging, we found that 72% of a 170km(2) protected area is likely to be used by peccaries. We demonstrate that the distribution of large mammals can be restricted within continuous areas of Atlantic forest and therefore population estimates based on the size of protected areas can be overestimated. Our findings suggest that the generation of realized density distributions should become the norm rather than the exception to enable conservation managers and researchers to extrapolate abundance and density estimates across continuous habitats and protected areas.

AB  - Snow has far-reaching effects on ecosystem processes and biodiversity in high-latitude ecosystems, but these have been poorly considered in climate change impact models(1,2). Here, to forecast future trends in species occurrences and richness, we fitted species-environment models with temperature data from three climate scenarios and simulated up to a 40% decrease in snow cover duration (SCD)(3). We used plot-scale data on 273 vascular plant, moss and lichen species in 1,200 study sites spanning a wide range of environmental conditions typical for mountainous Arctic landscapes (within 165 km(2)). According to the models, a rise in temperature increased overall species richness and caused only one species to lose all suitable habitat. In contrast, a shorter SCD tempered the effect of increasing temperature on species richness and led to accelerated rates of species' local extinctions after a tipping point at 20-30% SCD decrease. All three species groups showed similar extinction rates but contrasting species richness responses. Our simulations indicate that future biodiversity patterns in Arctic regions are highly dependent on the evolution of snow conditions. Climate impact models that ignore the effects of snow cover change may provide biased biodiversity projections, with potentially erratic implications for Arctic nature conservation planning.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) form the backbone of global conservation efforts. Although many studies have evaluated the impact of PAs on land cover, human disturbances, and people's welfare, PAs' impact on wildlife habitat quality remains poorly understood. By integrating wildlife habitat mapping and information of 2183 rural households, we assessed the impacts of nature reserves (a type of PAs) across the entire geographic range of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) on panda habitat suitability change between 2001 and 2013 using the matching approach. We found the impact of nature reserves is concentrated in areas susceptible to human pressure, where 65% of the habitat suitability increase is attributable to the nature reserves' protection. The impact of nature reserves has spilled over to nearby unprotected areas and enhanced habitat suitability there. Nature reserves supported by the central government showed higher performance in improving habitat suitability than their counterparts supported by local governments. Older nature reserves perform better than those established more recently. Our results also show that local households' participation in tourism and labor migration (people temporarily leaving to work in cities) enhanced the ability of nature reserves to improve habitat suitability. These results and methods provide valuable information and tools to support effective management of PAs to enhance the habitat quality of giant pandas and other wildlife species in China and elsewhere.

AB  - Hispaniola Island has both a high level of amphibian endemism, and a high level of habitat degradation due to agriculture, infrastructure development, and extractive industries. The objective of this work was to evaluate the capacity of Dominican Republic's current network of protection to maintain the habitat of four species of amphibians endemic to Hispaniola (Osteopilus pulchrilineatus, Osteopilus vastus, Hypsiboas heilprini, and Eleutherodactylus flavescens). Spatial analysis was performed to relate observations of the target species to environmental factors using a maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent). Results of this analysis produced maps of probability of occurrence for each species. Analysis of habitat degradation was based on a change analysis of vegetation, by evaluating trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) between 2000 and 2011. Results show that forest loss and species habitat loss within protected areas are smaller but similar to those extracted for the country as a whole, suggesting that the current protected area network is not effective for the maintenance of the habitat of the amphibians analyzed. Enforcement of established protection and restoration within current protected areas could facilitate the protection of up to 25.7% of target amphibian habitat. The methodologies presented here can be applied to measure biodiversity offset effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change has greatly affected the natural habitats of wild plants, especially vulnerable species. However, methods to properly assess priority protected areas (PPAs) that consider climate change have not been established. The distribution of Fraxinus mandshurica in northeast China was assessed, and our goal was to develop model-based strategies for the assessment of PPAs in consideration of climate change. To achieve this goal, we mapped the current and future suitable habitat distributions of F. mandshurica and planned PPAs based on 4 field surveys in northeast China. The models used in this study included a species distribution model (Maxent), systematic conservation planning model (Zonation), and geographic information system (ArcGIS 10.0). To promote sustainable development, the current and future suitable habitats of F mandshurica must be integrated into the assessment of PPAs; however, the conservation areas of F mandshurica in existing nature reserves cannot realize the conservation criterion of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC). In the eastern and northeastern regions of northeast China, the suitable habitats are predicted to migrate slightly northwards in the future. The methods used in this study are adequate for the assessment of PPAs and may provide a reference for the conservation and management of vulnerable plants.

AB  - Aim To explore spatiotemporal changes in Hyacinth Macaw Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus distribution and the impacts of land use change over 25 years, across its vast range in central/eastern South America. Location Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, South America, covering almost 3 million km(2). Methods We use a novel, multi-temporal species distribution model, to combine both year-specific occurrence records and land use/cover data in a single model that is subsequently projected over a land cover time series. We investigate changes in geographic range over 25 years and potential drivers of range extent at multiple spatial scales (10 and 30 km) and time-lags (current and 10 years previously). We also assess protected area coverage and impacts from degazettement within the remaining range and highlight priority areas to search for undiscovered populations. Results The modelled range of the species increased by 75,000 km(2) to over 500,000 km(2) between 1995 and 2019, during which period agriculture and pasture increased by 600,000 km(2) within the species' extent of occurrence. Habitat suitability was influenced most strongly by distribution of palms, forest cover and changes in pasture over 10 years and usually by predictors measured at larger spatial scales. Just 8% of the macaw's modelled range falls within protected areas, and more than 20,500 km(2) of protected areas overlapping with the range have been degazetted in the last 40 years. We highlight key areas to search for undiscovered populations in under-sampled and remote areas, especially led by community citizen science initiatives involving indigenous groups and protected area staff. Main conclusions Novel modelling methods, combining multi-temporal occurrence records and land cover data, appropriate for small sample sizes per year, have revealed habitat dynamics and changes to the range of this threatened species over 25 years. The method may have wide applicability for a range of species, including elusive and poorly studied species.

AB  - The Albertine Rift region of Africa is one of the most biodiverse areas on the planet, with more threatened and endemic vertebrates than elsewhere on the continent. Many of the endemic species are confined to montane forest or alpine areas. We assessed impacts of loss of habitat to agriculture and predicted impacts from niche modelling of climate change to the endemic species of the Albertine Rift. Modelling species distributions for 162 endemic terrestrial vertebrates and plants, we estimated the average percentage of habitat already lost to agriculture at 38% across all species. However, of the remaining suitable habitat the average percentage protected is currently 46%, greatly increased by the recent establishment of Itombwe, Kabobo and Ngandja Reserves in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo from 30%. Species ranges in 2080 were estimated using climate models and predicted to lead to an average loss of an additional 75% of remaining suitable habitat across all species. An estimated 34 endemic species were predicted to lose > 90% of their current remaining suitable habitat. The percentage of the total suitable habitat protected in parks or reserves increases under future climate change to 56% because as ranges contract more of the remaining area occurs within existing protected areas. This indicates that the protected area coverage is reasonably well located for future climate change. Based on these data we estimate that 46% of the endemic species we assessed would qualify for threatened status on the global Red List.

AB  - Part of the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, Yunnan province in China is a highly diverse terrestrial region, particularly in the wide range of natural forest types. These forests are under considerable conversion pressure as land use intensifies with expanding human population and economic development. Conservation strategies based on the geographic patterns of botanical species richness, including the identification of meaningful floristic regions and priority areas for conservation, could improve the effectiveness of forest policy and management. These strategies should also include current threats of loss due to forest conversion to address the more urgent challenges for sustainable development. Here, we produce distribution models at similar to 10 km(2) resolution for 2319 plant species, using geo-referenced herbarium collections, corrected for spatial bias using a null model, and detailed environmental variables. Based on 1996 species with significant non-random habitat preferences, we identify four important aspects of plant species distribution in Yunnan: (1) species diversity hotspots; (2) seven major floristic regions, using a cluster analysis of species presence/absence; (3) priority areas for conservation based on the concept of the 'irreplaceability' value of planning units and (4) the percentage remaining natural forest among the species rich and conservation priority areas, to assess the level of endangerment. Our maps provide clear priorities for the development of a sustainable and feasible biodiversity conservation strategy for Yunnan. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wetlands, especially those in semi-arid areas, are highly vulnerable to human activities, droughts, and other climate variations. Regards to water resources limitations in these regions, prioritization of management strategies is essential to ecosystem conservation and restoration, particularly during the breeding season of waterbirds. The present study sought to develop a spatial conservation prioritization approach based on remote sensing and geographical information system to identify areas of a wetland which require special protective measures during waterbirds' breeding season. After the extraction of spatial information from Landsat 8 time series data, maximum entropy and weighted linear combination (WLC) methods were used to identify areas with higher conservation priority. Firstly, waterbirds' habitat suitability map during their nesting time in Hamun Wetland was constructed. Then, Habitat suitability changes until the end of the nestling period were evaluated and areas providing suitable conditions for longer periods were identified. Moreover, areas with suitable conditions in the beginning of breeding season but unsuitable conditions ( caused by the drying of the wetland) in the nestling period were also determined. Considering limited water availability in the study area, carefully designed management strategies are required to conserve waterbird habitats in such parts of the wetland which are at higher risk of drying. The results of this paper highlighted areas with high conservation priority in a wetland with water limitation. This approach can be practically applied in the management of water habitats in arid and semi-arid areas facing water limitations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monitoring and species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to support conservation planning but are rarely projected at a very high resolution for conservation management. In this study, we compared the population distribution and size of five invasive plant species along an 18 km alluvial system in Switzerland, over a period of 11 years. Exhaustive inventories of past (2001) to current (2012) populations showed a massive increase in invaded areas over the eleven years. Impatiens glandulifera and Reynoutria japonica were the species with the largest increases in population number and size. The ecological preferences of each species were then modelled at 1 m resolution, using environmental variables expressing topography, disturbances, dispersal, soil texture and light availability. SDMs successfully depicted the niches at very high resolution. Some of the important predictors (e.g., canopy density, distance to river) would have been unhelpful at a coarser resolution. From these very-high-resolution models, we predicted the potential distribution and abundance of species and derived two indices indicating the amount of habitat still available for future species colonisation, crucial information for management. Large, empty areas were predicted to be suitable for each species, suggesting that the observed increase in population size may continue in the future. The two proposed range-filling indices and abundance models may be used efficiently in future studies at very fine resolution to prioritise eradication efforts in previously invaded areas and controls in areas at high risk of invasion. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the efficiency of SDMs to predict invasions at such a fine resolution.

AB  - Aim: Conservation planning requires the prioritization of a subset of taxa and geographical locations to focus monitoring and management efforts. Integration of the threats and opportunities posed by climate change often relies on predictions from species distribution models, particularly for assessments of vulnerability or invasion risk for multiple taxa. We evaluated whether species distribution models could reliably rank changes in species range size under climate and land use change.
   Location: Conterminous U.S.A.
   Time period: 1977-2014.
   Major taxa studied: Passerine birds.
   Methods: We estimated ensembles of species distribution models based on historical North American Breeding Bird Survey occurrences for 190 songbirds, and generated predictions to recent years given c.35 years of observed land use and climate change. We evaluated model predictions using standard metrics of discrimination performance and a more detailed assessment of the ability of models to rank species vulnerability to climate change based on predicted range loss, range gain, and overall change in range size.
   Results: Species distribution models yielded unreliable and misleading assessments of relative vulnerability to climate and land use change. Models could not accurately predict range expansion or contraction, and therefore failed to anticipate patterns of range change among species. These failures occurred despite excellent overall discrimination ability and transferability to the validation time period, which reflected strong performance at the majority of locations that were either always or never occupied by each species.
   Main conclusions: Models failed for the questions and at the locations of greatest interest to conservation and management. This highlights potential pitfalls of multi-taxa impact assessments under global change; in our case, models provided misleading rankings of the most impacted species, and spatial information about range changes was not credible. As modelling methods and frameworks continue to be refined, performance assessments and validation efforts should focus on the measures of risk and vulnerability useful for decision-making.

AB  - Aim Fire is a major driver of ecosystem structure and process, and shifts in fire regimes are implicated in the decline of many species. Shifting fire regimes have been documented around the world, and fire frequency and extent is predicted to increase in many areas because of changes in both climate and land management. Here, we evaluate how predicted increases in fire frequency are likely to impact on species distributions.
   Location The tropical savannas of northern Australia.
   Methods We developed distribution models for 44 bird species using the modelling algorithm Maxent. Our models incorporated bird locality records and environmental variables including climate, total fire frequency and the subset of fire frequency occurring late in the dry season. We investigated the effect of increasing total fire frequency and increasing fire late in the dry season, on species distributions by projecting species model algorithms onto scenarios of incrementally increased total fire frequency.
   Results The probability of presence for most species was higher when fire frequency late in the dry season was low. Species showed a mixed response to an overall increase in total fire frequency, with one-third predicted to increase in distribution. However, almost all species (98%) showed a decrease in predicted range with increased late-dry season fire, and species distribution area was generally negatively correlated with an increase in late-dry season fire.
   Main conclusions Our study highlighted the array of responses of species to increasing fire frequency and suggested that increased fire frequency late in the dry season is detrimental to most savanna-restricted bird species. The understanding of individual species' preferences for particular fire frequencies is important for informed conservation planning.

AB  - Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GISs) are increasingly being used in protected area monitoring and habitat suitability studies. In this article, Erdas Imagine's Expert Classifier tool was used to assess the specific trajectories of habitat suitability change during 19942007 in the Sonitpur elephant habitat, India. Sonitpur has been witness to increasing humanelephant conflict in the past decade. The suitability analysis took into account information relating to forest type and density, elevation, slope, source of water, human activities in terms of settlement, agriculture, tea plantations, roads, and railways. Satellite imagery, data from topographical maps, digital elevation data, and global positioning system readings formed the major data inputs that were incorporated into a GIS. Various decision rules were created and confidence levels assigned to the input layers to generate high, medium, and low habitat suitability. The area witnessed a sharp decline in suitability from 63% in 1994 to less than 38% by 2007. The high-suitability area declined by more than 50% during this period. The unique natural protected areas of Sonitpur, which are a mix of reserved forests, wildlife sanctuaries, and a national park, urgently need to be protected from further habitat degradation.

AB  - Biodiversity considerations in conservation system planning include three main criteria: representation, special elements, and focal species. A GIS-based approach utilizing simple models was used to assess existing biophysical data relative to these criteria for conservation system planning in Nova Scotia, Canada, with potential utility in applications elsewhere. Representative samples of natural landscapes were identified on the basis of size ( : 10 000 ha) and degree of naturalness (natural-cover, uneven-aged forests, low or zero road density). Special elements were selected, including hotspots of diversity and rarity, critical habitat for species at risk, significant wetlands, old and unique forests, and ecosites. Habitat requirements of viable populations of focal species (American moose, American marten, and Northern Goshawk) were identified using species distribution data, habitat suitability, and population viability analyses. Priority core. areas for biodiversity conservation system planning were identified on the basis of these three sets of criteria. Key areas of habitat connectivity were delineated by selecting the least-cost paths for focal species between relevant core areas through cost-distance. analyses based on habitat suitability, road density, and minimum corridor width. Collectively, these biodiversity considerations indicate that similar to 60% of Nova Scotia, including 32% in core areas, should be managed for conservation objectives to maintain genes, species, and ecosystems over time. Although data and modeling limitations require that our analysis of richness and diversity, habitat suitability, population viability, and core area selection be verified, the area calculations and other results are consistent with those in similar studies. Consequently, the system design and other information generated are useful for local and regional biodiversity conservation planning and management, and the methodological approach is of potential use in other regions where the necessary field-based data may be made available.

AB  - Egyptian flower mantis Blepharopsis mendica (Order: Mantodea) is a widespread mantis species throughout the southwest Palearctic region. The ecological and geographical distribution of such interesting species is rarely known. So, through this work, habitat suitability models for its distribution through Egyptian territory were created using MaxEnt software from 90 occurrence records. One topographic (altitude) and eleven bioclimatic variables influencing the species distribution were selected to generate the models. The predicted distribution in Egypt was focused on the Delta, South Sinai, the north-eastern part of the country, and some areas in the west including Siwa Oasis. Temporal analysis between the two periods (1900?1961) and (1961?2017) show current reduction of this species distribution through Delta and its surrounding areas, may be due to urbanization. On the other hand, it increases in newly protected areas of South Sinai. Under the future climate change scenario, the MaxEnt model predicted the habitat gains for B. mendica in RCP 2.6 for 2070 and loss of habitat in RCP 8.5 for the same year. Our results can be used as a basis for conserving this species not only in Egypt, but also throughout the whole of its range, also, it show how the using of geo-information could help in studying animal ecology.

AB  - Most spatial conservation planning for wide-ranging or migratory species is constrained by poor knowledge of species' spatiotemporal dynamics and is only based on static species' ranges. However, species have substantial variation in abundance across their range and migratory species have important spatiotemporal population dynamics. With growing ecological data and advancing analytics, both of these can be estimated and incorporated into spatial conservation planning. However, there is limited information on the degree to which including this information affects conservation planning. We compared the performance of systematic conservation prioritizations for different scenarios based on varying the input species' distributions by ecological metric (abundance distributions versus range maps) and temporal sampling resolution (weekly, monthly, or quarterly). We used the example of a community of 41 species of migratory shorebirds that breed in North America, and we used eBird data to produce weekly estimates of species' abundances and ranges. Abundance distributions at a monthly or weekly resolution led to prioritizations that most efficiently protected species throughout the full annual cycle. Conversely, spatial prioritizations based on species' ranges required more sites and left most species insufficiently protected for at least part of their annual cycle. Prioritizations with only quarterly species ranges were very inefficient as they needed to target 40% of species' ranges to include 10% of populations. We highlight the high value of abundance information for spatial conservation planning, which leads to more efficient and effective spatial prioritization for conservation. Overall, we provide evidence that spatial conservation planning for wide-ranging migratory species is most robust and efficient when informed by species' abundance information from the full annual cycle.

AB  - Context. Assessing the viability of animal populations in the wild is difficult or impossible, primarily because of limited data. However, there is an urgent need to develop methods for estimating population sizes and improving the viability of target species.
   Aims. To define suitable habitat for sambar (Cervus unicolor), banteng (Bos javanicus), gaur (Bos gaurus), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and tiger (Panthera tigris) in the Western Forest Complex, Thailand, and to assess their current status as well as estimate how the landscape needs to be managed to maintain viable populations.
   Methods. The present paper demonstrates a method for combining a rapid ecological assessment, landscape indices, GIS-based wildlife-habitat models, and knowledge of minimum viable population sizes to guide landscape-management decisions and improve conservation outcomes through habitat restoration.
   Key results. The current viabilities for gaur and elephant are fair, whereas they are poor for tiger and banteng. However, landscape quality outside the current distributions was relatively intact for all species, ranging from moderate to high levels of connectivity. In addition, the population viability for sambar is very good under the current and desired conditions.
   Conclusions. If managers in this complex wish to upgrade the viabilities of gaur, elephant, tiger and banteng within the next 10 years, park rangers and stakeholders should aim to increase the amount of usable habitat by similar to 2170 km(2) or 17% of existing suitable habitats. The key strategies are to reduce human pressures, enhance ungulate habitats and increase connectivity of suitable habitats outside the current distributions.
   Implications. The present paper provides a particularly useful method for managers and forest-policy planners for assessing and managing habitat suitability for target wildlife and their population viability in protected-area networks where knowledge of the demographic attributes (e.g. birth and death rates) of wildlife populations are too limited to perform population viability analysis.

AB  - We demonstrate how home range and habitat use analysis can inform landscape-scale conservation planning for the bobcat, Lynx rufus, in Vermont USA. From 2005 to 2008, we outfitted fourteen bobcats with GPS collars that collected spatially explicit locations from individuals every 4 h for 3-4 months. Kernel home range techniques were used to estimate home range size and boundaries, and to quantify the utilization distribution (UD), which is a spatially explicit, topographic mapping of how different areas within the home range are used. We then used GIS methods to quantify both biotic (e.g. habitat types, stream density) and abiotic (e.g. slope) resources within each bobcat's home range. Across bobcats, upper 20th UD percentiles (core areas) had 18% less agriculture, 42% less development, 26% more bobcat habitat (shrub, deciduous, coniferous forest, and wetland cover types), and 33% lower road density than lower UD percentiles (UD valleys). For each bobcat, we used Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate and compare 24 alternative Resource Utilization Functions (hypotheses) that could explain the topology of the individual's UD. A model-averaged population-level Resource Utilization Function suggested positive responses to shrub, deciduous, coniferous forest, and wetland cover types within 1 km of a location, and negative responses to roads and mixed forest cover types within 1 km of a location. Applying this model-averaged function to each pixel in the study area revealed habitat suitability for bobcats across the entire study area, with suitability scores ranging between -1.69 and 1.44, where higher values were assumed to represent higher quality habitat. The southern Champlain Valley, which contained ample wetland and shrub habitat, was a concentrated area of highly suitable habitat, while areas at higher elevation areas were less suitable. Female bobcat home ranges, on average, had an average habitat suitability score of near 0, indicating that home ranges consisted of both beneficial and detrimental habitat types. We discuss the application of habitat suitability mapping and home range requirements for bobcat conservation and landscape scale management. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Field active body temperatures (T-b) and operative temperatures (T-e) were assessed in a population of Uromastyx aegyptia microlepis at Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area, Saudi Arabia. In summer T-b ranged between 23.2 and 47.2 degrees C, in winter between 23.0 and 451 degrees C and in spring between 25.5 and 45.9 degrees C. There is a significant difference between respective T-b and T-e distributions which suggests that U. a. microlepis is an active thermoregulator. Above ground activity is very variable between seasons, with the highest activity level in spring. In winter the animals showed an unimodal activity profile. In spring and summer the lizards exhibit bimodal activity profiles with afternoon activity being generally lower than morning activity levels. Species distribution models were calculated to estimate the future impact of global warming on this taxon. Estimates on the basis of temperature data suggest that the range size on the Arabian Peninsula might be stable but with a remarkable decrease of environmental suitability of up to 70-80%. Based on a synthesis of thermo-ecological data and species distribution models we consider climate warming as a potential threat to the survival of the species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increased emphasis is being placed on developing effective biodiversity conservation tools for practical conservation planning. The mesofilter is such a biodiversity planning tool, but has yet to be fully explored to appreciate its effectiveness. The key premise of the mesofilter is that ecosystems contain certain physical elements that are specifically associated with a diversity of species. Identifying such mesofilters could therefore complement existing conservation planning tools such as coarse and fine filters. To explore the value of the mesofilter as an operational scale in conservation planning, we studied 18 remnant patches of endangered montane grassland in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, using the physical landscape feature of patch rockiness as an abiotic surrogate for biodiversity. The objective was to determine whether the mesofilter of rockiness can predict variation in species richness and composition for three dominant grassland taxa (plants, butterflies and grasshoppers) at the landscape scale. Variable levels of rockiness had significant interactions with all three focal taxa. Higher species richness of all taxa was closely associated with higher levels of rockiness in a patch. The rocky mesofilter only predicted significant differences in species composition for butterflies. Elevation was also important, possibly another mesofilter for plants and grasshoppers in this landscape. Synthesis and applications. The results indicate that the use of an abiotic surrogate such as rockiness can predict biodiversity value across multiple taxa. The mesofilter is therefore a valuable surrogacy and congruency tool for practical biodiversity conservation across this landscape and would likely have similar value if explored elsewhere. It also has value in the design and management of protected areas.

AB  - 1. Surrogates are used in marine conservation planning when there is limited information on the distribution of biodiversity, and representation of species and assemblage diversity are conservation goals. With prior confirmation of their relationship to spatial variation in biodiversity, habitat classification schemes are a potentially useful surrogate.
   2. Polychaetes can comprise over one-third of species of benthic infaunal assemblages, they are the most frequent and abundant marine metazoans in benthic environments, and they are a reliable surrogate for other macrobenthic taxa.
   3. It was tested whether polychaete biodiversity differed among six estuarine habitat classes defined for conservation planning in the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park, New South Wales, Australia: subtidal sand, mud, muddy sand, and seagrass beds comprising Posidonia australis, Zostera capricorni and mixed Posidonia/Zostera. Polychaetes were sampled from replicate sites in each habitat and differences among habitat classes in species richness, abundance, and assemblage structure were examined. Several environmental variables, known to be important determinants of polychaete distribution, were also quantified at each site.
   4. Ninety-five species of polychaetes (belonging to 35 families) were identified. Species richness and abundance did not differ among the habitat classes. Polychaete assemblages of subtidal sand differed from assemblages in both mud and muddy sand, however, assemblages in all other habitats were not different. A combination of some of the measured environmental variables (distance to the estuary entrance, depth, sediment grain size) was a more important determinant of assemblage variation than the habitat classes.
   5. Using these predictors, an alternative habitat classification scheme to the scheme currently utilized in marine park planning is proposed.
   6. This study demonstrates the critical importance of testing assumptions about surrogacy and an approach for refining surrogates. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The management and protection of potentially vulnerable species and habitats require the availability of detailed spatial data. However, such data are often not readily available in particular areas that are challenging for sampling by traditional sampling techniques, for example seamounts. Within this study habitat modelling techniques were used to create predictive maps of six species of conservation concern for the Le Danois Bank (El Cachucho Marine Protected Area in the South of the Bay of Biscay). The study used data from ECOMARG multidisciplinary surveys that aimed to create a representative picture of the physical and biological composition of the area. Classical fishing gear (otter trawl and beam trawl) was used to sample benthic communities that inhabit sedimentary areas, and non-destructive visual sampling techniques (ROV and photogrammetric sled) were used to determine the presence of epibenthic macrofauna in complex and vulnerable habitats. Multibeam echosounder data, high-resolution seismic profiles (TOPAS system) and geological data from box-corer were used to characterize the benthic terrain. ArcGIS software was used to produce high-resolution maps (75 x 75 m(2)) of such variables in the entire area. The Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) technique was used to process these data and create Habitat Suitability maps for six species of special conservation interest. The model used seven environmental variables (depth, rugosity, aspect, slope, Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) in fine and broad scale and morphosedimentary characteristics) to identify the most suitable habitats for such species and indicates which environmental factors determine their distribution. The six species models performed highly significantly better than random (p < 0.0001; Mann-Whitney test) when Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were tested. This indicates that the environmental variables chosen are relevant to distinguish the distribution of these species. The jackknife test estimated depth to be the key factor structuring their distribution, followed by the seabed morpho-sedimentary characteristics and rugosity variables. Three of the species studied (Asconema setubalense, Callogorgia verticillata and Helicolenus dactylopterus) were found to have small suitable areas as a result of being restrictive species related to the environmental characteristics of the top of the bank. The other species (Pheronema carpenteri, Phycis blennoides and Trachyscorpia cristulata), which were species less restrictive to the environmental variables used, had highly suitable areas of distribution. The study provides high-resolution maps of species that characterize the habitat of two communities included in OSPAR and NATURA networks, whose distributions corroborate the adequate protection of this area by the management measures applied at present.

AB  - Coastal urban expansion will continue to drive further biodiversity losses, if conservation targets for coastal ecosystems are not defined and met. Prioritizing areas for future protected area networks is thus an urgent task in such urbanization-threatened ecosystems. Our aim is to quantify past and future losses of coastal vegetation priority areas due to urbanization and assess the effectiveness of the existing protected area network for conservation.
   We conduct a prioritization analysis, based on 82 coastal plants, including common and IUCN red list species, in a highly-urbanized but biotically diverse region, in South-Eastern France. We evaluate the role of protected areas, by taking into account both strict and multi-use areas. We assess the impact of past and future urbanization on high priority areas, by combining prioritization analyses and urbanization models.
   We show that half of the highly diverse areas have already been lost due to urbanization. Remaining top priority areas are also among the most exposed to future urban expansion. The effectiveness of the existing protected area (PA) network is only partial. While strict PAs coincide well with top priority areas, they only represent less than one third of priority areas. The effectiveness of multi-use PAs, such as the Natura 2000 network, also remains limited.
   Our approach highlights the impact of urbanization on plant conservation targets. By modelling urbanization, we manage to identify those areas where protection could be more efficient to limit further losses. We suggest to use our approach in the future to expand the PA network in order to achieve the 2020 Aichi biodiversity targets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The importance of expert input to spatial conservation prioritization outcomes is poorly understood. We quantified the impacts of refinements made during consultation with experts on spatial conservation prioritization of Christmas Island. There was just 0.57 correlation between the spatial conservation priorities before and after consultation, bottom ranked areas being most sensitive to changes. The inclusion of a landscape condition layer was the most significant individual influence. Changes (addition, removal, modification) to biodiversity layers resulted in a combined 0.2 reduction in correlation between initial and final solutions. Representation of rare species in top ranked areas was much greater after expert consultation; representation of widely distributed species changed relatively little. Our results show how different inputs have notably different impacts on the final plan. Understanding these differences helps plan time and resources for expert consultation.

AB  - As data about populations of indicator species become available, proactive strategies that improve representation of biological diversity within protected area networks should consider finer-scaled evaluations, especially in regions identified as important through course-scale analyses. We use density distribution models derived from a robust regional bird abundance dataset, coupled with habitat conservation plans, to evaluate a network of protected areas and to inform conservation and biodiversity planning in the greater Klamath Siskiyou Bioregion, an area recognized globally as a region of outstanding biological diversity. Our novel modeling approach allowed for comparisons of abundance of conservation focal species on federal vs. non-federal lands, federal lands that are protected to maintain natural habitats vs. federal lands managed for multiple uses, and seven protected areas of interest. Our comparisons highlight conservation opportunities for suites of species associated with coniferous forests, oak woodlands, and grasslands. Specifically, we found that species associated with oak woodland and grassland habitats, both habitats of conservation concern, were not well represented in the Bioregion's existing protected areas. These species would benefit from expanding the regional protected area network to include their associated at-risk habitats. In contrast, our results suggest that coniferous forests birds are well represented in the Bioregion's protected areas. We identify management opportunities specifically associated with the restoration of fire-adapted ecosystems that would benefit coniferous forest focal species on both federally protected areas and other multiple-use lands. Our analysis provides an example of how a finer-scaled evaluation of a regional protected area network adds value to course-scale evaluations of protected areas and biological diversity. Data and results from this research were used to inform science-based expansion of the Bioregion's network of protected areas.

AB  - Restoration and conservation may be enhanced by using ecologically-based methods for prioritizing actions. Efforts are currently underway to restore river flows to the San Joaquin River in California's Central Valley. Although fish are the primary restoration target for restored flows, complementary efforts are being designed to protect, enhance, and restore riparian and floodplain habitats to benefit the larger ecological community. We describe our efforts to use bird habitat distribution models to inform and prioritize conservation activities along the San Joaquin River. We demonstrate the integration of habitat distribution models into an established conservation planning process that illustrates the synergies and tradeoffs of protecting high quality habitat for multiple species-groups and other restoration opportunities on the San Joaquin River. We used quantitative models to develop habitat quality indices for marsh birds, early-successional riparian birds, and mid/late-successional riparian birds, and used these indices to rank 18 sites under consideration along the San Joaquin River. We found little evidence that the rankings of the 18 sites for the three habitats were correlated, suggesting that any prioritization decisions will need to consider the quality of all three habitats, rather than one habitat acting as a surrogate for the others. Considering the habitat model rankings together with expert opinion rankings based on existing habitat quality, restoration potential, and flood management opportunities allowed us to identify sites that ranked high across multiple criteria. These results illustrate a simple process by which quantitative information from habitat models can be combined with expert opinion to inform priorities for protection and restoration.

AB  - The conservation of rare species is typically challenging because of incomplete knowledge about their biology and distributions. Species distribution models (SDMs) have emerged as an important tool for improving the efficiency of rare species conservation. However, these models must include biologically relevant predictor variables at scales appropriate for discriminating suitable and unsuitable habitat. We used a species distribution modelling tool, maximum entropy (Maxent), to assess the relative influence of biologically relevant topographic characteristics, land cover features, geological formations, and edaphic factors on the occurrence of the endangered endemic orchid Spiranthes parksii (Navasota ladies' tresses). Our final model produced an excellent AUC value (0.984), with the permutation importance to model fit of predictor variables representing topographic characteristics, land cover features, geological formations, and edaphic factors summing to 8.17, 35.12, 10.43, and 46.28%, respectively. Local-scale edaphic variables were the most informative, with soil taxonomic units explaining the highest amount of variance (36.40%) of all variables included in the model. These results document the importance of local edaphic characteristics in discriminating between suitable and unsuitable habitat for S. parksii, and emphasize the importance of including local-scale edaphic factors in SDMs for species such as S. parksii with specialized habitat requirements and close relationships with other organisms.

AB  - Climate change may shrink and/or shift plant species ranges thereby increasing their vulnerability and requiring targeted conservation to facilitate adaptation. We quantified the vulnerability to climate change of plant species based on exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and assessed the effects of including these components in complementarity-based spatial conservation prioritisation. We modelled the vulnerability of 584 native plant species under three climate change scenarios in an 11.9 million hectare fragmented agricultural region in southern Australia. We represented exposure as species' geographical range under each climate change scenario as quantified using species distribution models. We calculated sensitivity as a function of the impact of climate change on species' geographical ranges. Using a dispersal kernel, we quantified adaptive capacity as species' ability to migrate to new geographical ranges under each climate change scenario. Using Zonation, we assessed the impact of individual components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) on spatial conservation priorities and levels of species representation in priority areas under each climate change scenario. The full vulnerability framework proved an effective basis for identifying spatial conservation priorities under climate change. Including different dimensions of vulnerability had significant implications for spatial conservation priorities. Incorporating adaptive capacity increased the level of representation of most species. However, prioritising sensitive species reduced the representation of other species. We conclude that whilst taking an integrated approach to mitigating species vulnerability to climate change can ensure sensitive species are well-represented in a conservation network, this can come at the cost of reduced representation of other species. Conservation planning decisions aimed at reducing species vulnerability to climate change need to be made in full cognisance of the sensitivity of spatial conservation priorities to individual components of vulnerability, and the trade-offs associated with focussing on sensitive species.

AB  - AimDrivers of biodiversity loss are increasingly broad in scale, requiring conservation planning to move towards range-wide assessments. This is especially challenging for migratory species, such as reindeer or caribou (Rangifer tarandus), which use only a small portion of their range at a given point in time, and for which some parts of their range, such as calving grounds, may be much more important than others. Our aim was to identify potential calving ground habitat of wild tundra reindeer populations throughout Russia, where scarce knowledge about seasonal reindeer habitat is an obstacle for conservation planning, and to assess possible impacts from oil and gas development and climate change.
   LocationNorthern Eurasia.
   MethodWe used occurrence data from known reindeer calving grounds using species distribution models to first assess calving grounds characteristics and second predict their distribution across the Russian Arctic. We then compared our calving ground map with maps of oil and gas development, and a range of climate change indicators.
   ResultsWe found areas throughout the Russian Arctic that are suitable for calving, including for some wild reindeer populations where calving ground locations are unknown. Variables relating to resource availability in spring and predator avoidance were the strongest predictors in our model. Oil and gas development affects calving grounds especially in the Barents Sea region and in south-western Siberia, whereas climate change affects calving grounds on Taymyr, Chukotka, and Kamchatka.
   Main conclusionsWe conducted the first assessment of calving grounds of Russia's wild reindeer populations, highlighting the spatial heterogeneity of the threats that they may face. Given the potentially strong impact of oil and gas development and climate change, conservation planning should aim for designing resilient conservation networks that would allow Arctic biodiversity to freely move in time and space and thus to adapt to changing environments.

AB  - Aim Spatially-explicit trends in species richness and endemism on sandy shores are quantified to assess representation of beach ecosystems in existing reserve networks. Also, the relative importance of different drivers of species distributions are compared through species distribution modelling.
   Location The South African beaches are among the best-studied in the world, providing sufficient biological data for the analyses. There is also a well-established coastal protected-area network that putatively provides moderate protection to nearly all beach habitats.
   Methods Species distribution maps of beach-dependent vertebrates, macrofauna, microflora, and foredune vegetation were compiled from existing sources or modelled using standard techniques. While some data were available for the latter analyses, additional sampling was required to improve bioregional coverage. Each species' distribution was coded to a detailed map of the South African shoreline. Representation of habitats and species in various configurations of existing reserves was determined.
   Results Overall, 535 species have been recorded on the South African sandy shores, including 139 common species. Endemism is variable among taxonomic groups. Notably, two-thirds of the macrofauna are regional endemics, half of which are endemic to South Africa. For almost all of the common species, < 20 % of their distributions are protected in land-sea reserves. Protection of beach habitats is similarly poor; conservation targets were not met in all cases, and most habitat types are considered Poorly Protected.
   Main conclusions Sandy beach communities are considerably more diverse than they are generally acknowledged to be, and comprise a unique suite of biota. Given the species' narrow distributions and high degree of exposure to threats, many probably qualify as threatened/endangered. In spite of this, beaches are poorly represented in coastal reserve networks. To redress this issue, conservation planners need to account for beaches specifically, and to ensure they are represented in contiguous land-sea protected areas.

AB  - The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Linnaeus 1758, Phasianidae) is a common game bird in Europe and it is classified as SPEC 2 (Species of European Conservation Concern), that is, a species with unfavorable conservation status due to a marked population decline. Loss of suitable habitat and hunting management are considered among the major causes of its decline. Such a decline can be also related to agriculture intensification, changes in agricultural practices and the abandonment of less productive lands. Habitat suitability models are an important management tool to define the potential distribution range of a given species, design a protected area network, and plan appropriate management actions and evaluate their effects. This study was conducted on Elba Island (Tuscany) in spring 2011 to define the habitat factors that affect the A. rufa distribution in a typical Mediterranean landscape. On this island the species is declining, as it is in other areas of Europe. We carried out point counts in a survey stratified according to vegetation. We formulated Resource Probability Selection Functions following a presence vs. availability design by Binary Logistic Regression Analysis to obtain a map of potential distribution of the species. We observed that the red-legged partridge distribution was mainly linked to the natural habitat with garrigue and perennial meadows, whereas woody landscape had a negative effect. To stop the species decline on the island habitat improvement actions are needed, such as the cutting of dense vegetation to create open areas.

AB  - Regional conservation planning increasingly draws on habitat suitability models to support decisions regarding land allocation and management. Nevertheless, statistical techniques commonly used for developing such models may give misleading results because they fail to account for 3 factors common in data sets of species distribution: spatial autocorrelation, the large number of sites where the species is absent (zero inflation), and uneven survey effort. We used spatial autoregressive models fit with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to assess the relationship between older coniferous forest and the abundance of Northern Spotted Owl nest and activity sites throughout the species' range. The spatial random-effect term incorporated in the autoregressive models successfully accounted for zero inflation and reduced the effect of survey bias on estimates of species-habitat associations. Our results support the hypothesis that the relationship between owl distribution and older forest varies with latitude. A quadratic relationship between owl abundance and older forest was evident in the southern portion of the range, and a pseudothreshold relationship was evident in the northern portion of the range. Our results suggest that proposed changes to the network of owl habitat reserves would reduce the proportion of the population protected by up to one-third, and that proposed guidelines for forest management within reserves underestimate the proportion of older forest associated with maximum owl abundance and inappropriately generalize threshold relationships among subregions. Bayesian spatial models can greatly enhance the utility of habitat analysis for conservation planning because they add the statistical flexibility necessary for analyzing regional survey data while retaining the interpretability of simpler models.

AB  - Trachypithecus geei Khajuria, 1956 or Golden langur are an endangered colobine primate species that are distributed in the transboundary region of Bhutan and India. The species is severely threatened because of increasing habitat fragmentation and isolation across its entire range, especially the populations in Assam, India. The distribution range of the species has not been updated for the last two decades, nor is there any proper evaluation of the habitat requirements for the species. Therefore, we mapped the habitat suitability for the species across its entire distribution and projected its habitat suitability on the simulated landscape for the future (2031). The results indicate that out of the total range extent (66,320 km(2)), only 12,265 km(2) (18.49%) is suitable for the species at present, which will further be reduced to 8884 km(2) by the year 2031, indicating major range contraction. These suitable habitats are largely scattered and fragmented in southern range of the species. Among the predictors used, the distance to evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest was the strongest predictor out of the 35 used for model building. Moreover, land use and land cover were found to be more informative than the climatic variables. Much of the suitable habitats of the species are located outside the protected area network in the landscape. Therefore, we identified landscape configurations and suitable habitat areas for the future conservation and monitoring of Golden langur in the protected areas of its range.

AB  - The integration of spatial area prioritization algorithms and species distribution modelling has shown great promise in conservation planning in recent years. However, despite the fact that reptiles and amphibians have the highest threat status of all terrestrial vertebrates, these species are often under-represented in conservation planning. The Kingdom of Morocco possesses the richest and most varied herpetofauna in the Maghreb and the western Mediterranean, and is characterized by high species richness, endemism and number of European relict species. Despite the fact that Moroccan reptiles and amphibians have been the subject of numerous studies by a large number of international herpetologists since the beginning of the 20th century, few or none of these concerned their conservation. This study had three main objectives: (1) to identify those areas that harbour the highest species richness; (2) to evaluate the existing and proposed future 'important biological and ecological sites' (SIBES) conservation area network (CAN) with respect to their ability to protect the herpetofauna adequately; and (3) to identify priority areas into which the existing protected areas can be augmented. We used maximum-entropy species distribution modelling to run distribution models for 11 amphibian and 86 reptile species (27.6% endemics and 12.4% threatened) for which we had 2,170 single geographic records. A total of 97 models were used to create a richness map of the Moroccan herpetofauna and thereby detect both areas of high species richness and the distribution patterns of individual species. This map was subsequently used as a basis for performance evaluation of the CAN and area prioritization using the ConsNet conservation planning software initialized by "Rarity" first, while using representation targets of 5% and 10%. Additionally, the proposed future Moroccan CAN (SIBES) was evaluated in terms of its overlay and proximity with ConsNet solutions using visual interpretation and distance measurements in a GIS. Our results show that Moroccan herpetofauna is poorly protected under the existing and future CAN. Prioritization of areas shows that a major increase in conservation area is required to guarantee the persistence of individual herpetofauna species even with a global minimum representation target of only 10%. An increase of the existing CAN is especially needed along parts of the Atlantic coast, in the north-western Mediterranean region, on the north-eastern Moroccan coast, as well as in several areas in the Sahara, notably vast proportions of the Vallee du Haut and Bas Draa.

AB  - Having valid and up-to-date information on the ecological and conservation status of threatened species is one of the most important elements in the establishment of an effective conservation programme. Micromeria serbaliana and Veronica kaiseri are endemic perennial plants in the St Catherine Protected Area (SCPA), South Sinai, Egypt. It should be noted that both species have not been recorded since 1998. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the ecological and conservation status of the two species by: i) verifying their presence in the field; (ii) determining the current ecological and conservation status through an IUCN Red List Assessment; and (iii) identifying potentially suitable habitat by using the Species Distribution Model (SDM) as a tool to support Red List assessment. Extensive field surveys were carried out from March to September 2017 to determine the target species distribution, population characteristics, habitat, ecology, and threats. The results of these surveys provided great news, the two species were recorded in 14 sites, most of which are not historic (ten sites for M. serbaliana and five sites for V. kaiseri), in a very small restricted area of high mountains. The Extent of Occurrence (EOO) was 65.8 km(2) for M. serbaliana and 108.4 km(2) for V. kaiseri. The population sizes were very small, scattered, and fragmented. SDMs found that the potential suitable habitats for both species are concentrated in high mountain areas in the Middle North part of SCPA. A total of 20.4 km(2) were predicted to have a high probability that M. serbaliana is present, whereas 68.6 km(2) were predicted to have a high probability that V. kaiseri is present. SDMs were highly efficient in predicting the suitable habitat and in estimating EOO, and these models were therefore able to contribute to determining the extinction risk of the two species. Based on the assessed distributions and threats to the populations of M. serbaliana and V. kaiseri, we predict that both species have an Endangered status according to IUCN Red List Categories and criteria. Many threats have been detected that have a strong and noticeable impact on the target plants in the field, such as grazing and drought, and this calls for the establishment of an urgent conservation program. In situ (through recovery) and ex situ (through seed collection and storage, as well as awareness raising) conservation practices are recommended.

AB  - As a megadiverse country with three global biodiversity hotspots, a growing human population, and a rapidly developing economy, South Africa exemplifies the challenges facing modern conservation biology. South Africa has established a protected areas network which encompasses 1527 National Parks, nature reserves, wilderness areas, mountain catchment areas, and World Heritage sites. However, the contribution of South Africa's protected areas to biodiversity conservation remains poorly known as many currently protected areas were selected based on the affordability of land or simply situated on sites that were unsuitable for commercial activities, rather than on the biological diversity within them. Here, we model the distribution of > 10,000 species, representing South Africa's endemic flora, to evaluate the conservation effectiveness of the current protected areas network. We show that the flora within protected areas has been better sampled than sites outside of protected areas. However, the current protected areas network fails to adequately encompass threatened taxa, many of which are found in threatened ecosystems. We identify locations that represent important conservation gaps, and we suggest that these areas should be included in future conservation planning.

AB  - Aim Cetaceans are inherently difficult to study due to their elusive, pelagic and often highly migratory nature. New Zealand waters are home to 50% of the world's cetacean species, but their spatial distributions are poorly known. Here, we model distributions of 30 cetacean taxa using an extensive at-sea sightings dataset (n > 14,000) and high-resolution (1 km(2)) environmental data layers.
   Location New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
   Methods Two models were used to predict probability of species occurrence based on available sightings records. For taxa with <50 sightings (n = 15), Relative Environmental Suitability (RES), and for taxa with >= 50 sightings (n = 15), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models were used. Independently collected presence/absence data were used for further model evaluation for a subset of taxa.
   Results RES models for rarely sighted species showed reasonable fits to available sightings and stranding data based on literature and expert knowledge on the species' autecology. BRT models showed high predictive power for commonly sighted species (AUC: 0.79-0.99). Important variables for predicting the occurrence of cetacean taxa were temperature residuals, bathymetry, distance to the 500 m isobath, mixed layer depth and water turbidity. Cetacean distribution patterns varied from highly localised, nearshore (e.g., Hector's dolphin), to more ubiquitous (e.g., common dolphin) to primarily offshore species (e.g., blue whale). Cetacean richness based on stacked species occurrence layers illustrated patterns of fewer inshore taxa with localised richness hotspots, and higher offshore richness especially in locales of the Macquarie Ridge, Bounty Trough and Chatham Rise.
   Main conclusions Predicted spatial distributions fill a major knowledge gap towards informing future assessments and conservation planning for cetaceans in New Zealand's extensive EEZ. While sightings datasets were not spatially comprehensive for any taxa, these two best available approaches allow for predictive modelling of both more common, and of rarely sighted, cetacean species with limited available information.

AB  - Managers often have incomplete information to make decisions about threatened species management, and lack the time or funding needed to obtain complete information. Value of information (VOI) analysis can assist managers in deciding whether to manage using current information or monitor to reduce uncertainty before managing. However, VOI analysis has not yet been applied to spatial allocation of monitoring resources across a landscape.
   Here, we demonstrate how to make the best use of data from species distribution models (SDMs) and VOI analysis to assess the value of land protection decisions for single and multiple-species objectives across a heterogeneous landscape. Our method determines the situations where one should monitor before protecting the land, and those where one should act based on current incomplete information. Further, we prioritize land planning units based on cost-effectiveness (expected number of occurrences protected per dollar spent) and identify properties to target for monitoring or immediate conservation.
   In a single species case study, we found that the optimal decision was to act based on current information when the prior probability of detecting an occurrence in a survey was low. When probability of detection was high, it was most effective to monitor the majority of units. In a multi-species case study, monitoring was only optimal in 50% of cases, due to high inferred probability of at least one occurrence of a threatened species in many units. When compared to a simulation where units were monitored by default, using VOI to determine which units were monitored or prioritized for immediate conservation led to an increase in the expected number of occurrences protected.
   Synthesis and applications. Using a combination of species distribution models and value of information analysis can assist managers in efficiently distributing limited resources for protected area allocation. Our results suggest that if managers can use value of information to monitor more efficiently, it can lead to protecting a greater number of threatened species occurrences.

AB  - Species can respond to climate change by tracking appropriate environmental conditions in space, resulting in a range shift. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can help forecast such range shift responses. For few species, both correlative and mechanistic SDMs were built, but allis shad (Alosa alosa), an endangered anadromous fish species, is one of them. The main purpose of this study was to provide a framework for joint analyses of correlative and mechanistic SDMs projections in order to strengthen conservation measures for species of conservation concern. Guidelines for joint representation and subsequent interpretation of models outputs were defined and applied. The present joint analysis was based on the novel mechanistic model GR3D (Global Repositioning Dynamics of Diadromous fish Distribution) which was parameterized on allis shad and then used to predict its future distribution along the European Atlantic coast under different climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). We then used a correlative SDM for this species to forecast its distribution across the same geographic area and under the same climate change scenarios. First, projections from correlative and mechanistic models provided congruent trends in probability of habitat suitability and population dynamics. This agreement was preferentially interpreted as referring to the species vulnerability to climate change. Climate change could not be accordingly listed as a major threat for allis shad. The congruence in predicted range limits between SDMs projections was the next point of interest. The difference, when noticed, required to deepen our understanding of the niche modelled by each approach. In this respect, the relative position of the northern range limit between the two methods strongly suggested here that a key biological process related to intraspecific variability was potentially lacking in the mechanistic SDM. Based on our knowledge, we hypothesized that local adaptations to cold temperatures deserved more attention in terms of modelling, but further in conservation planning as well.

AB  - The Amazon floodplains represent important surfaces of highly valuable ecosystems, yet they remain neglected from protected areas. Although the efficiency of the protected area network of the Amazon basin may be jeopardized by climate change, floodplains are exposed to important consequences of climate change but are omitted from species distribution models and protection gap analyses. The present and future (2070) distribution of the giant bony-tongue fish Arapaima spp. (Arapaimidae) was modelled accounting for climate and habitat requirements, and with a consideration of dam presence (already existing and planned constructions) and hydroperiod (high- and low-water stages). The amount of suitable environment that falls inside and outside the current network of protected areas was quantified to identify spatial conservation gaps. We predict that climate change will cause a decline in environmental suitability by 16.6% during the high-water stage, and by 19.4% during the low-water stage. About 70% of the suitable environments of Arapaima spp. remain currently unprotected. The gap is higher by 0.7% during the low-water stage. The lack of protection is likely to increase by 5% with future climate change effects. Both existing and projected dam constructions may hamper population flows between the central, Bolivian and Peruvian parts of the basin. We highlight protection gaps mostly in the south-western part of the basin and recommend the extension of the current network of protected areas in the floodplains of the upper Ucayali, Jurua and Purus rivers and their tributaries. This study has shown the importance of integrating hydroperiod and dispersal barriers in forecasting the distribution of freshwater fish species, and stresses the urgent need to integrate floodplains within the protected area networks.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the impacts of climate change on the distribution of major tree species in the temperate forests of Northern Iran (also known as Hyrcanian forests). We analyzed the current distributions of the eleven major tree species using an ensemble approach involving five different species distribution models (generalized linear model, generalized additive model, generalized boosting model, classification tree analysis, and random forests) and generated the ensemble maps of the current and future distribution of each species. For the future, we used five general circulation models and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Finally, we mapped beta-diversity and changes in alpha-diversity of the tree species under climate change. Our analyses showed that generally, the climatically suitable habitats for most of the species tend to shift and shrink in the future. A shift in major trees boundaries will be expected both along an east-west gradient and along an altitudinal gradient under climate change scenarios. The results demonstrated that climate change is likely to exert a strong influence on beta-diversity and richness of the major tree species in northern forests of Iran. In total, beta-diversity of tree species will be higher in the central and eastern parts compared with the western areas under the climate change scenarios and the mid-elevations of the western Hyrcanian forests will likely experience the lowest beta-diversity through time, meaning that the impacts of climate change on these regions are minimal. The impacts of climate change on the distribution of major tree species in the Hyrcanian forests can be considered very severe and pose a high risk of loss in forest functions and services. Forest managers will encounter several uncertainties in the wood productions, plantation, restoration, and conservation plans due to climate change in the Hyrcanian forests.

AB  - The Lao newt (Laotriton laoensis) is a recently described species currently known only from northern Laos. Little is known about the species, but it is threatened as a result of overharvesting. We integrated field survey results with climate and altitude data to predict the geographic distribution of this species using the niche modeling program MAXENT, and we validated these predictions by using interviews with local residents to confirm model predictions of presence and absence. The results of the validated MAXENT models were then used to characterize the environmental conditions of areas predicted suitable for L. laoensis. Finally, we overlaid the resulting model with a map of current national protected areas in Laos to determine whether or not any land predicted to be suitable for this species is coincident with a national protected area. We found that both area under the curve (AUC) values and interview data provided strong support for the predictive power of these models, and we suggest that interview data could be used more widely in species distribution niche modeling. Our results further indicated that this species is mostly likely geographically restricted to high altitude regions (i.e., over 1,000 m elevation) in northern Laos and that only a minute fraction of suitable habitat is currently protected. This work thus emphasizes that increased protection efforts, including listing this species as endangered and the establishment of protected areas in the region predicted to be suitable for L. laoensis, are urgently needed.

AB  - To advance the development of conservation planning for rare species with small geographic ranges, we determined habitat associations of Siskiyou Mountains salamanders (Plethodon stormi) and developed habitat suitability models at fine (10 ha), medium (40 ha), and broad (202 ha) spatial scales using available Geographic Information Systems data and logistic regression analysis with an information theoretic approach. Across spatial scales, there was very little support for models with structural habitat features, such as tree canopy cover and conifer diameter. Model-averaged 95% confidence intervals for regression coefficients and associated odds ratios indicated that the occurrence of Siskiyou Mountains salamanders was positively associated with rocky soils and Pacific madrone (Abutus menziesii) and negatively associated with elevation and white fir (Abies concolor); these associations were consistent across 3 spatial scales. The occurrence of this species also was positively associated with hardwood density at the medium spatial scale. Odds ratios projected that a 10% decrease in white fir abundance would increase the odds of salamander occurrence 3.02-4.47 times, depending on spatial scale. We selected the model with rocky soils, white fir, and Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) as the best model across 3 spatial scales and created habitat suitability maps for Siskiyou Mountains salamanders by projecting habitat suitability scores across the landscape. Our habitat suitability models and maps are applicable to selection of priority conservation areas for Siskiyou Mountains salamanders, and our approach can be easily adapted to conservation of other rare species in any geographical location.

AB  - A growing number of human activities are among the top factors causing habitat loss and fragmentation. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal changes in habitat suitability, connectivity status and analysis of these changes using landscape ecology approach. Evidences indicate high probability of local extinction of Caspian red deer (Cervus elaphus maral Gray, 1850) in the current habitats of Guilan province in the north of Iran due to severe habitat destruction. In this study, habitat suitability layers and corridors were drawn with combining layers of land cover derived from the interpretation of satellite images, elevation, topography and distance to man-made in the period 1990-2015. Accordingly, 35% decrease in area metric of habitat suitability, 34% increase in the number of patches, 89% in edge density and 53% reduction in the average size of patches indicate that the occurrence of habitat fragmentation along with habitat loss, severely disrupted the integrity of the habitat. As a result, in all corridors, the relative share of semi-dense and dense forest cover were reduced. Research results have given a clear picture of the extent of changes in habitat suitability and connectivity paths that can have an effective role in restoration process.

AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are frequently associated with negative effects on biodiversity in natural and semi natural landscapes. Innovative spatio-temporal modelling tools may be valuable to support the design and optimization of conservation strategies for endangered species in a context of changes in land use and land cover (LULC). The Red-billed Chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) is a vulnerable corvid that exhibits high levels of population fragmentation and decline trends, due to its dependence on open habitats shaped by traditional agriculture and pastoralism. Here, we apply a spatially-explicit framework based on the stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM) principles to capture the trends of relevant population foraging ground attributes, assumed as proxies of the habitat suitability for two endangered Portuguese chough populations. StDM simulations were produced in order to capture the densities and distribution patterns of foraging flocking choughs in response to the complexity and dynamics of some realistic abandonment LULC scenarios expected to occur in the near future. Our modelling outputs reflect satisfactorily the seasonality of these patterns and suggest that the maintenance of traditional agriculture/pastoralism practices in at least 75% of the actual favourable areas is mandatory to ensure the foraging habitat suitability for choughs, evidencing the species high vulnerability in their last refuges in Portugal. This modelling approach represents a step forward in evaluating the consequences of LULC changes on endangered birds, which can be used in the future to guide effective conservation planning in the scope of habitat suitability management.

AB  - The combined study of movement patterns and habitat selection, behaviors that are affected by landscape structure, is of critical importance for effective conservation of wildlife. In the same context, maintaining connectivity is a key component for facilitating movement and ensuring species persistence. The brown bear is a wide-ranging predator that moves across large areas, crossing various habitats of different quality. Here, we provide a methodological framework that allowed us to explore the relative importance of habitat quality upon movement patterns and connectivity. First, we developed habitat-suitability models by using telemetry data of eight male brown bears (12,893 radio-locations) collected in Greece. Next, we combined habitat-suitability maps with real movement data to develop graph models that represent movement networks as inter-connected patches of different quality. Network analyses revealed that movement networks demonstrate some well-studied properties regarding their structure and robustness (i.e. scale-free and small-world), providing insights on the contribution of patches of different quality to connectivity. Less suitable patches were found to play a critical role for facilitating brown bear's movement and landscape connectivity. Our findings raise the importance of considering the entire habitat of brown bear in conservation planning rather than isolated patches of high quality, as it might have been revealed by simple habitat-suitability models. Our results highlight the need of assessing the importance of the intervening matrix for facilitating connectivity and movement specifically in the case of large and highly mobile species that do not perceive landscape as strictly dichotomous.

AB  - The expansion of protected areas is a critical component of strategies to promote the continued existence of biodiversity (i.e., life at all levels of biological organization) as climate changes, but scientific, social, and economic uncertainties associated with climate change are some of the major obstacles preventing such expansion. New models of climate change and species distribution and new methods of conservation planning now make it possible to explore the uncertainties associated with climate changes and species responses. Yet few reliable estimates of the costs of expanding protected areas and methods for determining these costs exist, largely because of the many (and uncertain) determinants of these costs. We developed a cost-accounting model to estimate the range in costs of various options for expanding protected areas and to explore the variables that drive these costs. Model development was informed by an existing plan to expand protected areas in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa to address species conservation under a scenario of climate change. The 50-year present value of total costs varied from US$260 million ($1077/ha) for an off-reserve option that involves agreements with landowners and no compensation of forgone production and associated revenue to $1020 million ($4228/ha) for an on-reserve option that involves land acquisition and protection. The costs of acquiring land or compensating landowners for forgone production and development opportunities were the major drivers of the total costs across all options because most of the area identified in the protected-area expansion plan consisted of urban and high-quality agricultural lands. Total costs were also affected by changes in protected area extent and discount rate. Model-generated outputs such as these may be useful for informing implementation strategies and the allocation of future efforts in monitoring, data collection, and model development.

AB  - Global changes may direct species expansion away from their current range. When such an expansion occurs, and the species colonizes a new region, it is important to monitor the habitat used by the species and utilize the information to updated management strategies. Water deer (Hydropotes inermis) is listed as Vulnerable species in IUCN Red List and is restricted to east central China and the Korean Peninsula. Since 2017, water deer has expanded its range towards northeast China and the Russian Far East. The objective of our study is to provide support for a better understanding of habitat use and provide suggestions for developing conservation strategy. We collected occurrence data in northeast China and the Russian Far East during 2017-2021. We used MaxEnt to predict habitat suitability for water deer and applied Circuitscape to determine possible dispersal routes for the species. We used seven environmental variables, viz., altitude, slope, aspect, distance to built-up area, distance to water source, distance to cropland and distance to roads for habitat suitability prediction. We chose the MaxEnt model (AICc = 2572.86) suitable for our data with the AUC value result of 0.935 +/- 0.014. There is good quality habitat for water deer in the boundary area of the Yalu and Tumen River estuaries between China, North Korea, and the Russian Far East, as well as the east and west regions of the Korean Peninsula. We identified three main suitable habitat patches, two of them located in east (NK2) and west (NK3) North Korea, and one in the newly colonized area downstream of the Tumen River along the border of China, Russia, and North Korea (TM1). Elevation, distance to cropland and water sources, and presence of wetlands were the variables that positively contributed to modelling the suitable habitats. Two possible dispersal routes were determined using the circuit theory, one was across the area from North Korea to the downstream Tumen transboundary region (Route B), and the other was across North Korea to the boundary region in China and along the tiger national park in northern China (Route A). A series of protected areas in North Korea, China, and Russia may support the dispersal of water deer. From the study on water deer dispersal, we can understand the existing ecological network in northeast Asia, which will benefit the whole landscape and biodiversity conservation. However, there are many threats present, and there is need for continued monitoring inside and outside the protected areas. Information sharing with stakeholders and carrying out local communities awareness activities are important. The establishment of a Northeast Asia landscape conservation network would help establish monitoring and conservation planning at a broad scale, and this study provides an example of the need for such a network.

AB  - Protected area systems should ideally maintain adaptive and neutral evolutionary processes. To achieve this, plans for expanding protected area systems (prioritizations) can improve coverage of related attributes (evolutionary attributes). However, long-standing challenges in mapping and operationalizing evolutionary attributes have prevented their widespread usage. We outline a novel framework for incorporating evolutionary processes into conservation planning. Using three amphibian species in the Iberian Peninsula (Hyla molleri,Pelobates cultripesandRana iberica), we mapped a comprehensive range of adaptive and neutral evolutionary attributes to delineate places containing individuals with moderate to high heterozygosity, different neutral genetic clusters, different adaptive genetic clusters and climatic refugia. We overlaid these maps with boundaries of existing protected areas to quantify representation shortfalls and generated a prioritization to identify additional priority areas. To assess the performance of conventional approaches, we also generated a prioritization using only the species' distribution data-without the evolutionary attributes. We found that existing protected areas within the Iberian Peninsula are failing to adequately represent evolutionary attributes for the study species. Specifically, they are not adequately representing places predicted to contain individuals with moderate to high heterozygosity for any of the studied species, and neither are they adequately representing the species' potential climatic refugia. They also have poor coverage of the distinct adaptive and neutral genetic clusters that comprise each of the species' distributions. By incorporating the evolutionary attributes into the prioritization process, we identified priority areas that would address all of the shortfalls for only a minor increase in the size of the protected area system. In comparison, the prioritization generated following conventional approaches, despite encompassing a similar extent, did not substantially improve representation of the species' evolutionary attributes. Synthesis and applications. We introduce a framework for incorporating adaptive and neutral evolutionary processes into conservation planning. This framework can reveal weaknesses in the coverage of climatic refugia, genetic diversity and potential local adaptations by existing protected areas. Moreover, it can identify priority areas to improve conservation of evolutionary processes. Since neglecting evolutionary processes can impair conservation plans, we recommend using evolutionary data to inform decision-making where possible.

AB  - Capsule Spatial environmental modelling well predicted nesting distribution of the White stork in Southeast Europe and can be used in conservation planning with respect to climate change.
   Aims To create spatial models for predicting White Stork presence and densities in the Southeast Europe to identify areas of suitable habitat for White Storks.
   Methods We quantified the habitat used by nesting White storks in Southeast Europe. Using spatial modelling, we defined a set of free and available online environmental variables that predict the breeding localities of the species. We employed pseudo-absences and the kriging of the residuals in order to create predictive models of nest presence and density.
   Results The presence-absence model was found to be precise in predicting the presence of nests. Both density and presence of breeding pairs were best explained negatively by elevation, slope, minimum temperature during May, and distance to the nearest human settlement and positively by topographic wetness index, total area of human settlement and spring precipitation.
   Conclusion Our robust and easily repeatable models offer a conservation tool to reveal suitable but unoccupied localities for breeding White Storks pairs which may inform our understanding of how climate change might affect the species' distribution in the future. For example, protecting White Storks on the Dalmatian coast may become even more significant in the future, because the Dalmatian coast is predicted as the only suitable breeding area in Croatia later this century.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to interpret and map fish distributions based on habitat variables and other drivers. Reef fish avoidance behavior has been shown to vary in the presence of divers and is primarily driven by spearfishing pressure. Diver avoidance behavior or fish wariness may spatially influence counts and other descriptive measures of fish assemblages. Because fish assemblage metrics are response variables for SDMs, measures of fish wariness may be useful as predictors in SDMs of fishes targeted by spearfishing. We used a diver operated stereo-video system to conduct fish surveys and record minimum approach distance (MAD) of targeted reef fishes inside and outside of two marine reserves on the island of O'ahu in the main Hawaiian Islands. By comparing MAD between sites and management types we tested the assumption that it provides a proxy for fish wariness related to spearfishing pressure. We then compared the accuracy of SDMs which included MAD as a predictor with SDMs that did not. Individual measures of MAD differed between sites though not management types. When included as a predictor, MAD averaged at the transect level greatly improved the accuracy of SDMs of targeted fish biomass.

AB  - Animal movement has direct applications in spatial management and conservation planning, yet it is rarely taken into account for the design of natural protected areas. For instance, reef shark species are thought to benefit from marine protected area networks, even though their movement behaviour remains poorly characterized. Poor understanding of species' movements implies that the benefits of MPA networks for species' populations are still widely unknown. To understand the consequences of movement behaviour for protection, we modelled movements of three reef shark species' (Carcharhinus albimarginatus,C. amblyrhynchosandC. leucas) with distinct levels of reef association using real passive-acoustic telemetry data. The model simulates if individuals are protected or unprotected by their movements in a system of reef patches in a network of MPAs. Model parameters that control individuals' movements were estimated from acoustic telemetry data. To estimate benefits for species we monitored longevity and time spent in protected habitats across all scenarios of reef protection, fishing intensity (11 values for each) and protection of high or low suitability reefs (a reef-dependent factor that attracts sharks to reside in it) for populations of 1,000 individuals per species. The time individuals spent in protected reefs increased linearly with protection until it levelled off after 50%-80% of reefs protected (78%C. amblyrhynchos, 72%C. albimarginatusand 52% C. leucas, at 100% protection). Individuals' life span decreased exponentially with fishing intensity. Reef protection only mildly counteracted life span lost to fishing. Protecting highly suitable reefs increased time spent in protected reefs, optimal protection was reached at a lower number of reefs protected, and life expectancy was higher with protection of highly suitable reefs. Synthesis and applications. Our framework can be applied to many studies using passive-acoustic telemetry to track animal movements. Protected area networks benefit species highly attached to protected sites. To increase benefits of marine protected area networks for all species (with low and high degrees of reef attachment) we need to understand the use of reef-adjacent areas, dispersal routes and characterize reef suitability for multiple species.

AB  - One way that climate change will impact animal distributions is by altering habitat suitability and habitat fragmentation. Understanding the impacts of climate change on currently threatened species is of immediate importance because complex conservation planning will be required. Here, we mapped changes to the distribution, suitability, and fragmentation of giant panda habitat under climate change and quantified the direction and elevation of habitat shift and fragmentation patterns. These data were used to develop a series of new conservation strategies for the giant panda. Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi, China. Data from the most recent giant panda census, habitat factors, anthropogenic disturbance, climate variables, and climate predictions for the year 2050 (averaged across four general circulation models) were used to project giant panda habitat in Maxent. Differences in habitat patches were compared between now and 2050. While climate change will cause a 9.1% increase in suitable habitat and 9% reduction in subsuitable habitat by 2050, no significant net variation in the proportion of suitable and subsuitable habitat was found. However, a distinct climate change-induced habitat shift of 11 km eastward by 2050 is predicted firstly. Climate change will reduce the fragmentation of suitable habitat at high elevations and exacerbate the fragmentation of subsuitable habitat below 1,900 m above sea level. Reduced fragmentation at higher elevations and worsening fragmentation at lower elevations have the potential to cause overcrowding of giant pandas at higher altitudes, further exacerbating habitat shortage in the central Qinling Mountains. The habitat shift to the east due to climate change may provide new areas for giant pandas but poses severe challenges for future conservation.

AB  - Many studies are based on the assumption that an area and its surrounding (buffer) area present similar environmental conditions and can be compared. For example, in order to assess the effectiveness of a protected area, the land use/cover changes are compared inside the park with its surroundings. However, the heterogeneity in spatial variables can bias this assessment: we have shown that most of the protected areas in Mexico present significant environmental differences between their interior and their surroundings. Therefore, a comparison that aims at assessing the effectiveness of conservation strategies, must be cautioned. In this paper, a simple method which allows the generation of a buffer area that presents similar conditions with respect to a set of environmental variables is presented. The method was used in order to assess the effectiveness of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, a protected area located in the south-eastern part of Mexico. The annual rate of deforestation inside the protected area, the standard buffer area (based upon distance from the protected area only) and the similar buffer area (taking into account distance along with some environmental variables) were 0.3, 1.3 and 0.6%, respectively. These results showed that the protected area was effective in preventing land clearing, but that the comparison with the standard buffer area gave an over-optimistic vision of its effectiveness.

AB  - Zagros Mountains are like an island in the Middle East and they are subjected to changes in climate. Daphne mucronata Royle is an important medicinal plant species preserved in the high elevation regions in these mountains. Maxent species distribution model was used to integrate presence data (2413 points) and environmental variables to model the current and future potential distribution of D. mucronata in Iran. The most important variables were Bio19 with 50.5% contribution, followed by Bio8 and Bio2 with 30% and 11.4% contributions, respectively. The best Maxent model included seven variables, 4 feature types (linear, quadratic, product, and hinge), and had a test AUC value of 0.894. The current potential distribution indicated that 8% of Iran's drylands are suitable for growing D. mucronata and this area could decrease to 5.2% under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5, and 3.1% under RCP 8.5 due to climate change. Our results suggest that D. mucronata may lose overall about 2.8% and 4.9% of its current distribution under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, by 2050. There would be only 0.7 and 0.2% gains under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The species would locally disappear between 1500- and 2000-m elevation under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The establishment of some stations for monitoring the changes in transition zone or lost areas especially on the southeastern parts of Zagros Mountain can help in detecting changes in the future. Additionally, stable habitats may be good target areas for future conservation planning.

AB  - Orchids are among the most threatened plants due to habitat loss and illegal harvesting for horticultural demands. Sabah is a centre of orchid diversity, with approximately 1300 species of which 250 orchid taxa are endemic to Sabah. In this study, we conducted an IUCN Red List assessment on 136 endemic species and used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) to develop species distribution models for 47 species. The species distribution models were developed using presence-only data and six environmental predictors. The accuracy of the models were assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and models with an AUC of higher than 0.8 stacked together to produce a species richness heatmap. We found that 83% of the researched species were threatened, of which 14 species were assessed to be Critically Endangered, eight species as Endangered and 93 species as Vulnerable. The heatmap shows that all of the species occurred within the Totally Protected Area (TPA) network in western Sabah. The heatmap highlighted the mid-altitude areas adjacent to the Kinabalu and Crocker Range parks and Ulu Sipitang regions as areas with a high species richness that were outside the TPA network. These areas are also important for the conservation of the majority of the species assessed as Critically Endangered and Endangered. Urgent conservation actions are needed to protect these species from extinction. The results from this work will be used as part of an intensive conservation action plan for threatened endemic orchids of Sabah and used to identify important plant areas currently not within the existing TPA network.

AB  - Biodiversity impact assessments under threatened species legislation often focus on individual development proposals at a single location, usually for a single species, leading to inadequate assessments of multiple impacts that accumulate over large spatial scales for multiple species. Regulations requiring ad-hoc assessments can lead to death by a thousand cuts, where biodiversity is degraded by many small impacts that individually do not appear to threaten species' persistence. Spatial prioritization methods can improve the efficiency of decision-making by explicitly considering cumulative impacts of multiple proposed developments on multiple species over large spatial scales. We present an assessment approach and a unique case study in which spatial prioritization tools were used to support strategic assessment of a large development plan in Western Australia. The application of the approach helped identify relatively minor alterations to development plans that resulted in reductions in biodiversity impacts and informed expansion of the protected area network. Using these tools to assess trade-offs between conservation and development will help identify planning footprints that minimize biodiversity losses.

AB  - Climate change affects parasitic plants and their hosts on distributions. However, little is known about how parasites and their hosts shift in distribution, and niche overlap in response to global change remains unclear to date. Here, the potential distribution and habitat suitability of four endangered holoparasites and their primary hosts in northern China were predicted using MaxEnt based on occurrence records and bioclimatic variables. The results indicated that (1) Temperature annual range (Bio7) and Precipitation of driest quarter (Bio17) were identified as the common key climatic factors influencing distribution (percentage contribution > 10%) for Cynomorium songaricum vs. Nitraria sibirica (i.e., parasite vs. host); Temperature seasonality (Bio4) and Precipitation of driest month (Bio14) for Boschniakia rossica vs. Alnus mandshurica; Bio4 for Cistanche deserticola vs. Haloxylon ammodendron; Precipitation of warmest quarter (Bio18) for Cistanche mongolica vs. Tamarix ramosissima. Accordingly, different parasite-host pairs share to varying degree the common climatic factors. (2) Currently, these holoparasites had small suitable habitats (i.e., moderately and highly) (0.97-3.77%), with few highly suitable habitats (0.19-0.81%). Under future scenarios, their suitable habitats would change to some extent; their distribution shifts fell into two categories: growing type (Boschniakia rossica and Cistanche mongolica) and fluctuating type (Cynomorium songaricum and Cistanche deserticola). In contrast, the hosts' current suitable habitats (1.42-13.43%) varied greatly, with highly restricted suitable habitats (0.18-1.00%). Under future scenarios, their suitable habitats presented different trends: growing type (Nitraria sibirica), declining type (Haloxylon ammodendron) and fluctuating type (the other hosts). (3) The niche overlaps between parasites and hosts differed significantly in the future, which can be grouped into two categories: growing type (Boschniakia rossica vs. Alnus mandshurica, Cistanche mongolica vs. Tamarix ramosissima), and fluctuating type (the others). Such niche overlap asynchronies may result in severe spatial limitations of parasites under future climate conditions. Our findings indicate that climate factors restricting parasites and hosts' distributions, niche overlaps between them, together with parasitic species identity, may jointly influence the suitable habitats of parasitic plants. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the threatened holoparasites themselves in conjunction with their suitable habitats and the parasite-host association when developing conservation planning in the future.

AB  - The development of species distribution models (SDMs) has benefited biodiversity conservation through their linkage of science to policy and decision processes. These models have evolved to provide scenarios of future landscapes based on known and projected environmental parameters. Whereas there are many caveats to their use, the persuasive power of the models for conveying the consequences of environmental change to the non-science community is immense. Scientists are obliged to convey the uncertainty of the futures depicted in their models, but also to involve the stakeholders who will shape those future conditions. Stakeholders can identify the natural resources they want to sustain, voice their priorities in environmental policy, and articulate the range of solutions they are willing to accept. The creation of alternative futures is an academic exercise if not linked to real viable decisions concerning important resources. SDMs only reach their full potential when they bring together scientists, public stakeholders and policy makers, and are used as an adaptive management tool to understand complex landscapes that are undergoing short- and long-term change.

AB  - Environmental Diversity (ED) has been proposed as a potential biodiversity surrogate for use in spatial biodiversity planning. The concept is based on the premise that differences in species composition between areas are correlated with differences in environmental conditions. If this is true then sites selected to represent the full range of environmental conditions in an area should provide good coverage of species diversity. This is potentially significant for conservation planning because environmental data are more easily available while species distribution data are often incomplete, but empirical tests of ED have been inconclusive. We explored the value of ED as a biodiversity surrogate using species distribution data from South Africa, focusing on how implementation affects its performance. We used empirical distribution datasets for birds, butterflies, frogs, and reptiles as well as artificial species distributions and modeled distributions for butterflies. Our results show that the form of the underlying optimization model and the number of environmental variables have a significant effect on the performance of ED while the choice of heuristic procedures for selecting sites has no significant effect. We conclude that ED can perform well as a biodiversity surrogacy strategy if it is implemented correctly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To help conserve biodiversity in coming decades, protected areas need to be located in places that will be important for species as their ranges shift to track suitable climatic conditions. Had past protected areas been optimally targeted to cover today?s biodiversity, then we would expect future coverage to decline. However, past protected area siting was often biased towards higher elevations and, with upslope movements of many species predicted under climate change projections, perhaps future coverage may improve as a result. We examine present and future coverage of species potential ranges by protected areas in the Appalachian Mountains, a critical climate refuge and corridor for the biodiversity of the eastern United States. We parameterize climate niche models using the Maxent algorithm with occurrence records for 258 amphibian, bird, mammal, and reptile species of conservation policy concern that depend on forested habitat. We forecast future range shifts by integrating climate projections from six global circulation models and two representative concentration pathways while making contrasting assumptions about species dispersal. We then examine coverage of the estimated present and future ranges of species by existing protected areas. Most of these policy relevant species (93%) have less than 15% of their present estimated range in the region covered by protected areas. We found that species ranked as high conservation priority would be poorly protected under future climate scenarios. We predicted amphibian and mammal coverages by protected areas would worsen whereas coverages of birds and reptiles improve if species are able to disperse freely to future climatically suitable habitat. If species movements are more restricted, then we predict marked losses of species from protected areas, particularly amphibians and mammals. Our results identify obvious candidate locations for adding new protected areas in places that are currently under-protected and that harbor a high diversity of species across all future climate scenarios we consider.

AB  - Land-use changes have severely degraded natural landscapes around the world, constituting the primary driver of biodiversity loss. In recent decades, agriculture expansion and the lack of effective conservation policies have mainly eroded tropical forests. Here, we built multi-scale habitat suitability models to investigate how land-use changes in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest over the last 30 years (1989-2019) have impacted habitat suitability and connectivity for six globally threatened or near-threatened species. We also assessed how the cover of highly suitable forests by protected areas has changed over the study period. We found an average reduction of 10% of suitable forests for the target species. Our models estimated a loss of up to 37% of highly suitable forests, with more range-restricted species experiencing the greatest declines. Today, forests still cover most highly suitable areas found in 1989, however they show reduced suitability due to landscape degradation. Pasture, agriculture, and forest plantations were the main land uses that replaced highly suitable forests. The land-use changes also deteriorated the connectivity network for most species. Although the total area protected more than doubled in the Atlantic Forest, we showed that the highly suitable forests under some level of protection covers only 0.6-2.5% of species extent of occurrence. Our study demonstrates how unplanned land-use changes can erode forest quantity, quality, and connectivity for threatened species, challenging their long-term persistence. Our findings reveal the need to expand and improve the protected area network of the Atlantic Forest and highlight the critical role of land-use planning for protecting biodiversity.

AB  - Identifying the factors predicting the high-elevation suitable habitats of Central Asian argali wild sheep and how these suitable habitats are affected by the changing climate regimes could help address conservation and management efforts and identify future critical habitat for the species in eastern Tajikistan. This study used environmental niche models (ENMs) to map and compare potential present and future distributions of suitable environmental conditions for Marco Polo argali. Argali occurrence points were collected during field surveys conducted from 2009 to 2016. Our models showed that terrain ruggedness and annual mean temperature had strong correlations on argali distribution. We then used two greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for two future time periods (2050 and 2070) to model the impacts of climate change on Marco Polo argali habitat. Results indicated a decline of suitable habitat with majority of losses observed at lower elevations (3,300-4,300m). Models that considered all variables (climatic and nonclimatic) predicted losses of present suitable areas of 60.6% (6,928km(2)) and 63.2% (7,219km(2)) by 2050 and 2070, respectively. Results also showed averaged habitat gains of 46.2% (6,106km(2)) at much higher elevations (4,500-6,900 m) and that elevational shifts of habitat use could occur in the future. Our results could provide information for conservation planning for this near threatened species in the region.

AB  - The Amazon rainforest covers more than 60% of Bolivia's lowlands, providing habitat for many endemic and threatened species. Bolivia has the highest rates of deforestation of the Amazon biome, which degrades and fragments species habitat. Anthropogenic habitat changes could be exacerbated by climate change, and therefore, developing relevant strategies for biodiversity protection under global change scenarios is a necessary step in conservation planning.
   In this research we used multi-species umbrella concept to evaluate the degree of habitat impacts due to climate and land cover change in Bolivia. We used species distribution modeling to map three focal species (Jaguar, Lowland Tapir and Lesser Anteater) and assessed current protected area network effectiveness under future climate and land cover change scenarios for 2050.

AB  - 1. To manage anthropogenic environmental change for the benefit of biodiversity, we must improve our understanding of the complex relationships between organisms and their environment. We have developed multiscale habitat suitability models (HSMs) for bats, a mobile group of mammals, for a geographically varied region of the UK. We ask whether the models have sufficient accuracy to contribute to informed decision-making in habitat management and in minimizing the impact of climate change and human infrastructural development. 2. We used acoustic surveys supplemented by catching to gather presence data for eight species from 30 sites across the south of the Lake District National Park in NW England. Species were identified by manual and automated extraction and analysis of echolocation calls. Fine-resolution (50 and 100m) habitat maps were generated at twelve spatial scales by calculating the variables across squares of increasing size, from 100 to 6000m, around each focal 50 or 100m square. Presence-only HSM software, MaxEnt, was used to determine the predictive power of each habitat variable at each scale. Multiscale models included data for each variable at the scale at which it had the strongest relationship with the presence of each species. 3. The best multiscale models were selected using fivefold cross-validation, with backwards, stepwise variable removal, whilst minimizing residual spatial autocorrelation and sampling bias. Further tests with independent field data indicated good model transferability across the entire National Park. 4. Foraging bats were generally most strongly associated with variables measured at small spatial scales and distance measures. However, each species responded differently across the range of scales, and strong associations were also found at the largest scale of analysis (6000m). 5. Synthesis and applications. The best models for determining habitat suitability had few variables, making them easy to interpret and use in practical conservation planning. The approach is applicable to any taxa for which reliable presence records are available, providing insight into the potential impacts of land-use and environmental change. Maps identify areas of conservation concern, such as hot spots for diversity, rare or vulnerable species and potential or threatened network corridors, making them useful for ecological impact assessment of proposed developments, and to conservation managers planning habitat creation or improvement.

AB  - The Western Central Atlantic (WCA) hosts a population of manta rays whose distribution and habitat preference is poorly understood. Addressing this lack of knowledge will be essential to aid the effective implementation of targeted conservation measures. Here, we use ensemble ecological niche modeling to predict the monthly distribution of manta rays in the WCA using multiple sources of species occurrence data, and consequently identify core areas, which represent suitable habitat in all months of the year. Models suggest a seasonal cycle of expansion and contraction of suitable habitat from coastal areas in spring-summer, to open ocean in autumn-winter. Core areas are concentrated along the coast of the USA, Mexico, and Venezuela. Only 24% of predicted suitable habitat is encompassed by the present regional network of MPAs, and is intersected by numerous, heavily trafficked shipping lanes. Manta rays are slow-growing animals that only produce a limited number of offspring; as such, this species is sensitive to even moderate increases in mortality rates. For this reason, the existing regional network of MPAs may offer them limited protection. As manta rays in the WCA are challenged by a complex landscape of threats and protective measures, future marine conservation planning in the region should explicitly address the conservation of manta rays, focusing on areas identified as key habitats for the species.

AB  - Patagonia is considered a region of high conservation priority due to its outstanding and representative habitats and high endemism. The purpose of this study is to assess the degree of representation of Patagonian lizards in the existing protected area network, and to identify conservation priority areas that may help expand the current system. We obtained locality data for all Patagonian species from different sources and used them, together with environmental variables, to model their potential distribution. We then used a reserve-selection algorithm to assess the performance of the existing protected area network in representing all lizard species, and to identify new priority areas. Our results indicate that the existing protected areas fail to protect 10 of the 60 species modeled. To protect at least 5% of the geographic distribution of all species, the existing reserve network would need an additional 3.7% of the study area, whereas to protect at least 10% of the distribution of species, an extra 9.9% would be needed. We found eleven main priority areas needed to protect at least 5% or 10% of the distribution of all species of lizards. In conclusion, the current reserve network is not very effective at protecting the lizards of Patagonia, particularly those species with range-restricted distributions. We hope that this contribution will help direct conservation efforts in the region, by maximising the protection of biodiversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The production of methane (CH4) by methanogens (Mgen) in mangrove sediments is known to contribute signifi-cantly to global warming. In such an estuarine environment, the abundance and population assemblage of Mgen are not well understood. Recently, there has been an increase of interest to understand about the properties of habitat distribu-tion and the main environmental factors that influence mangrove suitability. Here, we used a maximum entropy (Max-ent) species distribution model and a geographic information system (GIS) to determine the current habitat suitability distribution of Mgen in the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem in India. The Worldclim elevation (elev), precipitation (precp), solar radiation (srad), average temperature (t(avg)), maximum temperature (t(max)), minimum temperature (t(min)), water vapor pressure (vap) and the wind speed (wind) data and 36 spatially well-dispersed species occurrence points were used to predict the potential distribution of Mgen in the 14,317 km(2) study area. The results indicated that Mgen has a high potential distribution at the deforested areas adjacent to the riverine system in the Indian Sundarban mangrove ecosystem. Jackknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modeling. The prcp is the most important environmental variable which influences the distribution of Mgen in mangrove sediments. With an AUC (area under curve "Sensitivity vs. Specificity") of 0.826, the Maxent model was extremely accurate. The study shows that Maxent could be a useful tool for species rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation planning in the face of climate change.

AB  - The narrow ecological niche and the vulnerability of the griffon vulture in terms of its habitat and trophic requirements make it a good model species for assessing the state of agro-pastoral systems. The environmental niche of the species was studied in Bulgaria using a set of 109 cases of griffon vulture presence observations in breeding habitat and a maximum-entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach. MaxEnt can generate a model based on relatively low number of presence locations and is therefore a powerful tool for modeling species distribution. We employed a set of bioclimatic and environmental variables to determine species' optimal distribution. According to our results, griffon vulture's optimal habitats included areas with a slope over 40(0), which are advantageous for the breeding of the species as they often outline rocky habitats. The griffon vulture environmental niche model underlined the significance of the open landscapes that are essential for the species' foraging, as well as territories with higher mean temperature, low precipitation and high density of livestock. The suitability threshold of the model equal to 0.0738 and we estimated that 0.69% (769 km(2)) of Bulgaria is optimal for the breeding of the species and that 2.8% (3085 km(2)) is of high suitability for the griffon vulture. The results of the current survey aim to provide an important background for the management and conservation of the griffon vulture in Bulgaria. Such estimates are essential whenever investment plans, conservation programs or other management interventions are considered in the territories neighbouring or/and within the range of the griffon vulture.

AB  - Aim
   Models predicting the spatial distribution of animals are increasingly used in wildlife management and conservation planning. There is growing recognition that common methods of evaluating species distribution model (SDM) accuracy, as a global overall value of predictive ability, could be enhanced by spatially evaluating the model thereby identifying local areas of relative predictive strength and weakness. Current methods of spatial SDM model assessment focus on applying local measures of spatial autocorrelation to SDM residuals, which require quantitative model outputs. However, SDM outputs are often probabilistic (relative probability of species occurrence) or categorical (species present or absent). The goal of this paper was to develop a new method, using a conditional randomization technique, which can be applied to directly spatially evaluate probabilistic and categorical SDMs.
   Location
   Eastern slopes, Rocky Mountains, Alberta, Canada.
   Methods
   We used predictions from seasonal grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) resource selection functions (RSF) models to demonstrate our spatial evaluation technique. Local test statistics computed from bear telemetry locations were used to identify areas where bears were located more frequently than predicted. We evaluated the spatial pattern of model inaccuracies using a measure of spatial autocorrelation, local Moran's I.
   Results
   We found the model to have non-stationary patterns in accuracy, with clusters of inaccuracies located in central habitat areas. Model inaccuracies varied seasonally, with the summer model performing the best and the least error in areas with high RSF values. The landscape characteristics associated with model inaccuracies were examined, and possible factors contributing to RSF error were identified.
   Main conclusions
   The presented method complements existing spatial approaches to model error assessment as it can be used with probabilistic and categorical model output, which is typical for SDMs. We recommend that SDM accuracy assessments be done spatially and resulting accuracy maps included in model metadata.

AB  - The decline of farmland and grassland biodiversity is one the major conservation concerns nowadays. The European roller is a secondary cavity nester species typically inhabiting grasslands and farmlands. It has suffered large declines both in size and range of the population since the 1960s, but this negative trend has been reversed in several countries by applying direct conservation actions. As part of this study we aimed to evaluate the current habitat suitability of the historical breeding area of the species within Hungary, to promote the re-colonization and the enlargement of the breeding range in the Carpathian Basin, and to evaluate the potential significance of the Natura 2000 network in this process. We applied species distribution modelling (SDM) based on nest-box occupancy data to map potential areas for nest-box supplementation. Grasslands, broad-leaved forests and agricultural sites with significant areas of natural vegetation were found to be the most important predictors. The majority (71%) of the predicted area has no occupied nest-boxes. A significantly larger proportion of grid cells with archive data still preserve suitable land cover composition for rollers, than cells where former breeding was not confirmed, and only a small proportion of former breeding area has become completely unsuitable for the species. Our results indicate large overlaps between the Natura 2000 network and the predicted area, of which 28.3% overlaps with Special Protection Area (SPA) sites and 23.8% with Special Area of Conservation (SAC/SCI) sites. Our study highlights the importance of promoting the recolonization of the European roller in the Transdanubian region of Hungary and provides a useful tool for direct conservation planning for the species. Our results also suggest that a coordinated network of protected areas such as Natura 2000 can potentially serve as core areas in the recolonization processes.

AB  - Background and aims - Plants are often overlooked in conservation planning, yet they are the foundation of all terrestrial ecosystems. The East Africa region is used to investigate the effectiveness of protected areas for conserving plants. With a wide range of ecosystems and 771 protected areas covering nearly one quarter of the land area, East Africa is an ideal location to assess the effectiveness of protected areas through distribution modelling of the genus Acacia.
   Methods - Herbarium specimen data (2,047 records) were collated from East Africa for 65 taxa (species, subspecies, varieties) from the genus Acacia. Generalised Additive Models were used to determine climatic drivers, and thence to extrapolate climatic suitability across the region. For two Acacia taxa, we investigated the potential for climate-induced range-shifts using a downscaled regional climate model under two IPCC scenarios.
   Key results - Approximately two thirds of Acacia diversity hotspots had < 10% coverage by protected areas. Furthermore, the protected area network covered less of the predicted ranges of the Acacia taxa and contained fewer taxa per unit area than would be expected under randomised placement. Areas with suitable climate for high-elevation, moisture-dependent taxa such as A. abyssinica subsp. calophylla are predicted to contract their potential range by up to 80% towards mountain peaks, where protected areas are dominated by low-level protection forest reserves. Conversely, the area of suitable environment for a xerophytic low-elevation species (A. turnbulliana) is predicted to increase by up to 77%.
   Conclusions - East Africa's national parks may not be preserving an important component of ecosystem diversity, a situation exacerbated by climate change. Even within the genus Acacia, different species are predicted to respond differently to climate change. Priority areas for research and conservation are identified based on overlap between predicted high Acacia diversity and gaps in the collection record, with northern and eastern Kenya highlighted as particularly important. High elevation protected areas are also predicted to become increasingly important as climatic refugia in a warmer future.

AB  - Species distribution models have been applied across a wide range of spatial scales to generate information for conservation planning. Understanding how well models transfer through space and time is important to promote effective species-habitat conservation. Here, we assess model transferability in coastal tidal marshes of the southeastern United States using count data of a widespread marsh bird: the Clapper Rail (Rallus crepitans). We developed species-habitat models at a state level in both South Carolina and Georgia, and then assessed how well top models from each state predicted abundance in the other state. Internally (locally) validated models performed well with reasonable fit (SC: R-2 = 0.35, GA: R-2 = 0.14), and high significance (P = 0.0005); however, both models performed poorly when predicting abundance from the other state (R-2 = 0.03 and 0.003). To assess the consequences of this lack of transferability, we applied the South Carolina-and Georgia-derived parameter estimates to habitat features in South Carolina and identified the top 25% of tidal marsh habitat that each model predicted within the state. There was minimal overlap between model habitat quality predictions (< 5%). Our results address the predictive power and uncertainties that arise from using habitat associations and climate models to predict species distributions or abundance in locations without training data. We discuss potential reasons model transferability was not successful and address the need for better regional datasets and the importance of intraspecific variability in response to environmental gradients.

AB  - Preventing invasive species establishment is a global conservation priority, yet limited management resources oftentimes restrict sites to target for prevention or monitoring. Risk assessments based on habitat suitability can identify sites most vulnerable to invasion that should be prioritized for preventative actions. Since habitat suitability is the result of interactions between environmental and organismal attributes, analyses should incorporate individual variability in demographics expected in an invasive population. Individual-based models (IBMs) can predict habitat suitability by accounting for interactions between environmental conditions and individual-level variability. We developed an IBM to predict suitability of rivers in the northern United States to the invasive fishes silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) and explored the projected effects of climate change on habitat suitability. All rivers supported adult survival, although complete survival of all adult demographics and positive growth only occurred in approximately 45% (17 of 38) of rivers for silver carp and 26% (10 of 38) of rivers for bighead carp. Only the largest individuals at the time of introduction survived in rivers where adult mortality occurred. Most rivers were unsuitable for young-of-year (89% and 92% of rivers for silver carp and bighead carp respectively). Climate change simulations had relatively little effect on adult habitat suitability but resulted in up to four times the number of rivers being suitable for young-of-year by the late-21st century and greatly extended the viable spawning season by up to an additional 65 days for silver carp and 77 days for bighead carp. Synthesis and applications. Our approach of using individual-based models as a risk assessment tool informs proactive conservation planning by identifying sites for invasive species early detection monitoring, promoting the development of contingency response plans and allowing for proactive prevention efforts. Model predictions also provide specific management guidance regarding the size and life stages to target for monitoring efforts, which capture gears to use, and the most effective time to sample for early detection monitoring.

AB  - We sought to identify priority areas for the conservation of Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus) habitat in the northern portion of the eastern Andean cordillera in Ecuador. The study area included paramo and montane forest habitats within the Antisana and Cayambe-Coca ecological reserves, and unprotected areas north of these reserves with elevations ranging from 1,800 to 4,300 m. We collected data on bear occurrence along 53 transects during 2000-01 in the Oyacachi River basin, an area of indigenous communities within the Cayambe-Coca Ecological Reserve. We used those data and a set of 7 environmental variables to predict suitability of Andean bear habitat using Mahalanobis distance, a multivariate measure of dissimilarity. The Mahalanobis distance values were classified into 5 classes of habitat suitability and generalized to a resolution of 1,650-m x 1,650-m grid cells. Clusters of grid cells with high suitability values were delineated from the generalized model and defined as important habitat areas (IHAs) for conservation. The IHAs were ranked using a weighted index that included factors of elevation range, influence from disturbed areas, and current conservation status. We identified 12 IHAs, which were mainly associated with paramo and cloud forest habitats; 2 of these areas have high conservation priorities because they are outside existing reserves and close to areas of human pressure. The distribution of the IHAs highlighted the role of human land use as the main source of fragmentation of Andean bear habitat in this region, emphasizing the importance of preserving habitat connectivity to allow the seasonal movements among habitat types that we documented for this species. Furthermore, the existence of areas with high habitat suitability close to areas of intense human use indicates the importance of bear-human conflict management as a critical Andean bear conservation strategy. We suggest that a promising conservation opportunity for this species is linked to its occurrence in highland habitats, which play a key role in the maintenance of long-term water supplies.

AB  - Aim Distribution modelling is a useful approach to obtain knowledge about the spatial distribution of biodiversity, required for, for example, red-list assessments. While distribution modelling methods have been applied mostly to single species, modelling of communities and ecosystems (EDM; ecosystem-level distribution modelling) produces results that are more directly relevant for management and decision-making. Although the choice of predictors is a pivotal part of the modelling process, few studies have compared the suitability of different sets of predictors for EDM. In this study, we compare the performance of 50 single environmental variables with that of 11 composite landscape gradients (CLGs) for prediction of ecosystem types. The CLGs represent gradients in landscape element composition derived from multivariate analyses, for example "inner-outer coast" and "land use intensity." Location Norway. Methods We used data from field-based ecosystem-type mapping of nine ecosystem types, and environmental variables with a resolution of 100 x 100 m. We built nine models for each ecosystem type with variables from different predictor sets. Logistic regression with forward selection of variables was used for EDM. Models were evaluated with independently collected data. Results Most ecosystem types could be predicted reliably, although model performance differed among ecosystem types. We identified significant differences in predictive power and model parsimony across models built from different predictor sets. Climatic variables alone performed poorly, indicating that the current climate alone is not sufficient to predict the current distribution of ecosystems. Used alone, the CLGs resulted in parsimonious models with relatively high predictive power. Used together with other variables, they consistently improved the models. Main conclusions Our study highlights the importance of variable selection in EDM. We argue that the use of composite variables as proxies for complex environmental gradients has the potential to improve predictions from EDMs and thus to inform conservation planning as well as improve the precision and credibility of red lists and global change assessments.

AB  - The rapidly changing climate makes humans realize that there is a critical need to incorporate climate change adaptation into conservation planning. Whether the wintering habitats of Great Bustards (Otis tarda dybowskii), a globally endangered migratory subspecies whose population is approximately 1,500-2,200 individuals in China, would be still suitable in a changing climate environment, and where this could be found, is an important protection issue. In this study, we selected the most suitable species distribution model for bustards using climate envelopes from four machine learning models, combining two modelling approaches (TreeNet and Random Forest) with two sets of variables (correlated variables removed or not). We used common evaluation methods area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS) as well as independent test data to identify the most suitable model. As often found elsewhere, we found Random Forest with all environmental variables outperformed in all assessment methods. When we projected the best model to the latest IPCC-CMIP5 climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 in three Global Circulation Models (GCMs)), and averaged the project results of the three models, we found that suitable wintering habitats in the current bustard distribution would increase during the 21st century. The Northeast Plain and the south of North China were projected to become two major wintering areas for bustards. However, the models suggest that some currently suitable habitats will experience a reduction, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Basin. Although our results suggested that suitable habitats in China would widen with climate change, greater efforts should be undertaken to assess and mitigate unstudied human disturbance, such as pollution, hunting, agricultural development, infrastructure construction, habitat fragmentation, and oil and mine exploitation. All of these are negatively and intensely linked with global change.

AB  - Two of the principal responses of species to recent climate change have been changes in range and abundance, leading to a global reshuffling of the geographic distribution of species. Such range changes may cause species to disappear from areas they currently occupy and, given the right conditions, to colonize new sites. This could affect the ability of site networks (such as protected areas) to conserve species. Identifying sites that will continue to provide suitable conditions for focal species under future climate change scenarios and sites that are likely to become unsuitable is important for effective conservation planning. Here we explore the impacts of climate change on terrestrial bird species of conservation concern in the Neotropics, and the consequences for the network of Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) identified to conserve them. We modelled changes in species distributions for 3,798 species across the Caribbean and Central and South America, accounting for species-specific biological traits (natal dispersal ability and generation length), to assess species occurrences within IBAs under different future climate scenarios. Based on the projected changes in species compositions, we identified potential management strategies for the individual sites of the network. We projected that future climate change will have substantial impacts on the distribution of individual species across the IBA network, resulting in very heterogenous impacts on the individual IBAs. Mean turnover of species of conservation concern within IBAs was 17% by 2050. Nonetheless, under a medium-warming scenario, for 73% of the 939 species of conservation concern, more than half of the IBAs in which they currently occur were projected to remain climatically suitable, and for 90% at least a quarter of the sites remain suitable. These results suggest that the IBA network will remain robust under climate change. Nevertheless, 7% of the species of conservation concern are projected to have no suitable climate in the IBAs currently identified for them. Our results highlight the importance of a network-wide perspective when taking management decisions for individual sites under climate change.

AB  - The Phoenix Islands Protected Area, in the central Pacific waters of the Republic of Kiribati, is a model for large marine protected area (MPA) development and maintenance, but baseline records of the protected biodiversity in its largest environment, the deep sea (>200 m), have not yet been determined. In general, the equatorial central Pacific lacks biogeographic perspective on deep-sea benthic communities compared to more well-studied regions of the North and South Pacific Ocean. In 2017, explorations by the NOAA ship Okeanos Explorer and R/V Falkor were among the first to document the diversity and distribution of deep-water benthic megafauna on numerous seamounts, islands, shallow coral reef banks, and atolls in the region. Here, we present baseline deep-sea coral species distribution and community assembly patterns within the Scleractinia, Octocorallia, Antipatharia, and Zoantharia with respect to different seafloor features and abiotic environmental variables across bathyal depths (200-2500 m). Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) transects were performed on 17 features throughout the Phoenix Islands and Tokelau Ridge Seamounts resulting in the observation of 12,828 deep-water corals and 167 identifiable morphospecies. Anthozoan assemblages were largely octocoral-dominated consisting of 78% of all observations with seamounts having a greater number of observed morphospecies compared to other feature types. Overlying water masses were observed to have significant effects on community assembly across bathyal depths. Revised species inventories further suggest that the protected area it is an area of biogeographic overlap for Pacific deep-water corals, containing species observed across bathyal provinces in the North Pacific, Southwest Pacific, and Western Pacific. These results underscore significant geographic and environmental complexity associated with deep-sea coral communities that remain in under-characterized in the equatorial central Pacific, but also highlight the additional efforts that need to be brought forth to effectively establish baseline ecological metrics in data deficient bathyal provinces.

AB  - Large trees, as keystone structures, are functionally important in savanna ecosystems, and low recruitment and slow growth makes their conservation important. Understanding factors influencing their distribution is essential for mitigation of excessive mortality, for example from management fires or large herbivores. We recorded the locations of large trees in Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park (HiP) using GPS to record trees along 43 km of 10 m-wide transects. Maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) uses niche modeling to predict the distribution of a species from the probability of finding it within raster squares, based on environmental variables and recorded locations. MaxEnt is typically applied at a regional spatial scale, and here we assessed its usefulness when predicting the distribution of species at a small (local) scale. HiP has variable topography, heterogeneous soils, and a strong rainfall gradient, resulting in a wide variety of habitat types. We used locations of 179 Acacia nigrescens and 106 Sclerocarya birrea (large trees >= 5m), and raster environmental layers for: aspect, elevation, geology, annual rainfall, slope, soil and vegetation. A. nigrescens was largely restricted to the Imfolozi section, while S. birrea had a wider distribution across the reserve. Understanding the interaction of environmental variables dictating tree distribution may facilitate habitat restoration, and will assist planning decisions for persistence of large trees within reserves, including options to reduce fire frequency or herbivore impacts. Though the AUC (Area Under the Curve) values used to test model predictions were high for both species, the ground truthing test data showed that distribution for A. nigrescens was more accurate than that for S. birrea, highlighting the need for independent test data to assess model accuracy. We emphasize that MaxEnt can be used at finer spatial scales than those typically used for species occurrence, but models must be tested using spatially independent test data.

AB  - Useful woody species contribute enormously to maintain livelihoods in rural areas of West Africa and are strongly influenced by environmental conditions and human activities. To assess species-specific responses to these factors, we studied potential distributions and richness patterns of useful woody species in relation to several environmental factors in a communal and protected area in eastern Burkina Faso. We applied species distribution models, separately for adults and juveniles. While potential distributions of adults can be interpreted as the current state of the species, modeled distributions of juveniles give hints about the species' future development. Our results reveal that elevation and precipitation were the most influencing environmental factors on potential distributions of both juvenile and adult richness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that overall modeled adult richness (the same in communal and protected area) and juvenile richness (more successful in protected area) of woody species reacted differently to human disturbances. However, the fact that the responses to human activities differed widely between species and often even between adults and juveniles of the same species emphasizes the difficulty of giving simplified statements about the human impact on useful woody species. We discuss whether woody species might persist under increasing human pressure in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The contributions of species to ecosystem functions or services depend not only on their presence but also on their local abundance. Progress in predictive spatial modelling has largely focused on species occurrence rather than abundance. As such, limited guidance exists on the most reliable methods to explain and predict spatial variation in abundance. We analysed the performance of 68 abundance-based species distribution models fitted to 800 000 standardised abundance records for more than 800 terrestrial bird and reef fish species. We found a large amount of variation in the performance of abundance-based models. While many models performed poorly, a subset of models consistently reconstructed range-wide abundance patterns. The best predictions were obtained using random forests for frequently encountered and abundant species and for predictions within the same environmental domain as model calibration. Extending predictions of species abundance outside of the environmental conditions used in model training generated poor predictions. Thus, interpolation of abundances between observations can help improve understanding of spatial abundance patterns, but our results indicate extrapolated predictions of abundance under changing climate have a much greater uncertainty. Our synthesis provides a road map for modelling abundance patterns, a key property of species distributions that underpins theoretical and applied questions in ecology and conservation.

AB  - P>1. The abundance and distribution of a species are affected by processes which operate at multiple scales. Large-scale dynamics are increasingly recognized in conservation responses such as metapopulation management, transfrontier protected areas and softening the agricultural matrix. Landscape-scale monitoring is needed both to inform and judge their efficacy. In this Special Profile we address some of the challenges presented by monitoring at the landscape scale, how models of species distribution can be used to inform policy, and we discuss how monitoring at the global-scale could be approached.
   2. Collecting data over a large area is inherently costly, so methods which can provide robust information at low-cost are particularly valuable. We present two papers which test low-cost approaches against more data-hungry methods (indices of abundance vs. direct density estimates, and species distribution models built from presence-only vs. presence/absence data).
   3. Occupancy modelling is a useful approach for landscape-scale monitoring due to the relatively low-cost of collecting detection/non-detection data. We discuss challenges, such as non-random sampling locations and periodical unavailability for detection, in using detection/non-detection data for monitoring species distribution. Such data can also provide estimates of abundance and we show how existing models have been modified to allow the abundance of multiple species to be estimated simultaneously.
   4. Models of species distribution can be used to project likely future scenarios and thus inform conservation planning where distributions are likely to change because of climate change or changing disturbance patterns. We also discuss how an optimization framework can be used to make efficient management decisions for invasive species management in the light of imperfect information.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Monitoring is needed for many purposes including auditing past management decisions and informing future choices. Much monitoring data are collected at the site scale, although management authorities increasingly recognize landscape-scale dynamics. Recent global targets for conservation require monitoring which can report trends at the global-scale. Integrating data collected at a variety of scales to draw robust inference at the scale required is a challenge which deserves more attention from applied ecologists.

AB  - Knowledge of geographical distributions and habitat preferences are central to the conservation and management of threatened species. Ecological niche models can be used to map potentially suitable habitat, making them valuable tools in conservation biology. These models can assist in searching for new populations of species with poorly known distributions and can also be used to guide area selection for systematic biodiversity planning. These models have traditionally required ten or more occurrence records for calibration and this has limited the use of these tools in conservation biology, since many threatened species are known from fewer records. However, recently models have been successfully calibrated using few records. To illustrate this, we developed an ecological niche model to map the potential distribution of the endangered Juliana's golden mole (Neamblysomus julianae) in South Africa so that it could be used in searching for unrecorded populations and for area selection in systematic biodiversity plans. A model was calibrated in Maxent using only four occurrence records. Predictor variables included various bioclimatic, soil and vegetation types. The model identified limited suitable habitat within the map region. The first model facilitated the identification of two previously unrecorded populations. A second model was calibrated using the two additional occurrence records. This increased the proportion of correctly predicted presence records. Jackknife analyses indicated that the models were successful at predicting known presences as suitable. This paper demonstrates the use of ecological niche modelling to conservation of a cryptic endangered species with a poorly known distribution and discusses issues that are relevant for the application of this approach to other species.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Primates play an essential role in human life and its ecosystem. However, Indonesian primates have suffered many threats due to climate change and altered landscapes that lead to extinction. Therefore, primate conservation planning and strategies are important in maintaining their population. We quantified how extensively the protected areas overlapped primate hotspots and how it changes under mitigation and worst-case scenarios of climate change. Finally, we provide protected areas recommendations based on species richness and land-use changes under the worst-case scenario for Indonesian primate conservation planning and management options.
   Indonesia has a large number of primate diversity where a majority of the species are threatened. In addition, climate change is conservation issues that biodiversity may likely face in the future, particularly among primates. Thus, species-distribution modeling was useful for conservation planning. Herein, we present protected areas (PA) recommendations with high nature-conservation importance based on species-richness changes. We performed maximum entropy (Maxent) to retrieve species distribution of 51 primate species across Indonesia. We calculated species-richness change and range shifts to determine the priority of PA for primates under mitigation and worst-case scenarios by 2050. The results suggest that the models have an excellent performance based on seven different metrics. Current primate distributions occupied 65% of terrestrial landscape. However, our results indicate that 30 species of primates in Indonesia are likely to be extinct by 2050. Future primate species richness would be also expected to decline with the alpha diversity ranging from one to four species per 1 km(2). Based on our results, we recommend 54 and 27 PA in Indonesia to be considered as the habitat-restoration priority and refugia, respectively. We conclude that species-distribution modeling approach along with the categorical species richness is effectively applicable for assessing primate biodiversity patterns.

AB  - While the international pet trade and habitat destruction have been extensively discussed as major threats to the survival of the pancake tortoise (Malacochersus tornieri), the impact of climate change on the species remains unknown. In this study, we used species distribution modelling to predict the current and future distribution of pancake tortoises in Zambezian and Somalian biogeographical regions. We used 224 pancake tortoise occurrences obtained from Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia to estimate suitable and stable areas for the pancake tortoise in all countries present in these regions. We also used a protected area network to assess how many of the suitable and stable areas are protected for the conservation of this critically endangered species. Our model predicted the expansion of climatically suitable habitats for pancake tortoises from four countries and a total area of 90,668.75 km(2) to ten countries in the future and an area of 343,459.60-401,179.70 km(2). The model also showed that a more significant area of climatically suitable habitat for the species lies outside of the wildlife protected areas. Based on our results, we can predict that pancake tortoises may not suffer from habitat constriction. However, the species will continue to be at risk from the international pet trade, as most of the identified suitable habitats remain outside of protected areas. We suggest that efforts to conserve the pancake tortoise should not only focus on protected areas but also areas that are unprotected, as these comprise a large proportion of the suitable and stable habitats available following predicted future climate change.

AB  - The maned sloth Bradypus torquatus (Pilosa, Bradypodidae) is endemic to a small area in the Atlantic Forest of coastal Brazil. It has been listed as a threatened species because of its restricted geographic range, habitat loss and fragmentation, and declining populations. The major objectives of this study were to estimate its potential geographic distribution, the climatic conditions across its distributional range, and to identify suitable areas and potential species strongholds. We developed a model of habitat suitability for the maned sloth using two methods, Maxent and Mahalanobis Distance, based on 42 occurrence points. We evaluated environmental variable importance and the predictive ability of the generated distribution models. Our results suggest that the species distribution could be strongly influenced by environmental factors, mainly temperature seasonality. The modeled distribution of the maned sloth included known areas of occurrence in the Atlantic Forest (Sergipe, Bahia, Espirito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro), but did not match the observed distributional gaps in northern Rio de Janeiro, northern Espirito Santo or southern Bahia. Rather, the model showed that these areas are climatically suitable for the maned sloth, and thus suggests that factors other than climate might be responsible for the absence of species. Suitable areas for maned sloth were located mainly in the mountainous region of central Rio de Janeiro throughout Espirito Santo and to the coastal region of southern Bahia. We indicate 17 stronghold areas and recommended survey areas for the maned sloth. In addition, we highlight specific areas for conservation, including the current network protected areas. Our results can be applied for novel surveys and discovery of unknown populations, and help the selection of priority areas for management and conservation planning, especially of rare and relatively cryptic species directed associated with forested habitats.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are routinely applied to assess current as well as future species distributions, for example to assess impacts of future environmental change on biodiversity or to underpin conservation planning. It has been repeatedly emphasized that SDMs should be evaluated based not only on their goodness of fit to the data, but also on the realism of the modeled ecological responses. However, possibilities for the latter are hampered by limited knowledge on the true responses as well as a lack of quantitative evaluation methods. Here we compared modeled niche optima obtained from European-scale SDMs of 1476 terrestrial vascular plant species with empirical ecological indicator values indicating the preferences of plant species for key environmental conditions. For each plant species we first fitted an ensemble SDM including three modeling techniques (GLM, GAM and BRT) and extracted niche optima for climate, soil, land use and nitrogen deposition variables with a large explanatory power for the occurrence of that species. We then compared these SDM-derived niche optima with the ecological indicator values by means of bivariate correlation analysis. We found weak to moderate correlations in the expected direction between the SDM-derived niche optima and ecological indicator values. The strongest correlation occurred between the modeled optima for growing degree days and the ecological indicator values for temperature. Correlations were weaker for SDM-derived niche optima with a more distal relationship to ecological indicator values (notably precipitation and soil moisture). Further, correlations were consistently highest for BRT, followed by GLM and GAM. Our method gives insight into the ecological realism of modeled niche optima and projected core habitats and can be used to improve SDMs by making a more informed selection of environmental variables and modeling techniques.

AB  - The South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) Convention includes specific provisions to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs). The SPRFMO Commission has determined that the interim measures put in place to protect VMEs should be replaced by an improved system of fishable and closed areas. We used the conservation planning tool Zonation to examine the utility of a decision-support tool to develop spatial management options that balance the protection of VMEs with utilisation of high value areas for fishing. Input data included: habitat suitability maps for VME indicator taxa, and uncertainties associated with these model predictions, for an area of the high seas around New Zealand; naturalness condition, represented by two proxy variables using New Zealand trawl effort data; and value to the New Zealand fishery using trawl catch data for two gear types and three time-periods. Running scenario analyses with these data allowed for an understanding of the effect of varying the input data on the spatial prioritisation of areas for VME conservation. The analyses also allowed for the cost to fishing to be determined, in terms of the amount of the trawl catch footprint (normalised to the catch) lost if high priority areas for VME indicator taxa are protected. In most scenarios, the cost to fishing was low given the relatively high proportion of suitable habitat for VME indicator taxa that could be protected. The main outcome of the present study is a demonstration of the practical utility of using available data, including modelled data, and the Zonation decision-support tool to develop future options for the spatial management of the SPRFMO area. Suggestions are also made for improvements in input data for future analyses.

AB  - The consideration of information on social values in conjunction with biological data is critical for achieving both socially acceptable and scientifically defensible conservation planning outcomes. However, the influence of social values on spatial conservation priorities has received limited attention and is poorly understood. We present an approach that incorporates quantitative data on social values for conservation and social preferences for development into spatial conservation planning. We undertook a public participation GIS survey to spatially represent social values and development preferences and used species distribution models for 7 threatened fauna species to represent biological values. These spatially explicit data were simultaneously included in the conservation planning software Zonation to examine how conservation priorities changed with the inclusion of social data. Integrating spatially explicit information about social values and development preferences with biological data produced prioritizations that differed spatially from the solution based on only biological data. However, the integrated solutions protected a similar proportion of the species' distributions, indicating that Zonation effectively combined the biological and social data to produce socially feasible conservation solutions of approximately equivalent biological value. We were able to identify areas of the landscape where synergies and conflicts between different value sets are likely to occur. Identification of these synergies and conflicts will allow decision makers to target communication strategies to specific areas and ensure effective community engagement and positive conservation outcomes.

AB  - The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) was listed as threatened under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1990. We applied modern spatial conservation theory and models to evaluate several candidate critical habitat networks, and sought an efficient conservation solution that encompassed the highest value lands for spotted owl recovery rather than maximizing the total area of potential critical habitat. We created a map of relative habitat suitability, which served as input to the spatial conservation prioritization program Zonation. We used the spatially-explicit individual-based population model HexSim to estimate and compare simulated spotted owl population outcomes among a suite of candidate critical habitat networks that varied in size and spatial arrangement under alternative scenarios of future habitat suitability and barred owl (S. varia) effects. We evaluated simulated spotted owl population outcomes, including total population size, and extinction and quasi-extinction likelihoods for 108 combinations of candidate critical habitat networks by habitat change by barred owl scenarios, both range-wide and within 11 distinct portions of the owl's range. Barred owl encounter rates and the amount and suitability of habitat had substantial effects on simulated spotted owl populations. When barred owl encounter rates were high, changes in the amount and suitability of habitat had minimal impacts on population performance. Under lowered barred owl encounter rates, candidate critical habitat networks that included most existing high suitability habitat supported a high likelihood of long-term population persistence. Barred owls are currently the primary driving force behind poor population performance of NSOs; however, our models demonstrated that a sufficient area of high suitability habitat remains essential for recovery when effects of barred owls can be reduced. The modeling approach we employed is sufficiently flexible to incorporate new information about spotted owls as it becomes available and could likely be applied to conservation planning for other species.

AB  - Protected areas have been established historically in residual places where the potential for extractive uses is low, implying that places at risk are usually under-protected. Argentina is no exception, with few protected areas established in productive regions that are prone to conversion. Here, using reptiles as a study group and considering the most important human threats in north-western Argentina, we estimated priority conservation areas where we expect species to persist in the face of climate change and land conversion. Protected areas cover no more than 9% of the study region, but represent less than 15% of reptile distributions. There are great opportunities for improving the conservation status in the region by protecting only 8% more of north-western Argentina, with the level of species protection inside the protected area network increasing almost four-fold, reaching 43% of species distributions on average and 59% of the distributions of threatened reptiles. Fortunately, the highest diversity of reptiles in the region does not match the places targeted for agriculture expansion. Our findings suggest that future prioritization schemes should embrace other groups that are especially diverse in the Chaco ecoregion, which overlaps with our study area.

AB  - Understanding the processes related to wildlife recoveries is not only essential in solving human - wildlife conflicts, but also for identifying priority conservation areas and in turn, for effective conservation planning. We used data from a citizen science program to study spatial aspects of the demographic and genetic recovery of brown bears in Greece and to identify new areas for their conservation. We visually compared our data with an estimation of the past distribution of brown bears in Greece and used a point process approach to model habitat suitability. We then compared our results with the current distribution of brown bear records and with that of protected areas. Our results indicate that in the last 15 years bears may have increased their range by as much as 100%, by occupying mainly anthropogenic landscapes and areas with suitable habitat that are currently not legally protected, thus creating a new conservation reality for the species in Greece. This development dictates the re-evaluation of the national management and conservation priorities for brown bears in Greece by focusing in establishing new protected areas that will safeguard their recovery. Our conservation approach is a swift and cheap way of identifying priority conservation areas, while gaining important insights on spatial aspects of population recovery. It will help prioritize conservation actions for brown bears in Greece and may serve as a model conservation approach to countries facing similar financial and logistic constraints in the monitoring of local biodiversity or facing challenges in managing rapid population recoveries. Our conservation approach appeared to be particularly suited to identifying priority areas for conservation in areas with recovering wildlife populations and may therefore be used as an 'early-warning' conservation system.

AB  - Understanding the pattern of species distribution and the underlying mechanism is essential for conservation planning. Several climatic variables determine the species diversity, and the dependency of species on climate motivates ecologists and bio-geographers to explain the richness patterns along with elevation and environmental correlates. We used interpolated elevational distribution data to examine the relative importance of climatic variables in determining the species richness pattern of 26 species of gymnosperms in the longest elevation gradients in the world. Thirteen environmental variables were divided into three predictors set representing each hypothesis model (energy-water, physical-tolerance, and climatic-seasonality); to explain the species richness pattern of gymnosperms along the elevational gradient. We performed generalized linear models and variation partitioning to evaluate the relevant role of environmental variables on species richness patterns. Our findings showed that the gymnosperms' richness formed a hump-shaped distribution pattern. The individual effect of energy-water predictor set was identified as the primary determinant of species richness. While, the joint effects of energy-water and physical-tolerance predictors have explained highest variations in gymnosperm distribution. The multiple environmental indicators are essential drivers of species distribution and have direct implications in understanding the effect of climate change on the species richness pattern.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning methods to design marine protected area (MPA) networks can provide more meaningful results by addressing the spatiotemporal variability of biota, and by using these data to inform target assignment. This study used Marxan software to design candidate MPA networks to meet conservation targets for 67 coastal fish species on the east coast of South Africa. Species were selected for conservation importance, and included both resident and seasonal migrants. The distribution range of three phases of a species life cycle was generated using either cartographic habitat range models or maximum entropy models, and each used as a separate conservation feature. Two sets of conservation features were developed from this: A static set of 77 distribution models for features which ignored seasonal dynamics, and a seasonal set of 147 distribution models which included seasonal dynamics. Conservation targets depended on a species' extinction vulnerability and its seasonal abundance. Three scenarios were used to test the effects of incorporating seasonal spatial and abundance dynamics into MPA design: Scenario 1 tested the effect of using static or seasonal distribution data; Scenario 2 tested the additional effect of adjusting conservation targets based on seasonal variations in abundance; and Scenario 3 tested the additional effect of incorporating existing MPAs into the MPA network. In all three scenarios, the spatial configuration of MPA networks differed between the two datasets (Kappa 0.37, 0.25, 0.3), and static-designs did not fully meet targets for a number of species or critical life cycle phases of some species, however, larger and more expensive areas were required to design MPAs that could meet all conservation targets for seasonal features. Seasonal abundance adjusted targets was useful to elevate the prioritisation of seasonally abundant migratory species. Including existing MPAs did not change the differences observed between static and seasonal outcomes. We believe this will be true for any marine system that demonstrates seasonal spatial life-history differentiation and abundance dynamics, and advocate its use while giving due consideration to the increased cost associated with spatiotemporal planning.

AB  - Species reintroductions are high-investment ecological interventions that require careful planning. Predictive models are useful tools for managing reintroductions.
   We provide an overview of habitat suitability, dispersal, population dynamics and interspecies models, considering potential uses and limitations of established methods for reintroductions. Furthermore, we include a guide for integrating one or more model types to predict reintroduction outcomes and answer specific management questions.
   Model utility will be maximized by considering the goals of the reintroduction, attributes of the reintroduced species, threats to persistence and the quality of available data.
   Synthesis and applications. Our synthesis of state-of-the-art ecological models outlines how key ecological models can be applied to reintroductions. Our review can aid practitioners undertaking reintroductions to assess and quantify their data and modelling needs in line with their management goals.

AB  - Human activities are an increasing threat to Neotropical freshwater ecosystems, with the potential extinction of thousands of aquatic species. Despite this, knowledge about the effectiveness of protected area networks in protecting aquatic insects in this biogeographical region is very limited. Cuba supports the highest diversity of aquatic insects in the Antilles, with a large number of endemics. A gap analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the National System of Protected Areas of Cuba (NSPAC) in the conservation of Cuban diving beetles (family Dytiscidae). This involved considering the areas with the highest potential species richness, estimated by using species distribution models with three different approaches (MaxEnt, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine), and the known localities of endemic species. The highest potential species richness of Dytiscidae in Cuba is predicted to occur in the low-medium altitude of the eastern mountain areas. Although most of these areas occur inside the NSPAC, several areas of potential high species richness are currently unprotected. It is recommended that sampling programmes are carried out in areas with high predicted species richness to validate the species distribution models. The distribution of three Cuban endemic species (Copelatus barbouri, Desmopachria glabella and Celina cubensis) lies completely outside of the NSPAC. Despite their conservation interest as threatened endemic species, they are currently unprotected. To improve the conservation of freshwater biodiversity in Cuba it is recommended that (i) the NSPAC network is extended to protect areas supporting endemic species and those with the highest potential species richness that are currently unprotected, and (ii) a whole-catchment management approach, specifically to maintain natural flows, should be adopted, especially in the mountainous areas of eastern Cuba.

AB  - Limited data on the spatial, environmental, and human dimensions of small-scale fisheries hinder conservation planning, so the incorporation of fishers' local ecological knowledge may be a valuable way to fill data gaps while legitimizing management decisions. In Peru, vulnerable and poorly assessed juvenile smooth hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna zygaena) are the most commonly caught shark species in a small-scale drift gillnet fishery. We conducted semistructured interviews with 87 hammerhead fishers in three major Peruvian ports to elucidate the spatiotemporal niche of the hammerhead fishery and environmental drivers of juvenile hammerhead catch. We also built a biophysical model of hammerhead distribution that correlated remotely sensed environmental variables with a spatially explicit fishery observer dataset. Overall, we found a consensus between fishers' knowledge and species distribution modeling. Sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a emerged as important environmental drivers of juvenile hammerhead catch, with both fishers' knowledge and the biophysical model identifying similar habitat preferences (similar to 20-23 degrees C and log chl-a >-1.6 mg/m(3)). Participatory mapping of fishing grounds also corresponded to the spatiotemporal patterns of predicted hammerhead distribution. This study points to the utility of combining fishers' knowledge and biophysical modeling for spatial, temporal, and/or dynamic management of these sharks in Peru and in other data-poor fisheries globally.

AB  - Toothed whales (Odontocetes) are highly mobile animals that play key trophic roles in ecosystems and whose habitats often overlap with areas of human activity. To mitigate detrimental effects of this overlap, it is critical to understand their habitat use patterns. The Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary in the western Gulf of Maine is a hypothesized foraging area for toothed whale species and an area of high human use, but odontocete habitat use there is poorly understood. While a large whale watch community provides a robust, long-term, opportunistic sighting data set, those data are not standardized. To overcome this limitation, we used point process models to analyze 10 yr of opportunistic sighting data. We identified spatial distribution patterns and environmental predictors for the 2 most common odontocete species in the sanctuary, Atlantic white-sided dolphins Lagenorhynchus acutus and harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena. Habitat use differed among months, and depth, slope, substrate, and salinity were the most important and consistent predictors for both species. Models identified both persistent and shifting hotspots within the sanctuary. While presence was strongly associated with several covariates, environmental predictors did not fully explain shifting hotspots. This work highlights the importance of long-term opportunistic data collection and provides new knowledge on habitat use to inform assessment and management of potential human impacts on odontocetes in a federal marine protected area.

AB  - Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) play a central role in studying species response to environmental change. Effective management and conservation plans for freshwater ecosystems require SDMs that accommodate hierarchical catchment ordering and provide clarity on the performance of such models across multiple scales. The scale-dependence components considered here are: (a) environment spatial structure, represented by hierarchical catchment ordering following the Strahler system; (b) analysis grain, that included 1st to 5th order catchments; and (c) response grain, the grain at which species respond most, represented by local and upstream catchment area effects. We used fish occurrence data from the Danube River Basin and various factors representing climate, land cover and anthropogenic pressures. Our results indicate that the choice of response grain local vs. upstream area effects and the choice of analysis grain, only marginally influence the performance of SDMs. Upstream effects tend to better predict fish distributions than corresponding local effects for anthropogenic and land cover factors, in particular for species sensitive to pollution. Key predictors and their relative importance are scale and species dependent. Consequently, choosing proper species dependent spatial scales and factors is imperative for effective river rehabilitation measures.

AB  - Context With accelerating global declines in biodiversity, establishment and expansion of conservation areas (CAs) have increasingly been advocated in recent decades. Gap analysis has been useful to evaluate the sufficiency and performance of CAs. Objectives Researchers often identify putative gaps in the protection of biodiversity in CA networks, drawing on evidence from species occurrence patterns (i.e., representation), yet the effect on the gap analyses of the spatial configuration of CAs is poorly understood. Methods Focusing on two large, charismatic carnivores of western Asia, Persian leopard and Asiatic cheetah, we used species distribution models (SDMs) to map potentially suitable habitats throughout the region. We calculated species representation for four categories of CAs within the conservation network in Iran and used a new application of graph theory to include their spatial configuration into our gap analysis. We then regressed species representation against spatial configuration to provide more insights into the performance of different categories of CAs. Results Results showed that the existing CA network conserves only 32% of the suitable habitats for the two species. Leveraging spatial configuration of the conservation areas into the gap analysis, however, revealed that the recently-established less strictly CAs disproportionately provide a higher contribution to the collective effectiveness of the entire conservation network. Conclusions We introduce network bias as a new concept in reserve design and argue that incorporating spatial configuration into CA gap analysis improves the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of reserve network designs, and is an important decision support tool for integrated conservation planning.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed to support conservation decision making. However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.

AB  - Southeast Asia is one of the richest reservoirs of biodiversity on earth and home to one of the highest concentrations of endemic species. Many protected areas (PA) have been established across the region, but to date no systematic evaluation of their efficacy has been published because no comprehensive dataset was available which could be fed into an analysis of conservation gaps. We collected the geographic range for 1086 mammal species of Southeast Asia and we built species-specific habitat suitability models for 901 of them. We performed two gap analyses (one based on a combination of distribution models and distribution ranges and one based on distribution ranges only) for each mammalian species, to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing network of PA and to identify priority regions and priority species for expanding and consolidating the network. our results indicate that 7.5-8.2% of species are not covered by any PA, and 51.6-59.1% are covered only partially. These species are distributed throughout the entire study area and their conservation requires the creation of new PA that can help fill this existing conservation gap. This would be particularly important for species which are endemic of small islands, where species survival is often threatened by the presence of introduced species and habitat conversion. Yet PAS cannot be considered as the ending point of a conservation strategy, because overall, 34% of the species we analyzed (many of which already covered by existing PAS) were at risk of extinction when considering the IUCN red-list criteria. PAS should therefore be considered in a broader framework of all local ecological and socio-economic trends, including the growing human population, growing economy and infrastructure development.

AB  - Food availability, predation risk, climatic adversity, and human disturbance are usually considered relevant factors influencing the distribution of wild ungulates. Poaching and habitat degradation are threats to the guanaco, a native herbivore of South America characterized by ecological and behavioral adaptations to arid environments. Guanaco presence was seasonally surveyed in mountain environments of Andean Precordillera, corresponding to a protected area and its surroundings. Field surveys and satellite images processing estimated environmental variables ascribed to four predictions: resources availability, habitat complexity, weather conditions, and human activities. Generalized Linear Models estimated the probability of guanaco presence based on each prediction, whose variables with important effect were included in combined models. The main natural influence on the presence of guanaco was plant cover. Conservation activities improved this natural influence, whereas disturbing activities restricted it. The trade-off between high resources availability and low predation risk, as well as the effect of extreme weather conditions were not evident, at least in the study's spatial scale. The model validation with new seasonal surveys confirmed a consistency over time of those environmental variables that explain the probability of guanaco presence in the Southern Andean Precordillera.

AB  - The concept of Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations (PSESP) has been employed to guide conservation of threatened plant species in China. Climate change has a high potential to threaten PSESP. As a result, it is necessary to integrate climate change effects on PSESP into conservation planning in China. Here, ecological niche modelling is used to project current and future habitat distributions of six PSESP in China under climate change scenarios and conservation planning software is applied to identify priority conservation areas (PCAs) for these PSESP based on habitat distributions. These results were used to provide proposals for in-situ and ex-situ conservation measures directed at PSESP. It was found that annual precipitation was important for habitat distributions for all six PSESP (with the percentage contribution to habitat distributions ranging from 18.1 % to 74.9 %) and non-climatic variables including soil and altitude have a large effect on habitat suitability of PSESP. Large quantities of PCAs occurred within some provincial regions for these six PSESP (e.g. Sichuan and Jilin for the PSESP Cathaya argyrophylla, Taxus cuspidata, Annamocarya sinensis and Madhuca pasquieri), indicating that these are likely to be appropriate areas for in-situ and ex-situ conservation measures directed at these PSESP. Those nature reserves with large quantities of PCAs were identified as promising sites for in-situ conservation measures of PSESP; such reserves include Yangzie and Dongdongtinghu for C. argyrophylla, Songhuajiangsanhu and Chang-baishan for T. cuspidata and Shiwandashanshuiyuanlian for Tsoongiodendron odorum. These results suggest that existing seed banks and botanical gardens occurring within identified PCAs should allocate more resources and space to ex-situ conservation of PSESP. In addition, there should be additional botanical gardens established for ex-situ conservation of PSESP in PCAs outside existing nature reserves. To address the risk of negative effects of climate change on PSESP, it is necessary to integrate in-situ and ex-situ conservation as well as climate change monitoring in PSESP conservation planning.

AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that distribution of Neotropical seasonally dry forests (NSDFs) and the survival of the species and communities that inhabit them have been negatively affected by land-use modifications and global climate change (GCC). Protected Areas (PAs) in the region are inefficient and insufficient, and these human-driven threats are expected to further diminish their effectiveness. Research on the long-term effectiveness of these areas for NSDFs protection is therefore a high priority. Here, using birds as a study group, we combined both species distribution modelling and systematic conservation planning techniques to delineate priority areas where species are predicted to persist into the 2050's in the face of GCC and land conversion across the NSDFs distribution. These analyses showed an imperative need to improve the performance of PAs, which covered only -11% of the NSDFs area and included on average just 13% of species' remaining distributions in the 2050's. The most important opportunity for improving NSDFs conservation status is provided by protecting -6% more surface area, which could increase the level of protection in the near future: 24.8-28.2% of species distributions on average and 36.9-39.5% for those threatened and Data Deficit species. Besides, 21.6% for these proposed areas coincide with areas currently defined as priority for NSDFs, and 22.8% coincides with priority areas for conservation and research of terrestrial vertebrates. The priority areas identified are mainly distributed in Mexico (70.8%). Our findings pinpoint major opportunities for efficient conservation planning in the region, if there is political will to do so.

AB  - The Yangtze River Basin (YRB), a key biodiversity area and a major economic zone in China, the biodiversity of the area is confronted with severe challenges. In this paper, we analyzed species distribution patterns based on a dataset with 18,538 seed plant species to identify hotspots and evaluate conservation effectiveness and gaps of the YRB. We calculated distribution patterns of species richness with the top 5% richness algorithm and complementarity algorithm, and reconstructed a phylogenetic tree and elucidated spatial phylogenetics. There were 214 hotspot grid cells covering only 6.8% of the study region, but containing 88% seed plant species. Then, we conducted correlation analysis on distribution patterns of different algorithms and species categories, which showed moderate or weak correlations between the top 5% richness algorithm and complementary algorithm. Conservation effectiveness analysis indicated there were 116 hotspot grid cells (accounting for 73.6% of the total species) protected by current conservation networks and there are many conservation gaps remaining. Finally, we used the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to predict suitable habitat areas of threatened species under current and future climate scenarios. Prediction analysis results indicated future expansion of suitable habitat to the southeast, and reduction in the central and western portions of the study area. When we considered anthropogenic areas, the suitable habitat was severely decreased, indicating the importance of optimizing the layout of conservation networks and comprehensive biodiversity conservation planning in the YRB.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess land use change and the related biodiversity variations in the forest landscape of the upper reaches of Minjiang River, China. We examined temporal changes of land use at different periods. Remotely sensed images taken in 1974, 1986 and 2000 were rectified and classified based on the physiognomic characteristics of the vegetation. We applied landscape pattern metrics based on landscape composition, the shape and size of patches and patch isolation. We also calculated the suitable area for mammals in the upper reaches of Minjiang River and biodiversity of medium and large-sized mammals with Genera-Family index (G-F index). As a result of timber harvesting and increase of population, the forest area decreased and other land-use types increased. The suitable area for mammals decreased by 81,339 ha from 1974 to 2000, about 21.55% of the habitat in 1974. The number of medium and large-sized mammal species had decreased from 31 to 26, with G-F index decreased by 0.11, about 20% that of 1974. It can be concluded that landscape change and suitable habitat play an important role in protecting mammal diversity. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - National reserve networks are one of the most important means of species conservation, but their efficiency may be diminished due to the projected climatic changes. Using bioclimatic envelope models and spatial data on habitats and conservation areas, we studied how efficient the reserve network will be in preserving 100 forest, mire, marshland, and alpine bird species of conservation concern in Finland in 2051-2080 under three different climate scenarios. The occurrences of the studied bird species were related to the amount of habitat preferred by each species in the different boreal zones. We employed a novel integrated habitat suitability index that takes into account both the species' probability of occurrence from the bioclimatic models and the availability of suitable habitat. Using this suitability index, the distribution of the topmost 5% suitability squares ("hotspots'') in the four bird species groups in the period 1971-2000 and under the three scenarios were compared with the location of reserves with the highest amounts of the four habitats to study the efficiency of the network. In species of mires, marshlands, and Arctic mountains, a high proportion of protected habitat was included in the 5% hotspots in the scenarios in 2051-2080, showing that protected areas cover a high proportion of occurrences of bird species. In contrast, in forests in the southern and middle boreal zones, only a small proportion of the protected habitat was included in the 5% hotspots, indicating that the efficiency of the protected area network will be insufficient for forest birds in the future. In the northern boreal zone, the efficiency of the reserve network in forests was highly dependent on the strength of climate change varying between the scenarios. Overall, there is no single solution to preserving biodiversity in a changing climate, but several future pathways should be considered.

AB  - Threatened and endangered species are more vulnerable to climate change due to small population and specific geographical distribution. Therefore, identifying and incorporating the biological processes underlying a species' adaptation to its environment are important for determining whether they can persist insitu. Correlative models are widely used to predict species' distribution changes, but generally fail to capture the buffering capacity of organisms. Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) live in topographically complex mountains and are known to avoid heat stress. Although many studies have found that climate change will lead to severe habitat loss and threaten previous conservation efforts, the mechanisms underlying panda's responses to climate change have not been explored. Here, we present a case study in Daxiangling Mountains, one of the six Mountain Systems that giant panda distributes. We used a mechanistic model, Niche Mapper, to explore what are likely panda habitat response to climate change taking physiological, behavioral and ecological responses into account, through which we map panda's climatic suitable activity area (SAA) for the first time. We combined SAA with bamboo forest distribution to yield highly suitable habitat (HSH) and seasonal suitable habitat (SSH), and their temporal dynamics under climate change were predicted. In general, SAA in the hottest month (July) would reduce 11.7%-52.2% by 2070, which is more moderate than predicted bamboo habitat loss (45.6%-86.9%). Limited by the availability of bamboo and forest, panda's suitable habitat loss increases, and only 15.5%-68.8% of current HSH would remain in 2070. Our method of mechanistic modeling can help to distinguish whether habitat loss is caused by thermal environmental deterioration or food loss under climate change. Furthermore, mechanistic models can produce robust predictions by incorporating ecophysiological feedbacks and minimizing extrapolation into novel environments. We suggest that a mechanistic approach should be incorporated into distribution predictions and conservation planning.

AB  - Quality conservation planning requires quality input data. However, the broad scale sampling strategies typically employed to obtain primary species distribution data are prone to geographic bias in the form of errors of omission. This study provides a quantitative measure of sampling bias to inform accuracy assessment of conservation plans based on the South African Frog Atlas Project. Significantly higher sampling intensity near to cities and roads is likely to result in overstated conservation priority and heightened conservation conflicts in urban areas. Particularly well sampled protected areas will also erroneously appear to contribute highly to amphibian biodiversity targets. Conversely, targeted sampling in the arid northwest and along mountain ranges is needed to ensure that these under-sampled regions are not excluded from conservation plans. The South African Frog Atlas Project offers a reasonably accurate picture of the broad scale west-to-east increase in amphibian richness and abundance, but geographic bias may limit its applicability for fine scale conservation planning. The Global Amphibian Assessment species distribution data offered a less biased alternative, but only at the cost of inflated commission error.

AB  - Banded linsang Prionodon linsang is restricted to Sundaic South-east Asia and inhabits a wide altitudinal range. It occurs widely in Borneo, including all political units except perhaps South Kalimantan, with many recent records. It has never been studied in the field. Usually, it is recorded only once or a few times on any given cameratrap or spotlighting survey within its range. Only rarely is it among the most commonly found small carnivores. It probably occurs at lower densities than do many small carnivores and conventional survey methods are probably suboptimal at finding it. Its popular reputation for rarity and thus conservation priority has no compelling foundation and seems unlikely to be valid. It is not known or likely to be targeted by human hunters and it has been suggested to be associated with edge and degraded areas. Seventy spatially precise records were used to model its distribution. Habitat reclassification scores for use in the model showed wide variation across respondents: few people have seen banded linsang many times. It is tied to forest, including highly degraded and, perhaps, fragmented areas. The predicted suitable habitat map suggests large overlap between the protected area system and the species's range, and a large predicted area outside protected areas. Identification of priority areas for the species is thus impracticable. If population densities are typically low, banded linsang might need relatively large landscapes for long-term viability. Without understanding this, and the extent, if any, to which it uses plantation landscapes, it is difficult to speculate how well protected areas and other mechanisms to retain native forest on Borneo will secure representative populations of this species. Another uncertainty important to resolve is the difficulty of interpreting the species's status through camera-trapping.

AB  - Emerging methods in habitat and wildlife population modeling promise new horizons in conservation but only if these methods provide robust population-habitat linkages. We used Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data to verify and validate newly developed habitat suitability index (HSI) models for 40 priority landbird species in the Central Hardwoods and West Gulf Coastal Plain/Ouachitas Bird Conservation Regions. We considered a species' HSI model verified if there was a significant rank correlation between mean predicted HSI score and mean observed BBS abundance across the 88 ecological subsections within these Bird Conservation Regions. When we included all subsections, correlations verified 37 models. Models for 3 species were unverified. Rank correlations for an additional 5 species were not significant when analyses included only subsections with BBS abundance > 0. To validate models, we developed generalized linear models with mean observed BBS abundance as the response variable and mean HSI score and Bird Conservation Region as predictor variables. We considered verified models validated if the overall model was an improvement over an intercept-only null model and the coefficient on the HSI variable in the model was > 0. Validation provided a more rigorous assessment of model performance than verification, and models for 12 species that we verified failed validation. Species whose models failed validation were either poorly sampled by BBS protocols or associated with woodland and shrubland habitats embedded within predominantly open landscapes. We validated models for 25 species. Habitat specialists and species reaching their highest densities in predominantly forested landscapes were more likely to have validated models. In their current form, validated models are useful for conservation planning of priority landbirds and offer both insight into limiting factors at ecoregional scales and a framework for monitoring priority landbird populations from readily available national data sets.

AB  - Although many fish habitat suitability models (HSMs) have been developed and used in wildlife management and conservation planning, comparatively few have been independently validated. Given the importance of such models in habitat management and conservation policy, the extent to which they accurately predict population parameters (e.g., abundance or recruitment) is a critical issue. Here we apply an HSM recently developed for lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens in northern rivers to three reaches of the Ottawa River. using measurements of the model's key variables (substrate type, water depth, and velocity) to generate spatially explicit predictions of habitat suitability. We then test the predictive power of the model by comparing lake Sturgeon catch per unit effort (CUE) when using short-set gill nets in areas predicted to have good (habitat suitability index values >0.6) and poor (values < 0.3) adult and juvenile foraging habitats. Consistent with model predictions, significantly more lake Sturgeon were caught at sites within river reaches predicted to be of high quality than at those predicted to be of low quality. Moreover, the average CUE at the reach scale correlated positively with the average predicted habitat foraging quality. On the other hand, the predictive power was generally low, such that most of the variation in CUE was unexplained by the fitted models. These results suggest that although the lake sturgeon HSM developed [or northern rivers has some predictive power in other contexts, the uncertainty of its predictions is still rather high. We suggest that (1) considerably more effort be devoted to the independent validation of both existing HSMs and those still in development and (2) in the absence of independent validation and bona fide estimates of their predictive power, such models be used circumspectly in conservation management and planning.

AB  - Wild goat (Capra aegagrus) is one of the highly valued but threatened ungulates of Iran. Seasonal habitat use of wild goat was studied from October 2006 to September 2008 in Haftad Gholleh Protected Area, central Iran. We developed averaged logistic regression models based on Akaike Information Criterion weights for each season. The obtained habitat suitability models showed high sensitivity (greater than 88%) for all evaluation datasets. Wild goat habitat use was positively related with steep slopes, areas near rocky substrates and water sources, west-facing slopes and areas far from roads in all seasons. Core zones of protected area covered nearly 70% of suitable habitats for wild goats, predicted by logistic regression models. Northern core zone covered more than 61% of predicted suitable habitats, which should receive more attention in management actions. The southern core zone boundaries should be considered to increase the encompassed suitable habitats. There was a substantial overlap between seasonal suitable habitats with the highest overlap observed between spring and summer and summer and fall.

AB  - Improved quantification of species' ranges is needed to provide more accurate estimates of extinction risks for conservation planning. Highland tropical biodiversity may be particularly vulnerable to the anthropogenic changes in land cover and climate and is subject to overestimation of geographic range size in IUCN assessments. Here, we demonstrate a novel and practical approach for quantifying inferred range reductions based upon temporal matching of recent species occurrence localities and vegetation data. As an illustration pertinent to montane forest-associated species with limited distribution data, we use Gymnuromys roberti, an endemic Malagasy rodent with a Least Concern conservation status. We estimated climatic suitability and climate change vulnerability using species distribution modeling (SDM). We then determined deforestation tolerance thresholds for the species by temporally matching recent occurrence localities with percent forest cover values from MODIS forest cover layers. Finally, we applied these thresholds in postprocessing SDM-based range estimates. These estimates demonstrate that the lack of sufficient forest cover substantially reduces the species' current estimated range compared with the IUCN range map. Projections to 2050 suggest that there will be a loss of climatic suitability over three quarters of the currently suitable habitat along with increased fragmentation, highlighting the need to include climate change vulnerability assessments as an integral part of conservation planning. Broader application of SDMs could assist practitioners at various stages of conservation planning, stressing the need for improved accessibility of methodologically complex SDM approaches.

AB  - Aim Presence-only data represent a significant source of information for quantifying biodiversity distributions and provide opportunities for use in conservation planning. The large databases of presence-only records that are available and the lower cost of acquisition could help overcome the traditional problem of lack of data for conservation. However, there are risks associated with the use of presence-only data inherent with the lack of true absences that might cause omission errors (species are erroneously thought to be absent) and loss of efficiency (more areas are thought to be necessary than needed). These errors could constrain the economic viability of conservation plans and thus the success of conservation practice. We therefore evaluated the opportunities and risks of using presence-only data for conservation planning.
   Location Northern Australia.
   Methods The effects of using two different types (presence-only and presence-absence) and different quantities of data were simulated by building predictive models on different subsets of data with increasing numbers of presence-absence or presence-only records or a combination of both, for 80 freshwater fish species. We then compared the performance of conservation planning outcomes with the best information attainable (a true model built on the complete set of presence-absence data). We measured omission and commission errors in conservation planning outcomes, and the efficiency of and return on the investment in data acquisition.
   Results Including presence-only data helped reduce commission and omission errors in conservation planning outcomes, but only when used in combination with at least some presence-absence data. The use of just a large quantity of presence-only data resulted in significant reductions in the efficiency of conservation planning outcomes, as more areas than actually needed were required to achieve conservation targets. This reduction in efficiency was mainly related to inflated omission errors.
   Main conclusions We recommend using presence-only data cautiously if this is the only source of data available; whenever possible, presence-only data should be complemented with presence-absence data.

AB  - Tanzania's Ruaha landscape is an international priority area for large carnivores, supporting over 10% of the world's lions and important populations of leopards and spotted hyaenas. However, lack of ecological data on large carnivore distribution and habitat use hinders the development of effective carnivore conservation strategies in this critical landscape. Therefore, the study aimed to (i) identify the most significant ecogeographical variables influencing the potential distribution of lions, leopards and spotted hyaenas across the Ruaha landscape; (ii) identify zones with highest suitability for harbouring those species; and (iii) use species distribution modelling algorithms (SDMs) to define important areas for conservation of large carnivores. Habitat suitability was calculated based on environmental features from georeferenced presence-only carnivore location data. Potential distribution of large carnivores appeared to be strongly influenced by water availability; highly suitable areas were situated close to rivers and experienced above average annual precipitation. Net primary productivity and tree cover also exerted some influence on habitat suitability. All three species showed relatively narrow niche breadth and low tolerance to changes in habitat characteristics. From 21,050 km 2 assessed, 8.1% (1,702 km(2)) emerged as highly suitable for all three large carnivores collectively. Of that area, 95.4% (1,624 km(2)) was located within 30 km of the Park-village border, raising concerns about human-carnivore conflict. This was of particular concern for spotted hyaenas, as they were located significantly closer to the Park boundary than lions and leopards. This study provides the first map of potential carnivore distribution across the globally important Ruaha landscape, and demonstrates that SDMs can be effective for understanding large carnivore habitat requirements in poorly sampled areas. This approach could have relevance for many other important wildlife areas that only have limited, haphazard presence-only data, but which urgently require strategic conservation planning.

AB  - Correlations between environmental factors and the distribution of amphibian and reptile species richness were investigated in a climate transition area, Peneda-Geres National Park (PNPG), in North-Western Portugal. Using presence-data at a local-scale (1 x 1 km), Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) identified a mixture of climatic (precipitation and number of days with fog), topographical (altitude and relief) and habitat factors (number of watercourses and water surfaces, the type of the largest water surface and tree diversity cover), as accurate predictors of species occurrence. Three factors were common for both taxonomic groups, and consistently presented a positive relation with species occurrence: precipitation, number of water surfaces, and tree diversity cover; suggesting a strong coincidence in the environmental correlates that influence amphibian and reptile species richness. Distribution patterns of observed and predicted species richness were compared using a Geographical Information System. Overall, three high species richness areas were predicted in common for both taxonomic groups and two additional areas for amphibians only. These areas matched with the observed species richness but suggested larger areas of high species richness. The location of the PNPG in a biogeographic crossroad, between Euro-Siberian and Mediterranean provinces, emphasised species richness of amphibians and reptiles and suggests a high priority conservation status for this protected area. Most of Central-Northern Portugal is located in a climatic transition area; therefore, increased species richness should be expected for other areas. Local scale studies for other protected areas should be planned as a framework for the development of multi-scale conservation planning by Portuguese authorities.

AB  - Conservation organizations are collecting large-scale data regarding distribution and threats to vertebrate taxa. These data sets will enable planners to systematically identify large-scale conservation priorities; however, they will cover only a tiny proportion of living organisms. Therefore, it is essential to investigate to what extent the areas selected for conservation actions can provide protection for other species. We analyzed the umbrella effect between amphibians and mammals across mainland Africa. We built habitat suitability models within the geographic ranges of 1654 species, based on data collected in the framework of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Amphibian Assessment and IUCN Global Mammal Assessment. We applied systematic reserve selection algorithms to two sets of estimators of the area of occupancy of amphibians and mammals (geographic ranges and estimated suitable areas) and thus selected four reserve systems. We then quantified the protection that each of the four systems provided for amphibians and mammals. Reserves selected for amphibians and mammals were comparable in area, with the former concentrated in the Afrotropical region and the latter more evenly dispersed. Mammal reserves left fewer gaps in species coverage among amphibians than the reverse, but amphibian reserves included a larger proportion of each mammal's area of occupancy than the reverse. For both taxa, setting reserves to include estimated suitable areas instead of ranges resulted in the clustering of reserves in the tropics. Furthermore, it efficiently protected hidden gaps (species with unsuitable portions of their range inside protected areas) in the other taxon and included a higher proportion of the area of occupancy of the other taxon. Overall, amphibians and mammals in Africa acted as an umbrella for a high proportion of species in the other taxon. Focusing on estimated suitable areas instead of ranges improved the umbrella effect of both taxa.

AB  - Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a promising tool for priority setting, conservation decision-making and overall support for species conservation. We developed a participatory modeling process (PMP) to ensure both the proper use of SDMs as well as their efficacy and impact as a conservation tool. The PMP using SDM has assisted conservation planning in a number of situations, including more than 25 endangered species and supported IUCN SSC Red List assessments. PMP focuses on stakeholder engagement to co-develop SDMs that will in turn support and guide conservation decisions. This participatory approach to SDMs allowed us to: (a) update potential species distributions; (b) evaluate environmental suitability; (c) identify potential corridors and priority areas for implementing different conservation and management actions; (d) identify new potential areas for species searching; (e) predict potential impact under deforestation and climate change scenarios; and (f) provide valuable input for population viability analysis (PVA). Most often the level of successful stakeholder engagement will influence how the model will guide the decision-making process. The modeler must play a technical role as well as act as a translator and facilitator to engage and bridge the gap between researchers, conservation planners and decision makers, which is essential for effective conservation.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning is traditionally based on biological features, sometimes representing a single biodiversity component, such as top predators. However, few studies have tested the efficiency of traditional spatial prioritizations to capture the phylogenetic and functional diversity of entire faunas. Here, we evaluated (1) the congruence among spatial prioritization analyses based on taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity for mammals and birds occurring in Brazil; and (2) the congruence among outputs of spatial priorities for carnivores and birds of prey and priorities for conserving the phylogenetic and functional diversity of all mammal and bird species. Priority sites differed among taxonomic groups as well as among biodiversity aspects, with low congruence among them. Overall, both strategies - full group and top predators - were not efficient and have not captured even half of all variation in phylogenetic and functional diversity existing in the groups. @ 2014 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

AB  - Spatial conservation prioritization concerns trade-offs between marine conservation and resource exploitation. This approach has been increasingly used to devise spatial management strategies for fisheries because of its simplicity in the optimization model and less data requirement compared to complex dynamic models. However, most of the prioritization is based on static models or algorithms; whose solutions need to be evaluated in a dynamic approach, considering the high uncertainty and opportunity costs associated with their implementation. We developed a framework that integrates species distribution models, spatial conservation prioritization tools and a general grid-based dynamic model (Grid-DM) to support evaluation of ecological and economic trade-offs of candidate conservation plans. The Grid-DM is spatially explicit and has a tactical management focus on single species. We applied the Grid-DM to small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) in Haizhou Bay, China and validated its spatial and temporal performances against historical observations. It was linked to a spatial conservation prioritization tool Marxan to illustrate how the model can be used for conservation strategy evaluation. The simulation model demonstrated effectiveness in capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of the target fishery as well as the socio-ecological effects of conservation measures. We conclude that the model has the capability and flexibility to address various forms of uncertainties, simulate the dynamics of a targeted fishery, and to evaluate biological and socioeconomic impacts of management plans. The modelling platform can further inform scientists and policy makers of management alternatives screening and adaptive conservation planning.

AB  - Climate change is expected to bring about profound rearrangement of ecological communities by affecting individual species distributions. The resulting communities arise from the idiosyncratic responses of species to future changes, which ultimately relate to both shrinking and expanding species ranges. While spatial patterns of colonisation and extirpation events have received great attention, the identification of specific drivers remains poorly explored. This study aims to investigate the relative contribution of species gain and loss to the turnover of fish assemblages in French rivers under future climate change, and to identify their principal drivers. Future projections of potential habitat suitability in 2080 derived from species distribution models for 40 fish species showed that colonisations and extirpations could play counterbalancing roles in the reshuffling of communities. Simultaneously, these two processes exhibited patchy spatial patterns, segregated along the longitudinal and altitudinal gradients, resulting in dramatic species turnover of approximate to 60% of the current composition of species assemblages. Beyond the effect of topographic location, colonisations were found to be driven by temperature seasonality while extirpations were affected by modifications in both thermal and precipitation regimes. These results generate the possibility of developing ecosystem-based management tools focused on the early identification of areas where particular species may be sensitive to climate changes. Disentangling the drivers of colonisation and extirpation processes provides ready-to-use information that may be easily integrated into conservation planning. This information could be used to identify potential hotspots of species gain and loss and to then compare these hotspots with newly favourable areas so as to consider their actual accessibility in order to facilitate future range shifts.

AB  - Climate change is one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline worldwide, through shifting or shrinking habitats of species. Predicting the distribution of suitable habitats for species under climate change is essential for conservation planning. Cyamophila astragalicola is a specialist psyllid dependent on a spiny shrub, endemic to Zagros Mountains of Iran. The current study represents a modeling approach for lesser-known small invertebrates to assess their threat status. Ecological niche modeling was used to assess current suitable habitats of C. astragalicola, to develop model-based predictions of its habitat suitability under different climatic scenarios, and to assess the extinction risk of the species based on IUCN Red List criteria. Results revealed a sharp decline in suitable habitats (97.26% and 99.8% for the years 2050 and 2070, respectively) under the scenario of RCP 8.5. Further, under the two RCP scenarios, C. astragalicola was classified as IUCN Threat 2. A shift toward higher altitudes with lower temperature and higher precipitation was predicted. Results of modeling are based on abiotic factors only. Human interactions are not modeled; hence, the status of the species may be even more dramatic than the models may reveal. Generally, the results of this study indicate the high sensitivity of C. astragalicola to global warming. The narrow distribution range of the species coupled with the low dispersal ability can increase the risk of extinction. Ecological, economic, and social risks associated with the extinction need to be further evaluated to formulate future management policies.

AB  - The establishment of multiple zones offering different protection levels within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) can minimize social conflicts while maintaining associated biodiversity benefits such as fish population replenishment. Parrotfishes are among one of the most ecologically important reef fishes; yet extremely overexploited worldwide. In this context, well-designed priority management areas allowing no fishing activity (no-take zones) could help recover fish species, such as parrotfishes, through a MPA zoning process. Here, we tested this hypothesis by identifying the spatial configuration of zones that maximize the recovery of endangered parrotfish species (Scarus trispinosus; Scarus zelindae; Sparisoma amplum; Sparisoma axillare; Sparisoma frondosum) at the largest MPA in Brazil protecting nearshore coral reefs (MPA Costa dos Corais). We used parrotfish distribution data to produce species distribution models (SDMs) and combined them with conservation planning tools to delineate priority zones following a systematic approach. Then, we contrasted priority zones against non-systematic, newly designed no-take zones based on managers' and stakeholders' perspectives. After mapping the predicted abundance of each species within both zones based upon field surveys, we found that priority zones were more effective than non-systematic ones for the protection of two out of the five species: Scarus trispinosus and Sparisoma amplum. Thus, we considered that designing systematic zones was particularly relevant for increased protection of the two parrotfish species facing the largest decline. The prioritization analyses also showed that priority areas for parrotfish conservation following a systematic approach were mostly located surrounding and within no-take zones delineated by local stakeholders. The spatial overlap between systematic and non-systematic zones was of 38%. Hence, our study reinforces the importance of considering scientific information and methods (e.g., spatial distribution data and prioritization analyses) as a complementary strategy along with local stakeholders' knowledge, for delineating and refining management zones within MPAs.

AB  - Conservation programmes are always limited by available resources. Careful planning is therefore required to increase the efficiency of conservation and gap analysis can be used for this purpose. This method was used to assess the representativeness of current ex situ and in situ conservation actions of 234 priority crop wild relatives (CWR) in Indonesia. This analysis also included species distribution modelling, the creation of an ecogeographical land characterization map, and a complementarity analysis to identify priorities area for in situ conservation and for further collecting of ex situ conservation programmes. The results show that both current ex situ and in situ conservation actions are insufficient. Sixty-six percent of priority CWRs have no recorded ex situ collections. Eighty CWRs with ex situ collections are still under-represented in the national genebanks and 65 CWRs have no presence records within the existing protected area network although 60 are predicted to exist in several protected areas according to their potential distribution models. The complementarity analysis shows that a minimum of 61 complementary grid areas (complementary based on grid cells) are required to conserve all priority taxa and 40 complementary protected areas (complementary based on existing protected areas) are required to conserve those with known populations within the existing in situ protected area network. The top ten of complementary protected areas are proposed as the initial areas for the development of CWR genetic reserves network in Indonesia. It is recommended to enhanced coordination between ex situ and in situ conservation stakeholders for sustaining the long term conservation of CWR in Indonesia. Implementation of the research recommendations will provide for the first time an effective conservation planning of Indonesia's CWR diversity and will significantly enhance the country's food and nutritional security.

AB  - Invasive alien plants (IAP) are a threat to biodiversity worldwide. Understanding and anticipating invasions allow for more efficient management. In this regard, predicting potential invasion risks by IAPs is essential to support conservation planning into areas of high conservation value (AHCV) such as sites exhibiting exceptional botanical richness, assemblage of rare, and threatened and/or endemic plant species. Here, we identified AHCV in Georgia, a country showing high plant richness, and assessed the susceptibility of these areas to colonization by IAPs under present and future climatic conditions. We used actual protected areas and areas of high plant endemism (identified using occurrences of 114 Georgian endemic plant species) as proxies for AHCV. Then, we assessed present and future potential distribution of 27 IAPs using species distribution models under four climate change scenarios and stacked single-species potential distribution into a consensus map representing IAPs richness. We evaluated present and future invasion risks in AHCV using IAPs richness as a metric of susceptibility. We show that the actual protected areas cover only 9.4% of the areas of high plant endemism in Georgia. IAPs are presently located at lower elevations around the large urban centers and in western Georgia. We predict a shift of IAPs toward eastern Georgia and higher altitudes and an increased susceptibility of AHCV to IAPs under future climate change. Our study provides a good baseline for decision makers and stakeholders on where and how resources should be invested in the most efficient way to protect Georgia's high plant richness from IAPs.

AB  - Fewer than 250 Asian elephants remain in China, occupying fragmented habitats of Yunnan Province. One such fragmented population of 18-23 individuals occupies the Nangunhe Nature Reserve Area in Lincang City, Yunnan Province, China. The greatest threat to the survival of this population is the loss and fragmentation of habitat. In this study, we applied an ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) model to evaluate the habitat suitability of Lincang City for Asian elephants based on geographical factors, vegetation type, and human disturbance. Optimal, relatively suitable, and marginal habitat accounted for 0.16% (38.45 km(2)), 0.61% (150.00 km(2)), and 3.34% (817.26 km(2)) of the total study area, whereas non-suitable habitat accounted for 95.89% (23,463.29 km(2)) of this area. The marginality of Asian elephant habitat in Lincang was 1.954, indicating nonrandom selection of various eco-geographical variables in the environment. The primary factor affecting Asian elephant habitat quality was vegetation type, followed by geographical factors and human disturbance. A habitat quality map for the total distribution of Asian elephants remaining in China (i.e., Yunnan Province: Xishuangbanna, Lincang, and Pu'er) based on our current and previous study showed that just 1400.57 km(2) and 2689.62 km(2) relatively suitable and optimal habitat is available, owing to significant deforestation. In addition to reintroduction programs, conservation strategies should focus on improving the quality of marginal habitats for elephants, in parallel to placing ecological corridors through non-suitable habitat to connect all suitable habitats for this and other extremely small elephant populations in China to reduce genetic isolation and secure long-term survival for the species.

AB  - Large identifiable landscape units, such as ecoregions, are used to prioritize global and continental conservation efforts, particularly where biodiversity knowledge is inadequate. Setting biodiversity representation targets using coarse large-scale biogeographic boundaries, can be inefficient and under-representative. Even when using fine-scale biodiversity data, representation deficiencies can occur through misalignment of target distributions with such prioritization frameworks. While this pattern has been recognized, quantitative approaches highlighting misalignments have been lacking, particularly for assemblages of mammal species. We tested the efficacy of Australia's bioregions as a spatial prioritization framework for representing mammal species, within protected areas, in New South Wales. We produced an approach based on mammal assemblages and assessed its performance in representing mammal distributions. Substantial spatial misalignment between New South Wales's bioregions and mammal assemblages was revealed, reflecting deficiencies in the representation of more than half of identified mammal assemblages. Using a systematic approach driven by fine-scale mammalian data, we compared the efficacy of these two frameworks in securing mammalian representation within protected areas. Of the 61 species, 38 were better represented by the mammalian framework, with remaining species only marginally better represented when guided by bioregions. Overall, the rate at which mammal species were incorporated into the protected area network was higher (5.1%+/- 0.6sd) when guided by mammal assemblages. Guided by bioregions, systematic conservation planning of protected areas may be constrained in realizing its full potential in securing representation for all of Australia's biodiversity. Adapting the boundaries of prioritization frameworks by incorporating amassed information from a broad range of taxa should be of conservation significance.

AB  - Protected areas are crucial for Amazonian nature conservation. Many Amazonian reserves have been selected systematically to achieve biodiversity representativeness. We review the role natural-scientific understanding has played in reserve selection, and evaluate the theoretical potential of the existing reserves to cover a complete sample of the species diversity of the Amazonian rainforest biome. In total, 108 reserves ( 604,832 km(2)) are treated as strictly protected and Amazonian; 87 of these can be seen as systematically selected to sample species diversity ( 75.3% of total area). Because direct knowledge on all species distributions is unavailable, surrogates have been used to select reserves: direct information on some species distributions ( 15 reserves, 14.8% of total area); species distribution patterns predicted on the basis of conceptual models, mainly the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis, ( 5/ 10.3%); environmental units ( 46/ 27.3%); or a combination of distribution patterns and environmental units ( 21/ 22.9%). None of these surrogates are reliable: direct information on species distributions is inadequate; the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis is highly controversial; and environmental classiWcations do not capture all relevant ecological variation, and their relevance for species distribution patterns is undocumented. Hence, Amazonian reserves cannot be safely assumed to capture all Amazonian species. To improve the situation, transparency and an active dialogue with the scientific community should be integral to conservation planning. We suggest that the best currently available approach for sampling Amazonian species diversity in reserve selection is to simultaneously inventory indicator plant species and climatic and geological conditions, and to combine Weld studies with remote sensing.

AB  - Aim: To review the conservation status of Headwater catfish Ictalurus lupus (Girard,1859) in the United States, including quantifying environmental correlates with range contraction and hybridization and introgression with Channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque, 1818) to inform conservation prioritization.
   Location: Texas and New Mexico, USA.
   Methods: We used random forest models to construct species distribution models (SDMs) based on historical (1980-1999) and contemporary (2000-2019) data and 13 classes of remotely sensed stream network data. We measured hybridization and introgression with the widely introduced Channel catfish using external morphology, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and a nuclear gene (RAG2).
   Results: Species distribution models illustrated temporal reduction in suitability for Headwater catfish among the species' namesake headwater streams, including streams with steeper slopes, faster velocities, and higher elevations. Modelling also revealed reduced suitability of larger streams greater distances from groundwater springs, the same streams frequently occupied by non-native Channel catfish. A general pattern of increased use of streams draining watersheds with altered or developed land uses was apparent. Assessment of introgression and hybridization with non-native channel catfish at nine locations showed evidence of ongoing or past hybridization at six locations. Persistence of potentially non-introgressed populations were found at three locations with smaller sample sizes.
   Main conclusions: Modelling temporal changes in Headwater catfish distribution provided critical insight into the types and locations of streams that should be targeted for habitat preservation or restoration. Conservation and management of Headwater catfish will require priority decisions based on existing levels of introgression and the practicality of preventing further contact with Channel catfish. Maintaining Headwater catfish populations in springs that are also heavily used by humans will be critical for conservation of the species in the United States.

AB  - Indicators for preserving marine biodiversity include knowledge of how the spatial distribution and critical habitats of species overlap with human activities and impacts. Such indicators are key tools for marine spatial planning, a process that identifies and resolves conflicts between human uses and the conservation of marine environments. The common bottlenose dolphin in the Mediterranean Sea is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List and a priority species of the EU Habitat Directive. Here, we estimated spatio-temporal patterns of the species occurrence in the area around one Marine Protected Area (MPA) and two Sites of Community Importance (SCI) of the North western Sardinia, with the aim to predict the species distribution and the main links with the environmental factors and boat traffic. To evaluate whether dolphin groups with calves showed any habitat preference different from groups without calves, separate models for both type of groups were done. The most important contributing variables to the dolphin habitat suitability models were the likelihood of boat presence, habitat type and mean sea surface temperature. Different model outputs were obtained depending on dolphin group composition. The area of high likelihood of dolphin presence ranged between 30 and 60 km(2) and was smaller for groups with calves. Further, the area of highest dolphin habitat suitability overlaps with the area of high boat traffic, suggesting that boating in the study site is a potential relevant anthropogenic threat to dolphins. Particularly, boating is concentrated inside and around the MPA/SCIs, indicating the need for stronger restriction measures. We propose updated SCI boundaries for effective protection of common bottlenose dolphins. These areas and the suggestions of regulation are specifically aimed at reducing the impact of boating on dolphins, especially for groups with calves. Synthesis and applications. Management measures should be designed based on the data here provided, and then implemented and enforced to decrease dolphin-boat interactions, especially for mother-calf pairs. The creation of new coastal SCIs should be considered especially where boat traffic overlaps with areas most suitable for dolphins. In these SCIs, boating should be managed to limit disturbance, avoidance or alterations of dolphin vital behavior.

AB  - The mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa) is notably the most primitive North American rodent with a restricted distribution in the Pacific Northwest based on its physiological limits to heat stress and water needs. The Point Arena subspecies (A. r. nigra) is federally listed as endangered and is 1 of 2 subspecies that have extremely small and disjunct distributions, putting the taxon at risk from habitat loss and warming global temperatures. We sought to understand their range-wide distribution, to predict the environmental features that best describe their occurrence, and to establish a foundation for monitoring their distribution. We randomly sampled the occurrence of Point Arena mountain beavers (PAMB) from the portion of their geographic range that was accessible (public lands plus private lands where permission was granted). We surveyed 127, 25-ha sample units for their distinctive burrows and estimated the probability of detecting burrows, if they were present, at >90% per visit. Using this information, we estimated occupancy across the accessible portion of the range to be 26.2%. Range-wide estimates of occupancy, combined with strategically selected locations where abundance and survival can be estimated noninvasively, may comprise a realistic monitoring program for this taxon. We also used the detection and nondetection locations to develop a habitat suitability model by relating these locations to remotely sensed predictors. We evaluated 53 a priori candidate habitat suitability models and the best-fitting model included gentle slopes, low terrain roughness indices, and the high density of rivers and streams. Selecting the probability value that best separated the sample units into suitable and nonsuitable habitat, we estimated a total of 70.5 km(2) of suitable habit, or approximately 40.4% of the original geographic range. New detections significantly expanded the known geographic range, moderating concerns about habitat loss, including that predicted by climate change. A substantial number of suitable areas were predicted to occur outside the current range. The identification of high suitability areas allows management agencies to prioritize areas for PAMB conservation planning, evaluate human impacts on habitat, and evaluate how a changing climate may affect distribution.

AB  - Bayesian networks are one of the most powerful tools in the design of expert systems located in an uncertainty framework. However, normally their application is determined by the discretization of the continuous variables. In this paper the naive Bayes (NB) and tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) models are developed. They are based on Mixtures of Truncated Exponentials (MTE) designed to deal with discrete and continuous variables in the same network simultaneously without any restriction. The aim is to characterize the habitat of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca), using several continuous environmental variables, and one discrete (binary) variable representing the presence or absence of the tortoise. These models are compared with the full discrete models and the results show a better classification rate for the continuous one. Therefore, the application of continuous models instead of discrete ones avoids loss of statistical information due to the discretization. Moreover, the results of the TAN continuous model show a more spatially accurate distribution of the tortoise. The species is located in the Donana Natural Park, and in semiarid habitats. The proposed continuous models based on MTEs are valid for the study of species predictive distribution modelling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impact of climate change on conservation planning is affected by the availability of data (especially in data-sparse countries) and socioeconomic impacts. We build models using MaxEnt for Egyptian medicinal plants as a model system, projecting them to different future times under two IPCC 4th assessment emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no dispersal. We compare the effect of two indices of socioeconomic activity [Human Influence Index (HII) and human population density/km(2)] as cost layers in spatial prioritization for conservation using zonation. We assess the efficacy of Egypt's network of Protected Areas (PAs) by comparing the predicted conservation value inside and outside each PA under the various scenarios. The results show that there are many locations in Egypt (the main cities, agricultural land, coastal areas) that are highly ranked for conservation before human socioeconomic impacts are included. The HII had a stronger impact than using human population density. The PA value excess (inside-outside) varied significantly with the type of cost and dispersal, but not with climate-change scenario or Zonation settings. We conclude that human socioeconomic impacts add new scope and insights for future conservation; and conservation planning without consideration of such impacts cannot be complete.

AB  - A large amount of data for inconspicuous taxa is stored in natural history collections; however, this information is often neglected for biodiversity patterns studies. Here, we evaluate the performance of direct interpolation of museum collections data, equivalent to the traditional approach used in bryophyte conservation planning, and stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) to produce reliable reconstructions of species richness patterns, given that differences between these methods have been insufficiently evaluated for inconspicuous taxa. Our objective was to contrast if species distribution models produce better inferences of diversity richness than simply selecting areas with the higher species numbers. As model species, we selected Iberian species of the genus Grimmia (Bryophyta), and we used four well-collected areas to compare and validate the following models: 1) four Maxent richness models, each generated without the data from one of the four areas, and a reference model created using all of the data and 2) four richness models obtained through direct spatial interpolation, each generated without the data from one area, and a reference model created with all of the data. The correlations between the partial and reference Maxent models were higher in all cases (0.45 to 0.99), whereas the correlations between the spatial interpolation models were negative and weak (-0.3 to -0.06). Our results demonstrate for the first time that S-SDMs offer a useful tool for identifying detailed richness patterns for inconspicuous taxa such as bryophytes and improving incomplete distributions by assessing the potential richness of under-surveyed areas, filling major gaps in the available data. In addition, the proposed strategy would enhance the value of the vast number of specimens housed in biological collections.

AB  - Kawthoolei (defined as all Karen National Union administrative areas and encompassing Karen State, Myanmar), a global hotspot for biodiversity, is increasingly under threat due to deforestation, mining, human population growth, indiscriminate burning, and infrastructure development. Pinpointing biodiversity hotspots to focus conservation efforts is integral given the limited funding and capacity of local conservation actors to undertake activities throughout Kawthoolei. We obtained wildlife presence data for 23 medium-large mammal species of conservation concern from 7 years of camera trapping efforts throughout Kawthoolei and produced species distribution models, which were used to prioritize areas for conservation action. Presence only data were combined with bioclimatic, topographical, anthropogenic, land cover, and biotic interaction variables to produce Maxent models covering 87,612 km(2). Species specific maps were weighted according to their IUCN Red List of Threatened Species status and combined to pinpoint areas with high biodiversity, weighing areas higher that harbored Vulnerable and Endangered species. Individual species were predicted present in 1.44-32.17 % of the study area. Priority maps classified 55.91 % of the total study area as having no species present, 25.07 % as low priority, 10.73 % as medium priority, and 8.29 % as high priority. The protected area system currently covers 26.8 % of the high priority habitats available. While most endemic species continue to persist in Kawthoolei, models demonstrated a scattered distribution of high priority areas throughout Kawthoolei, which may lack connectivity. Additional conservation actions that supplement the current protected area system may be necessary to curb extirpation risks, including the demarcation and active patrolling of additional protected areas in high priority landscapes and activities that promote connectivity between high-quality habitats.

AB  - Remote sensing has made important contributions to biodiversity conservation planning through the measurement of deforestation rates, habitat fragmentation, habitat degradation, and isolation of protected areas in human altered landscapes. Progress in using remote sensing together with field data for the development of robust habitat suitability models has been more modest. In this paper, we present a habitat suitability model developed by relating field data on habitat characteristics and habitat selection of a medium-sized primate (redtail monkey, Cercopithecus ascanius) with a small home range (in contrast to many studies that focus on large-bodied, wide-ranging animals) to satellite-derived data, for predicting animal occurrence. We examined the relative performance of two high-resolution satellite sensors (2.5 m resolution Quickbird and 30 m resolution Landsat ETM+) in capturing patterns of habitat selection by redtail monkeys in Kibale National Park. Overall, our analyses suggest that a model combining data from both the Quickbird and ETM+ sensors predicts monkey presence-absence best, and that, individually, ETM+ data are better predictors than Quickbird data. Moreover, model fit was best at larger scales (ETM+ 120 m, 150 m and 240 m pixels). These results have important implications for future habitat modeling, biodiversity analyses and conservation studies given Landsat's temporal and spatial resolutions, long history of use, relatively well-developed methods for processing and analysis, and relatively low cost in comparison with many higher resolution sensors.

AB  - Expert knowledge-based species-habitat relationships are used extensively to guide conservation planning, particularly when data are scarce. Purported relationships describe the initial state of knowledge, but are rarely tested. We assessed support in the data for suitability rankings of vegetation types based on expert knowledge for three terrestrial avian species in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United States. Experts used published studies, natural history, survey data, and field experience to rank vegetation types as optimal, suitable, and marginal. We used single-season occupancy models, coupled with land cover and Breeding Bird Survey data, to examine the hypothesis that patterns of occupancy conformed to species-habitat suitability rankings purported by experts. Purported habitat suitability was validated for two of three species. As predicted for the Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens) and Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla), occupancy was strongly influenced by vegetation types classified as "optimal habitat" by the species suitability rankings for nuthatches and wood-pewees. Contrary to predictions, Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) models that included vegetation types as covariates received similar support by the data as models without vegetation types. For all three species, occupancy was also related to sampling latitude. Our results suggest that covariates representing other habitat requirements might be necessary to model occurrence of generalist species like the woodpecker. The modeling approach described herein provides a means to test expert knowledge-based species-habitat relationships, and hence, help guide conservation planning.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation typically precedes conservation planning; maintaining remaining linkages among core habitat areas can thus become a key conservation objective. Identifying linkages for dispersal and ensuring those linkages have long-term protection and management are challenging tasks for wildlife managers. These tasks can be especially daunting for smaller species with low mobility, termed corridor dwellers, which must maintain sustainable populations within corridors. Between May 2007 and June 2009, we collected occurrence locations for a corridor dweller, the Palm Springs pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris bangsii), from museums, previous research, and our own field sampling. We used those data to model their suitable niche space and then identify suitable linkages between proposed conservation areas. We used a partitioned Mahalanobis D-2 statistic to create a spatially explicit niche model describing the distribution of a suitable niche space, and we validated the model statistically, with live trapping and with burrowing owl (Athene cunnicularia) diets. Our model identified soil characteristics, topographic ruggedness, and vegetation as variables delimiting Palm Springs pocket mouse habitat; sand content of the soils was an especially important characteristic. Our historic distribution model identified 120,000-90,000 ha as historically potential Palm Springs pocketmouse habitat; roughly 39% of that has been lost to more recent development. Most of the remaining suitable habitat occurred in the northwestern portion of the valley. We modeled habitat within core reserves as well as within proposed linkages between those reserves as having high similarity to known occupied habitats. Live trapping in areas with high (>= 0.95) Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) values resulted in captures at 66% of those locations and, along with burrowing owl diets, refined a qualitative model as to what constituted a suitable Palm Springs pocket mouse corridor. While most corridor analyses have focused on mobile species which may traverse corridors in hours, days, or weeks, linkages for corridor dwellers must include habitat for sustaining multi-generational populations. This requires evaluating whether continuous suitable habitat exists within proposed corridors. Our research demonstrates how niche modeling can provide a landscape-scale view of the distribution of suitable habitat to evaluate conservation objectives for connectivity.

AB  - Crab species are economically and ecologically important in coastal ecosystems, and their spatial distributions are pivotal for conservation and fisheries management. This study was focused on modelling the spatial distributions of three Portunidae crabs (Charybdis bimaculata, Charybdis japonica, and Portunus trituberculatus) in Haizhou Bay, China. We applied three analytical approaches (Generalized additive model (GAM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN)) to spring and fall bottom trawl survey data (2011, 20132016) to develop and compare species distribution models (SDMs). Model predictability was evaluated using cross-validation based on the observed species distribution. Results showed that sea bottom temperature (SBT), sea bottom salinity (SBS), and sediment type were the most important factors affecting crab distributions. The relative importance of candidate variables was not consistent among species, season, or model. In general, we found ANNs to have less stability than both RFs and GAMs. GAMs overall yielded the least complex response curve structure. C. japonica was more pronounced in southwestern portion of Haizhou Bay, and C. bimaculata tended to stay in offshore areas. P. trituberculatus was the least region-specific and exhibited substantial annual variations in abundance. The comparison of multiple SDMs was informative to understand species responses to environmental factors and predict species distributions. This study contributes to better understanding the environmental niches of crabs and demonstrates best practices for the application of SDMs for management and conservation planning.

AB  - Species distribution models have been widely used to predict species distributions for various purposes, including conservation planning, and climate change impact assessment. The success of these applications relies heavily on the accuracy of the models. Various measures have been proposed to assess the accuracy of the models. Rigorous statistical analysis should be incorporated in model accuracy assessment. However, since relevant information about the statistical properties of accuracy measures is scattered across various disciplines, ecologists find it difficult to select the most appropriate ones for their research. In this paper, we review accuracy measures that are currently used in species distribution modelling (SDM), and introduce additional metrics that have potential applications in SDM. For the commonly used measures (which are also intensively studied by statisticians), including overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, kappa, and area and partial area under the ROC curves, promising methods to construct confidence intervals and statistically compare the accuracy between two models are given. For other accuracy measures, methods to estimate standard errors are given, which can be used to construct approximate confidence intervals. We also suggest that as general tools, computer-intensive methods, especially bootstrap and randomization methods can be used in constructing confidence intervals and statistical tests if suitable analytic methods cannot be found. Usually, these computer-intensive methods provide robust results.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we conducted, for the first time, an extensive climate change impact assessment of bee pollinators in the Aegean Islands, Greece, a regional bee hotspot in the Mediterranean. We located the current biodiversity and future extinction hotspots in the region and identified areas in urgent need for conservation prioritization, by undertaking an overlap analysis with the established protected areas network in Greece. Most bee species occurring in the archipelago are expected to face severe range contractions and there is evidence of an underlying extinction debt in the study area. Our work could serve as the baseline for the integration of a rather neglected, yet extremely economically and ecologically important taxonomic group, the bees, in the systematic conservation planning in the archipelago. Pollinators' climate change impact assessments focus mainly on mainland regions. Thus, we are unaware how island species might fare in a rapidly changing world. This is even more pressing in the Mediterranean Basin, a global biodiversity hotspot. In Greece, a regional pollinator hotspot, climate change research is in its infancy and the insect Wallacean shortfall still remains unaddressed. In a species distribution modelling framework, we used the most comprehensive occurrence database for bees in Greece to locate the bee species richness hotspots in the Aegean, and investigated whether these might shift in the future due to climate change and assessed the Natura 2000 protected areas network effectiveness. Range contractions are anticipated for most taxa, becoming more prominent over time. Species richness hotspots are currently located in the NE Aegean and in highly disturbed sites. They will shift both altitudinally and latitudinally in the future. A small proportion of these hotspots are currently included in the Natura 2000 protected areas network and this proportion is projected to decrease in the coming decades. There is likely an extinction debt present in the Aegean bee communities that could result to pollination network collapse. There is a substantial conservation gap in Greece regarding bees and a critical re-assessment of the established Greek protected areas network is needed, focusing on areas identified as bee diversity hotspots over time.

AB  - Most of the protected areas (PAs) in India have a hard boundary; very rarely having a transition zone to minimise the negative human wildlife interface. With increasing anthropogenic pressures, areas surrounding PAs are becoming integral for conservation. Government of India introduced a concept of Eco-sensitive Zones (ESZ) around PAs to minimise anthropogenic pressures and regulate rapid development in these areas. However, delineation of ESZs is a complex process and may take a long time. In this paper, a novel geospatial approach has been presented to delineate ESZ using a species centric approach. A case study using Swamp deer (Rucervus duvaucelli duvaucelli) as focal species was explored for its potential to delineate ESZ around protected area Jhilmil Jheel Conservation Reserve (JJCR) located in Uttarakhand India. Maximum entropy or Maxent model was used to identify habitat suitability. Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), altitude, land cover and distance to roads were used as co-variates. Seasonal variations for habitat suitability were also considered. In this study habitat suitability map of swamp deer was further rationalised based on habitat fragmentation and management limitations and proposed as ESZ of JJCR. This approach for delineation of ESZ can be very useful for PAs in India which have focal species and are yet to declare their ESZ.

AB  - Critically endangered Asiatic Cheetah faces a dramatic decrease in its abundance and distribution in recent decades, entailing the necessity for more severe conservation activities for the species in its last remaining habitats in Iran. Proper management of the target species is highly dependent on knowledge about its distribution and habitat requirements. The Maximum Entropy modeling approach was applied to achieve the species habitat suitability models using data collected from 2001 to 2018. We found that the most contiguous patch predicted as a suitable one has been reported from the country's central parts, which constitute around one-third of the country's predicted suitable habitats. However, only 36.3% of these habitats were shown to be located inside the borders of the country's protected area network. Naybandan Wildlife Refuge and Touran Biosphere Reserve incorporate 9661.7 (12.6%) and 8291 (10.8%) km2 of suitable habitats, respectively where can be regarded as the most critical areas in the species conservation programs. Least Cost Path analysis suggested two corridors with 262.5 and 192.5 km length connecting northern and southern suitable patches. Designing new protected areas or local community conserved areas and extending current borders of the protected areas are necessary to connect northern and southern habitats and increase the species viability.

AB  - The concept of shifting or sliding baselines refers to the way that significant changes to an ecological system are mistakenly measured against a previous baseline, which may be significantly different from the original state of the system. The concept assumes an 'original state' exists and that a return to that state might be possible, if it could be determined and there was sufficient control of human interference. The concept has been important in both marine conservation planning and fisheries management. However, long periods of exploitation, observed and projected climate change, and the disappearance of some environments, suggest that a return to an original state is unlikely to be achievable in many systems. In addition, protection based on static marine protected areas is unlikely to meet common conservation objectives, as species and habitats are moving and species assemblages shuffling with the changing climate. An alternative to modeling single species distribution changes is to examine change in environmental proxies, such as sea surface temperature (SST). Here, projected changes in SST for the period 2063-2065 from a down-scaled ocean model are used to illustrate the similarity to, and movements of, present pelagic environments within conservation planning areas off Eastern Australia. The future environment of small planning areas differs from their present environment and static protected areas might not protect range-changing species. Climate-aware conservation planning should consider the use of mobile protected areas to afford protection to species' changing their distribution, and develop conservation objectives that are not underpinned by a return to historical baselines.

AB  - Tourism development in protected areas inevitably induces a decline in the ecological environment and species survival. However, the degree of impact depends on target species' environmental quality tolerance and the number of tourists. Each fish can tolerate a specific level of water quality. Water quality should not deteriorate below this level as a result of tourism. In this study, we used regression analysis and habitat suitability curve method to determine the number of tourists that could visit an area without inducing a decline in water quality that would negatively impact the survival of protected fishes. A regression model indicated that of the ten water quality parameters evaluated, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, and ammonia-nitrogen were most impacted by tourists. A habitat suitability curve was produced for each target fish population and water quality parameter. These curves were used to determine suitable water quality for fish survival. The curves were then combined to determine the acceptable number of tourists for management of water quality suitable for fish survival. In order to maintain suitable water quality for the survival of Varicorhinus barbatulus, Candidia barbatus, and Acrossocheilus paradoxus, the threshold number of tourists at the study site is 3,000-3,600 people per week.

AB  - Statistical modelling of biological survey data in relation to remotely mapped environmental variables is a powerful technique for making more effective use of sparse data in regional conservation planning. Application of such modelling to planning in the northeast New South Wales ( NSW) region of Australia represents one of the most extensive and longest running case studies of this approach anywhere in the world. Since the early 1980s, statistical modelling has been used to extrapolate distributions of over 2300 species of plants and animals, and a wide variety of higher-level communities and assemblages. These modelled distributions have played a pivotal role in a series of major land-use planning processes, culminating in extensive additions to the region's protected area system. This paper provides an overview of the analytical methodology used to model distributions of individual species in northeast NSW, including approaches to: ( 1) developing a basic integrated statistical and geographical information system (GIS) framework to facilitate automated fitting and extrapolation of species models; ( 2) extending this basic approach to incorporate consideration of spatial autocorrelation, land-cover mapping and expert knowledge; and ( 3) evaluating the performance of species modelling, both in terms of predictive accuracy and in terms of the effectiveness with which such models function as general surrogates for biodiversity.

AB  - Recent assessments have identified significant shortfalls in the current Natura 2000 network approach for identifying protected areas throughout the European Union. A more systematic conservation network planning approach that adopts strategic development options and considers the occurrences of species and habitats within the distribution ranges of species across larger areas is needed in order to support decision making processes on the potential expansion, establishment and/or maintenance of conservation areas. Using high-nature-value forest habitats across a large test region, i.e. the state of Lower Saxony in Germany, we developed a method aimed at systematically locating and appraising temperate forest habitats using indicator species distribution maps. Forest community indicator species were determined using forest habitat affinity criteria (derived from an existing database) and community fidelity (based on a review of 5338 vegetation releves). Known habitat occurrences were derived from habitat surveys and relevant literature and were related to model data on indicator species distribution on a grid of 1739 raster cells (each 30 km(2)) using logistic regression. The predictive power of the distribution models increased with the number of indicator species. However, tight correlations between indicator species distribution and habitat occurrence were only found when indicator species with a high affinity to forests were used exclusively. Field inspection of grid cells with outlying occurrences of five upland forest communities revealed several new forest habitat locations and led to greatly improved distribution models. We conclude that the distribution of high-nature-value forest habitats can be predicted from large-scale raster data on plant species distributions when only indicator species with close association to forest habitats and a high fidelity to a single community are selected. Our approach may therefore facilitate a review of the existing Natura 2000 forest conservation network, be used to identify additional conservation areas or to monitor the success of forest conservation management measures.

AB  - Knowledge about biodiversity remains inadequate because most species living on Earth were still not formally described (the Linnean shortfall) and because geographical distributions of most species are poorly understood and usually contain many gaps (the Wallacean shortfall). In this paper, we developed models to infer the size and placement of geographical ranges of hypothetical non-described species, based on the range size frequency distribution of anurans recently described in the Cerrado Biome, on the level of knowledge (number of inventories) and on surrogates for habitat suitability. The rationale for these models is as follow: (1) the range size frequency distribution of these species should be similar to the range-restricted species, which have been most recently described in the Cerrado Biome; (2) the probability of new discoveries will increase in areas with low biodiversity knowledge, mainly in suitable areas, and (3) assuming range continuity, new species should occupy adjacent cells only if the level of knowledge is low enough to allow the existence of undiscovered species. We ran a model based on the number of inventories only, and two models combining effects of number of inventories and two different estimates of habitat suitability, for a total of 100 replicates each. Finally, we performed a complementary analysis using simulated annealing to solve the set-covering problem for each simulation (i.e. finding the smallest number of cells so that all species are represented at least once), using extents of occurrence of 160 species (131 real anuran species plus 29 new simulated species). The revised reserve system that included information about unknown or poorly sampled taxa significantly shifted northwards, when compared to a system based on currently known species. This main result can be explained by the paucity of biodiversity data in this part of the biome, associated with its relatively high habitat suitability. As a precautionary measure, weighted by the inferred distribution data, the prioritization of a system of reserves in the north part of the biome appears to be defensible.

AB  - Context Context Bats are considered as an ecological indicator of habitat quality due to their sensitivity to human-induced ecosystem changes. Hence, we will focus the study on two indicator species of bats as a proxy to evaluate structure and composition of the landscape to analyze anthropic pressures driving changes in patterns.
   Objectives This study develops a spatially-explicit model to highlight key habitat nodes and corridors which are integral for maintaining functional landscape connectivity for bat movement. We focus on a complex mountain landscape and two bat species: greater (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) horseshoe bats which are known to be sensitive to landscape composition and configuration.
   Methods Species distribution models are used to delineate high-quality foraging habitat for each species using opportunistic ultrasonic bat data. We then performed connectivity analysis combining (modelled) suitable foraging habitat and (known) roost sites. We use graph-theory and the deviation in the probability of connectivity to quantify resilience of the landscape connectivity to perturbations.
   Results Both species were confined to lowlands (< 1000 m elevation) and avoided areas with high road densities. Greater horseshoe bats were more generalist than lesser horseshoe bats which tended to be associated with broadleaved and mixed forests.
   Conclusions The spatially-explicit models obtained were proven crucial for prioritizing foraging habitats, roost sites and key corridors for conservation. Hence, our results are being used by key stakeholders to help integrate conservation measures into forest management and conservation planning at the regional level. The approach used can be integrated into conservation initiatives elsewhere.

AB  - Conservation management often requires decision-making without perfect knowledge of the at-risk species or ecosystem. Species distribution models (SDMs) are useful but largely under-utilized due to model uncertainty. We used an ensemble modeling approach of two independently derived SDMs to explicitly address common modeling impediments and directly inform conservation decision-making for piping plovers in a heavily populated mid-Atlantic (USA) coastal zone. We summarized previously published Bayesian network and maximum entropy models to highlight similarities and differences in structure, and we compared the relative importance of predictors used. Despite differences in analytical approach, relative importance of factors driving nest-site selection was consistent. Models demonstrated considerable agreement when comparing a binary (suitable/unsuitable) measure of suitability. Instances of model consensus (i.e., overlapping areas of predicted piping plover nesting habitat between models) provide a stronger "signal" in model results, reducing uncertainty related to biases or errors associated with either model. We tested model accuracy using a common dataset of plover nests initiated within the focal areas between 2013 and 2015, and we examined congruency in model outputs. Nearly, 90% of all nests occurred in areas predicted suitable by at least one model, and at least 33% of the total nests were predicted in areas suitable by both. Because models predominantly agreed on what drives piping plover nest-site selection, areas predicted suitable by a single model should not be discounted. This case study demonstrates how models can effectively inform conservation planning by explicitly identifying the management objective, presenting robust evidence to allow managers to evaluate outcomes of alternative management decisions, and clearly communicating results that address real-world conservation problems. Our results can greatly increase the piping plover management community's ability to prioritize candidate sites for future protection, manage existing nesting habitat appropriately, and make a compelling case for conservation actions against competing land use objectives.

AB  - The process of niche construction can alter the trajectory of natural selection through organism-environment feedback. As such, the mechanism and impact of niche construction can be better investigated along environmental gradients. Here we investigate how the process of niche construction affects the distribution of genotypes and fitness landscape along an environmental gradient under three selection regimes, namely heterozygote superiority, genetic loci which dictates niche construction ability being either selectively neutral or non-neutral. Using a spatially explicit cellular automaton, we show that niche construction can stratify genetic diversity by forming band-like distributions consisting of different genotypic compositions and promote reproduction isolation by forming a divide with reduced average fitness along the gradients, termed a fitness valley. The band structure and the presence of a fitness valley depend on heterogeneous environments, resource-dependent fitness and the selection acting on the gene loci affecting the niche-constructing ability. Our work adds to the growing body of evidence on criticizing species distribution models which assume that the environment alone can determine species distributions. Based on the results, we argue that conservation planning should target preserving or restoring environmental gradients.

AB  - Determining a species' geographic range is important for conservation planning, yet this information is lacking for many raptors. In rapidly changing environments, defining current and predicting future distributions can help define priority areas for monitoring and research. The Laggar Falcon (Falco jugger) is a rare and understudied raptor resident across the Indian subcontinent, categorized as Near Threatened, with populations potentially in rapid decline. Using a Species Distribution Modelling framework we update current distribution and predict future distribution based on two future climate change scenarios for 2050. Our current distribution model had high predictive accuracy, and defined core areas of high climatic suitability in western India and southeastern Pakistan. Three bioclimatic variables contributed 79.9% to model prediction: mean temperature of the wettest quarter (50.1%), precipitation seasonality (17.6%), and precipitation in the driest month (12.2%). Projecting our model into climate change scenarios for 2050 resulted in up to 6% mean gain in suitable climate space for a lower emission scenario, but a 5% mean loss in suitable climate by 2050 in a high emissions scenario. All future predictive models showed similar multidirectional range movements within the current predicted core range. Based on these results, Laggar Falcon distribution may not be adversely affected by climate change. We recommend directed population surveys and monitoring based on current model predictions of areas of highest climate suitability, which are likely where Laggar Falcons will persist into the near future. Regular monitoring and research will enhance our knowledge for this raptor, while contributing further data to improve our model predictions.

AB  - The Sunda clouded leopard Neofelis diardi is a medium sized (15-25 kg) cat, found only on the Sundaic islands of Borneo and Sumatra. In recent years intensive camera-trapping surveys in Borneo have begun to shed light on the habitat associations and basic ecology of this elusive wild cat, but its distribution on an island-wide scale remains very poorly known. Such information is an essential element in the assessment of the Sunda clouded leopard's conservation status and in the development of conservation action. In this paper we use MaxEnt niche distribution modelling to make predictions regarding the current distribution of this cat on Borneo. We collected a total of 259 occurrence records for the Sunda clouded leopard, stemming from all Bornean regions apart from Brunei and South Kalimantan, of which 48 (Balanced Model) or 94 (Spatial Filtering Model) were used in our modelling. Our habitat suitability model suggests that this species has a widespread distribution over a large contiguous portion of Borneo. The only exception is South Kalimantan, which is predicted largely to comprise unsuitable habitat. The predicted distribution closely follows the current distribution of little-encroached forest on Borneo (including selectively logged and unlogged areas). The species is notably predicted to be absent from the extensive areas of oil palm plantation, particularly in much of the low-lying coastal land. The predicted range encompasses a large proportion of the existing and proposed protected area network on Borneo. We highlight the priority areas for the conservation of the Sunda clouded leopard in Borneo based on our predicted distribution.

AB  - Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are ubiquitous in ecology to predict species occurrence throughout their range. Typically, SDMs are created using presence-only or presence-absence data. We hypothesize that the continuous metric of temporal occupancy, the proportion of time a species is observed at a given site, provides more detail about species occurrence than binary presence-based SDMs.
   Location North America.
   Methods We compared SDMs for 189 focal species using four modelling methods to determine whether North American avian species distributions are better predicted using temporal occupancy over presence-absence. We used the North American Breeding Bird Survey and built SDMs based on all sites sampled consecutively between 2001 and 2015, as well as on a subset of only five time points within the 15-year sampling window. Each model used the same environmental inputs to predict species range. Each SDM was cross-validated temporally and spatially.
   Results Species distributions were generally better predicted using temporal occupancy rather than presence-absence when using either a five-year or fifteen-year sampling window. Species that occurred in a smaller proportion of their predicted range were particularly better predicted with SDMs using temporal occupancy. Temporal occupancy SDMs had lower false discovery and false-positive rates but higher false-negative rates than presence-absence models.
   Main conclusions Temporal occupancy is a valuable metric that can improve predictions of species occurrence for birds and may improve conservation planning and design efforts.

AB  - Open-source species locality data are widely used in species distribution modeling but may be spatially biased by uneven sampling effort across a species' range. Spatial biases may vary across ecological trait groups if traits affect associations with landscape features and capture probability. Furthermore, spatial biases may change across time as research priorities, funding, and methodologies change, which may confound modeling of temporal changes in distributions. We used locality records from 93 bat species from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to characterize the differential contribution of bias variables to spatial bias and how contribution varied across ecological trait groups. Next, we examined how historical changes in protected area proliferation, economic development, and sampling method advancement affected protected area and university biases. Roosting and foraging traits influenced spatial bias, but distance to protected areas was the greatest contributor to spatial sampling bias in a pooled model and 8 out of 10 ecological trait group models. Over time, distance to protected areas significantly decreased following protected area proliferation, but economic improvement did not influence distance to universities. Sampling method advancements increased protected area bias for two out of three foraging groups. Although sampling effort has increased over time, effort is becoming more biased towards protected areas, which may not encompass the entirety of species' ranges or allow for equal sampling across taxa. Characterizing spatial bias differences among species and across time clarifies underlying causes of spatial bias, information that can be leveraged to improve spatial bias correction.

AB  - Conservation priorities that are based on species distribution, endemism, and vulnerability may underrepresent biologically unique species as well as their functional roles and evolutionary histories. To ensure that priorities are biologically comprehensive, multiple dimensions of diversity must be considered. Further, understanding how the different dimensions relate to one another spatially is important for conservation prioritization, but the relationship remains poorly understood. Here, we use spatial conservation planning to (i) identify and compare priority regions for global mammal conservation across three key dimensions of biodiversity-taxonomic, phylogenetic, and traits-and (ii) determine the overlap of these regions with the locations of threatened species and existing protected areas. We show that priority areas for mammal conservation exhibit low overlap across the three dimensions, highlighting the need for an integrative approach for biodiversity conservation. Additionally, currently protected areas poorly represent the three dimensions of mammalian biodiversity. We identify areas of high conservation priority among and across the dimensions that should receive special attention for expanding the global protected area network. These high-priority areas, combined with areas of high priority for other taxonomic groups and with social, economic, and political considerations, provide a biological foundation for future conservation planning efforts.

AB  - We analyzed the spatial distribution of a snake assemblage from the Sierras de Ventania mountain range, a rich endemism area in east-central Argentina. We used field-collected and museum specimens combined with high resolution environmental variables to identify common distributional patterns, estimate the suitable habitat for each species, and develop a conservation proposal related to the Protected Natural Areas (PNAs) system. Distributional models diverged into two opposite patterns: suitable habitats for most species at relatively high altitude in the hills, and suitable habitats for Bothrops ammodytoides and Lygophis anomalus at relatively low altitude in the surrounding hill plain. We assessed two proposals based on different conservation algorithms: the additive benefit function (ABF), which favours hilly environments, prioritizing areas with high specific richness, and the core-area zonation (CAZ), which prioritizes the distribution of all species, further indicating areas with low richness in the surrounding plain. Regardless of the algorithm used, our results indicated that the existing PNAs are not effective in protecting the snake assemblage. Protecting at least 5% of the highest species richness areas (ABF) or 5% of the distribution core areas of all species (CAZ), the existing PNAs only represented 2.2% of these priority areas. Our findings are largely consistent with previous work, highlighting that a widespread area needs to be assigned for conservation purposes. Thus, protection of the snake assemblage should take place both inside and outside the PNAs.

AB  - Accurate species distribution data across remote and extensive geographical areas are difficult to obtain. Here, we use bioclimatic envelope models to determine climatic constraints on the distribution of the migratory Saker FalconFalco cherrugto identify areas in data-deficient regions that may contain unidentified populations. Sakers live at low densities across large ranges in remote regions, making distribution status difficult to assess. Using presence-background data and eight bioclimatic variables within a species distribution modelling framework, we applied MaxEnt to construct models for both breeding and wintering ranges. Occurrence data were spatially filtered and climatic variables tested for multicollinearity before selecting best fit models using the Akaike information criterion by tuning MaxEnt parameters. Model predictive performance tested using the continuous Boyce index (B) was high for both breeding (B-TEST = 0.921) and wintering models (B-TEST = 0.735), with low omission rates and minimal overfitting. The Saker climatic niche was defined by precipitation in the warmest quarter in the breeding range model, and mean temperature in the wettest quarter in the wintering range model. Our models accurately predicted areas of highest climate suitability and defined the climatic constraints on a wide-ranging rare species, suggesting that climate is a key determinant of Saker distribution across macro-scales. We recommend targeted population surveys for the Saker based on model predictions to areas of highest climatic suitability in key regions with distribution knowledge gaps, in particular the Qinghai-Tibet plateau in western China. Further applications of our models could identify protected areas and reintroduction sites, inform development conflicts, and assess the impact of climate change on distributions.

AB  - Conservation planning and population assessment for widely-distributed, but vulnerable, arboreal folivore species demands cost-effective mapping of habitat suitability over large areas. This study tested whether multispectral data from WorldView-3 could be used to estimate and map foliar digestible nitrogen (DigN), a nutritional measure superior to total nitrogen for tannin-rich foliage for the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). We acquired two WorldView-3 images (November 2015) and collected leaf samples from Eucalyptus woodlands in semi-arid eastern Australia. Linear regression indicated the normalized difference index using bands "Coastal" and "NIR1" best estimated DigN concentration (% dry matter, R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.19%). Foliar DigN concentration was mapped for multi-species Eucalyptus open woodlands across two landscapes using this index. This mapping method was tested on a WorldView-2 image (October 2012) with associated koala tracking data (August 2010 to November 2011) from a different landscape of the study region. Quantile regression showed significant positive relationship between estimated DigN and occurrence of koalas at 0.999 quantile (R-2 = 0.63). This study reports the first attempt to use a multispectral satellite-derived spectral index for mapping foliar DigN at a landscape-scale (100s km(2)). The mapping method can potentially be incorporated in mapping and monitoring koala habitat suitability for conservation management.

AB  - Accurate data describing the geographic distribution of specific species form the basis for effective conservation management policies. However, for most species the freely available distributional information is usually confined to either expert maps or purely theoretical maps constructed by using a variety of modeling frameworks. These maps usually do not provide enough resolution for conservation applications or do not accurately describe the current distribution status. In this study, we constructed a novel workflow designed to integrate data from various species distribution models and expert knowledge into a single unified modeling process. Under this workflow, we systematically constructed current distribution maps for a selection of terrestrial vertebrates found across Taiwan.
   We used species distribution modeling as the base and then aggregated multiple open datasets describing species occurrence and environmental factors as data sources. Thereafter, we estimated the primary broad-scale and high spatial resolution species range maps using the MaxEnt modeling algorithm, and then consulted experts on each taxa to refine these maps.
   This dataset provides up-to-date species distribution maps for 379 terrestrial vertebrates in Taiwan, with members from across four taxa (27 amphibians, 52 reptiles, 264 birds, and 36 mammals). This dataset helps to fill the spatial knowledge gaps for conservation concerns and improves our understanding of the geographic distribution of more than half (61%) of the vertebrate species of Taiwan. Furthermore, by stacking the range maps of multiple species, we can identify vertebrate diversity hotspots and identify priority areas for conservation. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Continental- and regional-scale assessments of gaps in protected area networks typically use relatively coarse range maps for well documented species groups, creating uncertainty about the fate of unexamined biodiversity and providing insufficient guidance for land managers. By building habitat suitability models for a taxonomically diverse group of 2216 imperiled plants and animals, we revealed comprehensive and detailed protection opportunities in the conterminous United States. Summing protection-weighted range-size rarity (PWRSR, the product of the percent of modeled habitat outside of protected areas and the inverse of modeled habitat extent) uncovered novel patterns of biodiversity importance. Concentrations of unprotected imperiled species in places such as the northern Sierra Nevada, central and northern Arizona, the Rocky Mountains of Utah and Colorado, southeastern Texas, southwestern Arkansas, and Florida's Lake Wales Ridge have rarely if ever been featured in continental- and regional-scale analyses. Inclusion of diverse taxa (vertebrates, freshwater mussels, crayfishes, bumble bees, butterflies, skippers, and vascular plants) partially drove these new patterns. When analyses were restricted to groups typically included in previous studies (birds, mammals, and amphibians), up to 53% of imperiled species in other groups were left out. The finer resolution of modeled inputs (990 m) also resulted in a more geographically dispersed pattern. For example, 90% of the human population of the conterminous United States lives within 50 km of modeled habitat for one or more species with high PWRSR scores. Over one-half of the habitat for 818 species occurs within federally lands managed for biodiversity protection; an additional 360 species have over one-half of their modeled habitat on federal multiple use land. Freshwater animals occur in places with poorer landscape condition but with less exposure to climate change than other groups, suggesting that habitat restoration is an important conservation strategy for these species. The results provide fine-scale, taxonomically diverse inputs for local and regional priority-setting and show that although protection efforts are still widely needed on private lands, notable gains can be achieved by increasing protection status on selected federal lands.

AB  - Aim To assess the effectiveness of protected areas in two catchment scales (local and network) in conserving regionally common fluvial fishes using modelled species distributions. Location Conterminous United States. Methods A total of 150 species were selected that were geographically widespread, abundant, non-habitat specialists and native within nine large ecoregions. Species distribution models were developed using boosted regression trees, and modelled distributions were assessed for protection status under two alternatives: lands strictly managed for biodiversity (Highly Restricted Use) and those allowing multiple uses (Multiple Use), with protection target levels (i.e., the amount of protected area required for protection) for local and network catchments being developed from ecoregion-based urban and agricultural land use thresholds from fish responses. Results Overall, less than 2% of fluvial catchments in the conterminous USA are meeting both local and network catchment protection target levels under the Highly Restricted Use alternative, whereas 16% of catchments met protection levels for the Multiple Use alternative, with protection largely concentrated in the western USA. For common native species distributions within ecoregions, only one species had >10% of streams meeting combined local and network catchment protection target levels under the Highly Restricted Use alternative, whereas 50 distributions (similar to 14% of species distribution models) met this level under the Multiple Use alternative. Main conclusions Even for fishes considered widespread and abundant, protection levels are lacking, particularly when considering only lands that are actively managed for biodiversity. Given the increasing intensification of anthropogenic activities and substantial uncertainty associated with climate change, considering the conservation status for all species, including those currently considered common, is warranted.

AB  - Conservation biogeography involves the application of biogeographical principles, theories, and analyses to problems regarding biodiversity conservation. The field was formally defined in 2005, and considerable research has been conducted in the ensuing 5 years.
   This editorial sets the context for 16 contributions in a special issue of Diversity and Distributions on developments and challenges in conservation biogeography. Papers are grouped into the following main themes: species distribution modelling; data requirements; approaches for assigning conservation priorities; approaches for integrating information from numerous disparate sources; special challenges involving invasive species; and the crucial issue of determining how elements of biodiversity are likely to respond to rapid climate change. One paper provides a synthesis of requirements for a robust conservation biogeography for freshwater ecosystems.
   Conservation biogeography is well poised to make a significant contribution to the process of providing policy makers with objectively formulated scenarios and options for the effective management of biodiversity. The editorial, and the papers in the special issue, deliberate on many of the exciting developments in play in the field, and the many complex challenges that lie ahead.

AB  - Bottom-contact fisheries present risks to vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) such as deep-water coral and sponge communities. Managing these risks requires better knowledge about VME spatial distribution within fishing areas. In this paper, we develop predictive species distribution models for alcyonacean (Order Alcyonacea) corals at SGaan Kinghlas-Bowie Seamount (SK-B) in British Columbia, Canada, based on direct presence/absence observations obtained from deep-water cameras attached to commercial fishing gear. We obtained in situ presence/absence observations of deep-water corals (Order Alcyonacea, Order Antipatharia, Order Pennatulacea, Family Stylasteridae) and sponges (Class Hexactinellida, Class Demospongiae) at 124 locations during commercial fishing trips at the SK-B marine protected area. We developed species distribution models for alcyonacean corals at SK-B and compared the performance of models using 4 different estimators of trap landing position (surface drop position and 3 Bayesian estimators) to account for spatial uncertainty in observation locations. We found that the different estimators for landing position affected variable selection, model performance, and model predictions. The best-fitting models using the 4 different landing position estimators had mean AUC values ranging from 0.71 to 0.78 and maximum kappa values ranging from 0.36 to 0.47. This study demonstrates how collaborative research surveys with commercial fisheries can provide fine-scale spatial data for coral and sponge habitat mapping using an approach that is scalable for benthic habitat risk assessment for large, possibly remote, areas where fisheries operate.

AB  - Vulture populations are in severe decline across Africa and prioritization of geographic areas for their conservation is urgently needed. To do so, we compiled three independent datasets on vulture occurrence from road-surveys, GPS-tracking, and citizen science (eBird), and used maximum entropy to build ensemble species distribution models (SDMs). We then identified spatial vulture conservation priorities in Ethiopia, a stronghold for vultures in Africa, while accounting for uncertainty in our predictions. We were able to build robust distribution models for five vulture species across the entirety of Ethiopia, including three Critically Endangered, one Endangered, and one Near Threatened species. We show that priorities occur in the highlands of Ethiopia, which provide particularly important habitat for Bearded Gypaetus barbatus, Hooded Necrosyrtes monachus, Ruppell's Gyps ruppelli and White-backed Gyps africanus Vultures, as well as the lowlands of north-eastern Ethiopia, which are particularly valuable for the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus. One-third of the core distribution of the Egyptian Vulture was protected, followed by the White-backed Vulture at one-sixth, and all other species at one-tenth. Overall, only about one-fifth of vulture priority areas were protected. Given that there is limited protection of priority areas and that vultures range widely, we argue that measures of broad spatial and legislative scope will be necessary to address drivers of vulture declines, including poisoning, energy infrastructure, and climate change, while considering the local social context and aiding sustainable development.

AB  - Development of roads through protected areas can have deleterious effects on natural habitats containing species of conservation concern. During the past decades road construction has affected many former remote areas and led to fragmentation and isolation of wildlife populations. The present study focuses on the ecological impacts of Isfahan's West Freeway, which passes through Ghamishloo Wildlife Refuge; an IUCN category IV protected area, in Isfahan Province. The two key affected species, both classified as vulnerable by IUCN, the goitered gazelle (Gazelle subgutturosa subgutturosa) and the wild sheep (Ovis orientalis isphahanica) were subject to impact analyses. We used habitat evaluation procedure (HEP) as a habitat-based impact assessment methodology which considers habitat quality and quantity. Habitat quality was measured as habitat suitability index (HSI) for each species. By literature review and field observations, five variables defining habitat suitability were identified and suitability maps for both species generated. Habitat units (HUs) were derived from multiplying the HSI for each species by the habitat area before and after freeway construction. The results showed that due to the construction of the freeway, about 14% of the HUs for goitered gazelle and about 9% of the HUs for wild sheep were lost. In addition, for quantifying landscape pattern change due to freeway construction, various landscape metrics were calculated for the species distribution polygons for two times before and after freeway construction. Results obtained through quantifying landscape metrics showed that mean nearest neighbor (MNN) and number of patches (NP) metrics increased. On the other hand, CONTAG metric decreased in both goitered gazelle and wild sheep distribution polygons, demonstrating the negative effect of freeway on these species distribution polygons integrity. According to the results of this study, mitigation and compensation activities should be considered in Ghamishloo Wildlife Refuge. Our study demonstrated that HEP method combined with quantifying landscape metrics might provide a powerful tool for assessing ecological impact of technical infrastructures on populations of far-ranging species of conservation concern.

AB  - MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) modelling method is probably the most popular technique to model species distributions based only on the presence records across broad spatial scales. Although it is widely used, there is much controversy about the transferability of models between different geographical areas. Transferability might be more questionable when it comes to predict the distribution of peripheral populations at the margin of the species geographical range, where they may be affected by and adapted to environmental conditions different from those of core populations. To explore transferability of MaxEnt models among sectors of the geographic range, we selected three butterfly species with wide distributions and peripheral populations at their southernmost margin in the Iberian Peninsula, namely Plebejus argus, Cyaniris semiargus and Pyronia tithonus.
   Using data from the Atlas of the butterflies of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands as well as both climate and land use data, we modelled their potential distribution ranges in Spain. In addition, we also independently modelled their distributions separately in three concentric sectors of their range. We then investigated the transferability of the models between sectors and the effect of varying the regularization parameter.
   Our results show that when developing species distribution models the quality of occurrence data should be carefully checked, paying special attention to both their number and spatial distribution and avoiding possible significant biases.
   The transferability of the models tends to decrease when data from increasingly distant sectors are used as test data. More precisely, and independently of the regularization parameter value, models built using occurrence data either from the core or the intermediate sectors failed to adequately predict the distribution of the three butterfly species in the peripheral sector, especially in Donana National Park.

AB  - Despite substantial conservation efforts, biodiversity continues to decline and further conservation action is needed. This imposes significant opportunity cost on local communities, particularly in developing countries where livelihood depends strictly on land use and agricultural activities. Incorporating socio-economic data into methods for the identification of conservation priorities can reduce conflicts between socio-economic development and biodiversity conservation. We present a systematic selection of priority sites for the conservation of 353 Ugandan mammals and amphibians. We used the suitable habitat as an estimate of the area potentially occupied by each species inside its geographic range, and estimated the opportunity cost based on data on agricultural profit. We used the software Marxan to identify the sites that need to be added to the existing protected areas (IUCN categories I-IV) to conserve Ugandan mammals and amphibians at a minimum cost. In addition to the existing protected areas, covering ca. 17,100 km(2), ca. 57,500 km(2) of land should be protected to achieve the conservation target for amphibians and mammals, bringing the coverage to ca. 38% of the country. The sites that are irreplaceable for the target achievement occupy ca. 32,800 km(2), are mostly located in the Western and Eastern regions and overlap with the Eastern Afromontane hotspot and the Albertine Rift. The yearly agricultural profit from these sites amounts to ca. 540,700,000 US$, or 16,524 US$/km(2) (2008 value).

AB  - The study intended to describe the alpine vegetation of a protected area of the northwestern Himalaya and identify the important environmental variables responsible for species distribution. We placed random plots covering different habitats and altitude to record species composition and environmental variables. Vegetation was classified using hierarchical cluster analysis and vegetation-environment relationships were evaluated with Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Four communities, each in alpine shrub and meadows were delineated and well justified in the ordination plots. Indicator species for the different communities were identified. Maximum species richness and diversity were found in community IV among shrub communities and community II among the meadows. Studied environmental variables explained 61.5% variation in shrub vegetation and 59.8% variation in meadows. Soil variables explained higher variability (similar to 35%) than spatial variables (similar to 21%) in both shrubs and meadows. Altitude, among the spatial variables and carbon/nitrogen ratio and nitrogen among the soil variables explained maximum variation. About 40% variations left unexplained. Latitude and species diversity among the other variables had significant correlation with ordination axes. Study showed that altitude and C/N ratio played a significant role in species composition. Extensive sampling efforts and inclusion of other non-studied variables are also suggested for better understanding.

AB  - This study aims to map the spatial distribution of Atlantic cloud forest and assess its protection status in the Serra da Mantiqueira, southeastern Brazil, using a combination of predictive distribution modelling and remote sensing techniques. The potential distribution of cloud forests in the Serra da Mantiqueira was predicted using a combination of three algorithms for different environmental variables, including climatic, hydrometeorological, a topographic variable and a fog-related variable. After estimating the potential cloud forest distribution, remote sensing mapping techniques were used to approximate actual cloud forest area. Four land-use classes were distinguished: cloud forest, plantation forest, a 'high-altitude complex', and 'other covers'. Actual mapped cloud forest areas were compared with locations of existing protected areas to assess the status of regional cloud forest protection. Predicted cloud forest distribution was excellent, with conditions above 1500 m.a.s.l. generally the most suitable for cloud forest occurrence. Actual cloud forest occurrence mapped with remote sensing imagery was 52% of the predicted potential area with differences likely due to past forest loss and the presence of nonforest ('high-altitude complex') vegetation. Much of the mapped cloud forest area is under nominal protection, with most areas falling into the 'Protected Area with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources' category. The combined use of predictive distribution modelling and remotely sensed observations successfully mapped cloud forest extent in the study area. The results reinforce the need to assign high conservation priority to the Serra da Mantiqueira as a whole and to create a core area with full protection status.

AB  - Climate change has started impacting species, ecosystems, genetic diversity within species, and ecological interactions and is thus a serious threat to conserving biodiversity globally. In the absence of adequate adaptation measures, biodiversity may continue to decline, and many species will possibly become extinct. Given that global temperature continues to increase, climate change adaptation has emerged as an overarching framework for conservation planning. We identified both ongoing and probable climate change adaptation actions for greater one-horned rhinoceros conservation in Nepal through a combination of literature review, key informant surveys (n = 53), focus group discussions (n = 37) and expert consultation (n = 9), and prioritised the identified adaptation actions through stakeholder consultation (n = 17). The majority of key informants (>80%) reported that climate change has been impacting rhinoceros, and more than 65% of them believe that rhinoceros habitat suitability in Nepal has been shifting westwards. Despite these perceived risks, climate change impacts have not been incorporated well into formal conservation planning for rhinoceros. Out of 20 identified adaptation actions under nine adaptation strategies, identifying and protecting climate refugia, restoring the existing habitats through wetland and grassland management, creating artificial highlands in floodplains to provide rhinoceros with refuge during severe floods, and translocating them to other suitable habitats received higher priority. These adaptation actions may contribute to reducing the vulnerability of rhinoceros to the likely impacts of climate change. This study is the first of its kind in Nepal and is expected to provide a guideline to align ongoing conservation measures into climate change adaptation planning for rhinoceros. Further, we emphasise the need to integrating likely climate change impacts while planning for rhinoceros conservation and initiating experimental research and monitoring programs to better inform adaptation planning in the future.

AB  - Aim The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is an endangered cetacean found throughout Southeast Asia. The main threat to this species is human encroachment, led by entanglement in fishing gear. Information on this data-poor species' ecology and habitat use is needed to effectively inform spatial management.
   Location We investigated the habitat of a previously unstudied group of Irrawaddy dolphins in the eastern Gulf of Thailand, between the villages of Laem Klat and Khlong Yai, in Trat Province. This location is important as government groups plan to establish a marine protected area.
   Methods We carried out boat-based visual line transect surveys with concurrent oceanographic measurements and used hurdle models to evaluate this species' patterns of habitat use in this area.
   Results Depth most strongly predicted dolphin presence, while temperature was a strong predictor of group size. The highest probability of dolphin presence occurred at around 10.0 m with an optimal depth range of 7.50 to 13.05 m. The greatest number of dolphins was predicted at 24.93 degrees C with an optimal range between 24.93 and 25.31 degrees C. Dolphins are most likely to occur in two primary locations, one large region in the center of the study area (11(o)54 ' 18 '' N to 11(o)59 ' 23 '' N) and a smaller region in the south (11(o)47 ' 28 '' N to 11(o)49 ' 59 '' N). Protections for this population will likely have the greatest chance of success in these two areas.
   Main Conclusions The results of this work can inform management strategies within the immediate study area by highlighting areas of high habitat use that should be considered for marine spatial planning measures, such as the creation of marine protected areas. Species distribution models for this species in Thailand can also assist conservation planning in other parts of the species' range by expanding our understanding of habitat preferences.

AB  - Range maps provide important information in species conservation management, specially in the case of rare species of conservation interest. For the vast majority of cases, this information can only be estimated by means of species distribution modelling. When absence data is unavailable, modelled distribution maps represent the spatial variation of the degree of suitability for the species rather than their realised distribution. Although discerning potentially suitable areas for a given species is an important asset in conservation, it is necessary to estimate current distributions in order to preserve current populations. This work explores the use of species distribution modelling (Maxent) for species of conservation interest when their Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is well-known and there is quality occurrence data. In this case, derived binary maps of potentially suitable areas can be obtained and used to assess the conservation and protection status of a given species in combination with the EOO and existing protected area networks. Seven species, which are rare and endemic to the Western Mediterranean, have been used as an example. Valuable information for conservation assessment such as potentially suitable areas, EOO, Areas of Occupancy (AOO) and degree of protection is provided for this set of species. In addition, the existing informal view that among experts these species have range sizes much smaller than their potentially suitable area is confirmed. This could probably be attributed to important but currently unknown predictor variables and to historical phylogeographic factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated the applicability of biometric habitat modeling to rare plant inventory and conservation by developing and field testing a geographically explicit model for Cardamine clematitis Shuttleworth ex A. Gray (mountain bittercress), an endemic plant of the southern Blue Ridge Mountains, USA. For each of 187 confirmed coordinates for C. clematitis in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 13 habitat variables were measured with a geographic information system. These data were used to calculate Mahalanobis distances for each 30-m x 30-m pixel within the study area; small values of Mahalanobis distance represented site conditions similar to those of known locations of C. clematitis, whereas larger distance values represented dissimilar conditions. Following model development, we tested model performance by sampling 120 randomly distributed plots for C. clematitis presence. Logistic regression showed that Mahalanobis distance values were strongly related to C. clematitis occurrence (P = 0.039). Overall, 75% of all known occurrences of C clematitis had associated Mahalanobis distance values below 17.7, and 95% of all occurrences were below 33.8; the median Mahalanobis distance value for the study area as a whole was 40.0. A habitat suitability cutoff value was defined which identified roughly 23,640 ha (19.5% of the study area) as suitable habitat. Although the model successfully predicted species absence in test plots with high Mahalanobis distance values, many sites with low values did not contain C. clematitis. Only 16.2% of test plots below the habitat suitability cutoff contained C. clematitis. The absence of C. clematitis from sites with low Mahalanobis distance values (low specificity) is not necessarily indicative of a poor model; metapopulation processes (e.g., recolonizations, local extinctions) have been shown to play a major role in presence or absence of many plant species. That may be partially the case with our model as evidenced by a relationship between C. clematitis presence and habitat patch size.

AB  - Modeling species distributions over space and time is one of the major research topics in both ecology and conservation biology. Joint Species Distribution models (JSDMs) have recently been introduced as a tool to better model community data, by inferring a residual covariance matrix between species, after accounting for species' response to the environment. However, these models are computationally demanding, even when latent factors, a common tool for dimension reduction, are used. To address this issue, Taylor-Rodriguez et al. (2017) proposed to use a Dirichlet process, a Bayesian nonparametric prior, to further reduce model dimension by clustering species in the residual covariance matrix. Here, we built on this approach to include a prior knowledge on the potential number of clusters, and instead used a Pitman-Yor process to address some critical limitations of the Dirichlet process. We therefore propose a framework that includes prior knowledge in the residual covariance matrix, providing a tool to analyze clusters of species that share the same residual associations with respect to other species. We applied our methodology to a case study of plant communities in a protected area of the French Alps (the Bauges Regional Park), and demonstrated that our extensions improve dimension reduction and reveal additional information from the residual covariance matrix, notably showing how the estimated clusters are compatible with plant traits, endorsing their importance in shaping communities.

AB  - Ujung Kulon National Park (UKNP) is a protected area and also the sole habitat for Javan rhino. In UKNP, Peninsula and Mount Honje area have unique geomorphic characteristics. Distribution of the Javan rhino is found in Ujung Kulon Peninsula only. Therefore, this study aims to produce a potential habitat suitability model and to understand the contribution of each habitat variable to the presence of Javan rhinos in the extended area outside the Ujung Kulon Peninsula. The method used in this research is field observation of the rhino's signs and monitoring through camera traps deployed in those two areas. The presence of Javan rhino in 2017-2018 is monitored. Five variables of habitat fitness are used to produce a spatial habitat suitability model of Javan rhino. Those variables were slope, flow accumulation, potential forage, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and distance from the stream. Remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis are used to prepare all variables and produce the model. The habitat suitability model is produced by using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) software. This model produced a potential habitat suitability map of Javan rhino with mapping accuracy AUC value is 0.695, that is fair performance. The results from this study are the prediction of habitat suitability is 29,1738.05 hectares (60.66%) inside the national park. The suitable area dominated in Ujung Kulon Peninsula and fragmented in Mount Honje, due to the slope factor and followed with potential forage availability. The model shows the highest to the lowest percent contribution variables i.e. slope, potential forage, NDVI, distance from the stream, and flow accumulation. Javan rhino preferred lowland than highland areas, also inhabits in area rumpangs and shurbs because of highly potential forage availability. This model can be used to provide a baseline map and recommendation for the next monitoring design for updating the distribution of Javan rhinos in potential extended habitat within the Ujung Kulon National Park. Prediction of the potential habitat is essential in managing conservation area and also an effort to maintain the existence of Javan rhino.

AB  - In the Iberian Peninsula, Oak Decline (hereafter, OD) is becoming a serious and frequently occurring disease in Mediterranean oaks. Decline processes seem to involve multiple biotic and abiotic factors, which combine to reduce the vigour of oak trees often causing death. However, the exact causes of its extension are still unknown and therefore, given the ecological, economic and social relevance of these trees in Mediterranean countries it is crucial to develop tools that allow us to anticipate its occurrence and to reduce its expansion. In this sense, the present work aims to (i) unravel the relative role of environmental factors on the distribution of one of the most important phenomena that threat the biodiversity of the Iberian oaks, and (ii) to produce a spatially explicit model of OD risk, to assist conservation managers dealing with this phenomenon. To this, we have used a dataset of OD foci gathered during the period 2015-2017 by the program "Methodology for the inventory and monitoring of oak masses affected by the decline of oak in the southwest of Castilla y Leon" (this region is beginning to suffer the damages of this disease). In total, 68 locations were used to assess relationships with environmental factors (topographic conditions, abiotic stress conditions and human influence) using maximum entropy models (hereafter, MaxEnt) and variance-partitioning. OD distribution seems to be principally influenced by land-use (mainly dehesas), followed by dryer areas and areas with low slope gradients facing south or southeast. The resulting model has been used to produce a detailed OD risk map in central-western Spain. Our modelling approach may contribute to inform conservation planning and to establish the adequate management policy for Iberian oak dehesas, by helping to identify regions where the risk of OD is high.

AB  - Accurately demarcating distributions of biological taxa has long been at the core of ecology. Yet our understanding of the factors defining species range limits is incomplete, especially for tropical species in the Global South. Human-driven threats to the survival of many taxa are increasing, particularly habitat loss and climate change. Identifying distributional range limits of at-risk and data-limited species using Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can thus inform spatial conservation planning to mitigate these threats. The Madagascar Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus radama is the resident sub-species of the Peregrine Falcon complex distributed across Madagascar, Mayotte, and the Comoros Islands. There are currently significant knowledge gaps regarding its distribution, habitat preferences, and population size. Here, we use penalized logistic regression and environmental ordination to identify Madagascar Peregrine Falcon habitat in both geographic and environmental space and propose a population size estimate based on inferred habitat. From the penalized logistic regression model, the core habitat area of the Madagascar Peregrine Falcon extends across the central and northern upland plateau of Madagascar with patchier habitat across coastal and low-elevation areas. Range-wide habitat use in both geographic and environmental space indicated positive associations with high elevation and aridity, coupled with high vegetation heterogeneity and >95% herbaceous landcover, but general avoidance of areas >30% cultivated land and >10% mosaic forest. Based on inferred high-class habitat from the penalized logistic regression model, we estimate this habitat area could potentially support a population size ranging between 150 and 300 pairs. Following IUCN Red List guidelines, this subspecies would be classed as 'Vulnerable' due to its small population size. Despite its potentially large range, the Madagascar Peregrine Falcon has specialised habitat requirements and would benefit from targeted conservation measures based on spatial models to maintain viable populations.

AB  - This study described the floristic-structural variations between edges consisting of one bordering the road and the other by the forest stands with the interior of the forest. The effects of the relationships between environmental aspects in the Atlantic Forest remnant in Brazil was also studied. The structure of the vegetation stratum differed between the edges with the interior and the relationship between the distribution of species with the environmental variables reflected the changes which occurred in the edges towards the interior. For vegetation sampling, 36 plots were established over an area of 0.9 ha and were distributed on both edges and inside the remnant. All individuals with diameter at breast height of >= 2.5 cm were measured and identified. The results revealed the differences in the structure and composition of species distribution pattern in the remnant were influenced by environmental variables such as humidity, resistance to penetration, cation exchange capacity and sodium and potassium contents. These results reinforced the need to create conservation strategies to minimise forest degradation and loss of biodiversity in these forest ecosystems.

AB  - Coastal and marine ecosystems characterized by foundation species, such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and mangrove forests, are rich in biodiversity and support a range of ecosystem services including coastal protection, food provisioning, water filtration, carbon sequestration, recreational opportunities, cultural value, among others. These ecosystems have experienced degradation and a net loss of total area in regions around the world due to a host of anthropogenic stressors, resulting in declines in the associated ecosystem services they provide. Because of the extensive degradation in many locations, increasing attention has turned to ecosystem restoration of these marine habitats. Restoration techniques for marine and coastal ecosystems are generally more expensive when compared to terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting locations that will provide the largest return on investment, not only for the probability and magnitude of restoration success, but also for ecosystem service outcomes. However, site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration receive relatively lithe attention in the scientific literature, suggesting a need to better study how spatial planning tools could be incorporated into restoration practice. To the degree that site selection has been formally evaluated in the literature, the criteria have tended to focus more on environmental conditions beneficial for the restored habitat, and less on ecosystem service outcomes once the habitat is restored, which may vary considerably from site to site, or with more complex landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of connectivity. Here we (1) review recent (2015-2019) scientific peer-reviewed literature for several marine ecosystems (seagrass beds, salt marshes, and mangrove forests) to investigate how commonly site selection or spatial planning principles are applied or investigated in scholarly research about marine ecosystem restoration at different spatial scales, (2) provide a conceptual overview of the rationale for applying spatial planning principles to marine ecosystem restoration, and (3) highlight promising analytical approaches from the marine spatial planning and conservation planning literatures that could help improve restoration outcomes. We argue that strategic site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration, particularly applied at larger spatial scales and accounting for ecosystem service outcomes, can help support more effective restoration.

AB  - Biodiversity maps are an important component of ecosystem-based management and conservation. In the past, biodiversity maps were largely generated using patchy occurrence data from a range of data sources. Currently, substantial species occurrence data are readily available for large parts of the world and are accessible programmatically. Considering both the observed and expected changes in species distributions, and hence biodiversity, in response to present and future climate change, it is important to utilise readily available species occurrence databases to generate temporal and spatial biodiversity maps. In this study biodiversity maps were generated for three generic functional groups within the exclusive economic zone of South Africa: zooplankton, fishes and benthos. This was achieved by stacking individual species-distribution maps. Freely available occurrence data from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) were accessed for this purpose. Ensemble species-distribution modelling, employing five widely used statistical methods, was used to generate species-distribution maps for each functional group. The resulting spatial patterns of biodiversity for the three functional groups were largely in agreement with known patterns. The results of this study highlight the value of open-source occurrence and environmental data to generate biodiversity maps that can potentially be used in future spatial prioritisation or planning for management of marine areas and in environmental-change studies.

AB  - P>1. The juvenile stages of fish are often dependent on specific habitat types for their survival. Protecting these habitats may be crucial for maintaining strong adult stocks. The Natura 2000 network of the European Union offers protection of marine habitats that are essential for the recruitment of many fish species. By protecting these critical habitats the network may be important for maintaining the stocks of these fish species.
   2. We present a spatially explicit, GIS-based, assessment of two important components of the ecological coherence of Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks: representativity and connectivity. Representativity can be measured as the proportion of each conservation feature that is protected, whereas connectivity assesses the spatial configuration of the network. We apply these analyses to study the ecological coherence of the Natura 2000 network in a 30 000-km2 archipelago in the Baltic Sea, with respect to a coastal fish assemblage and associated habitats. The analyses are based on fish distribution maps that have been constructed by statistically relating life stage specific occurrence to environmental variables, and thereafter making spatial predictions based on maps of the environmental variables.
   3. The map-based analyses show that both the representativity and the connectivity of the network are poor with respect to the studied fish species. In total, 3 center dot 5% (11 km2) of the assemblage recruitment habitat was protected and 48% of the potentially connected habitats were included in the MPA network.
   4. The assessment explicitly identified geographical areas, visually communicated using maps, where the network should be improved to ensure ecological coherence.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Many MPA networks around the world, such as the Natura 2000 network in Europe, have recently come into effect. Establishment of the networks has often been governed by opportunity rather than by strict ecological analyses, primarily because distribution maps of species and habitats have been unavailable. Map-based assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of evolving MPA networks, such as the one presented here, are needed in adaptive management. They can provide an efficient tool for visualising and communicating the results to stakeholders and policy makers in the process of working towards ecological coherence.

AB  - Habitat suitability maps are important tools for conservation planning and species investigations, but maps at resolutions that are biologically meaningful and useful for local-level decision-making are lacking for many species that use resources at fine scales. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) describes 3-dimensional structure of forests and other habitats at high resolution, which can improve habitat models for many species and facilitate investigations otherwise impossible with field data or other remote-sensing techniques. We used an information-theoretic approach and logistic regression to model habitat of red tree voles (Arborimus longicaudus) at multiple spatial scales with predictors derived from airborne LiDAR in southwestern Oregon. We developed a priori models to evaluate habitat associations and identify good models useful for high-resolution mapping of habitat suitability across a large spatial extent. Our best models that compared habitats around nest trees of red tree voles to available sites performed well (i.e., accuracy=0.83) on an independent test data set. We found fair performance in comparisons of habitat around nest trees to unused locations within areas previously identified as red tree vole habitat (i.e., accuracy=0.71). Red tree vole nests were often in the largest trees in the stand and away from forest edges. Both analyses suggested that fine- and broad-scale predictors are important for modeling habitat of red tree voles. Habitat suitability for red tree voles should be predicted effectively by LiDAR acquisitions even with low point densities because maps were robust to reductions in point densities as low as 1point/m(2). We found that LiDAR was effective for modeling habitat of red tree voles and expect it to improve performance of models for other species with similar habitat requirements.

AB  - Dhole (Cuon alpinus) is threatened with extinction across its range due to habitat loss and prey depletion. Despite this, no previous study has investigated the distribution and threat of the species at a regional scale. This lack of knowledge continues to impede conservation planning for the species. Here we modeled suitable habitat using presence-only camera trap data for dhole and dhole prey species in mainland Southeast Asia and assessed the threat level to dhole in this region using an expert-informed Bayesian Belief Network. We integrated prior information to identify dhole habitat strongholds that could support populations over the next 50 years. Our habitat suitability model identified forest cover and prey availability as the most influential factors affecting dhole occurrence. Similarly, our threat model predicted that forest loss and prey depletion were the greatest threats, followed by local hunting, non-timber forest product collection, and domestic dog incursion into the forest. These threats require proactive resource management, strong legal protection, and cross-sector collaboration. We predicted <20% of all remaining forest cover in our study area to be suitable for dhole. We then identified 17 patches of suitable forest area as potential strongholds. Among these patches, Western Forest Complex (Thailand) was identified as the region's only primary stronghold, while Taman Negara (Malaysia), and northeastern landscape (Cambodia) were identified as secondary strongholds. Although all 17 patches met our minimum size criteria (1667 km(2)), patches smaller than 3333 km(2) may require site management either by increasing the ecological carrying capacity (i.e., prey abundance) or maintaining forest extent. Our proposed interventions for dhole would also strengthen the conservation of other co-occurring species facing similar threats. Our threat assessment technique of species with scarce information is likely replicable with other endangered species.

AB  - Olympic mudminnow (Novumbra hubbsi) is the only endemic freshwater fish species in Washington State and is limited to south-western and northern coastal wetlands there. Population decline has led to its listing as state 'Sensitive', while recent genetic analysis has identified north coast populations as a sub-group of potential concern because of historical isolation and low level of occurrence. Substantial knowledge gaps about the species have made further assessment of conservation status difficult and hampered proactive conservation measures. This article describes a three-tiered approach to evaluate conservation status, comprising: (i) a set of high-priority research questions identified by experts and stakeholders to advance conservation knowledge; (ii) a habitat suitability model to identify environmental factors related to the presence and absence of the species; and (iii) synthesis of information from that suitability model and other research to evaluate status using IUCN Red List criteria. Together these components provide an initial research agenda to guide future management and monitoring. Evidence for an elevated conservation status of Olympic mudminnow across its entire range is mixed, with knowledge about changes in distribution and population over time lacking in many places. The case for enhanced conservation status is strongest for the genetically distinct populations along the northern coast, where suitable habitat is limited and populations highly disjointed. Development of a monitoring network that would detect changes in distribution and abundance of key populations is a central requirement for the conservation of the species, which is threatened by the effects of climate, land use change and invasive species. Involving stakeholders in conservation planning at early stages allows development of robust, practical research questions based on shared data and diverse expertise. This is particularly valuable where species knowledge is highly constrained. These elements produce confidence in implementing research and management actions that are more likely to gain wide acceptance and increase knowledge of conservation status and needs over time.

AB  - Protected areas function as a lifeboat that can preserve the origins and maintenance of biodiversity. We assessed the representativeness of biodiversity in existing protected areas in Japan using a distribution dataset and phylogenetic tree for 5565 Japanese vascular plant species. We first examined the overlap of species distribution with the existing protected areas and identified the minimum set representing all plant species. Second, we evaluated the relative importance of environmental variables in explaining the spatial arrangement of protected areas using a random forest model. Finally, we clarified how potential drivers of plant diversity were sufficiently captured within the protected areas network. Although the protected areas captured the majority of species, nearly half of the minimum set areas were selected from outside the existing protected areas. The locations of existing protected areas are mainly associated with geographical and socio-economic factors rather than key biodiversity features (including evolutionary distinctiveness). Moreover, critical biodiversity drivers, which include current climate, paleoclimatic stability, and geographical isolation, were biasedly emulated within the existing protected areas. These findings demonstrate that current conservation planning fails to represent the ecological and evolutionary processes relevant to species sorting, dispersal limitation, and allopatric speciation. In particular, under-representativeness of historically stable habitats that function as evolutionary hotspots or refugia in response to climate changes may pose a threat to the long-term persistence of Japan's endemic biota. This study provides a fundamental basis for developing prioritization measures to retain species assembly processes and in situ diversification along current climatic and geohistorical gradients.

AB  - The protection of migratory birds and their habitats is important to the ecological stability of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Currently protected areas (PAs) were designed in accordance with species distribution patterns under current climatic conditions, thus ignoring climate change will lead to a decrease in the protection efficiency of PAs. In this study, using the flagship species Grus nigricollis, as an example, we used the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to simulate the distributions and conservation status of G. nigricollis and optimized the existing PA boundaries . The results showed that (1) suitable habitat- for G. nigricollis accounts for 12.48% of the QTP area, and the PAs established under current climatic conditions cover 17.84% of this suitable habitat area; (2) future climate changes will influence the distribution and quality of G. nigricollis habitats, and the average protection efficiency of the current PAs in four climatic scenarios will decrease from 17.84% to 15.31%; and (3) through optimization, the efficiency of existing PAs can be increased by 0.75 times and reach 28.37%, indicating PA planning must consider not only current climate conditions but also the effects of climate changes. Our results aim to address shortcomings in the conservation efficiency of PAs and provide an example for resolving mismatched PA boundaries and habitat changes for species.

AB  - Little remains of the Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla F.Muell. ex Benth.) woodlands of Australia, primarily due to land clearing for grazing and agriculture. Many threatened species in this region are poorly studied, and the life history traits of some herbaceous species such as ephemeral shoot systems, mean that conservation assessments are difficult. Recent gas pipeline developments have led to an increased need to understand the ecology and genetics of such taxa, in order to advise offset and translocation activities. Xerothamnella herbacea R.Baker is an endangered ephemeral herbaceous species from the Brigalow Belt region, which dies back during prolonged dry conditions. The aim of this study was to map the extent of potentially suitable habitat of this species, including determination of population extent within existing protected area estate. The species population sizes, reproductive activity and evidence of clonal spread, as well as the levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding, across the species range were also assessed to provide guidance for potential translocation and offsetting programs. The genetic results were related to the species suitable habitat distribution to test whether historic or recent habitat fragmentation most explains genetic patterns in this species. Most of the populations of this species were found to be small with less than 100 plants. The species appears not to be limited by its reproductive output, suggesting other factors may limit its abundance. The species populations have moderate to low genetic diversity suggesting the species is genetically viable in the medium term but are inbred which may be partially due to vegetative spread. Geographic proximity does not predict genetic similarity of populations and diversity is not correlated with population size. The results indicate potential translocation or offsetting programs need to account for genetic relationships in their planning. Resprouting ability has potentially assisted the species to slow the pace of genetic diversity loss due to anthropogenic fragmentation.

AB  - The need to incorporate habitat dynamics into spatial conservation prioritization is increasingly recognized but often limited by the lack of available temporal data. To overcome this limitation, model-assisted monitoring has been advocated and developed over the last decade. However, predictive modelling often relies on static habitat features or interpolated climate data, failing to consider other relevant ecological processes such as primary productivity and its dynamics. The importance of primary productivity relies on its key role in determining the availability of food resources via trophic cascades. This study aims to assess how the spatiotemporal variation in the habitat quality for top predators (using raptors as case study) can be affected by temporal fluctuations in primary productivity, and whether its incorporation into habitat modelling improves predictions in space and time. Through model predictions we then incorporate interannual habitat-quality dynamics into spatial conservation planning to identify priority areas for raptor conservation based on a new set of dynamic priority-area indices. Using raptor occurrence data from two surveys (2001 and 2014), we found high model performance and transferability for all species (AUC(2001) = 0.89 +/- 0.10 and Boyce's Index(2001) of 0.78 +/- 0.20; AUC(2014) = 0.89 +/- 0.12 and Boyce's Index(2014) of 0.87 +/- 0.06). Annual mean and minimum values of EVI (indicators of productivity and phenology, respectively) and elevation were the most important predictor variables for most raptor species. However, the standard deviation of EVI (an indicator of seasonality) was also found to be an important predictor for migratory species breeding in shrublands and croplands. Interannual model predictions showed a large interannual variation in habitat availability across species, partially associated with regional land-use changes. Interannual habitat-quality dynamics was translated into marked changes in the priority areas for raptor conservation -areas mostly associated with deciduous forest and water environments (rivers and dams) in our study area. Our results shed light on the role of intra- and interannual dynamics of primary productivity in driving habitat quality for top predators. They also confirm the potential of remotely sensed ecosystem functioning attributes to inform about habitat-quality dynamics in a cost-effective, standardized and repeatable way. Incorporating interannual dynamics of primary productivity in habitat modelling supports raptor conservation prioritization by informing about adequacy, stability and legacy of raptor conservation areas.

AB  - Advances in remotely sensed data for characterizing habitat have enabled development of spatially explicit predictive species distribution models (SDM) that can be essential tools for management. SDMs commonly use coarse-grain metrics, such as forest patch size or patch connectivity, over broad spatial extents. However, species distributions are likely driven in part by local, fine-grained habitat conditions. Conservation and management are often planned and applied locally, where coarse predictions may be uninformative or not sufficiently precise. We investigated the integration of high-resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) with avian point sampling data to develop a detection-corrected occupancy model to quantify habitat-occurrence relationships for two species with different habitats: the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) on a military installation in central Texas. We compared occupancy models that used only the more conventional, coarse remotely sensed metrics to models that also incorporated high-resolution LiDAR-derived metrics for vegetation height and canopy cover, to assess their use for predicting distributions. Models including LiDAR-derived vegetation height and canopy cover metrics were competitive for both species, and models without LiDAR-derived vegetation height had substantially lower model weights and explanatory strength. Area under curve estimates for the highest ranked models were high for warblers (0.864) and moderate for vireos (0.746). Using the best supported models for each species, we predicted the occurrence distribution for both species. The resulting predictions provide a decision support tool that enables assessment of the status, impacts, and mitigation of impacts to endangered species habitat on the installation due to land management and military training activities that is more standardized and accurate than current assessment approaches based on visual gestalt of habitat and expert opinion. Additionally, although previous species distribution models have been created for our focal species, most fail to match the grain and extent of most management actions or include local, fine-grained metrics that influence distributions. In contrast, we demonstrate that use of LiDAR with species occurrence data can provide precision and resolution at a scale that is relevant ecologically and to the operational scale of most conservation and management actions.

AB  - The stacking of species-distribution models (S-SDMs) is receiving attention by conservation researchers because this approach is capable of simultaneously predicting species richness and composition. However, the steps required to build S-SDMs implies at least two choices that influence its predictive performance which have not been extensively assessed: the selection of the modelling algorithm and the application of a threshold to transform the species-distribution models into binary maps to be added together to build the final S-SDM. Our goal was to provide guidelines concerning the best combinations of modelling algorithms and thresholds with which to build more accurate S-SDMs. We generated 380 S-SDMs of 1224 tree species in Mesoamerica by combining 19 distribution modelling methods with 20 different thresholds using presence-only data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. We compared the predicted richness and composition with inventory data obtained from the BIOTREE-NET forest plot database. We designed two indicators of predictive performance that were based on the diversity factors used to measure species turnover: a (shared species between the observed and predicted compositions), b and c (the exclusive species of the predicted and observed compositions respectively) and compared them with the Sorensen and Beta-Simpson turnover measures. Our proposed indexes and the Sorensen index proved suitable as indicators of predictive performance for S-SDMs, whereas the Beta-Simpson turnover measure presented issues that would prevent its application to evaluate S-SDMs. Some modelling methods especially machine learning and ensemble model forecasting methods performed significantly better than others in minimizing the error in predicted richness and composition. Our results also points out that restrictive thresholds (with high omission errors) lead to more accurate S-SDMs in terms of species richness and composition. Here, we demonstrate that particular combinations of modelling methods and thresholds provide results with higher predictive performance. These results provide clear modelling guidelines that will help S-SDM modellers to select the appropriate combination of modelling methods and thresholds to build more accurate S-SDMs, and therefore will have a positive impact on the quality of the diversity models used to assist conservation planning.

AB  - Phenology is a key feature in the description of species niches to capture seasonality in resource use and climate requirements. Species distribution models (SDMs) are widespread tools to evaluate a species' potential distribution and identify its large-scale habitat preferences. Despite its chief importance, data phenology is often neglected in SDM development. Non-migratory bats of temperate regions are good model species to test the effect of data seasonality on SDM outputs because of their different roosting preferences between hibernation and reproduction. We hypothesized that (1) the output of SDMs developed for six non-migratory European bat species will differ between hibernation and reproduction; (2) models built from datasets encompassing both ecological stages will perform better than seasonal models. We employed a dataset of 470 independent occurrences of bat hibernacula and 400 independent records of nursery roosts of selected species and for each species we developed separate winter, summer and mixed (i.e. generated from both winter and summer occurrences) models. Seasonal and mixed potential ranges differed from each other and the direction of this difference was species-specific. Mixed models outperformed seasonal models in representing species niches. Our work highlights the importance of considering data seasonality in the development of SDMs for bats as well as many other organisms, including non-migratory species, otherwise the analysis will lead to significant biases whose consequences for conservation planning and landscape management may be detrimental.

AB  - Habitat models are now broadly used in conservation planning on public lands. If implemented correctly, habitat modelling is a transparent and repeatable technique for describing and mapping biodiversity values, and its application in peri-urban and agricultural landscape planning is likely to expand rapidly. Conservation planning in such landscapes must be robust to the scrutiny that arises when biodiversity constraints are placed on developers and private landholders. A standardized modelling and model evaluation method based on widely accepted techniques will improve the robustness of conservation plans. We review current habitat modelling and model evaluation methods and provide a habitat modelling case study in the New South Wales central coast region that we hope will serve as a methodological template for conservation planners. We make recommendations on modelling methods that are appropriate when presence-absence and presence-only survey data are available and provide methodological details and a website with data and training material for modellers. Our aim is to provide practical guidelines that preserve methodological rigour and result in defendable habitat models and maps. The case study was undertaken in a rapidly developing area with substantial biodiversity values under urbanization pressure. Habitat maps for seven priority fauna species were developed using logistic regression models of species-habitat relationships and a bootstrapping methodology was used to evaluate model predictions. The modelled species were the koala, tiger quoll, squirrel glider, yellow-bellied glider, masked owl, powerful owl and sooty owl. Models ranked sites adequately in terms of habitat suitability and provided predictions of sufficient reliability for the purpose of identifying preliminary conservation priority areas. However, they are subject to multiple uncertainties and should not be viewed as a completely accurate representation of the distribution of species habitat. We recommend the use of model prediction in an adaptive framework whereby models are iteratively updated and refined as new data become available.

AB  - Continuing climate change may cause shifts in the adaptive ranges of plant species. But this impact is less understood for many species in the tropics. Here, we examined the distribution of the current and future potential suitable habitats of two native forest spices Piper capense and Aframomum corrorima. We have used MaxEnt software to predict the current and future suitable habitats of these species. Two future climate change scenarios, that is, middle (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP 4.5]) and extreme (RCP 8.5) scenarios for years 2050 and 2070, were used. A total of 60 and 74 occurrence data of P. capense and A. corrorima, respectively, and 22 environmental variables were included. The effects of elevation, solar radiation index (SRI) and topographic position index (TPI) on suitable habitats of these species were tested using linear model in R. Precipitation of the driest quarter, SRI and TPI significantly affect future suitable habitats of P. capense and A. corrorima. Furthermore, there are significant elevational shifts of suitable habitats for both species under future scenarios (P < 0.001). These novel suitable habitats are located in moist Afromontane and Combretum-Terminalia vegetations. Our results suggest that conservation planning for these species should consider climate change factors including assisted migration.

AB  - Identifying networks of sites that efficiently represent the biotic diversity of larger regions is a prerequisite for effective, conservation planning. Recent approaches for systematic conservation planning rely on the idea of complementarity, i.e., the selection of networks of sites that complement each other in their species composition. A major obstacle in applying these methods is the need for detailed data on species distribution, which is usually not available. In this study, we test the hypothesis that cluster analysis based on environmental variables (rainfall, temperature, and lithology) can be used to identify sets of complementary sites that efficiently represent regional species diversity. The performance of this approach (which we term environmental cluster analysis, ECA) is evaluated using an extensive database of the flora of Israel as a test case. Our results indicate that the ECA performed significantly better than a random null model in representing regional floristic diversity. Moreover, sites representing regions (clusters) defined by the ECA were more efficient in capturing the floristic diversity of Israel than sites representing the floristic regions of the area. In contrast to our expectation, the efficiency of the ECA was particularly pronounced in the analysis of rare species. The main mechanism behind the superiority of the ECA was its ability to identify sets of sites characterized by high turnover of species, rather than individually rich sites. The overall results suggest that ECA may serve as an important tool for the identification of complementary networks of conservation sites.

AB  - The high rate of amphibian endemism and the severe habitat modification in the Caribbean islands make them an ideal place to test if the current protected areas network might protect this group. In this study, we model distribution and map species richness of the 40 amphibian species from eastern Cuba with the objectives of identify hotspots, detect gaps in species representation in protected areas, and select additional areas to fill these gaps. We used two modeling methods, Maxent and Habitat Suitability Models, to reach a consensus distribution map for each species, then calculate species richness by combining specific models and finally performed gap analyses for species and hotspots. Our results showed that the models were robust enough to predict species distributions and that most of the amphibian hotspots were represented in reserves, but 50 percent of the species were incompletely covered and Eleutherodactylus rivularis was totally uncovered by the protected areas. We identified 1441 additional km(2) (9.9% of the study area) that could be added to the current protected areas, allowing the representation of every species and all hotspots. Our results are relevant for the conservation planning in other Caribbean islands, since studies like this could contribute to fill the gaps in the existing protected areas and to design a future network. Both cases would benefit from modeling amphibian species distribution using available data, even if they are incomplete, rather than relying only in the protection of known or suspected hotspots.

AB  - Determining the drivers, patterns and hotspots of biodiversity can be of critical importance in supporting regional conservation planning. However, as biodiversity hotspots can be described with several different metrics, it is important to investigate their congruence as well as the spatial overlap of hotspots with protected areas. Here, by using extensive data on climate, topography, soil characteristics and vascular plants combined with boosted regression tree models, we determine the patterns and key drivers of plant diversity hotspots along broad environmental gradients in northernmost Europe spanning from taiga landscapes to treeless tundra. We assess plant diversity with four metrics - species richness, range-rarity richness, threatened species richness, and local contribution to beta diversity - and examine their congruence with each other as well as with contemporary conservation areas.
   We found that climate plays an important role in governing species diversity, though topo-edaphic are highlighted alongside climatic predictors in determining the diversity patterns of many threatened, near threatened, and range-restricted species. Importantly, the different diversity metrics have contrasting drivers and, overall, their hotspots have low congruence. Furthermore, existing protected areas appear to offer limited coverage for hotspots of vascular plant diversity.
   Modelling the various facets of diversity and their drivers, such as the topo-edaphic setting, may provide useful information to help conserve diversity in a changing climate. Projected patterns of different aspects of diversity and their congruency can provide insights into the processes underlying biodiversity and be employed to assess the representativeness of protected area networks.

AB  - After their failure to achieve a significant reduction in the global rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, world governments adopted 20 new ambitious Aichi biodiversity targets to be met by 2020. Efforts to achieve one particular target can contribute to achieving others, but different targets may sometimes require conflicting solutions. Consequently, lack of strategic thinking might result, once again, in a failure to achieve global commitments to biodiversity conservation. We illustrate this dilemma by focusing on Aichi Target 11. This target requires an expansion of terrestrial protected area coverage, which could also contribute to reducing the loss of natural habitats (Target 5), reducing human-induced species decline and extinction (Target 12), and maintaining global carbon stocks (Target 15). We considered the potential impact of expanding protected areas to mitigate global deforestation and the consequences for the distribution of suitable habitat for >10,000 species of forest vertebrates (amphibians, birds, and mammals). We first identified places where deforestation might have the highest impact on remaining forests and then identified places where deforestation might have the highest impact on forest vertebrates (considering aggregate suitable habitat for species). Expanding protected areas toward locations with the highest deforestation rates (Target 5) or the highest potential loss of aggregate species' suitable habitat (Target 12) resulted in partially different protected area network configurations (overlapping with each other by about 73%). Moreover, the latter approach contributed to safeguarding about 30% more global carbon stocks than the former. Further investigation of synergies and trade-offs between targets would shed light on these and other complex interactions, such as the interaction between reducing overexploitation of natural resources (Targets 6, 7), controlling invasive alien species (Target 9), and preventing extinctions of native species (Target 12). Synergies between targets must be identified and secured soon and trade-offs must be minimized before the options for co-benefits are reduced by human pressures.

AB  - There are few quantitative predictions for the impacts of climate change on freshwater fish in Australia. We developed species distribution models (SDMs) linking historical fish distributions for 43 species from Victorian streams to a suite of hydro-climatic and catchment predictors, and applied these models to explore predicted range shifts under future climate-change scenarios. Here, we present summary results for the 43 species, together with a more detailed analysis for a subset of species with distinct distributions in relation to temperature and hydrology. Range shifts increased from the lower to upper climate-change scenarios, with most species predicted to undergo some degree of range shift. Changes in total occupancy ranged from -38% to +63% under the lower climate-change scenario to -47% to +182% under the upper climate-change scenario. We do, however, caution that range expansions are more putative than range contractions, because the effects of barriers, limited dispersal and potential life-history factors are likely to exclude some areas from being colonised. As well as potentially informing more mechanistic modelling approaches, quantitative predictions such as these should be seen as representing hypotheses to be tested and discussed, and should be valuable for informing long-term strategies to protect aquatic biota.

AB  - Over the past decades, global environmental changes have led to unfavorable effects on migratory birds. However, many species that encounter climate change are listed as least concern by International Union for Conservation of Nature. Using species distribution models, we quantified the redistributions of breeding and wintering sites of oriental honey buzzards, OHB (Pernis ptilorhynchus), a long-distance migratory raptor that often preys on the larvae of wasps and bees under changing climate based on shared socio-economic pathways scenarios. We also incorporated climate and land use risks based on climate anomalies and vegetation dynamics to assess future conservation strategies. The results revealed a significant range contraction on the wintering and breeding areas of the OHB species by 2050 and 2100. Our results suggest that the migration distance will likely increase under all scenarios. In addition, we found many high-risk areas across OHB habitats while refugia areas were relatively only covered a small proportion. Habitat restoration and developing new protected areas become a fundamental strategy for OHB conservation. Our approaches have provided comprehensive insights into broad biogeographic dynamics under multifaceted threats and how to tackle global changes through the specific landscape management for long-distance migrants.

AB  - Proactive forest conservation planning requires spatially accurate information about the potential distribution of tree species. The most cost-efficient way to obtain this information is habitat suitability modelling i.e. predicting the potential distribution of biota as a function of environmental factors. Here, we used the bootstrap-aggregating machine-learning ensemble classifier Random Forest (RF) to derive a 1-km resolution European forest formation suitability map. The statistical model use as inputs more than 6,000 field data forest inventory plots and a large set of environmental variables. The field data plots were classified into different forest formations using the forest category classification scheme of the European Environmental Agency. The ten most dominant forest categories excluding plantations were chosen for the analysis. Model results have an overall accuracy of 76%. Between categories scores were unbalanced and Mesophitic deciduous forests were found to be the least correctly classified forest category. The model's variable ranking scores are used to discuss relationship between forest category/environmental factors and to gain insight into the model's limits and strengths for map applicability. The European forest suitability map is now available for further applications in forest conservation and climate change issues.

AB  - Tossa (Corchorus olitorius L.) is a significant cash crop, cultivated commercially in the lower flood plain of Bangladesh. The climatic regimes in Bangladesh are changing as well as the world does. However, this species is threatened by climate change. Occurrences of data on threatened and endangered species are frequently sparse which makes it difficult to analyse the species suitable habitat distribution using various modelling approaches. The current paper used maximum entropy (Maxent) and educational global climate model (EdGCM) modelling to predict and conserve the suitable habitat distributions for Tossa species in Bangladesh to the year 2100. Nine environmental variables, 239 occurrence data and two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were used for the Maxent modelling to project the impact of climate change on the Tossa distributions. Furthermore, the EdGCM was used to study the climatic space suitability for the Tossa species in the context of Bangladesh. Both of the climatic scenarios were used for the prediction to the year 2100. The Maxent model performed better than random for the Tossa species with a high AUC value of 0.86. Under the RCP scenarios, the Maxent model predicted habitat reduction for RCP4.5 is 2%, RCP8.5 is 9% and EdGCM is 10.2% from the current localities. The predictive modelling approach presented here is promising and can be applied to other important species for conservation planning, monitoring and management, especially those under the threat of extinction due to climate change.

AB  - Beyond providing critical information to biologists, species distributions are useful for naturalists, curious citizens, and applied disciplines including conservation planning and medical intervention. Venomous snakes are one group that highlight the importance of having accurate information given their cosmopolitan distribution and medical significance. Envenomation by snakebite is considered a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization and venomous snake distributions are used to assess vulnerability to snakebite based on species occurrence and antivenom/healthcare accessibility. However, recent studies highlighted the need for updated fine-scale distributions of venomous snakes. Pitvipers (Viperidae: Crotalinae) are responsible for >98% of snakebites in the New World. Therefore, to begin to address the need for updated fine-scale distributions, we created VenomMaps, a database and web application containing updated distribution maps and species distribution models for all species of New World pitvipers. With these distributions, biologists can better understand the biogeography and conservation status of this group, researchers can better assess vulnerability to snakebite, and medical professionals can easily discern species found in their area.T

AB  - Grassland birds are among the most globally threatened bird groups due to substantial degradation of native grassland habitats. However, the current network of grassland conservation areas may not be adequate for halting population declines and biodiversity loss. Here, we evaluate a network of grassland conservation areas within Wisconsin, U.S.A., that includes both large Focal Landscapes and smaller targeted conservation areas (e.g., Grassland Bird Conservation Areas, GBCAs) established within them. To date, this conservation network has lacked baseline information to assess whether the current placement of these conservation areas aligns with population hot spots of grassland-dependent taxa. To do so, we fitted data from thousands of avian point-count surveys collected by citizen scientists as part of Wisconsin's Breeding Bird Atlas II with multinomial N-mixture models to estimate habitat-abundance relationships, develop spatially explicit predictions of abundance, and establish ecological baselines within priority conservation areas for a suite of obligate grassland songbirds. Next, we developed spatial randomization tests to evaluate the placement of this conservation network relative to randomly placed conservation networks. Overall, less than 20% of species statewide populations were found within the current grassland conservation network. Spatial tests demonstrated a high representation of this bird assemblage within the entire conservation network, but with a bias toward birds associated with moderately tallgrasses relative to those associated with shortgrasses or tallgrasses. We also found that GBCAs had higher representation at Focal Landscape rather than statewide scales. Here, we demonstrated how combining citizen science data with hierarchical modeling is a powerful tool for estimating ecological baselines and conducting large-scale evaluations of an existing conservation network for multiple grassland birds. Our flexible spatial randomization approach offers the potential to be applied to other protected area networks and serves as a complementary tool for conservation planning efforts globally.

AB  - Creating and managing protected areas is critical to ensure the persistence of species but dynamic threats like land-use change and climate change may reduce the effectiveness of protected areas planned under a static approach. Here we defined spatial priorities for the conservation of non-flying mammals inhabiting the Cerrado Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil, that overcome the likely impacts of land-use and climate change to this imperiled fauna. We used cutting-edge methods of species distribution models combining thousands of model projections to generate a comprehensive ensemble of forecasts that shows the likely impacts of climate change in mammal distribution. We also generate a future land-use model that indicates how the region would be impacted by habitat loss in the future. We then used our models to propose priority sites for mammal conservation minimizing species climate-forced dispersal distance as well as the mean uncertainty associated to species distribution models and climate models. At the same time, our proposal maximizes complementary species representation across the existing network of protected areas. Including land-use changes and model uncertainties in the planning process changed significantly the spatial distribution of priority sites in the region. While the inclusion of land-use models altered the spatial location of priority sites at the regional scale, the effects of climate change tended to operate at the local scale. Our solutions already include possible dispersal corridors linking current and future priority sites for mammal. conservation, as well as a formal risk analysis based on planning uncertainties. We hope to provide decision makers with conservation portfolios that could be negotiated at the decision level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reserve systems are part of biodiversity conservation planning. However, reserves are rarely assessed for their contribution to population persistence. Here we address knowledge gaps on reserve effectiveness by developing a new approach to model protected area efficacy as a function of habitat suitability and natural disturbance regimes. We demonstrate the utility of the model through a detailed case study of the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) in south-eastern Australia. We defined reserve effectiveness for the species to be when there was no more than 5% probability of populations falling to (or below) 500 adult females in 40 generations. A reserve system established specifically for Leadbeater's possum was found inadequate to ensure population persistence for the next 40 generations, given historical disturbance, habitat decline, and future fires. Simulation modelling of potential areas of reserve suggests that, depending on management risk tolerance, between 30% to 100% of current forest extent within the range of the species may be required to ensure population persistence. This study exemplifies the need to consider the size of reserves prior to their establishment to ensure an adequate reserve design that will be effective against future disturbance for conserving threatened species.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used in conservation and land-use planning as inputs to describe biodiversity patterns. These models can be built in different ways, and decisions about data preparation, selection of predictor variables, model fitting, and evaluation all alter the resulting predictions. Commonly, the true distribution of species is unknown and independent data to verify which SDM variant to choose are lacking. Such model uncertainty is of concern to planners. We analyzed how 11 routine decisions about model complexity, predictors, bias treatment, and setting thresholds for predicted values altered conservation priority patterns across 25 species. Models were created with MaxEnt and run through Zonation to determine the priority rank of sites. Although all SDM variants performed well (area under the curve >0.7), they produced spatially different predictions for species and different conservation priority solutions. Priorities were most strongly altered by decisions to not address bias or to apply binary thresholds to predicted values; on average 40% and 35%, respectively, of all grid cells received an opposite priority ranking. Forcing high model complexity altered conservation solutions less than forcing simplicity (14% and 24% of cells with opposite rank values, respectively). Use of fewer species records to build models or choosing alternative bias treatments had intermediate effects (25% and 23%, respectively). Depending on modeling choices, priority areas overlapped as little as 10-20% with the baseline solution, affecting top and bottom priorities differently. Our results demonstrate the extent of model-based uncertainty and quantify the relative impacts of SDM building decisions. When it is uncertain what the best SDM approach and conservation plan is, solving uncertainty or considering alterative options is most important for those decisions that change plans the most.

AB  - Limited conservation resources mean that management decisions are often made on the basis of scarce biological information. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed as a way to improve the representation of biodiversity features in conservation planning, but the extent to which SDMs are used in conservation planning is unclear. We reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey conservation planning literature to explore if and how SDMs are used in conservation prioritisations. We use text mining to analyse 641 peer-reviewed conservation prioritisation articles published between 2006 and 2012 and find that only 10% of atticles specifically mention SDMs in the abstract, title, and/or keywords. We use topic modelling of all peer-reviewed articles plus a detailed review of a random sample of 40 peer-reviewed and grey literature plans to evaluate factors that might influence whether decision-makers use SDMs to inform prioritisations. Our results reveal that habitat maps, expert-elicited species distributions, or metrics representing landscape processes (e.g. connectivity surfaces) are used more often than SDMs as biodiversity surrogates in prioritisations. We find four main reasons for using such alternatives in place of SDMs: (i) insufficient species occurrence data (particularly for threatened species); (ii) lack of biologically-meaningful predictor data relevant to the spatial scale of planning; (iii) low concern about uncertainty in biodiversity data; and (iv) a focus on accounting for ecological, evolutionary, and cumulative threatening processes that requires alternative data to be collected. Our results suggest that SDMs are perceived as best-suited to dealing with traditional reserve selection objectives and accounting for uncertainties such as future climate change or mapping accuracy. The majority of planners in both the grey and peer-reviewed literature appear to trade off the benefits of using SDMs for the benefits of including information on multiple threats and processes. We suggest that increasing the complexity of species distribution modelling methods might have little impact on their use in conservation planning without a corresponding increase in research aiming at better incorporation of a range of ecological, evolutionary, and threatening processes.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning aims to design networks of protected areas that meet conservation goals across large landscapes. The optimal design of these conservation networks is most frequently based on the modeled habitat suitability or probability of occurrence of species, despite evidence that model predictions may not be highly correlated with species density. We hypothesized that conservation networks designed using species density distributions more efficiently conserve populations of all species considered than networks designed using probability of occurrence models. To test this hypothesis, we used the Zonation conservation prioritization algorithm to evaluate conservation network designs based on probability of occurrence versus density models for 26 land bird species in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. We assessed the efficacy of each conservation network based on predicted species densities and predicted species diversity. High-density model Zonation rankings protected more individuals per species when networks protected the highest priority 10-40% of the landscape. Compared with density-based models, the occurrence-based models protected more individuals in the lowest 50% priority areas of the landscape. The 2 approaches conserved species diversity in similar ways: predicted diversity was higher in higher priority locations in both conservation networks. We conclude that both density and probability of occurrence models can be useful for setting conservation priorities but that density-based models are best suited for identifying the highest priority areas. Developing methods to aggregate species count data from unrelated monitoring efforts and making these data widely available through ecoinformatics portals such as the Avian Knowledge Network will enable species count data to be more widely incorporated into systematic conservation planning efforts.
   Mejoria de la Efectividad de la Planeacion Sistematica de la Conservacion con Datos de Densidad La planeacion sistematica de la conservacion tiene como meta disenar redes de areas protegidas que cumplan con objetivos de conservacion a lo largo de grandes paisajes. El diseno optimo de estas redes de conservacion se basa con mayor frecuencia en modelos de idoneidad de habitat o probabilidad de occurrencia de especies, a pesar de la evidencia existente de que las predicciones de esos modelos pueden no estar fuertemente correlacionadas con la densidad de especies. Hipotetizamos que las redes de conservacion disenadas con las distribuciones de la densidad de especies conservan con mayor eficiencia a las poblaciones de todas las especies consideradas que las redes disenadas con modelos de probabilidad de occurencia. Para probar esta hipotesis usamos el algoritmo Zonation de planeacion de la conservacion para evaluar los disenos de redes de conservacion basados en la probabilidad de ocurrencia versus los modelos de densidad para 26 especies de aves terrestres en el noroeste del Pacifico en los Estados Unidos. Evaluamos la efectividad de cada red de conservacion con base en las densidades pronosticadas de cada especie y la diversidad de especies pronosticada. Las clasificaciones de Zonation de los modelos de alta densidad protegieron a mas individuos por especie cuando las redes protegieron el 10-40% de la mas alta prioridad del paisaje. Comparado con los modelos basados en la densidad, los modelos basados en la ocurrencia protegieron a mas individuos en el 50% mas bajo de las areas prioritarias de los paisajes. Las dos estrategias conservaron la diversidad de especies de formas similares: la diversidad pronosticada fue mas alta en las localidades de alta prioridad en ambas redes de conservacion. Concluimos que tanto los modelos de densidad como los de probabilidad de ocurrencia pueden ser utiles para establecer prioridades de conservacion, pero que los modelos basados en la densidad son mas adecuados para identificar las areas de mas alta prioridad. Desarrollar metodos para agregar datos de conteos de especies a partir de esfuerzos de monitoreo no relacionados y hacer que estos datos esten disponibles en portales eco-informaticos como la Avian Knowledge Network permitira que los datos de conteos de especies se incorporen mas ampliamente en esfuerzos de planeacion sistematica de la conservacion.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs), especially those basing on climatic parameters, have frequently been used to project future species ranges and to develop conservation strategies. As suggested by several authors, we considered both different dispersal abilities and different evolutionarily significant units (ESUs, as determined in an earlier genetic survey). For our study species, the flightless ground beetle Carabus irregularis, SDMs for two ESUs from the western and the Carpathian area of the distribution range showed immense, and deviating future range contractions reflecting divergent ecological requirements. As minimal dispersal SDMs resulted in a stronger decline of future ranges than the maximal dispersal models, low dispersal ability tended to strengthen the already high vulnerability of the cold-adapted mountain species to global warming. Areas shown in our maximal dispersal models as offering climatically suitable habitats for C. irregularis in the future should be considered as potential areas of action in future conservation planning (e. g. assisted migration or assisted colonisation). Thus, both dispersal scenarios and different (if applicable) ESUs should be considered when developing SDMs as useful tools for species conservation strategies adapted to species' performance and differentiation patterns.

AB  - Preventing biological invasions in areas of conservation concern represents the most cost-effective strategy to minimize the impact of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) on native communities. In this context, invasive Species Distribution Models (iSDMs) are a sound tool for predicting invasion risk in protected areas. Although their potential to support invasive species managers is widely acknowledged, evidence of iSDMs providing actual conservation solutions is still scarce. With this work, we propose an iSDM-based methodology that accounts for the role of multiple invasion drivers to assess the risk posed by 1AS in protected areas. Using a binomial Generalized Additive Model, we predicted the occurrence of a highly invasive plant in Mediterranean dune systems. According to the predicted IAS occurrence, we quantified the invasibility of protected sites inside the study area, classified each site in low to medium-high invasibility categories, and identified site-specific management perspectives. Our results encourage the use of iSDMs as a means of evaluating the risk posed by IAS in protected areas, and, at the same time, represent an attempt to fill the gap between theory and practice in conservation decision-making.

AB  - The East China Sea (ECS) supports some of the most important fisheries and stocks of China. The rapid economic development and subsequent multiple pressures led to a concomitant decline of fisheries resources. To protect and restore the fisheries resources the Government has implemented the Hairtail Protected Area (HPA) in 2008. In 2012-2013 we conducted spring and autumn surveys using bottom trawling to investigate the effects of protected policy on fisheries recovery in the HPA. Species richness and composition were determined. A total of 138 fish species were collected, belonging to 2 classes, 17 orders and 57 families. Fish biomass and abundance increased in autumn and decreased in spring. Eight species were considered as dominant species, respectively accounting for 51.4% in 2012 and 48.6% in 2013 of the total biomass. Except Trichiurus lepturus and Harpogon nehereus, the dominant species were replaced by small-sized species, and the dominant species in HPA showed obviously seasonal turnover. Temperature was the most influential variable to shape the fish assemblage in the HPA. Salinity was also important in determining fish composition except in spring 2012. This study provides information for strategizing management of HPA.

AB  - Rhododendron arboreum Sm. ssp. nilagiricum (Zenker) Tagg, a tree species endemic to the southern Western Ghats of peninsular India, is restricted to a narrow topographic and bioclimatic niche. Since information on ecological and geographic extent of the species is lacking, we used Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP), an ecological niche modelling (ENM) method to model its spatial distribution. The model is developed based on its occurrence in the Western Ghats, in relation to topographic and environmental variables. Prediction of R. arboreum ssp. nilagiricum in the Western Ghats is strongly related to local climatic conditions in terms of annual temperature, precipitation and diurnal temperature ranges and not so much dependent on altitudinal variations. The numerous bioclimatic, topographic and anthropogenic factors have led to the formation of islands of species distribution, restricted to the Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Meghamalai hills of the Western Ghats. Predictions allow identification of key areas for in situ conservation of the species and prioritize areas falling in the ecological extent of the species for conservation.

AB  - Climate change is known as an important threat to biodiversity, particularly for freshwater or-ganisms as they have limited dispersal ability. Freshwater crabs are ecologically important freshwater macro-invertebrates and play a key role in their ecosystem. In this study we used an ensemble approach using three machine learning methods (Generalised Boosted Models, Maximum Entropy modeling, Random Forest) and assessed the impacts of climate change on the distribution of eight freshwater crabs (Potamon elbursi, P. fluviatile, P. hippocratis, P. ibericum, P. pelops, P. persicum, P. potamios, P. strouhali) and estimated the protected area coverage for their suitable habitats under current and future climate predictions. We found that the suitable habitats of six species will decrease (P. elbursi, P. fluviatile, P. hippocratis, P. pelops, P. potamios and P. strouhali) while the other two species (P. ibericum and P. persicum) will gain new suitable habitats due to climate change. Loss of suitable habitat would be substantial for the P. hippocratis and P. elbursi as these species will lose 92 %-100 % and 75 %-100 % of their suitable habitats by 2070, respectively. Additionally, P. fluviatile and P. pelops will lose 70 %-95 % and 81 %-86 % of their current suitable habitat, respectively. Thus, they are particularly sensitive to climate change. We showed that a very small proportion (< 1 %) of each species' current suitable habitat is covered by protected areas ranging from zero in P. elbursi, P. persicum and P. strouhali to 0.96 % in P. fluviatile. Under both climate change models P. elbursi, P. hippocratis and P. potamios will not have protected habitat in the future. Suitable habitats identified to remain stable under climate change will play a critical role in conservation of these freshwater species and will act as climate change refugia.

AB  - Prunus arabica (Oliv.) Meikle is an endangered shrub with a restricted distribution, which inhabits banks of flood flow channels in small sites of ancient volcanic activity dominated by black basaltic boulders within the Harrat Al-Harrah protectorate, Northern Saudi Arabia. It is with limited information about its ecology and hence, the present study is focusing on its phytosociological behavior and ecological features. The multi-methodological approach comprised species description, vegetation sampling and soil composition of 9 study sites at Harrat Al-Harrah protectorate. The application of TWINSPAN, DCA and CCA multivariate analyses led to identify 3 vegetation groups (VGI: Pulicaria undulata-Prunus arabica, VGII: Prunus arabica-Artemisia seiberi, VGIII: Artemisia seiberi-Achillea fragrantissima) associated with the distribution of P. arabica. The environmental variables that affect P. arabica and its main ecological features had been estimated and discussed. The present study concludes that the main reasons for its threatened and endangerment are seemingly due to overgrazing, poor rainfall, drought, shifting and destruction of its suitable habitat area.

AB  - Chinese pangolin is the world's most heavily trafficked small mammal for luxury food and traditional medicine. Although their populations are declining worldwide, it is difficult to monitor their population status because of its rarity and nocturnal behavior. We used site occupancy (presence/absence) sampling of pangolin sign (i.e., active burrows) in a protected (Gaurishankar Conservation Area) and non-protected area (Ramechhap District) of central Nepal with multiple environmental covariates to understand factors that may influence occupancy of Chinese pangolin. The average Chinese pangolin occupancy and detection probabilities were psi<^> +/- SE = 0.77 +/- 0.08;p<^> +/- SE = 0.27 +/- 0.05, respectively. The detection probabilities of Chinese pangolin were higher in PA (p<^> +/- SE = 0.33 +/- 0.03) than compared to non-PA (p<^> +/- SE = 0.25 +/- 0.04). The most important covariates for Chinese pangolin detectability were red soil (97%), food source (97.6%), distance to road (97.9%), and protected area (97%) and with respect to occupancy was elevation (97.9%). We recommended use of remote cameras and potentially GPS collar surveys to further investigate habitat use and site occupancy at regular intervals to provide more reliable conservation assessments.

AB  - Large, citizen-science species databases are powerful resources for predictive species distribution modeling (SDM), yet they are often subject to sampling bias. Many methods have been proposed to correct for this, but there exists little consensus as to which is most effective, not least because the true value of model predictions is hard to evaluate without extensive independent field sampling. We present here a nationwide, independent field validation of distribution models of ancient and veteran trees, a group of organisms of high conservation importance, built using a large and internationally unique citizen-science database: the Ancient Tree Inventory (ATI). This validation exercise presents an opportunity to test the performance of different methods of correcting for sampling bias, in the search for the best possible prediction of ancient and veteran tree distributions in England. We fitted a variety of distribution models of ancient and veteran tree records in England in relation to environmental predictors and applied different bias correction methods, including spatial filtering, background manipulation, the use of bias files, and, finally, zero-inflated (ZI) regression models, a new method with great potential to investigate and remove sampling bias in species data. We then collected new independent field data through systematic surveys of 52 randomly selected 1-km(2) grid squares across England to obtain abundance estimates of ancient and veteran trees. Calibration of the distribution models against the field data suggests that there are around eight to 10 times as many ancient and veteran trees present in England than the records currently suggest, with estimates ranging from 1.7 to 2.1 million trees compared to the 200,000 currently recorded in the ATI. The most successful bias correction method was systematic sampling of occurrence records, although the ZI models also performed well, significantly predicting field observations and highlighting both likely causes of undersampling and areas of the country in which many unrecorded trees are likely to be found. Our findings provide the first robust nationwide estimate of ancient and veteran tree abundance and demonstrate the enormous potential for distribution modeling based on citizen-science data combined with independent field validation to inform conservation planning.

AB  - Hangul (Cervus hanglu hanglu), the only red deer subspecies surviving in the Indian subcontinent, is of top conservation priority with global importance. Unfortunately, it has lost much of its historical distribution range, and it is now confined to Dachigam landscape within the Kashmir valley of India. The Government of India initiated a recovery plan in 2008 to augment their numbers through ex-situ conservation programs. However, it was necessary to identify potential hangul habitats in Kashmir valley for adopting landscape-level conservation planning for the species. Based on geometric aspects of reserve design, we modeled hangul habitat using an ensemble approach to identify hangul habitats. The present model indicates that the conifer and broadleaf mixed forests were the most suitable habitats. Only 9% of the total study landscape was found suitable for the species. We identified corridors among the suitable habitat blocks, which may be vital for the species' long-term genetic viability. We suggest reorganizing the existing management of Dachigam National Park (NP) following the landscape level and habitat block-level management planning based on the core principles of geometric reserve design. We recommend that the identified patch (PID-6) in the southern region of the landscape to be converted into a Conservation Reserve or merged with the Overa-Aru Wildlife Sanctuary. This habitat patch PID-6 may be a stepping stone habitat and vital for maintaining the species landscape connectivity and metapopulation dynamics.

AB  - Climate change disproportionately threatens alpine species, by reducing available habitat and by isolating their populations. These pressures are particularly relevant for rear-edge populations, which typically occupy more marginal habitat compared to populations at the core of species' ranges. We studied Caucasian grouse Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi in the Caucasus ecoregion, a global biodiversity hotspot where this species is endemic, to understand potential climate change impacts on the species. Specifically, we assessed how climate change impacts rear-edge populations and how important these populations are for understanding range shifts and adaptive capacity under climate change. We used maximum entropy modeling to assess changes in the distribution of climatically suitable habitat under present and 2070 climate conditions for the representative concentration pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5). Our results revealed that ignoring rear-edge populations leads to a significant underestimation of the future range (by about 14,700 km(2)). Rear-edge populations were better adapted to warmer climates compared to core populations, and ignoring them, therefore, also underestimates adaptive capacity. Preventing the loss of rear-edge populations should, therefore, be a priority for conservation planning in the face of climate change. Because the Caucasian grouse is associated with alpine mountain tops, conservation should focus on establishing connectivity between rear-edge and core populations (e.g., via transboundary corridors or assisted colonizations). Our study reveals how species distribution modeling can highlight the importance of rear-edge populations for mitigating climate change impacts on species of conservation concern.

AB  - Theaceae, an economically important angiosperm family, is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical forests in Asia. In China, Theaceae has particularly high abundances and endemism, comprising similar to 75% of the total genera and similar to 46% of the total species worldwide. Therefore, predicting the response of Theaceae species to climate change is vital. In this study, we collected distribution data for 200 wild Theaceae species in China, and predicted their distribution patterns under current and future climactic conditions by species distribution modeling (SDM). We revealed that Theaceae species richness is highest in southeastern China and on Hainan Island, reaching its highest value (137 species) in Fujian Province. According to the IUCN Red List criteria for assessing species threat levels under two dispersal assumptions (no dispersal and full dispersal), we evaluated the conservation status of all Theaceae species by calculating loss of suitable habitat under future climate scenarios. We predicted that nine additional species will become threatened due to climate change in the future; one species will be classified as critically endangered (CR), two as endangered (EN), and six as vulnerable (VU). Given their extinction risks associated with climate change, we recommended that these species be added to the Red List. Our investigation of migration patterns revealed regional differences in the number of emigrant, immigrant, and persistent species, indicating the need for targeted conservation strategies. Regions containing numerous emigrants are concentrated in Northern Taiwan and coastal regions of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, while regions containing numerous immigrants include central Sichuan Province, the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region, southwest Yunnan Province, northwest Sichuan Province, and the junction of Guangxi and Hunan provinces. Lastly, regions containing persistent species are widely distributed in southern China. Importantly, regions with high species turnover are located on the northern border of the entire Theaceae species distribution ranges owing to upwards migration; these regions are considered most sensitive to climate change and conservation planning should therefore be prioritized here. This study will contribute valuable information for reducing the negative impacts of climate change on Theaceae species, which will ultimately improve biodiversity conservation efficiency.

AB  - Habitat models for animal species are important tools in conservation planning. We assessed the need to consider several scales in a case study for three amphibian and two grasshopper species in the post-mining landscapes near Leipzig (Germany). The two species groups were selected because habitat analyses for grasshoppers are usually conducted on one scale only whereas amphibians are thought to depend on more than one spatial scale.
   First, we analysed how the preference to single habitat variables changed across nested scales. Most environmental variables were only significant for a habitat model on one or two scales, with the smallest scale being particularly important. On larger scales, other variables became significant, which cannot be recognized on lower scales. Similar preferences across scales occurred in only 13 out of 79 cases and in 3 out of 79 cases the preference and avoidance for the same variable were even reversed among scales.
   Second, we developed habitat models by using a logistic regression on every scale and for all combinations of scales and analysed how the quality of habitat models changed with the scales considered. To achieve a sufficient accuracy of the habitat models with a minimum number of variables, at least two scales were required for all species except for Bufo viridis, for which a single scale, the microscale, was sufficient. Only for the European tree frog (Hyla arborea), at least three scales were required.
   The results indicate that the quality of habitat models increases with the number of surveyed variables and with the number of scales, but costs increase too. Searching for simplifications in multi-scaled habitat models, we suggest that 2 or 3 scales should be a suitable trade-off, when attempting to define a suitable microscale.

AB  - The efficient representation of all species in conservation planning is problematic. Often, species distribution is assessed by dividing the land into a grid; complementary sets of grids, in which each taxon is represented at least once, are then sought. To determine if this approach provides useful surrogate information, species and higher taxon data for South African plants and animals were analyzed. Complementary species sets did not coincide and overlapped little with higher taxon sets. Survey extent and taxonomic knowledge did not affect this overlap. Thus, the assumptions of surrogacy, on which so much conservation planning is based, are not supported.

AB  - AimWe conduct the first assessment of likely future climate change impacts for biodiversity across the West African protected area (PA) network using climate projections that capture important climate regimes (e.g. West African Monsoon) and mesoscale processes that are often poorly simulated in general circulation models (GCMs).
   LocationWest Africa.
   MethodsWe use correlative species distribution models to relate species (amphibians, birds, mammals) distributions to modelled contemporary climates, and projected future distributions across the PA network. Climate data were simulated using a physically based regional climate model to dynamically downscale GCMs. GCMs were selected because they accurately reproduce important regional climate regimes and generate a range of regional climate change responses. We quantify uncertainty arising from projected climate change, modelling methodology and spatial dependency, and assess the spatial and temporal patterns of climate change impacts for biodiversity across the PA network.
   ResultsSubstantial species turnover across the network is projected for all three taxonomic groups by 2100 (amphibians=42.5% (median); birds=35.2%; mammals=37.9%), although uncertainty is high, particularly for amphibians and mammals, and, importantly, increases across the century. However, consistent patterns of impacts across taxa emerge by early to mid-century, suggesting high impacts across the Lower Guinea forest.
   Main conclusionsReducing (e.g. using appropriate climate projections) and quantifying uncertainty in climate change impact assessments helps clarify likely impacts. Consistent patterns of high biodiversity impacts emerge in the early and mid-century projections, while end-of-century projections are too uncertain for reliable assessments. We recommend that climate change adaptation should focus on earlier projections, where we have most confidence in species responses, rather than on end-of-century projections that are frequently used. In addition, our work suggests climate impact should consider a broad range of species, as we simulate divergent responses across taxonomic groups.

AB  - Aim Holistic marine biodiversity conservation refers to ecosystem-based management through marine conservation planning (MCP), based on mapping habitat protection priority areas. In practice, MCP is frequently hindered by information gaps in biodiversity distributions, particularly on a marine ecoregion scale. Species distribution modelling (SDM) can help to resolve this gap and provide information essential for MCP scenarios. We constructed habitat configurations for three coastal marine megafauna animals using SDM, then based MCP scenarios on the projected habitat configurations and tested the use of marine megafauna animals as surrogates to protect major ecosystems.
   Location Gulf of Thailand, Southeast Asia.
   Methods A MaxEnt model was used to project likely habitats for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) and sea turtles in the Gulf of Thailand. MARXAN software was used to prioritize spatial configurations for habitat protection. The percentage of overlaps between MARXAN delineations and major biodiversity features in the Gulf of Thailand were calculated.
   Results Habitat configurations of humpback dolphins, Irrawaddy dolphins and sea turtles were projected throughout the coastal and estuarine waters along the Gulf of Thailand. MCP based on the habitat of three marine megafauna animals highlighted five critical habitats for the protection of major ecosystems in the Gulf of Thailand.
   Main conclusions Holistic MCP starts with mapping critical habitats for marine protected area (MPA) networks, balances MPA networks with maritime livelihood activities and alleviates conflicts between MPA management and local livelihood needs. A combination of SDM and MARXAN methods provides a cost-effective approach to delineate MPA networks. In this approach, surrogate selection and data preparation should consider niches representative of regional ecosystem features and avoid spatial sampling bias. In coastal and estuarine waters, marine megafauna such as coastal cetaceans and sea turtles may serve as efficient surrogates to protect major ecosystems.

AB  - Fuscopannaria leucosticta is a rare lichen that exhibits an apparent specificity for old wet forests in eastern Canada, and may, consequently, be sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance. Estimates of the current distribution and population size are highly uncertain. Effective conservation planning requires improving our understanding of both its current distribution and the factors that influence habitat suitability. We built a MaxEnt distribution model with interpolated climate data, depth to water table mapping, forest inventory data, and herbarium collection data for F. leucosticta in New Brunswick, Canada. We tested model performance via field verifications in high-probability areas with no record of previous surveys. We found F. leucosticta in 13 out of 22 previously unsurveyed locations with a predicted high probability of occurrence. Selected variables included the presence of cedar in the canopy and a lack of recent anthropogenic disturbance, as well as mean annual rainfall and degree days above 0 degrees C. These associations are likely a result of the lichen's low reproductive output and the thermal and hydration requirements of its cyanobacterial photobiont. Our study affirms several previous claims about habitat associations of the species, and provides focus for conservation efforts in the future.

AB  - We investigated the spatial arrangement of Great Bustard Otis tarda nests relative to leks in 55 females captured at four lek sites and radio-tracked through 1-6 years in a protected area in central Spain. Although females showed a tendency to nest close to the lek centers where they were observed during the mating season (29% did it at < 2 km), lek-to-nest distances ranged between 0.22 and 53.82 km. This resulted in most nest-sites (64%) being outside the lek areas where the female had mated, often closer to nearby leks, and sometimes far from any lek, in areas used only for nesting, outside the protected area (25%). The distribution of nest-to-nearest-lek distances did not differ from that of randomly distributed control sites, indicating that nest-sites were not aggregated, but dispersed over the whole suitable habitat within a large area around leks. Females with and without hatching success did not differ in their mean lek-to-nest distance. These results suggest that females used the whole suitable habitat available for nesting, and did not base nest-site selection on factors related to density-dependent disturbances or predation risks at leks (lek avoidance hypothesis). In this and other lekking birds, managers have often restricted conservation efforts to lek areas, under the wrong assumption that these would include most nest-sites. If a much larger region including most nesting habitat is not protected, Great Bustards in our study population might eventually be forced to nest at higher densities within the protected area, with a consequent density-dependent reduction in the mean breeding success of the population.

AB  - Context Effective conservation planning for species depends on vegetation models that can capture the dynamics of habitat elements across both spatial and temporal domains. Incorporating these dynamics at landscape scales is essential for understanding the impact of natural disturbance, management, and climate change on habitat availability and stability on fauna. Objectives To explore the impact of resource availability, wildfire, forest management (timber harvesting and planned burning), and climate change on the habitat of the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum (LBP; Gymnobelideus leadbeateri McCoy) with the goal of understanding the importance of these factors on future habitat availability. Methods We used a spatially explicit landscape-simulation model, LANDIS-II, linked to habitat suitability and patch modelling, to identify quantity, configuration, and temporal stability of habitat for LBP. We used boosted regression trees and general additive modelling to explore the importance of management and disturbance factors on future LBP habitat availability. Results Wildfire was the main factor determining all habitat components for LBP, both alone and in interaction with climate change and forest management. We identified stable habitat patches that will likely persist under future conditions, and that might be prioritised for conservation in a dynamic landscape. Conclusions We highlight how the current reserve network could be augmented to improve the future conservation status of LBP. Our approach provides conservation planners with a spatially and temporally explicit framework for incorporating the key dynamic processes that are typically omitted in conservation planning.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) have become important and essential tools in conservation and management. However, SDMs built with count data, referred to as species abundance models (SAMs), are still less commonly used to date, but increasingly receiving attention. Species occurrence and abundance do not frequently display similar patterns, and often they are not even well correlated. Therefore, only using information based on SDMs or SAMs leads to an insufficient or misleading conservation efforts. How to combine information from SDMs and SAMs and how to apply the combined information to achieve unified conservation remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce and propose a priority protection index (PI). The PI combines the prediction results of the occurrence and abundance models. As a case study, we used the best available presence and count records for an endangered farmland species, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda dybowskii), in Bohai Bay,'China.l We then applied the Random Forest algorithm (Salford Systems Ltd. Implementation) with eleven 1predictor variables to forecast the spatial occurrence as we las the abundance distribution. The results show that the occurrence model had a decent performance (ROC:(0.77) and the abundance model had a RMSE of 26.54. It is noteworthy that environmental variables influenced bustard occurrence and abundance differently. The area of farmland, and the distance to residential areas were the top important variables influencing bustard occurrence. While the distance to national roads and to expressways were the most important influencing abundance. In addition, the occurrence and abundance models displayed different spatial distribution patterns. The regions with a high index of occurrence were concentrated in the south-central part of the study area; and the abundance distribution showed high populations Species occurrence in the central and northwestern parts of the study area. However, combining occurrence and abundance indices to produce a priority protection index (PI) to be used for conservation could guide the protection of the areas with high occurrence and high abundance (e.g., in Strategic Conservation Planning). Due to the widespread use of SDMs and the easy subsequent employment of SAMs, these findings have a wide relevance and applicability than just those only based on SDMs or SAMs and tiladate the We promote and strongly encourage researchers to further test, apply priority protection inde) (PI) elsewhere to explore the generality of rid methods that are now readil available.

AB  - P>1. We review recent advances in systematic conservation planning in fresh waters. Most modern systematic planning approaches are based on the CARE principles: comprehensiveness, adequacy, representativeness and efficiency. Efficiency is usually provided by a complementarity-based strategy, aiming to select new conservation areas in the light of previously protected features. These strategies have to be modified to account for the connected nature of rivers.
   2. Choice of surrogates for conservation features depends on the scale of the assessment, as well as the available expertise and resources. Ideally, real information about taxa or processes - extrapolated by models - ensures that target features are protected. Where this is not feasible, it is critical that the choice of environmental surrogates is informed by target biota or processes.
   3. Setting adequacy targets - the most challenging aspect in planning - needs to be evaluated in a freshwater-specific context, as species-area relationships and the distribution of diversity differ in dendritic networks. Adequately designed conservation plans also need to consider upstream land use and catchment disturbances. Recent studies have largely addressed longitudinal connectivity either by setting rules to protect adjacent subcatchments (or even the entire catchment upstream), or by considering the magnitude of disturbance upstream of selected planning units. Very few studies have addressed lateral and vertical connectivity in a systematic way.
   4. To implement freshwater conservation plans, we recommend adopting a recently proposed hierarchical protection strategy, from 'freshwater focal areas' that contain the actual features to be protected to mixed-use 'catchment management zones'. Stakeholder involvement is crucial, especially in the large multi-use areas upstream and in the surrounding catchment.
   5. We conclude that conservation planning using CARE principles is the only efficient way forward. This special issue shows significant efforts are under way to adapt freshwater-specific adequacy, connectivity and implementation issues in conservation planning. However, a more holistic research investment is required to link freshwater, terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

AB  - Predicting spatial patterns in thermal tolerance and vulnerability of species under climate warming remains a challenge. Current knowledge is mainly from experiment-based thermal physiology of limited numbers of ectotherms, yet large-scale evaluations on plants remain elusive. Here, using distribution maps with spatial resolutions of 20 x 20 km for 5628 woody species in China, we propose a novel approach, i.e. thermal distribution curves, to describe species' realized thermal niches and then estimate their thermal tolerance and warming risks under projected climate warming in 2050s and 2070s. We find that species' vulnerability and potential local extinction risks within grid cells decrease with latitude and increase with aridity due to narrow thermal tolerance of species located at low latitudes and arid regions. Over 90% of species could still tolerate future warming in most areas, indicating relatively optimistic expectation of potential local extinctions. Our study presents a new framework to quantify climate warming impacts on a large number of species without sufficient physiological information and provides fundamental references for conservation planning under climate change.

AB  - Anticipating the ecological effects of climate change to inform natural resource climate adaptation planning represents one of the primary challenges of contemporary conservation science. Species distribution models have become a widely used tool to generate first-pass estimates of climate change impacts to species probabilities of occurrence. There are a number of technical challenges to constructing species distribution models that can be alleviated by the use of scientific workflow software. These challenges include data integration, visualization of modeled predictor-response relationships, and ensuring that models are reproducible and transferable in an adaptive natural resource management framework. We used freely available software called VisTrails Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (VisTrails:SAHM) along with a novel ecohydrological predictor dataset and the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 future climate projections to construct species distribution models for eight forest and shrub species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the Northern Rocky Mountains USA. The species considered included multiple species of sagebrush and juniper, Aims flexilis, Pinus contorta, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Populus tremuloides, Abies lasciocarpa, Picea engelmannii, and Pinus albicaulis. Current and future species probabilities of occurrence were mapped in a GIS by land ownership category to assess the feasibility of undertaking present and future management action. Results suggested that decreasing spring snowpack and increasing late-season soil moisture deficit will lead to deteriorating habitat area for mountain forest species and expansion of habitat area for sagebrush and juniper communities. Results were consistent across nine global climate models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios. For most forest species their projected future distributions moved up in elevation from general federal to federally restricted lands where active management is currently prohibited by agency policy. Though not yet fully mature, custom scientific workflow software shows considerable promise to ease many of the technical challenges inherent in modeling the potential ecological impacts of climate change to support climate adaptation planning.

AB  - Temperature profoundly affects ecology, a fact ever more evident as the ability to measure thermal environments increases and global changes alter these environments. The spatial structure of thermalscapes is especially relevant to the distribution and abundance of ectothermic organisms, but the ability to describe biothermal relationships at extents and grains relevant to conservation planning has been limited by small or sparse data sets. Here, we combine a large occurrence database of >23000 aquatic species surveys with stream microclimate scenarios supported by an equally large temperature database for a 149000-km mountain stream network to describe thermal relationships for 14 fish and amphibian species. Species occurrence probabilities peaked across a wide range of temperatures (7.0-18.8 degrees C) but distinct warm- or cold-edge distribution boundaries were apparent for all species and represented environments where populations may be most sensitive to thermal changes. Warm-edge boundary temperatures for a native species of conservation concern were used with geospatial data sets and a habitat occupancy model to highlight subsets of the network where conservation measures could benefit local populations by maintaining cool temperatures. Linking that strategic approach to local estimates of habitat impairment remains a key challenge but is also an opportunity to build relationships and develop synergies between the research, management, and regulatory communities. As with any data mining or species distribution modeling exercise, care is required in analysis and interpretation of results, but the use of large biological data sets with accurate microclimate scenarios can provide valuable information about the thermal ecology of many ectotherms and a spatially explicit way of guiding conservation investments.

AB  - Systematic data in the form of collections data are useful in biodiversity studies in many ways, most importantly because they serve as the only direct evidence of species distributions. However, collecting bias has been demonstrated for most areas of the world and has led some to propose methods that circumvent the need for collections data. New methods that model collections data in combination with abiotic data and predict potential total species distribution are examined using 25,111 records representing 5, 123 species of plants and animals from Guyana; some methods use the reduced number of 320 species. These modeled species distributions are evaluated and potential high-priority biodiversity sites are selected based on the concept of irreplaceability, a measure of uniqueness. The major impediments to using collections data are the lack of data that are available in a useful format and the reluctance of most systematists to become involved in biodiversity and conservation research.

AB  - There is strong international agreement on the need for marine protected areas to reverse pervasive human impacts on the oceans' biodiversity. However, their implementation is often hampered both by legal difficulties in defining reserves in international waters and the patchy nature of data in many offshore waters. We demonstrate the use of recent advances in statistical learning and conservation prioritization to produce MPA scenarios with varying costs and benefits for New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone, based on the analyses of distributions of 96 demersal fish species. MPAs based on our most cost-effective scenario would deliver conservation benefits nearly 2.5 times greater than those from equivalent-sized areas recently implemented at the request of fishers, and at lower cost to them. Such results demonstrate the power of quantitative, knowledge-based prioritization approaches, which can be applied at high resolution and at oceanic scales.

AB  - Species distribution maps are important tools for wildlife conservation planning and management. To model koala distributions, usually, a spatially representative sample of koala populations is collected through systematic field surveys. Details of koala sightings collected by members of the public could potentially be used to develop species distribution models if appropriate analytical approaches are applied to address the inherent biases in such datasets. We developed a stepwise approach for applying bias correction techniques to estimate and map koala distributions. Using a Boosted regression tree approach, we modelled indirectly the search effort made by observers to identify or sight koalas. Land lot density (58%) and human population density (19%) had the strongest positive impact on the indirect search effort, while the distances to roads were negatively associated with the indirect search effort. To estimate the koala distribution across South-East Queensland, we then developed models describing koala habitat (environmental model), access to koala habitat (accessibility model) and the search effort (search effort model), with the latter including the indirect search effort covariate. Finally, we corrected the estimates derived from these models (bias-corrected search effort and accessibility model). Three independent statistical modelling approaches (Lasso penalty Poisson regression, Down weighted Poisson regression, and Maximum entropy) were used to compare the five koala distribution models. Based on assessments of areas under curves, the predictive accuracy of models improved when area accessibility and search effort were included. Overall, the spatial extent of koala distributions increased in the prediction maps when models were corrected for accessibility and indirect search effort (except for Down-weighted Poisson regression).

AB  - Species' range maps based on expert opinion are a critical resource for conservation planning. Expert maps are usually accompanied by species descriptions that specify sources of internal range heterogeneity, such as habitat associations, but these are rarely considered when using expert maps for analyses. We developed a quantitative metric (expert score) to evaluate the agreement between an expert map and a habitat probability surface obtained from a species distribution model. This method rewards both the avoidance of unsuitable sites and the inclusion of suitable sites in the expert map. We obtained expert maps of 330 butterfly species from each of 2 widely used North American sources (Glassberg [1999, 2001] and Scott [1986]) and computed species-wise expert scores for each. Overall, the Glassberg maps secured higher expert scores than Scott (0.61 and 0.41, respectively) due to the specific rules (e.g., Glassberg only included regions where the species was known to reproduce whereas Scott included all areas a species expanded to each year) they used to include or exclude areas from ranges. The predictive performance of expert maps was almost always hampered by the inclusion of unsuitable sites, rather than by exclusion of suitable sites (deviance outside of expert maps was extremely low). Map topology was the primary predictor of expert performance rather than any factor related to species characteristics such as mobility. Given the heterogeneity and discontinuity of suitable landscapes, expert maps drawn with more detail are more likely to agree with species distribution models and thus minimize both commission and omission errors.

AB  - Context Climate change is an important driver of habitat contraction and the loss of biodiversity. Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to assess the impacts of climate change and to identify priority conservation areas. Conservation assessment of endemic keystone species can foster the conservation of forest ecosystems. Objectives The objectives of this study are: (1) to evaluate the potential impacts of future climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) on the extents of the habitat of eight endemic montane conifer species under dispersal scenarios (full and limited) and (2) to estimate the percentage loss in the area of occupancy (AOO) of the target species based on projected habitat suitability in order to assess their extinction risks and identify priority conservation areas. Methods Southwestern China is a global hotspot of conifer diversity and endemism. We used three ensemble-SDMs along with the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List criteria to evaluate the impacts of climate change. Results Abies fabri, Abies fargesii var. faxoniana, Abies recurvata var. ernestii, and Picea neoveitchii are predicted to lose more than 90% of their AOOs under both the climate and dispersal scenarios. All of these species are predicted to become extinct or critically endangered except for Picea retroflexa and Abies squamata. It should be noted that while the changes in the AOOs changes were filtered for the current unsuitable man-made areas these predictions do not account for future land use changes. Conclusions Stable and suitable habitats are promising tools for in-situ conservation planning. Moreover, future conservation actions should give full consideration to the pattern of climate and land use.

AB  - Climate change and human activities have caused dramatic impacts on biodiversity. Although a number of international agreements or initiatives have been launched to mitigate the biodiversity loss, the erosion of terrestrial biome habitats is inevitable. Consequently, the identification of potential suitable habitats under climate change and human disturbance has become an urgent task of biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to identify the current and potential future habitats of Asian elephants in South and Southeast Asia. We performed analyses for future projections with 17 scenarios using the present results as baseline. To optimize the modelling results, we delineated the core habitats by using the Core Mapper Tool and compared them with existing protected areas (PAs) through gap analysis. The results showed that the current total area of core habitats is 491,455 km(2) in size and will be reduced to 332,544 km(2) by 2090 under SSP585 (the shared socioeconomic pathway). The projection analysis under differential scenarios suggested that most of the core habitats in the current protected areas would remain stable and suitable for elephants in the future. However, the remaining 75.17% of the core habitats lay outside the current PAs, and finally we mapped approximately 219,545 km(2) of suitable habitats as priority protected areas in the future. Although our model did not perform well in some regions, our analyses and findings still could provide useful references to the planning of protected areas and conservation of Asian elephant.

AB  - Decisions regarding the level of detail included in conservation planning and the importance given to feasibility considerations can greatly influence management in terms of total area required, achievement of conservation targets and costs. This work had two main objectives: (1) to compare priority sites proposed by the Chilean commission for the environment in a politically driven process to the results of alternative systematic conservation planning scenarios; and (2) to compare the efficacy of systematic conservation planning based on different types of conservation targets (forest types and bird species) and minimum area thresholds. To address these issues, we used vegetation cover as well as field data on forest birds in central Chile. Bird species distributions were modeled using a variety of climatic and environmental layers, allowing for the integration of environmental heterogeneity into the planning process. We then ran several conservation planning scenarios considering conservation targets based on vegetation types alone, birds alone, or a combination of vegetation and birds. Collectively these results show that conservation planning results differ significantly when considering birds or vegetation types, and that minimum area requirements for each conservation feature has a great influence on the final results. Moreover, important conservation sites are not represented in the current government plan, and these sites are related to the small representation of rare vegetation types. This study suggests that using appropriate minimum area requirements can greatly affect the results of a conservation planning exercise and therefore represents a key knowledge gap in the region.

AB  - Species distribution models are required for the research and management of biodiversity in the hyperdiverse tropical forests, but reliable and ecologically relevant digital environmental data layers are not always available. We here assess the usefulness of multispectral canopy reflectance (Landsat) relative to climate data in modelling understory plant species distributions in tropical rainforests. We used a large dataset of quantitative fern and lycophyte species inventories across lowland Amazonia as the basis for species distribution modelling (SDM). As predictors, we used CHELSA climatic variables and canopy reflectance values from a recent basin-wide composite of Landsat TM/ETM+ images both separately and in combination. We also investigated how species accumulate over sites when environmental distances were expressed in terms of climatic or surface reflectance variables. When species accumulation curves were constructed such that differences in Landsat reflectance among the selected plots were maximised, species accumulated faster than when climatic differences were maximised or plots were selected in a random order. Sixty-nine species were sufficiently frequent for species distribution modelling. For most of them, adequate SDMs were obtained whether the models were based on CHELSA data only, Landsat data only or both combined. Model performance was not influenced by species' prevalence or abundance. Adding Landsat-based environmental data layers overall improved the discriminatory capacity of SDMs compared to climate-only models, especially for soil specialist species. Our results show that canopy surface reflectance obtained by multispectral sensors can provide studies of tropical ecology, as exemplified by SDMs, much higher thematic (taxonomic) detail than is generally assumed. Furthermore, multispectral datasets complement the traditionally used climatic layers in analyses requiring information on environmental site conditions. We demonstrate the utility of freely available, global remote sensing data for biogeographical studies that can aid conservation planning and biodiversity management.

AB  - Knowledge of habitat suitability (HS) is required for effective conservation planning, yet it can be difficult to obtain. In the absence of local HS information, managers often use studies from other areas to guide their decisions, typically without local validation. We tested the hypothesis that HS is consistent across a species range, and thus reliably extrapolated to understudied sites. We focused on the puma, Puma concolor, a widely distributed large carnivore of conservation and management importance. We conducted a meta-analysis of 41 studies to calculate a mean effect size for six of the most common predictor variables used in mammal HS research. Using the estimated effect sizes in a regression model which included all six variables, we created a new HS model for pumas in an understudied site, the Tumbesian Region (TR). We contrasted predictions from this range-wide model with those from three more regionally specific HS models: a model developed in the Caatinga, Brazil (Caatinga model), a model considering only tropical studies (tropical model), and a model using only studies from the United States and Canada (temperate model). We used puma detection rates from camera trap surveys across the TR to validate model predictions. Although mean effect sizes of habitat predictor variables varied across puma range, all models provided useful predictions of HS for pumas in the TR (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] > 0.64). Unexpectedly, the temperate model was best at predicting puma HS in the TR (AUC: 0.77; r(s) = 0.3), followed by the range-wide model (AUC = 0.73; r(s) = 0.29). The tropical and Caatinga models had lower predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.68; r(s) = 0.28 and AUC = 0.64; r(s) = 0.23, respectively). The accuracy of the tropical model improved when the area of potential recent puma extirpation was excluded from the validation data set. These results highlight that although HS for P. concolor varies across the species range, information collected across a wide range of sites may be better than only locally or regionally specific information for informing HS in understudied sites (e.g., for habitat protection, restoration areas). Given the pressing need for actions to address widespread biodiversity declines, existing knowledge can be used to predict HS to data-poor regions and inform conservation planning while also motivating model validations and targeted data collection.

AB  - Prediction maps produced by species distribution models (SDMs) influence decision-making in resource management or designation of land in conservation planning. Many studies have compared the prediction accuracy of different SDM modeling methods, but few have quantified the similarity among prediction maps. There has also been little systematic exploration of how the relative importance of different predictor variables varies among model types and affects map similarity. Our objective was to expand the evaluation of SDM performance for 45 plant species in southern California to better understand how map predictions vary among model types, and to explain what factors may affect spatial correspondence, including the selection and relative importance of different environmental variables. Four types of models were tested. Correlation among maps was highest between generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) and lowest between classification trees and GAMs or GLMs. Correlation between Random Forests (RFs) and GAMs was the same as between RFs and classification trees. Spatial correspondence among maps was influenced the most by model prediction accuracy (AUC) and species prevalence; map correspondence was highest when accuracy was high and prevalence was intermediate (average prevalence for all species was 0.124). Species functional type and the selection of climate variables also influenced map correspondence. For most (but not all) species, climate variables were more important than terrain or soil in predicting their distributions. Environmental variable selection varied according to modeling method, but the largest differences were between RFs and GLMs or GAMs. Although prediction accuracy was equal for GLMs, GAMs, and RFs, the differences in spatial predictions suggest that it may be important to evaluate the results of more than one model to estimate the range of spatial uncertainty before making planning decisions based on map outputs. This may be particularly important if models have low accuracy or if species prevalence is not intermediate.

AB  - For 107 endemic mammal species in the Afro-Arabian region, Sahara-Sahel and Arabian Desert, we used ensemble species distribution models to: (1) identify the hotspot areas for conservation, (2) assess the potential impact of the projected climate change on the distribution of the focal species, and (3) assign IUCN threat categories for the focal species according to the predicted changes in their potential distribution range. We identified two main hotspot areas for endemic mammals: the Sinai and its surrounding coastal area in the East, and the Mediterranean Coast around Morocco in the West. Alarmingly, our results indicate that about 17% of the endemic mammals in the AfroArabian region under the current climate change scenarios could go extinct before 2050. Overall, a substantial number of the endemic species will change from the IUCN threat category "Least Concern" to "Critically Endangered" or "Extinct" in the coming decades. Accordingly, we call for implementing an urgent proactive conservation action for these endemic species, particularly those that face a high risk of extinction in the next few years. The results of our study provide conservation managers and practitioners with the required information for implementing an effective conservation plan to protect the biodiversity of the Afro-Arabian region.

AB  - Iran lies at the southernmost range limit of brown bears globally. Therefore, understanding the habitat associations and patterns of population connectivity for brown bears in Iran is relevant for the species' conservation. We applied species distribution modeling to predict habitat suitability and connectivity modeling to identify population core areas and corridors. Our results showed that forest density, topographical roughness, NDVI and human footprint were the most influential variables in predicting brown bear distribution. The most crucial core areas and corridor networks for brown bear are concentrated in the Alborz and Zagros Mountains. These two core areas were predicted to be fragmented into a total of fifteen isolated patches if dispersal of brown bear across the landscape is limited to 50,000 cost units, and aggregates into two isolated habitat patches if the species is capable of dispersing 400,000 cost units. We found low overlap between corridors, and core habitats with protected areas, suggesting that the existing protected area network may not be adequate for the conservation of brown bear in Iran. Our results suggest that effective conservation of brown bears in Iran requires protection of both core habitats and the corridors between them, especially outside Iran's network of protected areas.

AB  - Indicators on the state of global biodiversity illustrate continued decline, while pressure on biodiversity keeps rising. This necessitates revisiting site prioritization and species protection for conservation. Patterns of richness and threat of four well-studied aquatic taxa, the fishes, crabs, molluscs and dragonflies largely coincide at the continental scale, at least in Africa. For this study, we focus on dragonflies, for which there is a point locality database, as a surrogate taxon, modeling the species at the fine-scale, using species distribution modeling. With this approach, we built a protected areas network using spatial planning software. Priority areas for dragonfly conservation largely coincided with analyses of global biodiversity hotspots. The Zambian swamps and woodlands, as well as the rainforests of the Lower Guinea and Congo Basin are emphasized as hotspots of dragonfly diversity. Among globally threatened species, 72% were recorded at least once in a protected area. Although the current reserve network covers 10.7% of the landscape, the proportional representation of species geographic distributions in reserves is only 1.2%. The reserve network is therefore inefficient concerning freshwater species, and many areas of conservation priority that are not formally protected remain. The advantage of operating at the fine scale, while covering a large geographic area is that it shifts the focus from the large-scale hotspots to smaller priority areas within and beyond hotspots. Also, by operating at the fine-scale for a large geographical area, the potential exists for local conservation managers to consider campaigning for the inclusion of the priority areas that are not formally protected, while adjacent to the existing reserve networks. Where this is not possible, we recommend monitoring these areas to detect future threats to the habitats that these might face. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding of how a large landscape or network of conservation areas and habitats of red-listed species change in time is an important topic when addressing the temporal interplay between protected areas and matrix. We developed models of habitat suitability indices (HSI) for saproxylic red-listed invertebrate and fungal species, accounting for roughly 70% of all red-listed boreal forest species of the study area in eastern Finland. By using a forestry planning program that incorporates various optimisation methods we analysed trade-offs between timber production and amount of habitats of saproxylic red-listed species within a 60-year period. We also produced production possibility frontiers that show how to increase quality of the matrix with least costs. Moreover, we analysed how habitat suitability criteria used in optimisations affect the area of different habitat quality classes.
   Our analysis shows that by adopting HSI models in long-term matrix management, it is possible to increase habitats for several red-listed species without substantial losses in timber production. The increase in habitat area is achieved mainly by decreasing the area that is thinned compared to intensive timber production plan. In the long term, this seems to be a novel cost-effective method to increase the quality of the matrix for red-listed saproxylic species. However, the selected optimisation method and the criteria or specification of the management objective for red-listed forest species have a strong effect on results when HSI models are used in conservation planning. Therefore any practical application must be performed with great care. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biologists and policy-makers have the difficult task of allocating limited resources to habitat conservation and management for endangered species in the face of changing environmental conditions. Satellite remote sensing can inform conservation because it is an efficient means to obtain environmental data over broad spatial and temporal extents. Yet, the challenges of accessing, processing, and analyzing remote sensing data hinder wider application of these techniques in conservation planning. We used Landsat data and hierarchical statistical models to link satellite-derived habitat measurements with abundance of endangered Yuma Ridgway's rails (Rallus obsoletus yumanensis) within the Lower Colorado River Basin and Salton Sink, USA. We addressed many of the challenges facing the application of remote sensing techniques by using the web-based, freely-available Google Earth Engine to process Landsat datasets, apply habitat models, and generate maps to predict habitat suitability at a fine spatial grain (30 m) across the range of the species. These maps are shareable, interactive, and easy to update annually as habitat conditions change using a Google Earth Engine App we developed. Thus, we provide a framework for building habitat suitability models and maps to help target adaptive habitat management over broad extents for sensitive species, enabling biologists to improve conservation and restoration efforts regularly as conditions change in highly variable ecosystems. We demonstrate this approach for Yuma Ridgway's rails, but our methods for merging hierarchical statistical models with open-source mapping software to describe spatial-temporal heterogeneity in habitat quality are applicable to any species, and are especially helpful to species inhabiting highly variable ecosystems.

AB  - As climates change over the coming century, many species will experience range shifts. Some species that currently inhabit protected areas will move out of those areas and others will move in. Drawing on model projections from previous studies, we assessed potential changes in the representation of trees, birds, mammals, and amphibians in the protected areas of the Northern Appalachian/Acadian ecoregion of North America. Six of 17 tree species were projected to experience a reduction in the areas suitable for growth in the region's protected areas and 11 of the 17 were projected to gain representation. Seven of 14 bird species were projected to experience losses in representation of their suitable habitat and the other seven were projected to experience gains. Range-shift projections for mammals and amphibians indicated that the protected areas would likely experience 13% and 21% turnover in these species, respectively with roughly half of the species experiencing losses of suitable habitat in the reserves and half experiencing gains. Despite these potential changes, protected areas are still likely to be one of the best tools for protecting biodiversity in a changing climate. One of the major challenges for the coming decades will be to provide the connectivity that will facilitate movement out of, and into, protected areas.

AB  - Aim
   Gap analysis measures the percentage of protected species distribution and generally compares it to a representation target (i.e. minimum area to be protected). The results are used to identify species that need further protection, providing a quantitative baseline to address a possible expansion of a given protected area (PA) systems. However, the achievement of the same representation target may have different implications in terms of species persistence depending on population spatial structure and conservation needs. The aim was to investigate to what extent and why gap analysis may provide inequitable assessments of species protection.
   Location
   Europe.
   Methods
   We performed three gap analyses on 27 European species of carnivores and ungulates, measuring the level of protection according to three different types of distribution data: geographical ranges, habitat suitability models and habitat suitability models that incorporate the potential spatial structuring in populations within PAs.
   Results
   The estimated degree of species protection depends on the distribution proxy and the target adopted. When the analyses are based on areas able to support viable populations (irrespective of how these areas are quantified), the perceived relative protection of different species changes considerably. The ability of different species to persist in PA systems mostly depends on their population density and dispersal abilities, as well as the interaction between these two features, which eventually determines the number and relative size of the populations.
   Main conclusions
   The achievement of the same representation target for different species may imply protecting different numbers of individuals in populations having different spatial structures and may consequently lead to different probabilities of persistence across species. If species spatial structuring is disregarded, gap analysis may thus lead to inequitable assessments of PA coverage.

   LocationIberian Peninsula.
   MethodsWe used distribution data from 133 endemic water beetle species in the Iberian Peninsula. Climatic potential distributions were estimated by applying a multidimensional-envelope procedure based on climatic data (both current and future) and observed occurrences. Mahalanobis distances were calculated to obtain continuous climatic suitability values within the climatic potential distribution. Two protected area networks were assessed: National Parks (NPs) and Natura 2000 (N-2000). The average climatic suitability value for the cells overlapping with protected areas was calculated and compared with the average value of 10,000 random samples from the same number of cells within their entire potential distribution, which allowed to identify species whose climatic niches were optimally or marginally represented.
   ResultsFifty-seven and 104 of the 107 considered taxa were represented with at least one occurrence in NPs and N-2000, respectively, and the climatic potential distributions of 93 and all 107 taxa overlapped with NPs and N-2000. While the climatic niches of 48 and 38 taxa were marginally represented in NPs and N-2000, the climatic niches of only 11 and 29 were optimally represented by these two protected area networks. When predicted future climatic conditions were considered, both the climatic suitability values and the number of species whose potential distribution was represented by protected areas decreased.
   Main conclusionsAlthough the representation of endemic Iberian taxa could be considered adequate, these results show that for most of them the protected networks tend to include areas with climatic conditions close to the species tolerance limit, and the expected climate change only worsened this scenario. Thus, current protected areas cannot be considered to guarantee the long-term survival of the species considered in this study.

AB  - Wetland conservation in the Indo-tropics can benefit from the protection of the charismatic Fishing Cat. India, supporting ~ 40% of its known range, is a stronghold for the species. Here, using multiple information sources we outline a framework to safeguard fishing cats in India. Specifically, we a) estimated district-level Conservation priority scores (using presence records, and habitat suitability and habitat connectivity) to identify ecologically important habitats, b) estimated state-level Conservation likelihood scores assessing the success potential of any conservation intervention, c) collated district-level Conservation initiative information identifying ongoing efforts for species and/or habitat conservation. We consecutively assessed the spatial congruence between (a), (b) and (c) to delineate species' conservation areas and corresponding action goals (blueprint). Using information on habitat suitability, we also delineated survey landscapes. Although Fishing Cat records were found in 12 Indian states, only a small proportion of the state area was identified harbouring optimal habitat for the species. Three broad habitat clusters Terai arc, Eastern coast, and Brahmaputra floodplains were identified, with overall high habitat connectivity. Most districts ranking high in Conservation priority scored low in Conservation likelihood. Districts with Fishing Cat presence (n = 60) were delineated into four tiers of action landscapes and the majority of districts classified as survey landscapes (n = 156) were found in the Terai arc. We use our results to recommend and discuss conservation actions for districts identified in our blueprint. Flagship species conservation approach has substantial potential to enrich wetland conservation, for which our blueprint can act as a baseline.

AB  - Biodiversity and natural ecosystems are under pressure from a large range of drivers. In south eastern Australia these include periods of drought and occasional floods, increasing urbanisation pressures, changing land use patterns, altered fire frequency and regime, habitat loss and degradation, impacts of invasive species, etc. Detailed and reliable information about the spatial distribution of species provides critical information for effective conservation planning. In Victoria, Australia, this responsibility is held by the Department of Sustainability and Environment, which maintains and curates a database of site records for species: the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA). Although this database is comprehensive and contains many records for numerous species, the information is provided in point form. This point data can be useful for some planning and management tasks, but does not provide an adequate view of distribution for all management purposes. By integrating known occurrences of species with environmental GIS data layers using statistical or machine learning algorithms, it is possible to build models and to predict the likelihood that the species may occur at particular locations across large landscapes. We have used the VBA to build species distribution models (SDMs) for 523 vertebrate fauna species across the whole state, providing predictive 'maps' that are available for use in various conservation planning activities. In this paper, we introduce and discuss the methods we developed and implemented for producing these models.
   Modelling requires a number of steps: gathering species occurrence data, vetting or mining this data for useful records and winnowing out potentially misleading records, collating existing and / or developing new relevant environmental variables, selecting an appropriate modelling algorithm, training and evaluating models, mapping predictions to the whole state scale, and selecting a threshold to transform the continuous model result into binary (i.e. presence/absence) mapped outputs.
   All the occurrence data for the 523 fauna species were derived from the VBA. This database contains presence data for fauna species, but for the majority of survey techniques information on absences cannot be known or inferred. Twenty four explanatory variables were selected for use in developing models including 12 bioclimatic, terrain and soil radiometric (BTSR) variables, two coordinates (latitude and longitude), and 10 remotely sensed variables primarily derived from a time series of Landsat imagery. For each species, three versions of models (V1, V2 and V3 models) reflecting different constraint were built. V1 models used 12 BTSR variables; V2 models used 12 BTSR variables and two coordinates; and V3 models used all the 24 variables.
   Since true absence data was not available, pseudo-absences were created by filtering random points by a profile model based on Mahalanobis distance method. Using both pseudo-absences and the true presences data SDMs were developed with a machine learning algorithm, random forest, which was implemented in the statistical computing environment R. The models were evaluated using six accuracy measures, which have been demonstrated suitable for evaluating presence-only models. These metrics include AUL (area under the lift curve), MVDl (the maximum vertical distance from lift curve to the diagonal line), MPA (minimal predicted area with pre-specified true positive rate), VDl (vertical distance from lift curve to the diagonal line), Lift and Se (sensitivity). These measures can be used for both within-species and among-species model comparisons. A threshold was set for each model with a method based on maximising the sum of sensitivity and specificity to provide binary outputs or maps of species' distributions.

AB  - Several global strategies for protected area (PA) expansion have been proposed to achieve the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi target 11 as a means to stem biodiversity loss, as required by the Aichi target 12. However, habitat loss outside PAs will continue to affect habitats and species, and PAs may displace human activities into areas that might be even more important for species persistence. Here we measure the expected contribution of PA expansion strategies to Aichi target 12 by estimating the extent of suitable habitat available for all terrestrial mammals, with and without additional protection (the latter giving the counterfactual outcome), under different socio-economic scenarios and consequent land-use change to 2020. We found that expanding PAs to achieve representation targets for ecoregions under a Business-as-usual socio-economic scenario will result in a worse prognosis than doing nothing for more than 50% of the world's terrestrial mammals. By contrast, targeting protection towards threatened species can increase the suitable habitat available to over 60% of terrestrial mammals. Even in the absence of additional protection, an alternative socio-economic scenario, adopting progressive changes in human consumption, leads to positive outcomes for mammals globally and to the largest improvements for wide-ranging species.

AB  - Prediction error is considered an important problem in species distribution models. To address this issue, we here examined the accuracy of overlays of presence-only-based models for many individual species in representing patterns of assemblage diversity. For this purpose, we used a database of 977 160 records of seed plant occurrences on an intensively surveyed, species-rich island (Tenerife, Canary Islands) for modelling the distribution of all its 841 native plant species individually. The modelling was done using Maxent, one of the best-performing presence-only modelling techniques, using various thresholds to convert the estimated suitability values into predicted presence or absence. Distribution models for each individual species were overlaid to predict species richness and composition, which were then compared to the observed values for well-surveyed grid cells. We found high levels of compositional error, when the best performing suitability threshold for predicting species richness was applied. Our best prediction had a mean species richness error of 24% and a mean compositional error of 60% relative to the observed values for the well-surveyed cells; > 50% of all species were included erroneously in > 25% of the well-surveyed cells. Hence, large quantities of data are not necessarily enough to obtain reliable predictions of assemblage diversity, limiting the usefulness of this methodology in conservation planning.

AB  - Wild tiger numbers continue to decline despite decades of conservation action. Identification, conservation and restoration of tiger habitat will be a key component of recovering tiger numbers across Asia. To identify suitable habitat for tigers in the Russian Far East, we adopted a niche-based tiger habitat modeling approach, including biotic interactions with ungulate prey species, human activities and environmental variables to identify mechanisms driving selection and distribution of tiger habitat. We conducted >28,000 km of winter snow tracking surveys in 2004/2005 over 266,000 km(2) of potential tiger habitat in 970 sampling units (similar to 171 km(2)) to record the presence of tracks of tigers and their ungulate prey. We adopted a used-unused design to estimate Resource Selection Probability Functions (RSPF) for tigers, red deer, roe deer, sika deer, wild boar, musk deer and moose. Tiger habitat was best predicted by a niche-based RSPF model based on biotic interactions with red deer, sika deer and wild boar, as well as avoidance of areas of high human activity and road density. We identified 155,000 km(2) of occupied tiger habitat in the RFE in 17 main habitat patches. Degradation of tiger habitat was most extreme in the southern areas of the Russian Far East, where at least 42% of potential historic tiger habitat has been destroyed. To improve and restore tiger habitat, aggressive conservation efforts to reduce human impacts and increase ungulate densities, tiger reproduction and adult survival will be needed across all tiger habitat identified by our tiger habitat model.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) have been selected using either subjective or objective criteria applied to an extremely limited subset of biodiversity. Improved availability of species distribution data, better statistical tools to predict species distributions and algorithms to optimize spatial conservation planning allow many impediments to be overcome, particularly on small islands. This study analyses whether 219 species are adequately protected by PAs on Pico Island (the Azores, Portugal), and if they are as efficient as possible, maximizing species protection while minimizing costs. We performed distribution modelling of species' potential distributions, proposed individual conservation targets (considering the context of each species in the archipelago and their current conservation status) to determine the efficiency of current PAs in meeting such targets and identify alternative or complementary areas relevant for conservation. Results showed that current PAs do not cover all taxa, leaving out important areas for conservation. We demonstrate that by using optimization algorithms it is possible to include most species groups in spatial conservation planning in the Azores with the current resources. With increasing availability of data and methods, this approach could be readily extended to other islands and regions with high endemism levels.

AB  - Deforestation is currently the major threat to Amazonian tree species but climate change may surpass it in just a few decades. Here, we show that climate and deforestation combined could cause a decline of up to 58% in Amazon tree species richness, whilst deforestation alone may cause 19-36% and climate change 31-37% by 2050. Quantification is achieved by overlaying species distribution models for current and future climate change scenarios with historical and projected deforestation. Species may lose an average of 65% of their original environmentally suitable area, and a total of 53% may be threatened according to IUCN Red List criteria; however, Amazonian protected area networks reduce these impacts. The worst-case combined scenario-assuming no substantial climate or deforestation policy progress-suggests that by 2050 the Amazonian lowland rainforest may be cut into two blocks: one continuous block with 53% of the original area and another severely fragmented block. This outlook urges rapid progress to zero deforestation, which would help to mitigate climate change and foster biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Spatial transfers of species distribution models (SDMs) are often applied in the study of land use and climate-change effects, spread of invasive species and conservation planning. However, model transferability and risk of error are rarely evaluated prior to predicting species distribution to different regions. We aim to assess spatial transferability of SDMs for stream fish and to evaluate the effect of model types and habitat heterogeneity on transferability. We developed SDMs for 21 fish species and made predictions of occurrence of these species among five pairs of river catchments (i.e. model transfers). Forty eight transfers were made for each of three modelling approaches (Lasso-regularised logistic regression (LLR), boosted regression trees (BRT) and MaxEnt) after incorporating spatial autocorrelation. In addition to internal and external evaluation of discrimination power, we assessed the cross-catchment consistency of variable selections, fish-habitat relationships and predicted probabilities of species presences. Approximately half of 144 spatial transfers of SDMs had moderate to high discrimination power. Discrimination power was low for the rest of the models. Incorporating spatial autocorrelation could not improve discrimination power in the model transfers. Friedman test showed that BRT did not differ significantly from LLR but it outperformed MaxEnt in terms of AUC in the model transfers. BRT and LLR models tended to have high overall accuracy and specificity, whereas MaxEnt tended to have high sensitivity in the model transfers. The degree of model transferability varied among species, and was asymmetric when reciprocal transfers were made between paired catchments. Ranks of variable importance in BRT models differed among catchments for most species. Temperature, base flow index, altitude and habitat condition index were more often ranked as the most important predictors in the five study river catchments, although the functional forms of their effects on fish presence were sometimes inconsistent between paired catchments. Compared to published transferability of some terrestrial taxa SDMs, spatial transferability of stream-fish distribution models was limited, reflecting the natural barriers to dispersal among catchments, and the necessity of evaluating model transferability in conservation applications (e.g. evaluation of climate- or landscape-change effects, invasive species risk assessments and species reintroduction planning). We suggest the following strategies to enhance spatial transferability: (i) match the range and location of the habitat predictors between the model region and prediction region, or alternatively choose a model training region with a large extent and a wide range of environmental gradients; (ii) use presence-absence models such as BRT and LLR and (iii) include habitat features with a sound ecological basis such as temperature and hydrology.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in basic and applied ecology, making it important to understand sources and magnitudes of uncertainty in SDM performance and predictions. We analyzed SDM performance and partitioned variance among prediction maps for 15 rare vertebrate species in the southeastern USA using all possible combinations of seven potential sources of uncertainty in SDMs: algorithms, climate datasets, model domain, species presences, variable collinearity, CO2 emissions scenarios, and general circulation models. The choice of modeling algorithm was the greatest source of uncertainty in SDM performance and prediction maps, with some additional variation in performance associated with the comprehensiveness of the species presences used for modeling. Other sources of uncertainty that have received attention in the SDM literature such as variable collinearity and model domain contributed little to differences in SDM performance or predictions in this study. Predictions from different algorithms tended to be more variable at northern range margins for species with more northern distributions, which may complicate conservation planning at the leading edge of species' geographic ranges. The clear message emerging from this work is that researchers should use multiple algorithms for modeling rather than relying on predictions from a single algorithm, invest resources in compiling a comprehensive set of species presences, and explicitly evaluate uncertainty in SDM predictions at leading range margins.

AB  - Sponge aggregations have been recognised as key component of shallow benthic ecosystems providing several important functional roles including habitat building and nutrient recycling. Within the deep-sea ecosystem, sponge aggregations may be extensive and available evidence suggests they may also play important functional roles, however data on their ecology, extent and distribution in the North Atlantic is lacking, hampering conservation efforts. In this study, we used Maximum Entropy Modelling and presence data for two deep-sea sponge aggregation types, Pheronema carpenteri aggregations and ostur aggregations dominated by geodid sponges, to address the following questions: 1) What environmental factors drive the broad-scale distribution of these selected sponge grounds? 2) What is the predicted distribution of these grounds in the northern North Atlantic, Norwegian and Barents Sea? 3) How are these sponge grounds distributed between Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and High Seas areas? 4) What percentage of these grounds in High Seas areas are protected by the current High Seas MPA network? Our results suggest that silicate concentration, temperature, depth and amount of particulate organic carbon are the most important drivers of sponge distribution. Most of the sponge grounds are located within national EEZs rather than in the High Seas. Coordinated conservation planning between nations with significant areas of sponge grounds such as Iceland, Greenland and Faroes (Denmark), Norway (coastal Norway and Svalbard), Portugal and the UK, should be implemented in order to effectively manage these communities in view of the increasing level of human activity within the deep-sea environment.

AB  - 1. Although ecosystems are increasingly threatened worldwide, the resources available to set up management actions, such as conservation or restoration, remain severely limited. Methods designed to spatially allocate conservation and restoration actions while maximizing their ecological benefits are urgently needed. Whereas conservation planning methods have been extensively developed in past decades, improvements in restoration planning are still needed to build efficient management tools. This methodological gap may be explained by the difficulties encountered when estimating non-disturbed ecological conditions (i.e. reference conditions) which are usually required to compare past and present ecosystem states.
   2. Here, the species composition of stream fish assemblages in 607 river stretches of the Pas-de-Calais department in the north of France was predicted using species distribution models. Present occurrence was predicted according to four environmental variables, including two related to human-induced disturbances (i.e. proportion of river stretch length affected by hydraulic works and local geomorphological alterations). The fish assemblages potentially present in the absence of such disturbances were then predicted using hindcasting modelling which involves artificially setting to zero the values of the disturbance variables in the models.
   3. A framework based on a multi-faceted approach of diversity was applied to the present-day fish assemblages and those predicted under the two non-disturbed scenarios (i.e. restoration scenarios) to assess their suitability for management.
   4. While the theoretical restoration of the natural flow regimes was likely to result in few changes in fish assemblage composition and consequently in their multi-faceted diversity, the restoration of natural geomorphological characteristics was predicted to reduce the taxonomic diversity but increase the functional diversity, the natural heritage importance and the socio-economic value of the fish assemblages.
   5. This study provides environmental decision-makers with a tool to identify precisely and simultaneously the conservation and restoration actions that have to be undertaken as a priority, by comparing the present and non-disturbed multi-faceted diversity indices.

AB  - This paper focuses on a rare case of natural disappearance of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) in an extensive area without using traditional methods of eradication programs. The study was conducted both in the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (PRNH) Sesc Pantanal and in an adjacent traditional private cattle ranch. In 1998, feral pigs were abundant and widely distributed in the PRNH. However, the feral pigs gradually disappeared from the area and currently, the absence of pigs in the PRNH contrasts with the adjacent cattle ranch where the species is abundant. To understand the current distribution of the species in the region we partitioned the effects of variation of feral pigs' presence considering the habitat structure (local), landscape composition and the occurrence of potential predators. Additionally, we modeled the distributions of the species in Northern Pantanal, projecting into the past using the classes of vegetation cover before the PRNH implementation (year 1988). Our results show areas with more suitability for feral pigs in regions where the landscape is dominated by pastures and permeated by patches of Seasonal Dry Forest. The species tends to avoid predominantly forested areas. Additionally, we recorded that the environmental suitability decreases exponentially as the distance from water bodies increases. The disappearance of feral pigs in the PRNH area seems to be associated with changes in the landscape and vegetation structure after the removal of the cattle. In the Brazilian Pantanal, the feral pigs' occurrence seems strongly conditioned to environmental changes associated to livestock activity.

AB  - Observational studies have not yet shown that environmental variables can explain pervasive nonlinear patterns of species abundance, because those patterns could result from (indirect) interactions with other species (e.g., competition), and models only estimate direct responses. The experiments that could extract these indirect effects at regional to continental scales are not feasible. Here, a biophysical approach quantifies environment-species interactions (ESI) that govern community change from field data. Just as species interactions depend on population abundances, so too do the effects of environment, as when drought is amplified by competition. By embedding dynamic ESI within framework that admits data gathered on different scales, we quantify responses that are induced indirectly through other species, including probabilistic uncertainty in parameters, model specification, and data. Simulation demonstrates that ESI are needed for accurate interpretation. Analysis demonstrates how nonlinear responses arise even when their direct responses to environment are linear. Applications to experimental lakes and the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) yield contrasting estimates of ESI. In closed lakes, interactions involving phytoplankton and their zooplankton grazers play a large role. By contrast, ESI are weak in BBS, as expected where year-to-year movement degrades the link between local population growth and species interactions. In both cases, nonlinear responses to environmental gradients are induced by interactions between species. Stability analysis indi-cates stability in the closed-system lakes and instability in BBS. The probabilistic framework has direct application to conservation planning that must weigh risk assessments for entire habitats and communities against competing interests.

AB  - Aim Angolan Miombo woodlands, rich in timber species of the Leguminosae family, go through one of the highest rates of deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa. This study presents, on the basis of updated information of the distribution of Leguminosae timber species native to Angola, an integrated index framing the main threats for trees, which aims to support new conservation measures. Location Sub-Saharan Africa, Republic of Angola. Methods The current distribution areas of six Leguminosae timber species (i.e., Afzelia quanzensis, Brachystegia spiciformis, Guibourtia coleosperma, Isoberlinia angolensis, Julbernardia paniculata, and Pterocarpus angolensis) were predicted through ensemble modeling techniques. The level of threat to each species was analyzed, comparing the species potential distribution with a threat index map and with the protected areas. The threat index of anthropogenic and climatic factors encompasses the effects of population density, agriculture, proximity to roads, loss of tree cover, overexploitation, trends in wildfires, and predicted changes in temperature and precipitation. Results Our results revealed that about 0.5% of Angola's area is classified as of "Very high" threat, 23.9% as "High" threat, and 66.5% as "Moderate" threat. Three of the studied species require special conservation efforts, namely B. spiciformis and I. angolensis, which have a large fraction of predicted distribution in areas of high threat, and G. coleosperma since it has a restricted distribution area and is one of the most valuable species in international markets. The priority areas for the conservation of Leguminosae timber species were found in Benguela and Huila. Main conclusions This study provides updated data that should be applied to inform policymakers, contributing to national conservation planning and protection of native flora in Angola. Moreover, it presents a methodological approach for the predictions of species distribution and for the creation of a threat index map that can be applied in other poorly surveyed tropical regions.

AB  - Non-indigenous species (NIS) pose a major threat to biodiversity and the functioning and services of ecosystems. Despite their rapid spread in coastal waters worldwide, biotic invasions are widely disregarded in marine conservation planning. To guide conservation actions, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms determining the success of NIS are therefore needed. Here we develop a combined modelling approach to identify the key drivers and community assembly processes determining the occurrence of invasive benthic invertebrates, using Danish coastal waters as a case study. To reflect factors affecting the introduction, establishment and spread of NIS throughout the area, we compiled long-term monitoring data on NIS, as well as information on commercial shipping, environmental conditions and estimates of larvae settling densities derived from drift model simulations informed by species traits. We then applied a set of species distribution models to identify the key drivers determining the occurrence of NIS. Our results demonstrate a significant positive effect of vessel activity, a negative effect of depth and bottom salinity, as well as a positive effect of the simulated settling densities on the probability of presence. Taken together, our results highlight the role of commercial shipping, habitat characteristics and passive advection of early-life stages on the presence of NIS. Our combined modelling approach provide improved process understanding on the key community assembly processes determining the presence of NIS and may serve to guide monitoring, management and conservation planning in order to limit future invasions and their negative consequences on coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Identification of potential habitats of endemic species can facilitate conservation planning and rehabilitation programs in rangeland ecosystems. This study aimed to generate potential distribution maps of Astragalus verus Olivier, a valuable endemic and medicinal plant, in a semi-arid part of central Iran (with an approximate area of 1000 km(2)) using logistic regression (LR), nonparametric multiplicative regression (NPMR), and ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA) methods A stratified-random sampling approach was used to collect the presence-absence data, along with some environmental data, from 100 sites. Soil maps were obtained from 70 profiles, and climate maps were produced using data from 10 weather stations. Geostatistical methods were used to convert the obtained data to digital maps with 90m x 90m resolution. The species potential habitat maps were produced using ENFA, LR, NPMR, and an ensemble method. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using Cohen's kappa coefficient and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) based on both calibrated and independent data sets. Although no method was superior under all circumstances, ENFA performed slightly better due to the very high anthropogenic impacts in the study area. Potential habitat maps and the species response curves revealed that A. verus habitats were characterized by a pH of 7.5, moderate to relatively heavy soil texture (44%-48% clay content), moderate slope (10%-20%), low electrical conductivity (< 0.3 dS/m), and a soil saturation percentage of 45%-47%. These modeling approaches can be widely used to identify appropriate areas for rehabilitation and protection of endangered and valuable native plant species.

AB  - Aim It is increasingly recognized the importance of accounting for imperfect detection in species distribution modelling and conservation planning. However, the integration of detectability into a spatially explicit frame has received little attention. We aim (1) to show how to develop distribution maps of both detection probability and survey effort required to reliably determine a species presence/absence and (2) to increase awareness of the spatial variation of detection error inherent in studies of species occurrence.
   Location North-western Spain.
   Methods We registered the presence/absence of the endangered Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in 213 surveys performed in 40 of 104 territories once known to be occupied. We model simultaneously both detection probability and occurrence, using site occupancy modelling. With the resulting regression equations, we developed distribution maps of both detection probability and required sampling effort throughout the area.
   Results Of the studied territories, 72.5% were detected as occupied, but after accounting for imperfect detection, the proportion of sites truly occupied was 79%. Detectability decreased in territories with higher topographical irregularity and increased with both the time of day of the survey and the progress of the season. Spatial distribution of detectability showed a mainly north-south gradient following the distribution of slope in the area. The likelihood of occupancy increased with rockier, less forested surface and less topographical irregularity within the territory. A minimum of five surveys, on average, are needed to assess, with 95% probability, the occupancy status of a site, ranging from <= 3 to > 24 visits/territory depending on survey-and site-specific features.
   Main conclusions Accounting for detectability and its sources of variation allows us to elaborate distribution maps of detectability-based survey effort. These maps are useful tools to reliably assess (e.g. with 95% probability) occupancy status throughout a landscape and provide guidance for species conservation planning.

AB  - Species distribution modelling is increasingly used in ecological studies and is particularly useful in conservation planning. Models are, however, typically created with a coarse resolution, although conservation planning often requires a high resolution. In this study we created high resolution models and explored central aspects of the modelling procedure; transferability and predictive performance of the models. We created models for two breeding water bird species, common eider Somateria mollissima and herring gull Larus argentatus, based on data from two regions in the Finnish archipelago (234 islands). We used seven variables which we considered as potential predictors of nest site location: distance to forest, distance to rock and distance to low vegetation, exposure, elevation, slope and curvature of the land surface. We tested the predictive ability of the models crosswise between the areas by using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The models were transferable between our study areas and the predictive performance varied from fair to excellent. The most important predictors overall were exposure and distance to forest. More general models, with higher regularization values in the Maxent software, had better transferability regarding predictive performance. However, when we fitted a model based on 60% of the data from both regions and evaluated the model on the remaining 40%, the most complex model had the highest accuracy. Extrapolation of SDMs, evaluated on data from the same region, should therefore always be done with caution as the most accurate model might not have the best transferability if it is not general enough.

AB  - The effectiveness of a system of reserves may be compromised under climate change as species' habitat shifts to nonreserved areas, a problem that may be compounded when well-studied vertebrate species are used as conservation umbrellas for other taxa. The Northwest Forest Plan was among the first efforts to integrate conservation of wide-ranging focal species and localized endemics into regional conservation planning. We evaluated how effectively the plan's focal species, the Northern Spotted Owl, acts as an umbrella for localized species under current and projected future climates and how the regional system of reserves can be made more resilient to climate change. We used the program maxent to develop distribution models integrating climate data with vegetation variables for the owl and 130 localized species. We used the program zonation to identify a system of areas that efficiently captures habitat for both the owl and localized species and prioritizes refugial areas of climatic and topographic heterogeneity where current and future habitat for dispersal-limited species is in proximity. We projected future species' distributions based on an ensemble of contrasting climate models, and incorporating uncertainty between alternate climate projections into the prioritization process. Reserve solutions based on the owl overlap areas of high localized-species richness but poorly capture core areas of localized species' distribution. Congruence between priority areas across taxa increases when refugial areas are prioritized. Although core-area selection strategies can potentially increase the conservation value and resilience of regional reserve systems, they accentuate contrasts in priority areas between species and over time and should be combined with a broadened taxonomic scope and increased attention to potential effects of climate change. Our results suggest that systems of fixed reserves designed for resilience can increase the likelihood of retaining the biological diversity of forest ecosystems under climate change.

AB  - 1. To develop a conservation management plan for a species, knowledge of its distribution and spatial arrangement of preferred habitat is essential. This is a difficult task, especially when the species of concern is in low abundance. In south-western Victoria, Australia, populations of the rare rufous bristlebird Dasyornis broadbenti are threatened by fragmentation of suitable habitat. In order to improve the conservation status of this species, critical habitat requirements must be identified and a system of corridors must be established to link known populations. A predictive spatial model of rufous bristlebird habitat was developed in order to identify critical areas requiring preservation, such as corridors for dispersal.
   2. Habitat models generated using generalized linear modelling techniques can assist in delineating the specific habitat requirements of a species. Coupled with geographic information system (GIS) technology, these models can be extrapolated to produce maps displaying the spatial configuration of suitable habitat.
   3. Models were generated using logistic regression, with bristlebird presence or absence as the dependent variable and landscape variables, extracted from both GIS data layers and multispectral digital imagery, as the predictors. A multimodel inference approach based on Akaike's information criterion was used and the resulting model was applied in a GIS to extrapolate predicted likelihood of occurrence across the entire area of concern. The predictive performance of the selected model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) technique. A hierarchical partitioning protocol was used to identify the predictor variables most likely to influence variation in the dependent variable. Probability of species presence was used as an index of habitat suitability.
   4. Negative associations between rufous bristlebird presence and increasing elevation, 'distance to creek', 'distance to coast' and sun index were evident, suggesting a preference for areas relatively low in altitude, in close proximity to the coastal fringe and drainage lines, and receiving less direct sunlight. A positive association with increasing habitat complexity also suggested that this species prefers areas containing high vertical density of vegetation.
   5. The predictive performance of the selected model was shown to be high (area under the curve 0.97), indicating a good fit of the model to the data. Hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that all the variables considered had significant independent contributions towards explaining the variation in the dependent variable. The proportion of the total study area that was predicted as suitable habitat for the rufous bristlebird (using probability of occurrence at a greater than or equal to 0.5 level) was 16%.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The spatial model clearly delineated areas predicted as highly suitable rufous bristlebird habitat, with evidence of potential corridors linking coastal and inland populations via gullies. Conservation of this species will depend on management actions that protect the critical habitats identified in the model. A multiscale approach to the modelling process is recommended whereby a spatially explicit model is first generated using landscape variables extracted from a GIS, and a second model at site level is developed using fine-scale habitat variables measured on the ground. Where there are constraints on the time and cost involved in measuring finer scale variables, the first step alone can be used for conservation planning.

AB  - The Vu Gia Thu Bon (VGTB) watershed in Central Vietnam is enclosed by the foothills of the Annamite Mountains in the north, west and south. The Annamite Mountains are known for their elevated level of biodiversity, but the VGTB watershed faces increasing pressures from economic growth, urbanization, and agricultural expansion. This leads to an increasing loss and fragmentation of near-natural forest ecosystems by an extension of the road network and clearing of forests for agricultural land and plantations of exotic species. The main objective of this research is to identify priority areas for biodiversity conservation based on tree species distribution patterns, and to link these priority areas by a biodiversity corridor. Species distribution models show highest levels of potential tree species richness in the northwestern part of the watershed bordering Lao PDR, and in the highlands in the south at the border to Kon Tum Province. The protected area network covers a proportion of the areas of higher potential tree species richness, but leaves a gap in the northwestern part of the VGTB watershed. In order to close that gap, a new protected area should be established, and be connected to existing protected areas with stepping stones, small areas of elevated high potential tree species richness or with plantations of native tree species with high economic and ecological value. Awareness-building measures for both, biodiversity conservation as well as the use of native tree species for income generation have to be carried out to sensitize local communities.

AB  - Increasingly, biogeographical knowledge and analysis are playing a fundamental role in assessing the representativeness of biodiversity in protected areas, and in identifying critical areas for conservation. With almost 20% of the country assigned to protected areas, Chile is well above the conservation target (i.e. 10-12%) proposed by many international conservation organizations. Moreover, the Chilean government has recently proposed new conservation priority sites to improve the current protected area network. Here, we used all 653 terrestrial vertebrate species present in continental Chile to assess the performance of the existing and proposed reserve networks. Using geographical information systems, we overlaid maps of species distribution, current protected areas, and proposed conservation priority sites to assess how well each species is represented within these networks. Additionally, we performed a systematic reserve selection procedure to identify alternative conservation areas for expanding the current reserve system. Our results show that over 13% of the species are not covered by any existing protected area, and that 73% of Chilean vertebrate species can be considered partial gaps, with only a small fraction of their geographical ranges currently under protection. The coverage is also deficient for endemic (species confined to Chile) and threatened species. While the proposed priority sites do increase coverage, we found that there are still several gaps and these are not the most efficient choices. Both the gap analysis and the reserve selection analysis identified important areas to be added to the existing reserve system, mostly in northern and central Chile. This study underscores the need for a systematic conservation planning approach to redefine the conservation priority sites in order to maximize the representation of species, particularly endemic and threatened species.

AB  - Fire has shaped Australia?s diverse mammal fauna for millennia. However, ongoing changes to fire regimes threaten native mammal populations, and a significant conservation challenge is to understand and promote desirable forms of pyrodiversity (variation in fire regimes). A way forward is to quantify how different aspects of pyrodiversity influence whole mammal assemblages and produce dynamic maps of species distributions to inform conservation. We aimed to determine and map how spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes correlates with a diverse mammal assemblage comprising macropods, microbats, rodents, small marsupials and a monotreme. We built species distribution models for 17 species against fire, climate and environmental covariates in fire-prone woodlands of semi-arid Australia. Spatial measures of fire included the area, diversity and configuration of landscape elements, and temporal measures included time since fire and fire frequency. Native mammals showed a variety of responses to pyrodiversity. Microbats were more likely to occur as time since fire increased, whereas rodents were correlated with recently burned areas. Small dasyurid marsupials were correlated with the area of older post-fire age-classes, while western grey kangaroo occurrence was positively associated with high diversity of post-fire ages. Our new approach, using predictive models to map mammal distributions in relation to spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes, provides outputs that managers can use to improve conservation planning. This enables the positive and negative effects of fire to be better understood and will assist in achieving desirable forms of pyrodiversity that meet the needs of whole mammal assemblages.

AB  - Habitat destruction and overexploitation are the main threats to biodiversity and where they co-occur, their combined impact is often larger than their individual one. Yet, detailed knowledge of the spatial footprints of these threats is lacking, including where they overlap and how they change over time. These knowledge gaps are real barriers for effective conservation planning. Here, we develop a novel approach to reconstruct the individual and combined footprints of both threats over time. We combine satellite-based land-cover change maps, habitat suitability models and hunting pressure models to demonstrate our approach for the community of larger mammals (48 species > 1 kg) across the 1.1 million km(2) Gran Chaco region, a global deforestation hotspot covering parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. This provides three key insights. First, we find that the footprints of habitat destruction and hunting pressure expanded considerably between 1985 and 2015, across 40% of the entire Chaco - twice the area affected by deforestation. Second, both threats increasingly acted together within the ranges of larger mammals in the Chaco (17% increase on average, +/- 20% SD, cumulative increase of co-occurring threats across 465 000 km(2)), suggesting large synergistic effects. Conversely, core areas of high-quality habitats declined on average by 38%. Third, we identified remaining priority areas for conservation in the northern and central Chaco, many of which are outside the protected area network. We also identify hotspots of high threat impacts in central Paraguay and northern Argentina, providing a spatial template for threat-specific conservation action. Overall, our findings suggest increasing synergistic effects between habitat destruction and hunting pressure in the Chaco, a situation likely common in many tropical deforestation frontiers. Our work highlights how threats can be traced in space and time to understand their individual and combined impact, even in situations where data are sparse.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) underpin the sustainable management of marine ecosystems but require accurate knowledge of species distributions. Recently, advances in tracking technology and habitat modelling have enabled the production of large-scale species distribution models (SDM), which provide the basis for hotspot mapping. In the UK, hotspot mapping to inform seabird MPA identification has involved converting observed or predicted distributions to polygons using either Maximum Curvature or Getis-Ord (Gi*) analysis. Here, we apply both mapping techniques to UK-wide, breeding season SDM predictions for four seabird species (Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, Common Guillemots Uria aalge, Razorbills Aka torda and European Shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis) in order to compare their performance and inform seabird MPA. When using Maximum Curvature, grid cells within the identified maximum curvature boundaries were defined as hotspots. For Getis-Ord analysis, we defined hotspots as either (1) grid cells containing the top 1% or (2) the top 5% Gi* scores or (3) cells in which Gi* scores were statistically significant. Hotspots based upon Maximum Curvature or statistically significant Gi* scores covered the greatest area and were generally larger than current marine Special Protection Areas. Hotspots based on the top 1% or top 5% of Gi* scores were smaller and were concentrated around the largest breeding colonies. All hotspot methods consistently identified several high-density areas that should be prioritised for seabird conservation. Ultimately, the choice of hotspot identification method should be informed by considering species ecology alongside conservation goals to ensure hotspots are of sufficient size to protect target populations.

AB  - The habitats and food resources required to support breeding and migrant birds dependent on North American prairie wetlands are threatened by impending climate change. The North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) hosts nearly 120 species of wetland-dependent birds representing 21 families. Strategic management requires knowledge of avian habitat requirements and assessment of species most vulnerable to future threats. We applied bioclimatic species distribution models (SDMs) to project range changes of 29 wetland-dependent bird species using ensemble modeling techniques, a large number of General Circulation Models (GCMs), and hydrological climate covariates. For the U.S. PPR, mean projected range change, expressed as a proportion of currently occupied range, was -0.31 (+/- 0.22 SD; range -0.75 to 0.16), and all but two species were projected to lose habitat. Species associated with deeper water were expected to experience smaller negative impacts of climate change. The magnitude of climate change impacts was somewhat lower in this study than earlier efforts most likely due to use of different focal species, varying methodologies, different modeling decisions, or alternative GCMs. Quantification of the projected species-specific impacts of climate change using species distribution modeling offers valuable information for vulnerability assessments within the conservation planning process.

AB  - The continuing decline and loss of biodiversity has caused an increase in the use of interventionist conservation tools, such as translocation. However, many translocation attempts fail to establish viable populations, with poor release site selection often flagged as an inhibitor of success. We used species distribution models (SDMs) to predict the climate suitability of 102 release sites for amphibians, reptiles, and terrestrial insects and compared suitability predictions between successful and failed attempts. We then quantified the importance of climate suitability relative to 5 other variables frequently considered in the literature as important determinants of translocation success: number of release years, number of individuals released, life stage released, origin of the source population, and position of the release site relative to the species' range. Probability of translocation success increased as predicted climate suitability increased and this effect was the strongest among the variables we considered, accounting for 48.3% of the variation in translocation outcome. These findings should encourage greater consideration of climate suitability when selecting release sites for conservation translocations and we advocate the use of SDMs as an effective way to do this.

AB  - Species distribution models are an important component of natural-resource conservation planning efforts. Independent, external evaluation of their accuracy is important before they are used in management contexts. We evaluated the classification accuracy of two species distribution models designed to predict the distribution of pygmy rabbit Brachylagus idahoensis habitat in southwestern Wyoming, USA. The Nature Conservancy model was deductive and based on published information and expert opinion, whereas the Wyoming Natural Diversity Database model was statistically derived using historical observation data. We randomly selected 187 evaluation survey points throughout southwestern Wyoming in areas predicted to be habitat and areas predicted to be nonhabitat for each model. The Nature Conservancy model correctly classified 39 of 77 (50.6%) unoccupied evaluation plots and 65 of 88 (73.9%) occupied plots for an overall classification success of 63.3%. The Wyoming Natural Diversity Database model correctly classified 53 of 95 (55.8%) unoccupied plots and 59 of 88 (67.0%) occupied plots for an overall classification success of 61.2%. Based on 95% asymptotic confidence intervals, classification success of the two models did not differ. The models jointly classified 10.8% of the area as habitat and 47.4% of the area as nonhabitat, but were discordant in classifying the remaining 41.9% of the area. To evaluate how anthropogenic development affected model predictive success, we surveyed 120 additional plots among three density levels of gas-field road networks. Classification success declined sharply for both models as road-density level increased beyond 5 km of roads per km-squared area. Both models were more effective at predicting habitat than nonhabitat in relatively undeveloped areas, and neither was effective at accounting for the effects of gas-energy-development road networks. Resource managers who wish to know the amount of pygmy rabbit habitat present in an area or wanting to direct gas-drilling efforts away from pygmy rabbit habitat may want to consider both models in an ensemble manner, where more confidence is placed in mapped areas (i.e., pixels) for which both models agree than for areas where there is model disagreement.

AB  - Effects of climate change are particularly important in the Mediterranean Biodiversity hotspot where rising temperatures and drought are negatively affecting several plant taxa, including endemic species. Assisted colonisation (AC) represents a useful tool for reducing the effect of climate change on endemic plant species threatened by climate change.
   We combined species distribution models (SDMs) for 188 taxa endemic to Italy with the IUCN red listing range loss threshold under criterion A (30%) to define: (a) the number of AC (measured as 2 x 2 km grid cells that should be occupied by new populations, i.e. grid cells = new populations) required to fully compensate for predicted range loss and to halt the decline below the 30% of range loss; (b) The number of cells necessary to compensate for range loss was calculated as the number of currently occupied cells lost under future climate due to unsuitable conditions. We used two representative concentration pathways, +2.6 and +8.5 W/m(2), optimistic and pessimistic scenarios respectively. Availability of suitable areas for AC was also assessed within the current species distribution and within protected areas.
   Under the optimistic scenario, no taxa would lose more than 30% of their range and AC would not be required. Under the pessimistic scenario, roughly the 90% of taxa showed a cell loss higher than 30%. Eight taxa were predicted to lose >95% of their range. For these species, AC was required from 13 to 16 new populations (=13-16 grid cells) per taxon to cap the range loss at 30%. For currently VU or EN species, an average number of 32-35 AC attempts would be necessary to fully compensate their range loss under a pessimistic scenario. Suitable recipient sites within protected areas falling in their projected range were identified, allowing for short-distance AC.
   Synthesis. Combining species distribution models and red listing thresholds under Criterion A has enabled the strategic planning of multiple species assisted colonisation minimising the effort in terms of new populations to be created and maximising the conservation benefit in terms of range loss compensation.

AB  - Lack of information about ichthyofauna makes it difficult to predict human effects on the communities. In this study, the effects of the environmental and human factors were examined on altitudinal patterns of fish habitat selection, faunal changes, species richness and fish abundance from upstream to downstream in the southern part of the central Alborz Protected Area during 2016 and 2017. 366 fish individuals of five species in three families were identified and brown trout was the dominant species. The river was divided into three zones based on habitat structure, species composition and influence of physical and chemical variables. The results indicate that, in some situations, including small changes in habitat structure indices, physical and chemical variables along the altitudinal gradient are more effective in habitat preference, describing the composition, and abundance. Chemical variables can help to have a better understanding of the conventional patterns, shaped by the habitat structure and physical variables. Habitat suitability index model for brown trout in three zones is completely different over the two years and this species could overcome these conditions. However, upstream areas were more appropriate. Dam, with decreases of outlet water temperature, also creates homogeneous and simple habitats leading to changes in expected fish distribution patterns with decreasing altitude. These conditions may have increased habitat suitability index for the brown trout in downstream, while despite favorable ecological conditions in the middle zone, habitat suitability index and alternative habitats available in this zone are likely to decline due to density and interspecific competition. The natural pattern of fish distribution and habitat selection varies along the altitudinal gradient due to various factors and human disturbances. Optimal management of protected areas can control the effects of some of these factors at least temporarily.

AB  - 1. Maintaining ecological processes that underpin the functioning of marine ecosystems requires planning and management of marine resources at an appropriate spatial scale.
   2. The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBR) is the world's largest World Heritage Area (approximately 348 000 km(2)) and second largest marine protected area. It is difficult to inform the planning and management of marine ecosystems at that scale because of the high cost associated with collecting data. To address this and to inform the management of coastal (approximately 15 m below mean sea level) habitats at the scale of the GBR, this study determined the presence and distribution of seagrass by generating a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based habitat suitability model.
   3. A Bayesian belief network was used to quantify the relationship (dependencies) between seagrass and eight environmental drivers: relative wave exposure, bathymetry, spatial extent of flood plumes, season, substrate, region, tidal range and sea surface temperature. The analysis showed at the scale of the entire coastal GBR that the main drivers of seagrass presence were tidal range and relative wave exposure. Outputs of the model include probabilistic GIS-surfaces of seagrass habitat suitability in two seasons and at a planning unit of cell size 2 km x 2 km.
   4. The habitat suitability maps developed in this study extend along the entire GBR coast, and can inform the management of coastal seagrasses at an ecosystem scale. The predictive modelling approach addresses the problems associated with delineating habitats at the scale appropriate for the management of ecosystems and the cost of collecting field data.

AB  - Conservation planning in estuaries has lagged behind that in terrestrial and marine areas, despite these valuable ecosystems being among the most degraded. The core of any such approach is a reliable habitat classification and inventory of target biota. These data, and particularly the latter, are often lacking at the local-regional scales most relevant to estuarine management. This study presents a quantitative approach for predicting the likely fish and benthic invertebrate assemblages at any unsampled estuarine site using readily-obtainable and enduring biophysical attributes. We apply this scheme to an urbanised estuary and predict the above faunas throughout its entire nearshore zone. These data are then used to systematically design an exploratory spatially-efficient reserve that meets representation targets for numerous faunal conservation features, and test the ability of an existing, unsystematically-derived Marine Park to do the same.
   Spatial patterns in the enduring biophysical attributes of local-scale habitats provided good to excellent surrogates for those in the fish and invertebrate faunas. All unsampled sites were then successfully assigned to their respective habitat and correlated fauna using biophysical measurements and a predictive decision tree. The resultant spatially-continuous 'faunal map' enabled quantification of 67 conservation features, from which reserves aimed at representing 10-30% of each feature were systematically derived. All reserves were highly efficient and almost always met representation targets, contrasting with the existing Marine Park which underrepresented 40-80% of features. Reserve designs were, however, spread throughout the system, highlighting the complexities in designing representative reserves for estuarine environments that capture their spatiotemporal diversity.

AB  - The temperate waters of the North-Eastern Atlantic have a long history of maritime resource richness and, as a result, the European Union is endeavouring to maintain regional productivity and biodiversity. At the intersection of these aims lies potential conflict, signalling the need for integrated, cross-border management approaches. This paper focuses on the marine megafauna of the region. This guild of consumers was formerly abundant, but is now depleted and protected under various national and international legislative structures. We present a meta-analysis of available megafauna datasets using presence-only distribution models to characterise suitable habitat and identify spatially-important regions within the English Channel and southern bight of the North Sea. The integration of studies from dedicated and opportunistic observer programmes in the United Kingdom and France provide a valuable perspective on the spatial and seasonal distribution of various taxonomic groups, including large pelagic fishes and sharks, marine mammals, seabirds and marine turtles. The Western English Channel emerged as a hotspot of biodiversity for megafauna, while species richness was low in the Eastern English Channel. Spatial conservation planning is complicated by the highly mobile nature of marine megafauna, however they are important components of the marine environment and understanding their distribution is a first crucial step toward their inclusion into marine ecosystem management.

AB  - Aim
   We seek to demonstrate that whilst information derived from phylogeographic and landscape genetic approaches has been used broadly to further ecological and evolutionary hypothesis testing, it can also be used to further species modelling approaches, particularly where bioclimatic and demographic methodologies are to be combined to tackle climate change adaptation and conservation planning.
   Location
   General application.
   Methods
   We start with a review of species distribution modelling studies that have used data derived from molecular marker studies, and identify which parameters can realistically be derived from molecular marker studies for inclusion in species and ecosystem distribution prediction and conservation planning.
   Results
   We find that the uptake of phylogeographic and landscape genetic methods to inform species distribution modelling studies has to date been limited (particularly the latter approaches), despite offering clear potential to improve species modelling approaches that aim to combine climatic envelope and demographic parameters. Using a series of cases studies, we demonstrate that phylogeographic approaches can be particularly useful for identifying biogeographic barriers and refugia, testing alternative demographic models, identifying concordant demographic patterns between species within a single ecosystem and testing temporal niche conservatism. We also find that landscape genetic approaches are particularly useful for quantifying landscape permeability and source/sink dynamics of meta-populations and identifying adaptive variation in the landscape. A summary of parameters that are derivable from such studies for modelling and conservation applications is provided.
   Main conclusions
   Molecular marker methods have much to offer species distribution modelling, particularly in the field of climate adaptation. Molecular information can inform on species historical dynamics and contemporary demography necessary to advance species modelling paradigms that seek to integrate climatic and demographic drivers. Furthermore, recognizing diversity below species level and incorporating this information into modelling frameworks will enable conservation managers to plan for the capture of areas of evolutionary potential.

AB  - The simplest type of model describing animal habitats is a "cover-type model," in which a species is assumed to be present in certain vegetation types and absent in others. Ecologists and managers use these models to predict animal distributions for gap analysis and conservation planning. Critics, however, have suggested that the models are overly simplistic and inaccurate. We reviewed the use of cover-type models including assessing their error rates, diagnosing the problems with these models, and determining how they should best be used by managers. To determine models' accuracy rates, we conducted a meta-analysis of 35 studies in which cover-type models were tested against data on animal occurrences. Models had a mean accuracy rate of 0.71 +/- A 0.18 (SD). Rates of commission error averaged 0.20 +/- A 0.16, and omission errors averaged 0.09 +/- A 0.11. A review of the effects of errors in conservation planning suggests that the observed error rates were high enough to call into question any management decisions based on these models. Reasons for the high error rates of cover-type models include the fallibility of expert opinion, the fact that the models oversimplify how animals actually use habitats, and the dynamic nature of animal populations. Given the high rate of errors in cover-type models, any conclusions based on them should be taken with extreme caution. We suggest that these models are best used as coarse filters to identify locations for further study in the field.

AB  - Global climate is rapidly changing and while many studies have investigated the potential impacts of this on the distribution of montane plant species and communities, few have focused on those with oceanic montane affinities. In Europe, highly sensitive bryophyte species reach their optimum occurrence, highest diversity and abundance in the northwest hyperoceanic regions, while a number of montane vascular plant species occur here at the edge of their range. This study evaluates the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of these species and assesses the implications for EU Habitats Directive-protected oceanic montane plant communities. We applied an ensemble of species distribution modelling techniques, using atlas data of 30 vascular plant and bryophyte species, to calculate range changes under projected future climate change. The future effectiveness of the protected area network to conserve these species was evaluated using gap analysis. We found that the majority of these montane species are projected to lose suitable climate space, primarily at lower altitudes, or that areas of suitable climate will principally shift northwards. In particular, rare oceanic montane bryophytes have poor dispersal capacity and are likely to be especially vulnerable to contractions in their current climate space. Significantly different projected range change responses were found between 1) oceanic montane bryophytes and vascular plants; 2) species belonging to different montane plant communities; 3) species categorised according to different biomes and eastern limit classifications. The inclusion of topographical variables in addition to climate, significantly improved the statistical and spatial performance of models. The current protected area network is projected to become less effective, especially for specialised arctic-montane species, posing a challenge to conserving oceanic montane plant communities. Conservation management plans need significantly greater focus on potential climate change impacts, including models with higher-resolution species distribution and environmental data, to aid these communities' long-term survival.

AB  - Madagascar is one of the most biodiverse countries in Africa, due to its level of endemism and species diversity. However, the pressure of human activities threatens the last patches of natural vegetation in the country and conservation decisions are undertaken with limited data availability. In this study, we use free online datasets to generate distribution models of 1539 endemic trees and prioritise for conservation and restoration considering threat, alongside conservation value and cost. Threats considered include illegal logging, forest degradation and agriculture or slash and burns activities. We found that the areas with the highest potential concentration of species are along the north and south-east of the country where more than 400 tree species can be found. Most scenarios identify a common conservation and restoration priority area along the north east of the country. Our findings guide managers, conservation organizations or governments in decisions about where to invest their limited conservation resources.

AB  - Climate can play a critical role in seed development and germination. Linking seed germination information with environmental variables and provenance may be important in understanding plant community structure and response to climate change, which can help guide conservation planning. Native Hawaiian Metrosideros (Myrtaceae; Modified Letter Turned CommaOhiModified Letter Turned Commaa) is a hyperdiverse species complex that dominates HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai's wet and mesic forests and serves as the most bioculturally important native plant in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai. In response to Rapid Modified Letter Turned CommaOhiModified Letter Turned Commaa Death, a major threat to native forests caused by introduced fungal pathogens, seed collections of Modified Letter Turned CommaOhiModified Letter Turned Commaa across the state have increased. We used initial seed germination data from recent collections stored in the National Tropical Botanical Garden's Seed Bank to explore if seed germinability is correlated with seed zones and environmental variables. Linear models of the proportion of seed germinated, seed zones, and environmental data revealed that only seed zones were significantly correlated with the proportion germinated. Seed germination was lower for the "Na Pali Valleys" than the "Windward Ranges." Generalized provisional seed zones are a helpful tool for conservation collecting and restoration planning. Germination data routinely collected for seed bank collections provide an easily accessible source of preliminary information for these purposes.

AB  - Quantitative conservation objectives require detailed consideration of the habitat requirements of target species. Tree-living bryophytes, lichens, and fungi are a critical and declining biodiversity component of boreal forests. To understand their requirements, Bayesian methods were used to analyze the relationships between the occurrence of individual species and habitat factors at the tree and the stand scale in a naturally fragmented boreal forest landscape. The importance of unexplained between-stand variation in occurrence of species was estimated, and the ability of derived models to predict species' occurrence was tested. The occurrence of species was affected by quality of individual trees. Furthermore, the relationships between occurrence of species at the tree level and size and shape of stands indicated edge effects, implying that some species were restricted to interior habitats of large, regular stands. Yet for the habitat factors studied, requirements of many species appeared similar. Species occurrence also varied between stands; most of the seemingly suitable trees in some stands were unoccupied. The models captured most variation in species occurrence at tree level. They also successfully accounted for between-stand variation in species occurrence, thus providing realistic simulations of stand-level occupancy of species. Important unexplained between-stand variation in species occurrence warns against a simplified view that only local habitat factors influence species' occurrence. Apparently, similar stands will host populations of different sizes due to historical, spatial, and stochastic factors. Thus, habitat suitability cannot be assessed simply by population sizes, and stands lacking a species may still provide suitable habitat and merit protection.

AB  - Recent extinction rates suggest that humans are now causing the sixth mass extinction, and the Mediterranean islands are at the forefront of many of the environmental issues involved. This study provides an alternative approach for investigating documented local plant extinctions that occurred in Sardinia (western Mediterranean) during the last half century. A total of 190 local extinctions of 62 plant species were used to investigate the independent effects of eight ecological and anthropogenic variables and to model the areas of potential extinctions where plant conservation efforts could be focused. If all analysed plant species were considered together, ecological factors explained local extinctions more than anthropogenic factors. The independent effects of each factor considerably varied among species of different lifeforms and altitude ranges. Accordingly, distribution models of local extinctions outscored areas that are potentially rich in plant species with conservation interest, but which are particularly affected by humans. This paper suggests a reproducible, operational framework for analysing which extinction factors may play important roles in similar contexts and where they might be relevant.

AB  - Simple Summary Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus L.) populations and their habitat decreased significantly over the past decades due to unsustainable, long-term hunting and deforestation. To support the species' conservation, we assessed its potential distribution, conservation priority areas, core patch fragmentation, and potential connectivity corridors in Northeast China. We concluded that large areas of a high-quality M. moschiferus habitat with low fragmentation and low human influence remain in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains. In contrast, a habitat in the Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Changbai Mountains was highly fragmented and highly influenced by human activity. The Greater Khingan Mountains offer a suitable habitat for the recovery of M. moschiferus populations in Northeast China. These findings offer recommendations to support the Chinese government's goal of establishing protected area systems with national parks in Northeast China. Species conservation actions are guided by available information on the biogeography of the protected species. In this study, we integrated the occurrence data of Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus L.) collected from 2019 to 2021 with species distribution models to estimate the species' potential distribution in Northeast China. We then identified conservation priority areas using a core-area zonation algorithm. In addition, we analyzed core patch fragmentation using FRAGSTATS. Lastly, we identified potential connectivity corridors and constructed a potential protection network based on the least-cost path and the circuit theory. The results showed concentrations of M. moschiferus in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains, the southeastern Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the eastern Changbai Mountains, with a potential distribution area of 127,442.14 km(2). Conservation priority areas included 41 core patches with an area of 106,306.43 km(2). Patch fragmentation mainly occurred in the Changbai Mountains and the Lesser Khingan Mountains. We constructed an ecological network composed of 41 core patches and 69 linkages for M. moschiferus in Northeast China. The results suggest that the Greater Khingan Mountains represent the most suitable area to maintain the stability of M. moschiferus populations in Northeast China. Considering the high habitat quality requirements of M. moschiferus and its endangered status, we propose that the Chinese government accelerates the construction of the Greater Khingan Mountains National Park and the Lesser Khingan Mountains National Park and enlarges the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park to address the fragmentation of protected areas and the habitat of M. moschiferus.

AB  - Aim To identify the relationships between volunteer bird survey effort and motivations in order to prioritize investment in future surveying activities. Location South-west Western Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot. Methods We developed nine hypotheses for volunteer motivations to predict the probability of a bird survey being undertaken anywhere in the landscape using data from the New Atlas of Australian Birds. We then established three goals for surveying in the study region: (1) equal representation of surveys across the landscape, (2) surveys stratified by habitat type and (3) representation of surveys in protected areas. We developed a function to estimate the benefit of investing in professional surveys, given the probability of a volunteer survey taking place and the survey goal, and calculated the cost of meeting a surveying goal with and without accounting for the probability of cells not being surveyed by volunteers. Results A model combining the location of protected areas, location of previous records of threatened species and habitat diversity was the strongest predictor of the probability of a volunteer bird survey being conducted. Each surveying goal resulted in different areas being prioritized for future surveying, indicating the importance of setting clear objectives before undertaking broad-scale monitoring or surveying activities. If our primary goal is stratified protected area representation in surveys, there are huge cost savings if only protected areas with a 70% predicted probability of not being surveyed by volunteers are selected for professional surveys. Main conclusions Professional sampling in survey gaps is required to reduce bias in volunteer-collected datasets. Using models of volunteer behaviour, we can identify areas unlikely to be surveyed. If these areas are important for the project objective, then we can either provide incentives for volunteers or carry out professional surveying. These analyses are best carried out before data collection commences.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation in the Ukrainian Carpathians cannot be accomplished without a clear understanding of the factors negatively impacting habitats and species, and long-term projection of these impacts. One factor that may severely alter the ecosystems involved is the introduction and spread of invasive plant species, but the potential distribution and spatial aggregation of suitable habitats for several invaders have not been quantified. The Maxent approach was used to model the potential establishment within the entire mountain range of 11 alien invasive plant species based on stratified sampling and herbaria records and six variables representing climatic extremes, topography, and anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Predictions of habitat suitability were projected to two future change scenarios depicting increasing rates of climate warming and anthropogenic disturbances in 2050 and 2100. Under current climate and disturbance patterns, the models predicted suitable habitats for invasive species establishment to be aggregated in the southwest, east and north-east of the Ukrainian Carpathians, along major rivers and roads at altitudes of up to c. 700 m. Eight per cent of the total area within protected areas was predicted to be potentially susceptible to invasion by at least one species, with 13% of these susceptible habitats being suitable for all 11 species. Under the future change scenarios, suitable habitat ranges increased significantly in the entire study area and within regions of high conservation value. All species were projected to gain suitable habitats at higher altitudes along linear habitats and to potentially expand their ranges laterally from habitats predicted as suitable for current conditions along small rivers and roads. Under the scenario solely of increased average seasonal temperatures, suitable habitats for the establishment of at least one species within protected areas and a proposed ecological network increased by more than 15 percentage points by 2050 and by more than 30 percentage points by 2100 when compared with predictions for current conditions. Similar future patterns were discernible for the aggregation of suitable habitats for all 11 species. Incorporating increases in anthropogenic pressures into climatic-change projections led to a significantly greater projected expansion of suitable habitats for establishment as compared to scenarios considering only climatic changes. As the 11 species have already established viable populations within protected areas, further spread of at least one species is likely if conservation planning is not changed to include the management of invasive species in such areas.

AB  - Application of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS)as a tool has assumed an immense significance in habitat suitability modelling for various wildlife species and now a days these are widely used in conservation biology and wildlife management.
   This paper evaluates habitat suitability for tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) in Chandoli National Park, India. This research provides information about potential areas that can be declared as Tiger Reserve, a federal designation of protection. Habitat evaluation was completed in the Chandoli National Park (17 degrees 04' 00 '' N to 17 degrees 19' 54 '' N and 73 degrees 40' 43 '' E to 73 degrees 53' 09 '' E) using habitat suitability index (HSI). Remotely sensed data of satellite IRS-P6, LISS-III of 25th February 2005 was procured from National Remote Sensing Agency, India. The satellite imagery data was digitally processed and collateral data were generated from topographic maps in a GIS framework. Various layers of different variables such as landuse land cover, forest density, measures of proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created based on ground truthing. These layers, GPS location of animal's presence and "binomial multiple logistic regression (BMLR)" techniques were integrated in a GIS environment for the HSI modelling.
   Results indicate that approximately 160.48 km(2) (55%) of the forest of Chandoli National Park is highly suitable for herbivores population, and 176.52 km(2) (50%) of the Park is suitable for tigers. Therefore, this study concludes that forest areas within the Chandoli National Park are appropriate for consideration as Tiger Reserve.
   Furthermore, the identification and mapping of wildlife corridors and other forest patches lying in between neighboring protected area like Koyana sanctuary, suggests that these region of Sahyadri range of Western Chats should be included into the proposed Tiger Reserve. This will be a benefit for tigers, as tigers require larger and least disturbed forest habitats for establishing and maintaining their high-density population. Fortunately, in May 2008 the Government of India declared Chandoli NP as tiger reserve. Thus declaration of Chandoli National Park as a Tiger Reserve reflects that the habitat suitability model developed by us for tiger was not only statistically sound but also has potential to be considered while taking any decision regarding wildlife habitat management.

AB  - The United Nations General Assembly in 2006 and 2009 adopted resolutions that call for the identification and protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) from significant adverse impacts of bottom fishing. While general criteria have been produced, there are no guidelines or protocols that elaborate on the process from initial identification through to the protection of VMEs. Here, based upon an expert review of existing practices, a 10-step framework is proposed: (1) Comparatively assess potential VME indicator taxa and habitats in a region; (2) determine VME thresholds; (3) consider areas already known for their ecological importance; (4) compile information on the distributions of likely VME taxa and habitats, as well as related environmental data; (5) develop predictive distribution models for VME indicator taxa and habitats; (6) compile known or likely fishing impacts; (7) produce a predicted VME naturalness distribution (areas of low cumulative impacts); (8) identify areas of higher value to user groups; (9) conduct management strategy evaluations to produce trade-off scenarios; (10) review and reiterate, until spatial management scenarios are developed that fulfil international obligations and regional conservation and management objectives. To date, regional progress has been piecemeal and incremental. The proposed 10-step framework combines these various experiences into a systematic approach. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Location Europe.
   Methods Using recently updated catchment-scale species data and climate projections from multiple climate models, we assessed the climate change threat by the 2050s for 1648 European freshwater plants, fishes, molluscs, odonates, amphibians, crayfish and turtles for two dispersal scenarios and identified hot-spots of change at three spatial scales: major river basins, countries and freshwater ecoregions. We considered both common species and the often overlooked rare species. To set our findings within the context of current and future conservation networks, we evaluated the coverage of freshwater biodiversity by Europe's protected area network.
   Results Six per cent of common and 77% of rare species are predicted to lose more than 90% of their current range. Eight fish species and nine mollusc species are predicted to experience 100% range loss under climate change. As the most species-rich group, molluscs are particularly vulnerable due to the high proportion of rare species and their relatively limited ability to disperse. Furthermore, around 50% of molluscs and fish species will have no protected area coverage given their projected distributions.
   Main conclusions We identified the species most at threat due to projected changes in both catchment suitability and representation within the European protected area network. Our findings suggest an urgent need for freshwater management plans to facilitate adaptation to climate change.

AB  - The potential threats and habitat preferences of noxious plants in tropical countries are poorly known. Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a robust tool that can be used in conservation planning for early detection of invasion risks. However, the use of SDM for the strategic management of increasing risks of such plant invasions in Sri Lanka has not been undertaken due to several underlying reasons including the long-lasting data gap, technical, technological, and financial issues. In addition, the literature relevant to SDM applications in the country is substantially poor, scattered, and unpublished. Therefore, in this article, we explore SDM applications relevant to invasive plants in Sri Lanka with implications similar to other countries in the tropics. We examine the challenges and potentials for utilization of SDM technology in conservation planning in Sri Lanka and discuss data gap as a major obstacle. We also identify the potential SDM interventions relevant to invasive plants control and management in Sri Lanka and recommend conservation planners to prioritize them and apply for the strategic management of invasive plants in Sri Lanka. Finally, we suggest some recommendations to make an enabling environment in relevant institutions for the utilization of SDM technology in ecosystem management planning in Sri Lanka.

AB  - The spatial distribution of Pinna nobilis densities have been analysed through a geostatistical approach in the MPA of Cabrera National Park, Balearic Islands (Spain), Western Mediterranean Sea. Regression kriging was used to model the effect of environmental variables on the density of living individuals of P. nobilis and generate a predictive map of its distribution within the MPA. The environmental variables considered for the model were: depth; slope; habitat type and heterogeneity; wave exposure; and MPA zoning. A total of 378 transects were randomly distributed with a total of 149,000 m(2) surveyed at a depth range from 4.2 to 46 m. The recorded P. nobilis densities are among the highest in the Mediterranean Sea. With respect to the prediction model, results indicate that benthic habitats play a key role in the spatial distribution of P. nobilis, with higher densities in seagrass meadows of Posidonia oceanica. The fan mussel population density peaked at 9 m depth, decreasing with depth. Also, decreasing densities are expected with increasing exposure to waves. The predicted map shows some hotspots of density different in size and distributed along the MPA, and provides valuable information for the spatial conservation management of this species.

AB  - Identifying priority conservation areas plays a significant role in conserving biodiversity under climate change, but uncertainties create challenges for conservation planning. To reduce uncertainties in the conservation planning framework, we developed an adaptation index to assess the effect of topographic complexity on species adaptation to climate change, which was incorporated into the conservation framework as conservation costs. Meanwhile, the species distributions were predicted by the Maxent model, and the priority conservation areas were optimized during different periods in Sichuan province by the Marxan model. Our results showed that the effect of topographic complexity was critical for species adaptation, but the adaptation index decreased with the temperature increase. Based on the conservation targets and costs, the distributions of priority conservation areas were mainly concentrated in mountainous areas around the Sichuan Basin where may be robust to the adaptation to climate change. In the future, the distributions of priority conservation areas had no evident changes, accounting for about 26% and 28% of the study areas. Moreover, most species habitats could be conserved in terms of conservation targets in these priority conservation areas. Therefore, our approach could achieve biodiversity conservation goals and be highly practical. More importantly, quantifying the effect of topography also is critical for options for planning conservation areas in response to climate change.

AB  - Urbanization and linear infrastructure are reported to influence amphibian assemblages and populations. In areas undergoing rapid infrastructure development and urbanization, the mounting threats to biodiversity are evident. Although protected area coverage and focus on charismatic species conservation are well recognized, non-charismatic species such as amphibians are far from mainstream conservation actions and policies in Nepal. Studies on pattern and distribution of amphibians are limited, as are the roles of environmental variables in amphibian diversity in the urban landscape. This study was designed to assess the frog species richness and correlates of amphibian occurrence in Kathmandu valley. Visual encounter survey of 161 belt transects was carried out in August 2018. Data analysis used two part or Hurdle regression methods where the richness of frogs was considered a response variable. A total of 10 frog species belonging to six families were recorded. The occurrence of frogs was negatively associated with the dry soil conditions and positively associated with increased distance from roads. Occurrence of frogs along road distance gradient depicts the influence of urban infrastructure in amphibian distribution. This entails consideration of systematic conservation planning for rapidly urbanizing areas. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Data on the occurrence of species are widely used to inform the design of reserve networks. These data contain commission errors (when a species is mistakenly thought to be present) and omission errors (when a species is mistakenly thought to be absent), and the rates of the two types of error are inversely related. Point locality data can minimize commission errors, but those obtained from museum collections are generally sparse, suffer from substantial spatial bias and contain large omission errors. Geographic ranges generate large commission errors because they assume homogenous species distributions. Predicted distribution data make explicit inferences on species occurrence and their commission and omission errors depend on model structure, on the omission of variables that determine species distribution and on data resolution. Omission errors lead to identifying networks of areas for conservation action that are smaller than required and centred on known species occurrences, thus affecting the comprehensiveness, representativeness and efficiency of selected areas. Commission errors lead to selecting areas not relevant to conservation, thus affecting the representativeness and adequacy of reserve networks. Conservation plans should include an estimation of commission and omission errors in underlying species data and explicitly use this information to influence conservation planning outcomes.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning has been used extensively throughout the world to identify important areas for maintaining biodiversity and functional ecosystems, and is well suited to address large-scale biodiversity conservation challenges of the twenty-first century. Systematic planning is necessary to bridge implementation, scale, and data gaps in a collaborative effort that recognizes competing land uses. Here, we developed a conservation planning process to identify and unify conservation priorities around the central and southern Appalachian Mountains as part of the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (App LCC). Through a participatory framework and sequential, cross-realm integration in spatial optimization modeling we highlight lands and waters that together achieve joint conservation goals from LCC partners for the least cost. This process was driven by a synthesis of 26 multi-scaled conservation targets and optimized for simultaneous representation inside the program Marxan to account for roughly 25% of the LCC geography. We identify five conservation design elements covering critical ecological processes and patterns including interconnected regions as well as the broad landscapes between them. Elements were then subjected to a cumulative threats index for possible prioritization. The evaluation of these elements supports multi-scaled decision making within the LCC planning community through a participatory, dynamic, and iterative process.

AB  - Range shifts due to climate change may cause species to move out of protected areas. Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here, we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, and Western Europe) to examine the need for additional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species representation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future, under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario, and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action. According to our projections, costs may vary among regions and none of the three areas studied will fully meet all conservation targets, even under a moderate climate change scenario. This suggests that limiting climate change is an essential complement to adding protected areas for conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) have become integral tools in scientific research and conservation planning. Despite progress in the assessment of various statistical models for use in SDMs, little has been done in way of evaluating appropriate ecological models. In this paper, we evaluate the multiscale filter framework as a suitable theoretical model for predicting freshwater fish distributions in the upper Green River system (Ohio River drainage), USA. The spatial distributions of six fishes with contrasting biogeographies were modeled using boosted regression trees and multiscale landscape data. Species biogeography did not appear to affect predictive performance and all models performed well statistically with receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.87 to 0.98. Predictive maps show accurate estimations of ranges for five of six species based on historical collections. The relative influence of each type of environmental feature and spatial scale varied markedly with between species. A hierarchical effect was detected for narrowly distributed species. These species were highly influenced by soil composition at larger spatial scales and land use/land cover (LULC) patterns at more proximal scales. Conversely, WLC pattern was the most influential feature for widely distributed at all spatial scales. Using multiscale data capable of capturing hierarchical landscape influences allowed production of accurate predictive models and provided further insight into factors controlling freshwater fish distributions.

AB  - The research objective was to demonstrate the use of soil fauna groups as a tool for monitoring of the "Springs Complex of Corbii Ciungi" protected area (the IUCN category 4), Dambovita County, Romania. Some ecological indicators were quantified: taxonomic diversity, numerical abundance, dominance, evenness, equitabilty, Acari/Collembola ratio; Oribatida+Mesostigmata/Prostigmata+Astigmata ratio; correlations between the investigated communities and environmental factors (soil layer thickness, air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and moisture, soil pH. soil penetration resistance, exposure, slope, amount of organic carbon, total N, soil nutrients and the vegetation cover). Transects located near the water sources, were characterised by biological indicators with higher values. There was a significant interdependence between environmental variables. They influenced the abundance and distribution of the edaphic taxonomic groups. Statistical multivariate analysis showed that certain edaphic groups (From a total of 34 taxonomical taxa) are dependent especially on soil moisture e.g. Lumbricidae. Collembola and Oribatida.

AB  - The contribution of protected areas to biodiversity conservation is well attested but many taxa in many regions remain dependent on the unprotected wider landscape. To develop conservation plans for large mammals such as the Endangered pygmy hippopotamus Choeropsis liberiensis of West Africa's Upper Guinea Forests it is critical to understand the importance of unprotected land. Despite being a conservation priority, little is known about the habitat associations of this species, or its distribution across its range. Through a combination of field surveys, species distribution models and community questionnaires we investigated the use of unprotected areas by the pygmy hippopotamus in the Sierra Leone-Liberia border region. We found signs of the species in 128 of 525 1-km(2) cells surveyed. Our analysis suggested that the species is reasonably widespread in this region and is associated with major rivers. It occurred close to, but rarely within, large areas of intact forest, and 80.4% of pygmy hippopotamus signs were recorded outside protected areas. The expansion of the protected area network in this area is unrealistic in Sierra Leone and to some extent in Liberia, mainly because of anthropogenic pressure and the overlap of proposed protected areas with mining and logging concessions. Thus pygmy hippopotamus conservation activities in the region need to include programmes on community lands while maintaining a robust network of protected forests. Community-based conservation of the pygmy hippopotamus may prove valuable for other threatened and endemic species that are not confined to protected areas in this region.

AB  - Aim: Predicting accurate species responses to climate change in fragmented landscapes is challenging in conservation biogeography. We assessed the role of dispersal, including long-distance dispersal (LDD), for the long-term persistence of a rare plant species (Vella pseudocytisus subsp. paui) under current climate conditions and four future climate scenarios; and analysed the effect of competition for its regional survival.
   Location: Ester Iberian system, Aragon, Spain.
   Methods: We used BioMove, a linked modelling platform that integrates demographic, dispersal and competition features with biogeographic predictions of range dynamics, and whose results can inform risk assessments and conservation planning. We linked Vella's population dynamics and habitat suitability models with its well-documented life history traits and ecological characteristics to enhance our understanding of its inherent vulnerability to dispersal, competitive interactions and climate change.
   Results: We found thresholds in the effect of long dispersal distances on population persistence, suggesting a mid-distance optimum, which reduces mortality risk associated with the increasing proportion of LDD seeds. Moreover, increasing the proportion of LDD propagules reduces Vella's ability to compete in currently occupied and nearby unoccupied habitats by reducing the number of local recruitments.
   Main conclusions: Whereas LDD ability is generally assumed to be beneficial for the long-term persistence of plant species in fragmented landscapes, our results suggest that moderate to high distances between new colonization increase the species' dispersal-related mortality. Higher numbers of LDD events reduce the number of local propagules in established populations, reducing regional survival for Vella. Moreover, associated range shifts of potentially better climate-adapted competitors could prevent Vella individuals from colonizing new climatically suitable habitats. These findings can support development of more efficient conservation management strategies for establishing new population patches to mitigate population losses due to climate change. Our findings may also apply as a framework for other narrowly distributed endemic shrub species, particularly edaphic endemics.

AB  - Expanding the network of protected areas is a core strategy for conserving biodiversity in the face of climate change. Here, we explore the impacts on reserve network cost and configuration associated with planning for climate change in the USA using networks that prioritize areas projected to be climatically suitable for 1460 species both today and into the future, climatic refugia and areas likely to facilitate climate-driven species movements. For 14% of the species, networks of sites selected solely to protect areas currently climatically suitable failed to provide climatically suitable habitat in the future. Protecting sites climatically suitable for species today and in the future significantly changed the distribution of priority sites across the USA-increasing relative protection in the northeast, northwest and central USA. Protecting areas projected to retain their climatic suitability for species cost 59% more than solely protecting currently suitable areas. Including all climatic refugia and 20% of areas that facilitate climate-driven movements increased the cost by another 18%. Our results indicate that protecting some types of climatic refugia may be a relatively inexpensive adaptation strategy. Moreover, although addressing climate change in conservation plans will have significant implications for the configuration of networks, the increased cost of doing so may be relatively modest. This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.

AB  - The conservation outcomes of a protected area depend on management actions. The effectiveness of protected area management remains a concern for donors and policy-makers. However, very few feasible methods assessing the ability and performance of management teams have been developed. Behavioral shifts in habitat usage, direct and sensitive wildlife responses to threats, have been ignored in the evaluation of protected area management. To address the technical limitations, we developed a method that uses the behavioral dynamics of target species as indicators of the efficacy of threat reduction, control, and overall management effort. By comparing wildlife behavior with threat avoidance distances and patterns we can examine threat mitigation efficacy as a proxy for overall reserve management effectiveness. Using evidence of giant panda habitat utilization in eleven reserves across Qinling Mountains from 2000 to 2012, we built a model of behavior based on the avoidance of four types of anthropogenic threat. We stratified the eleven reserves into five efficacies, of which Changqing reserve was deemed to have the highest management effectiveness. Our approach was validated and supported by changes in suitable habitat and population size across reserves. Focusing on the end result of all threats and management effort means that our framework is straightforward for reserve staff to implement, produces easily interpreted results, and is worthy of application. This study highlights the value of behavioral dynamics when making a full and scientific assessment of the effectiveness of protected area management, and helps investors and policy-makers realize the efficacy of conservation inputs.

AB  - The projections of species distribution models (SDMs) have provided critical knowledge for conservation planning under climate change in the Republic of Korea. However, uncertainty about the SDM projections has been criticized as a major challenge to reliable projections. The present research investigated uncertainty among competing models (Model uncertainty) and uncertainty of future climate conditions (climate uncertainty) driving from different GCMs and CO2 emission scenarios in predicting the future distributions of plants. For this purpose, using nine single-model algorithms and the pre-evaluation weighted ensemble method, we modeled the geographical distributions of Silver Magnolia (Machilus thunbergii Siebold & Zucc.), a warm-adapted evergreen broadleaved tree; furthermore, we predicted its future distributions under 20 climate change scenarios (5 global circulation models (GCMs) x 4 CO2 emission scenarios (RCPs)). The results showed a great variation in the accuracies of nine single-model projections: the mean AUC values of nine single-models ranged from 0.764 (SER) to 0.970 (RF), and the mean TSS ranged from 0.529 (SRE) to 0.852 (RF). RF (mean AUC= 0.970, mean TSS = 0.852) and the ensemble forecast (AUC= 0.968, TSS=0.804) showed the highest predictive power, while SRE showed the lowest. The future distributions of Silver Magnolia projected with the ensemble SDM clearly varied according to GCMs and RCPs. The twenty climate scenarios produced twenty different projections of the magnolia prospective distribution. GCMs commonly projected the maximum range expansion under RCP 8.5 in 2050 and 2070, but CO2 emission scenarios explaining the minimum expansions differed according to GCMs. In conclusion, our results show that GCMs, CO2 emission scenarios and SDM algorithms produce considerable variations in the SDM projections. Therefore, this research suggests that understanding of model and climate uncertainties is critical for an effective conservation planning in forest management under climate change on the Korean Peninsula.

AB  - Remotely sensed imagery, coupled with wildlife habitat models provide a powerful tool for the implementation, assessment, and monitoring of wildlife conservation/restoration initiatives. Observed, empirical relationships between a species abundance metric and landscape structure/composition are used to structure models. Habitat suitability models always represent a trade off between breadth of applicability and specificity. Large-spatial extent, coarse spatial resolution data sets may be useful for characterizing potential animal distributions at regional or continental scales; however, habitat models developed at this spatial scale may have little applicability for predicting suitability at finer spatial resolutions. Whereas numerous issues related to multi-scale analysis have been acknowledged with respect to wildlife habitat models, only recently have sources of high-resolution imagery been readily available for site-specific analyses. We outline a multi-scale approach to habitat modeling and demonstrate this approach with northern bobwhite. We developed a coarse resolution model appropriate for identifying,focal regions likely to support bobwhite using classified LandSat imagery and relative abundance measures from breeding season call counts. Then we developed a fine resolution model based on 4-m multispectral IKONOS imagery and animal space-use for planning and implementing conservation practices at the local scale. We discuss the application of this hierarchical approach to conservation planning.

AB  - Aim: Climate is considered a major driver of species distributions. Long-term climatic means are commonly used as predictors in correlative species distribution models (SDMs). However, this coarse temporal resolution does not reflect local conditions that populations experience, such as short-term weather extremes, which may have a strong impact on population dynamics and local distributions. We here compare the performance of climate- and weather-based predictors in regional SDMs and their influence on future predictions, which are increasingly used in conservation planning.
   Location: South-western Germany.
   Methods: We built different SDMs for 20 Orthoptera species based on three predictor sets at a regional scale for current and future climate scenarios. We calculated standard bioclimatic variables and yearly and seasonal sets of climate change indicating variables of weather extremes. As the impact of extreme events may be stronger for habitat specialists than for generalists, we distinguished species' degrees of specialization. We computed linear mixed-effects models to identify significant effects of algorithm, predictor set and specialization on model performance and calculated correlations and geographical niche overlap between spatial predictions.
   Results: Current predictions were rather similar among all predictor sets, but highly variable for future climate scenarios. Bioclimatic and seasonal weather predictors performed slightly better than yearly weather predictors, though performance differences were minor. We found no evidence that specialists are more sensitive to weather extremes than generalists.
   Main conclusions: For future projections of species distributions, SDM predictor selection should not solely be based on current performances and predictions. As long-term climate and short-term weather predictors represent different environmental drivers of a species' distribution, we argue to interpret diverging future projections as complements. Even if similar current performances and predictions might imply their equivalency, favouring one predictor set neglects important aspects of future distributions and might mislead conservation decisions based on them.

AB  - Biodiversity is dramatically declining worldwide due to the complex processes that include interactions among threats. Studies investigating how multiple drivers (inter)act to influence spatio-temporal shifts in species distribution ranges, which are among the most anticipated changes in biodiversity in the future, are still scarce in the scientific literature, particularly at meaningful conservation planning scales. We used species occurrence data for eight terrestrial Mediterranean carnivores at a regional scale of southern Spain to: 1) estimate environmental favourability to each species during two periods (1960s and present); 2) predict current favourability assuming the same environment-species relationships as the ones observed in the 1960s (expected favourability); and 3) analyse single and interactive effects of human persecution, presence of protected areas, and prey richness on favourability changes (present vs. expected) for each carnivore species. We found that, with a few exceptions, environmentally favourable areas for carnivore occurrence were more widely distributed in the past than today and, for most species, favourability tended to increase inside protected areas, with low frequency of poisoning events and high prey richness. Notwithstanding, for rare species such as Iberian grey wolf (Canis lupus signatus) and Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), interactions among drivers were the most important predictors of favourability changes, underpinned by a compensatory role of protected areas in the face of continued human persecution. We emphasize the role of protected areas in abating the effects of biodiversity threats and claim that scientific studies based on analyses of single-effect drivers that omit driver interactions may misinform conservation planning and require revision.

AB  - Understanding the impact of land-cover mosaics on crocodile distribution and habitat patterns is essential to prioritize areas for their conservation in human-dominated landscapes. This is especially important for species with specialist requirements; or where there is human-wildlife conflict, as is the case in many areas with crocodiles, such as Myanmar's Ayeyarwady Delta. The saltwater crocodile is used as a surrogate species in this study to identify important conservation areas, and to propose potential protected areas for the Ayeyarwady coastal mangrove ecoregion. In total, 684 locations of saltwater crocodile encounters were collected, 444 for the wet season (May to June), and 240 for the dry season (December to January) between 1999 and 2018. Suitable habitats of saltwater crocodiles in the Ayeyarwady Delta were modelled for wet and dry seasons, using 12 predictor variables at 300-m resolution. The area of suitable habitat in the wet season is about 1,272.3 km(2) but reduces to 563.7 km(2) in the dry season. Distance to the cropland, distance to the sea, mangrove cover, and wetland cover are identified as the key landscape variables that contributed to the seasonal habitat distribution of saltwater crocodiles in the Ayeyarwady Delta. Protecting core and buffer areas in Kadonkani Reserved Forest and Pyindayae Reserved Forest would safeguard the seasonal habitats of saltwater crocodiles. Khaing Thaung Island, an unprotected area with suitable habitat areas for saltwater crocodiles, is proposed as a potential marine protected area in the Ayeyarwady Delta of Myanmar.

AB  - In Europe, agricultural practices have progressively evolved towards high productivity leading either to the intensification of productive and accessible areas or to the abandonment of less profitable sites. Both processes have led to the degradation of semi-natural habitats like extensive grasslands, threatening species such as the Eurasian Scops Owl Otus scops that rely on extensively managed agricultural landscapes. In this work, we aimed to assess the habitat preferences of the Scops Owl using habitat suitability models combined with a multi-scale approach. We generated a set of multi-scale predictors, considering both biotic and abiotic variables, built on two newly developed vegetation management and orthopteran abundance models. To select the variables to incorporate in a 'best multi-scale model', we chose the best spatial scale for each variable using univariate models and by calculating their relative importance through multi-model inference. Next, we built ensembles of small models (ESMs) at 10 different scales from 50 to 1000 m, and an additional model with each variable at its best scale ('best multi-scale model'). The latter performed better than most of the other ESMs and allowed the creation of a high-resolution habitat suitability map for the species. Scops Owls showed a preference for dry sites with extensive and well-structured habitats with 30-40% bush cover, and relied strongly on semi-extensive grasslands covering at least 30% of the surface within 300 m of the territory centre and with high orthopteran availability near the centre (50-m radius), revealing a need for good foraging grounds near the nest. At a larger spatial scale within a radius of 1000 m, the habitat suitability of Scops Owls was negatively related to forest cover. The resulting ESM predictions provide valuable tools for conservation planning, highlighting sites in need of particular conservation efforts together with offering estimates of the percentage of habitat types and necessary prey abundance that could be used as targets in future management plans to ensure the persistence of the population.

AB  - 1. Correlative species distribution models can be used to produce spatially explicit estimates of environmental suitability for organisms. This process can provide meaningful information for a range of purposes (e.g. estimating a species' current or future distribution, estimating dispersal limits, predicting occupancy for conservation planning) but, like all statistical exercises, is subject to numerous assumptions and can be influenced by several sources of potential bias.
   2. In this issue of Journal of Applied Ecology, we (Murray et al. 2011) employ a correlative species distribution model for infection with the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), cause of amphibian chytridiomycosis, to derive useful information for the immediate management and research of this pathogen in Australia. Also in this issue, Rohr, Halstead & Raffel (2011) comment on some of the potential limitations of our approach and the value of our results in practice.
   3.Synthesis and applications. Here we show that while a focus on mechanisms of dispersal and transmission among hosts, as advocated in both studies, is an important objective for modelling Bd distribution under climate change or at invasion fronts, correlative models can be of immediate value for their ability to generate a baseline hypothesis about the current potential distribution of this lethal pathogen and for efficiently identifying gaps in current knowledge. As demonstrated in our paper, this should help improve the immediate allocation of limited research and management resources for future surveillance efforts and proactive species conservation.

AB  - Climate change is causing many irreversible changes in the Himalayan ecosystems. In this study, an attempt was made to understand the ecological response of medicinal plant species to changing climate conditions in the Sikkim Himalaya, a part of the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) approach was used to analyze the potential habitat distribution of 163 medicinal plant species in current and future climates (2050, 2070). An attempt was also made to identify the most suitable areas for conservation and test the effectiveness of the existing Protected Area (PA) network in conserving medicinal plant species in current and future climate scenarios through the Habitat Suitability and Overlap Analyses. SDM analyses revealed that the majority of the medicinal plant species are found in the tropical and sub-tropical regions in the Sikkim Himalaya (300-2000 m) at present. In future climates, however, most of the species are likely to show an upward and northward shift in their distributions. Maximum species-rich regions are likely to shift by 200 m and 400 m in 2050 and 2070, respectively. A total of 13-16% of medicinal plant species currently found in the region are likely to lose their existing potential habitats by 2050 and 2070. The results highlight that species that are restricted to specific localities and have a narrow elevational distribution are the most vulnerable species and likely to go extinct due to climate change in the Himalaya. Habitat suitability analyses indicated that elevations ranging from 860 to 2937 m serve as highly suitable habitats for medicinal plant species in Sikkim Himalaya. Consequently, these areas can be focused for conservation actions in order to mitigate the effect of climate change. The results of Overlap Analysis indicated that out of 8 PAs in Sikkim Himalaya, only 5 PAs are effective in the conservation of medicinal plant species in current and future climates. The boundaries of existing PAs need to be expanded in order to accommodate the upward shifts in the spatial distribution of species, especially in the case of those PAs that are located in the lower elevations or tropical regions. This study provides a novel integrated framework for use of ecological informatics in assessing the species vulnerability to climate change and planning conservation priorities.

AB  - As natural habitats become fragmented by human activities, animals must increasingly move through human-dominated systems, particularly agricultural landscapes. Mapping areas important for animal movement has therefore become a key part of conservation planning. Models of landscape connectivity are often parameterized using expert opinion and seldom distinguish between the risks and barriers presented by different crop types. Recent research, however, suggests different crop types, such as row crops and orchards, differ in the degree to which they facilitate or impede species movements. Like many mammalian carnivores, bobcats (Lynx rufus) are sensitive to fragmentation and loss of connectivity between habitat patches. We investigated how distinguishing between different agricultural land covers might change conclusions about the relative conservation importance of different land uses in a Mediterranean ecosystem. Bobcats moved relatively quickly in row crops but relatively slowly in orchards, at rates similar to those in natural habitats of woodlands and scrub. We found that parameterizing a connectivity model using empirical data on bobcat movements in agricultural lands and other land covers, instead of parameterizing the model using habitat suitability indices based on expert opinion, altered locations of predicted animal movement routes. These results emphasize that differentiating between types of agriculture can alter conservation planning outcomes.

AB  - The "translocation of species into habitable locations outside of their current ranges, termed assisted migration, has been proposed as a means of saving vulnerable species from extinction as a result of climate change. We explore the use of this controversial technique using a threatened keystone species in western North America, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), as a case study. Species distribution models predict that whitebark pine will be extirpated from most of its current range as temperatures rise over the next 70 years. However, the same models indicate that a large area within northwestern British Columbia, Canada, is climatically suitable for the species under current conditions and will remain so throughout the 21st century. To test the capacity of whitebark pine to establish relative to Climatic and habitat features within its predicted climatic range, we planted seeds from seven populations in eight locations spanning from 600 km southeast to 800 km northwest of the northern boundary of the current species range. During the first three growing seasons, germination occurred in all locations. Nearly three times as many treated (induced maturation and broken dormancy) than untreated seeds germinated, and most treated seeds germinated a year earlier than the untreated seeds. Germination, survival, and growth were primarily influenced by seed mass, site climate conditions related to the duration of snow cover, and provenance temperature. Our experiment provides a preliminary test of models predicting the existence of climatically suitable whitebark pine habitat north of the current species ranges. More broadly, our techniques and results inform the development of scientific guidelines for assisting the migration of other species that are highly threatened by climate change. Applied case studies of this kind are critical for assessing the utility of species distribution models as conservation planning tools.

AB  - 1. Species distribution models (SDM) are increasingly applied as predictive tools for purposes of conservation planning and management. Such models rely on the concept of the ecological niche and assume that distribution patterns of the modelled species are at some sort of equilibrium with the environment. This assumption contrasts with empirical evidence indicating that distribution patterns of many species are constrained by dispersal limitation.
   2. We demonstrate that the performance of SDM based on presence-only data can be significantly enhanced by incorporating distance constraints (functions relating the likelihood of species' occurrences at a site to the distance of the site from known presence locations) to the modelling procedure. This result is highly consistent for a variety of niche-based models (ENFA, DOMAIN and Mahalanobis distance), distance functions (nearest neighbour distance, cumulative distance and Gaussian filter) and taxonomic groups (plants, snails and birds, a total of 226 species).
   3. Distance constraints are expected to enhance the accuracy of niche-based models even in the absence of strong dispersal limitation by accounting for mass effects and spatial autocorrelation in environmental factors for which data are not available.
   4. While distance-based methods outperformed niche-based models when all data were used, their accuracy deteriorated sharply with smaller sample sizes. Niche-based methods are shown to cope better with small sample sizes than distance-based methods, demonstrating the potential advantage of niche-based models when calibration data are limited.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Incorporating distance constraints in SDM provides a simple yet powerful method to account for spatial autocorrelation in patterns of species distribution, and is shown empirically to improve significantly the performance of such models. We therefore recommend incorporating distance constraints in future applications of SDM.

AB  - Understanding the importance of climate in determining species distribution and how it might change as a function of spatial grain size is a vital issue for species distribution modeling (SDM), yet it is often not accounted for in models and has not been extensively addressed in under sampled areas in tropical forests. Using extensive field sampled vegetation plots data on species occurrences and current climate conditions we modeled 150 vascular plant species in the Okavango River Basin, to map their current projected suitable climate space at 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 km(2) pixel resolution. Relationships between the variable importance scores and variable identity and their interaction with predictor spatial grain were investigated using Generalized Linear Models and post-hoc analysis. We found variation in the relative influence of temperature and precipitation variables across the spatial grains. The importance of the determinants of species distribution may change between species but such changes are less determined by the predictor's spatial grain. Potential evapotranspiration consistently exhibited the greatest influence in determining species and richness distribution across fine to coarse spatial grains. We found that the spatial grain of predictors had no effect on the model predictive power and that varying predictor spatial grains had only negligible effects on the model performance measured by AUC and Kappa statistics. The spatial grains of the climatic predictors used showed no effect on species richness pattern either. Our results indicate that in areas with relatively low topographic variation, modeling at coarse spatial grain for conservation purposes can be acceptable. Moreover, we show that in tropical areas that have comparatively homogeneous climatic conditions along large spatial extents the variable importance is not influenced by predictor spatial grain. For projections of contemporary species suitable climate space in relatively flat and topographically homogeneous areas which often have a climatically homogenous landscape, more attention must be given to the identity of the selected predictor variables for modeling the species distributions than to their spatial grain size. We suggest that in species distribution modeling for conservation planning, assessment of the input datasets spatial grain should be informed and guided by knowledge of the landscape level topographic conditions, as protocol.

AB  - AimSpecies distribution models based on breeding occurrence data allow for identifying both environmental drivers and geographic areas potentially relevant for breeding. However, the interpretation of model predictions in terms of reproductive performance should be further investigated, as this information is crucial for conservation planning. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of a correlative modelling approach based on breeding occurrence data (presence-absence) against another approach based on vital rates' data (breeding success) for gaining insights on species persistence in the case of Great Bustards (Otis tarda).
   LocationSpain.
   MethodsBreeding occurrence and breeding success were independently modelled using generalized linear models and multimodel inference analyses. Sensitivities to the way in which the population parameter (breeding success) was defined were explored by building five versions of the dependent variable. We evaluated differences in model performance and identified areas of congruence for breeding occurrence and breeding success.
   ResultsThe agreement between the spatial predictions achieved by breeding occurrence and breeding success models differed substantially across databases, with the largest differences in occupied breeding areas. The deviance explained by the breeding occurrence model was 64.98% and ranged from 7.83% to 62.27% for the breeding success models. Model performance was higher for models calibrated within potential than within occupied breeding areas.
   Main conclusionsThe combination of data on both breeding occurrence and breeding success into a species distribution modelling framework showed the limitations of breeding occurrence models for inferring reproductive parameters. The definition of the population parameter as dependent variable was a key factor that strongly affected the inference of vital rates' models. The approach allowed for discriminating between areas and landscape attributes necessary for the long-term species persistence from others that may be relevant, but not so much for reproductive performance.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used during the planning stage of reintroduction programmes to model species' occurrence with the aim of selecting potential release sites. However, for many endangered species, only a low number of records are available, leading to models with low accuracy. When planning reintroductions for rare species, an alternative approach may be to model surrogate species that are more abundant or easier to locate. Here, we modelled the distribution of white gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), the preferred food tree of the forty-spotted pardalote (Pardalotus quadragintus), a rare songbird for which reintroduction has been proposed. Using boosted regression trees, we modelled white gum distribution under current and future climate conditions with the aim of identifying areas of high probability of occurrence that later can be used to plan on ground habitat assessments for reintroductions. Our model show areas with high probability of white gum occurrence outside its currently mapped distribution, indicating that there may be opportunities for reintroduction of pardalotes beyond their current range. Predictions of future climate scenarios showed climate space shifts, not only with some decrease but also with substantial increase in the probability of suitability for occurrence under some scenarios. Our spatial predictions for white gum may be used to design a survey to ground-truth our model and undertake a comprehensive habitat assessment for other habitat features forty-spotted pardalotes need to persist. The approach used in our study may be used for other highly specialized species, not only in the context of reintroduction planning but also in the general management of data-poor specialist species that depend on a more common resource.

AB  - Contraction of native old forest can limit occurrence of old forest associated species, especially species with limited vagility. Patterns of size and distribution of remaining patches of old forest along with forest disturbance and what replaces old forest can influence whether species adapt or perish after forest loss. The arboreal red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) is a small arvicoline rodent that is associated with old coniferous forest and typically emigrates short distances. Since 1911, old forest (>= 80 years old) in the northern half of the Oregon Coast Range has been reduced by >80%, primarily due to large stand replacing wildfires, timber harvest, and subsequent conversion to young forest (<80 years old). In 2011, the tree vole population in the northern half of the Oregon Coast Range was listed as a candidate species as a distinct population segment under the United States Endangered Species Act, primarily due to habitat loss. We examined the contribution of current and historical (early 20th century) old forest cover, and recent disturbances (1984-2012) on relative habitat suitability for tree voles using light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) data, Landsat imagery, and machine learning. We used a step -wise variable removal procedure to build a parsimonious model and to rank contribution of variables in our final model. We further described the configuration of large patches of old forest using metrics of amount and distance from patch for historical, current, two forest loss scenarios, and two forest restoration scenarios within our study area. Red tree vole relative habitat suitability was positively correlated with current old forest cover at the local scale and negatively correlated with distance from large patches of current old forest. Landscape context, specifically proximity to old forest and absence of recent disturbance contributed most to relative habitat suitability of young forest matrix. If old forest contracted to only reserves on federal lands, amount would decrease from 10.9% to 9.5% and be spatially clumped with an increase in average distance to nearest patch from 3.1 km to 11.1 km. Alternatively, a random addition of patches equivalent to a 1.4% increase in amount, would reduce distance to nearest patch to 1.8 km. Given the history of large historical wildfires in the Oregon Coast Range, restoration of even a small amount of old forest throughout the study area would likely enhance connectivity and resiliency of red tree vole populations in the event of large-scale loss of old forest.

AB  - Estuaries have long been recognized as nursery habitats for various marine fish species. As seascapes consisting of a mosaic of habitat patches, estuarine nurseries incorporate ecological processes such as ontogenetic shifts. To improve our understanding of the habitat requirement changes of nursery species within the estuarine seascape, habitat suitability models were built using boosted regression trees for three size classes of European flounder (Platichthys flesus) juveniles. The models combined several dynamic and static predictors, from physical and chemical water parameters to biological and physical habitat variables. The relationships between juveniles and predictor variables varied with size, potentially indicating the dynamics of habitat use for the juvenile flounder inside the estuarine nursery. Younger post-settled juveniles tended to be spatially constrained to a shallow upstream area and, with size, there were ontogenetic shifts to the middle estuary. This demonstrates the importance of considering different life stages when developing essential fish habitat maps, which reflect fine scale temporal and spatial distributions. Given the high level of anthropogenic pressures to which estuaries are subjected, the consideration of fish ontogenetic habitat requirements within the estuarine nursery is needed to identify high-value areas, and is valuable for developing effective spatial and temporal management plans. These are essential to fully protect the most sensitive life stages, such as early post-settlement stages occupying transient habitats. Additionally, and as the juvenile-habitat associations can rapidly change, fine-scale connectivity in the estuarine nursery becomes even more relevant in determining recruitment. Connectivity should therefore be central in conservation planning, in order to sustain estuarine and marine adult populations, and ultimately maintaining the fisheries.

AB  - Mapping suitable habitat is an important process in wildlife conservation planning. Species distribution reflects habitat selection processes occurring across multiple spatio-temporal scales. Because habitat selection may be driven by different factors at different scales, conservation planners require information at the scale of the intervention to plan effective management actions. Previous research has described habitat selection processes shaping the distribution of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) at the range-wide scale. Finer-scale information for applications within jurisdictional units inside the species range is lacking, yet necessary, because state wildlife agencies are the management authority for sage-grouse in the United States. We quantified seasonal second-order habitat selection for sage-grouse across the state of Utah to produce spatio-temporal predictions of their distribution at the southern periphery of the species range. We used location data obtained from sage-grouse marked with very-high-frequency radio-transmitters and lek location data collected between 1998 and 2013 to quantify species habitat selection in relation to a suite of topographic, edaphic, climatic, and anthropogenic variables using random forest algorithms. Sage-grouse selected for greater sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) cover, higher elevations, and gentler slopes and avoided lower precipitations and higher temperatures. The strength of responses to habitat variables varied across seasons. Anthropogenic variables previously reported as affecting their range-wide distribution (i.e., roads, powerlines, communication towers, and agricultural development) were not ranked as top predictors at our focal scale. Other than strong selection for sagebrush cover, the responses we observed differed from what has been reported at the range-wide scale. These differences likely reflect the unique climatic, geographic, and topographic context found in the southern peripheral area of the species distribution compared to range-wide environmental gradients. Our results highlight the importance of considering appropriateness of scale when planning conservation actions for wide-ranging species.

AB  - Aim Some threatened species are now recovering after a period of serious decline. Understanding and predicting the spatio-temporal recolonization of these species in a heterogeneous landscape are important for their conservation planning. We aimed to predict the range expansion of the endangered Asian crested ibis Nipponia nippon as it recovers from near-extinction to guide its in situ conservation and plan possible reintroductions.
   Location Central China.
   Methods We used a presence-only ecological niche model to predict breeding habitat suitability and a newly developed, spatially explicit and individual-based dynamic modelling platform to simulate range expansion. We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of uncertainty in demographic and dispersal parameters on the simulation of range dynamics. The impact of human-induced mortality risk was also investigated.
   Results Predictions showed that the Asian crested ibis population and the range extent would continue to increase over the next 50 years, and the species would recolonize parts of its historical range. However, the majority of the population would still be restricted to a relatively small region, and some potential suitable regions might not be recolonized for decades by natural dispersal. Moreover, the simulated range dynamics were sensitive to life history trait parameters, among which adult survival probability and the proportion of long-distance dispersal events showed the strongest effects. High human-induced mortality risks had a significant negative effect on population growth and range expansion.
   Main conclusions This study demonstrates how hybrid modelling can inform conservation management of threatened species as they recolonize former habitat. The findings enable prioritization of management efforts, highlight the need for long-term monitoring of the key life history parameters and provide evidence to guide the selection of potential reintroduction sites for the long-term survival and recovery of target species.

AB  - Climate change is expected to impact a large number of organisms in many ecosystems, including several threatened mammals. A better understanding of climate impacts on species can make conservation efforts more effective. The Himalayan ibex (Capra ibex sibirica) and blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) are economically important wild ungulates in northern Pakistan because they are sought-after hunting trophies. However, both species are threatened due to several human-induced factors, and these factors are expected to aggravate under changing climate in the High Himalayas. In this study, we investigated populations of ibex and blue sheep in the Pamir-Karakoram mountains in order to (i) update and validate their geographical distributions through empirical data; (ii) understand range shifts under climate change scenarios; and (iii) predict future habitats to aid long-term conservation planning. Presence records of target species were collected through camera trapping and sightings in the field. We constructed Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model on presence record and six key climatic variables to predict the current and future distributions of ibex and blue sheep. Two representative concentration pathways (4.5 and 8.5) and two-time projections (2050 and 2070) were used for future range predictions. Our results indicated that ca. 37% and 9% of the total study area (Gilgit-Baltistan) was suitable under current climatic conditions for Himalayan ibex and blue sheep, respectively. Annual mean precipitation was a key determinant of suitable habitat for both ungulate species. Under changing climate scenarios, both species will lose a significant part of their habitats, particularly in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges. The Pamir-Karakoram ranges will serve as climate refugia for both species. This area shall remain focus of future conservation efforts to protect Pakistan's mountain ungulates.

AB  - Climate change is causing rapid shifts in species' range limits, leading to poleward expansions and range losses toward the equator. However, 'climate debt', the gap between required and realized range shifts under changing climates, can accumulate when species are unable to track shifting conditions sufficiently rapidly to keep pace with climate changes. Currently, we do not know the rate at which species will keep pace via dispersal to track their climate envelopes, yet understanding potential differences in climate debt is central to estimating how climate change will influence extinction risk. Here, we use historical observations of 155 butterfly species found in Canada to construct climate-based environmental niche models for each species and then compare projections with observed modern distributions to quantify climate debts. This approach suggests that high levels of climate debt are accumulating within the vast majority of these species. Such failure to track changing climates may arise from some combination of interspecific interactions such as particular food availability for specialists, abiotic barriers such as mountain ranges, or species' intrinsic dispersal capacities. Our linear models relating climate debt to a variety of biological predictors suggest that the debts we documented are accumulating independently of dispersal ability, diet breadth, and phylogeny. A proxy for range size is the only significant predictor of climate debt, with species with narrower ranges accumulating more debt: this suggests that species with narrow ranges may be at risk from both a reduction of suitable habitat in their current range and the failure to colonize newly available habitat. Identifying the factors, whether intrinsic or imposed by local environmental conditions, that limit species' capacities to colonize areas beyond their historical limits is vital to conservation planning.

AB  - The lack of information about species distribution, also known as Wallacean shortfall, targets most species, even charismatic animals like felids, limiting the performance of scientific study and conservation planning. The knowledge about species distribution (specifically occurrence data) is also affected by restriction of data availability and dispersion of existing information in many data sources. Therefore, we created and tested the reliability and validity of Felidae occurrence database at spatial resolution of 0.5 decimal degree by: (i) investigating knowledge bias generated by charismatic attributes, species detectability, and spatial data aggregation; and (ii) evaluating climatic niche predictability and species-niche patterns mediated by ecological or phylogenetic, which is the main concern of database utilization in macroecological studies. We found 3,549 spatially unique felid occurrence records around the world, considering a resolution scale of 0.5 decimal degree. Numbers of occurrences were positively related to body mass and distribution area (R-2 = 0.2, p < 0.001), revealing that charismatic attributes influences the choice of study species and making the Wallacean shortfall more critical for small-bodied than large-bodied felids. All species had systematic or random point patterns, which can efficiently capture climatic variation into species distribution. Climatic variables efficiently described the distributions of felids' niches, through two general proprieties, marginality and tolerance. Niche marginality has spatial and evolutionary signature, since it relates to time of divergence, body mass, and distribution area. Therefore, this database can support macroecological studies due to the non-spatial bias of occurrences and the species predictability of climatic variables, despite the species bias.

AB  - Biologists who develop and apply habitat models are often familiar with the statistical challenges posed by their data's spatial structure but are unsure of whether the use of complex spatial models will increase the utility of model results in planning. We compared the relative performance of nonspatial and hierarchical Bayesian spatial models for three vertebrate and invertebrate taxa of conservation concern (Church's sideband snails [Monadenia churchi], red tree voles [Arborimus longicaudus], and Pacific fishers [Martes pennanti pacifica]) that provide examples of a range of distributional extents and dispersal abilities. We used presence-absence data derived from regional monitoring programs to develop models with both landscape and site-level environmental covariates. We used Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and a conditional autoregressive or intrinsic conditional autoregressive model framework to fit spatial models. The fit of Bayesian spatial models was between 35 and 55% better than the fit of nonspatial analogue models. Bayesian spatial models outperformed analogous models developed with maximum entropy (Maxent) methods. Although the best spatial and nonspatial models included similar environmental variables, spatial models provided estimates of residual spatial effects that suggested how ecological processes might structure distribution patterns. Spatial models built from presence-absence data improved fit most for localized endemic species with ranges constrained by poorly known biogeographic factors and for widely distributed species suspected to be strongly affected by unmeasured environmental variables or population processes. By treating spatial effects as a variable of interest rather than a nuisance, hierarchical Bayesian spatial models, especially when they are based on a common broad-scale spatial lattice (here the national Forest Inventory and Analysis grid of 24 km2 hexagons), can increase the relevance of habitat models to multispecies conservation planning.

AB  - The maximum entropy (Maxent) model was used to predict the distribution of Persian leopards and wild sheep in the Tang-e-Sayad protected area in Iran. For this purpose, eight variables, as well as 30 occurrence points of leopard and 98 points of wild sheep, were used. Two techniques, density-based occurrence points thinning and performance-based predictor variables selection were used to improve the results of the model. The model results were analyzed based on four threshold limit-based statistics (sensitivity, specificity, kappa and true skill statistics) and area under the curve (AUC), followed by determining the relative importance of variables based on the jackknife procedure. The results of threshold limit-based statistics revealed that the success of the model for distribution prediction of leopard and wild sheep were good and relatively good, respectively. According to the jackknife procedure, for wild sheep and for leopard, slope and distance to road, respectively, were the most important predictor variables. The results also indicated that the efficiency of the model did not improve by reducing the density of occurrence points for the wild sheep (AUC= 0.784-0.773). However, the selection of predictor variables slightly improved the performance of the model (AUC= 0.794-0.819). The results of the study also showed overlapping habitat for two species due to both human and ecological reasons for which we proposed some conservation actions such as excluding domestic grazing, controlling illegal poaching and restoration of old migratory corridors.

AB  - Conservation planning using a species approach involves the prioritization and selection of conservation areas based on biological criteria. Therefore, there is a need to adopt appropriate criteria for forest conservation planing. We propose that forest conservation planning refers to globally accepted criteria and indicators (i.e. C&I) for sustainable forest management. Criteria related to 'biodiversity conservation' and 'soil and water conservation' are two functions adopted and applied to forest conservation planning using a geographic information system (GIS)-based multiple-criteria decision-making approach (MCDM). The biodiversity conservation criterion comprises indicators of ecosystem diversity and species diversity, whereas the soil and water conservation criterion consists of indicators related to landslide, floor for potential timber species distribution, proximity to settlements and roads is used as a measure of potential forest threats. The application of C&I to the GIS-based MCDM approach has enabled forest conservation priorities to be considered in terms of the important forest functions. It also integrated two decision-making processes (i.e. 'biodiversity conservation' and 'soil and water conservation') into a single process.

AB  - The increase in anthropogenic activities that lead to fragmentation and habitat loss, could result in a reduction of connectivity among habitat patches of terrestrial species. We used ecological niche models, circuit and graph theories to evaluate functional connectivity among home-range patches and suitable habitat patches of the Mexican Leaf Frog (Agalychnis dacnicolor), in a heterogeneous landscape of tropical dry forest (TDF) in central-western Mexico. We found high connectivity among home-range patches within the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve (CCBR) and among those surrounding the CCBR. Similarly, suitable habitat patches along the Pacific slope (except those in the South) were well-connected. Conversely, we detected weak connectivity in the southern and eastern parts of the study area, which is in accordance with the poor habitat quality and fragmentation that characterize that zone. Suitable habitat patches with the largest areas of TDF were the most important in maintaining functional connectivity, but only one patch was within a natural protected area. Our results highlight the importance of conserving large and continuous patches of habitat in a very threatened landscape to maintain connectivity in A. dacnicolor and probably in other anurans.

AB  - For effective conservation planning, resource managers around the world require information on species distributions. Available data, however, are often too coarse in spatial resolution to be of practical use. We describe four modelling techniques that harness the information contained in coarse-scale occurrence records to predict species' distributions at the finer resolutions relevant to conservation officers in the field. The techniques are primarily statistical in nature, but can incorporate expert knowledge on species' habitat preferences. We highlight the conceptual strengths and weaknesses of each, and perform a preliminary test of their comparative performance, using empirical data on the distribution of nine bird species in Uganda and satellite-derived environmental indices. Two techniques, the point sampling approach and iterative approach, yield encouraging results. Because the dominance of environmental factors controlling species' distributions shifts with spatial scale, however, cross-scale predictions remain a formidable challenge. Further testing and refinement of the techniques we present here are undoubtedly necessary before they can be applied with any confidence. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The water conservancy projects bring benefits to the society. At the same time, they change the suitable habitat for fish, block the channel between upstream and downstream of fish; the reservoir discharged water had a negative impact on fish's breeding and growth. Therefore, we should actively take some appropriate protective and compensatory measures on fish while we construct water conservancy projects, which include establishing the fish germplasm bank, constructing fish passage facilities, releasing water from the reservoir hierarchically, constructing fish-breeding and releasing station and fish protected area, etc.

AB  - We forecasted potential impacts of climate change on the ability of a network of key sites for bird conservation (Important Bird Areas; IBAs) to provide suitable climate for 370 bird species of current conservation concern in two Asian biodiversity hotspots: the Eastern Himalaya and Lower Mekong. Comparable studies have largely not accounted for uncertainty, which may lead to inappropriate conclusions. We quantified the contribution of four sources of variation (choice of general circulation models, emission scenarios and species distribution modelling methods and variation in species distribution data) to uncertainty in forecasts and tested if our projections were robust to these uncertainties. Declines in the availability of suitable climate within the IBA network by 2100 were forecast as extremely likely' for 45% of species, whereas increases were projected for only 2%. Thus, we predict almost 24 times as many losers' as winners'. However, for no species was suitable climate extremely likely' to be completely lost from the network. Considerable turnover (median=43%, 95% CI=3569%) in species compositions of most IBAs were projected by 2100. Climatic conditions in 47% of IBAs were projected as extremely likely' to become suitable for fewer priority species. However, no IBA was forecast to become suitable for more species. Variation among General Circulation Models and Species Distribution Models contributed most to uncertainty among forecasts. This uncertainty precluded firm conclusions for 53% of species and IBAs because 95% confidence intervals included projections of no change. Considering this uncertainty, however, allows robust recommendations concerning the remaining species and IBAs. Overall, while the IBA network will continue to sustain bird conservation, climate change will modify which species each site will be suitable for. Thus, adaptive management of the network, including modified site conservation strategies and facilitating species' movement among sites, is critical to ensure effective future conservation.

AB  - We introduce a novel approach to building corridors in spatial conservation prioritization. The underlying working principle is the use of a penalty structure in an iterative algorithm used for producing a spatial priority ranking. The penalty term aims to prevent loss or degradation of structural connections, or, equivalently, to promote to a higher rank landscape elements that are required to keep networks connected. The proposed method shows several convenient properties: (1) it does not require a priori specification of habitat patches, end points or related thresholds, (2) it does not rely on resistance coefficients for different habitats, (3) it does not require species targets, and (4) the cost of additional connectivity via corridors can be quantified in terms of habitat quality lost across species. Corridor strength and width parameters control the trade-off between increased structural connectivity via corridors and other considerations relevant to conservation planning. Habitat suitability or dispersal suitability layers used in the analysis can be species specific, thus allowing analysis both in terms of structural and functional connectivity. The proposed method can also be used for targeting habitat restoration, by identifying areas of low habitat quality included in corridors. These methods have been implemented in the Zonation software, and can be applied to large scale and high resolution spatial prioritization, effectively integrating corridor design and spatial conservation prioritization. Since the method operates on novel principles and combines with a large number of features already operational in Zonation, we expect it to be of utility in spatial conservation planning.

AB  - Aim: Application of environmental envelope modelling (EEM) for conservation planning requires careful validation. Opinions of experts who have worked with species of interest in the field can be a valuable and independent information source to validate EEM because of their first-hand experience with species occurrence and absence. However, their use in model validation is limited because of the subjectivity of their feedback. In this study, we present a method on the basis of cultural consensus theory to formalize expert model evaluations.
   Methods: We developed, for five tree species, distribution models with nine different variable combinations and Maxent EEM software. Species specialists validated the generated distribution maps through an online Google Earth interface with the scores from Invalid to Excellent. Experts were also asked about the commission and omission errors of the distribution models they evaluated. We weighted expert scores according to consensus theory. These values were used to obtain a final average expert score for each of the produced distribution models. The consensus-weighted expert scores were compared with un-weighted scores and correlated to four conventional model performance parameters after cross-validation with test data: Area Under Curve (AUC), maximum Kappa, commission error and omission error.
   Results: The median consensus-weighted expert score of all species-variable combinations was close to Fair. In general, experts that reached more consensus with peers were more positive about the EEM outcomes, compared to those that had more opposite judgements. Both consensus-weighted and un-weighted scores were significantly correlated to corresponding AUC, maximum Kappa and commission error values, but not to omission errors. More than half of the experts indicated that the distribution model they considered best included areas where the species is known to be absent. One third also indicated areas of species presence that were omitted by the model.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that experts are fairly positive about EEM outcomes. This is encouraging, but EEM application for conservation actions remains limited according to them. Methods to formalize expert knowledge allow a wider use of this information in model validation and improvement, and they complement conventional validation methods of presence-only modelling. Online GIS and survey applications facilitate the consultation of experts.

AB  - Sardinian populations of the snake Hemorrhois (= Coluber) hippocrepis are likely the most endangered populations of snakes in Italy. Major threats to survivorship are the anthropogenic habitat alteration and the extremely low population density, while nothing is known about the potential effects that climate change could exert on this species. The main goal of this paper is to provide helpful instruments for the short- and long-term conservation of H. hippocrepis in Sardinia. By means of an ecological modeling approach, we derived the Sardinian whip snake habitat suitability map, and we compared the potential range extent under present condition and future climatic scenarios. Results clearly show an alarming trend for H. hippocrepis conservation: changing climate conditions will cause a dramatic reduction on suitable surface since 2020, with a further collapse by 2050 (down to 11 km(2)). We also identified areas of species potential persistence up till 2050, where prospective management initiatives could have the greatest probability of success in this region. In particular, only one existing protected area will likely still keep suitable habitats for H. hippocrepis. Therefore, we suggest that very careful management of this relictual area should be implemented by now if we really want to save these exceedingly threatened snake populations.

AB  - The golden mantella (Mantella aurantiaca) is a critically endangered (CR) frog, endemic to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. Although the species is very popular in the pet trade and widely bred in captivity, its specific habitat requirements in the wild are poorly understood. Ten forested sites in the Moramanga district of Madagascar were surveyed for microhabitat and environmental variables, and the presence or absence of golden mantellas in quadrats positioned along transects in the vicinity of breeding sites. Mixed models were used to determine which variables best explained microhabitat use by golden mantellas. Sites where golden mantellas were found tended to have surface temperatures of 20-23 degrees C, UVI units at about 2.9, about 30 % canopy cover, and around 30 % herbaceous cover. Within sites, golden mantellas preferred microhabitats that had 70 % leaf litter coverage and relatively low numbers of tree roots. This information can be used to improve the identification and management of habitats in the wild, as well as to refine captive husbandry needs.

AB  - Little is known about differences in species diversity among ecological communities subject to different levels of human-caused habitat transformation and how this disturbance contributes to diversity through symbiotic dependencies with the environment in freshwater ecosystems. We estimated and diversities of benthic macroinvertebrates and relationships between diversity and environmental variables in Ado River (natural) and Yasu River (intermediately disturbed) watersheds, Japan. Alpha diversity was consistently slightly higher in the natural river watershed than in the intermediately disturbed one, but the spatial distribution was not equivalent. The opposite pattern was found for diversity. Significant differences in environmental variables existed between the two river watersheds, with especially high chlorophyll-a concentrations detected in the intermediately disturbed watershed. Alpha diversity was not correlated with specific environmental variables, whereas water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations were the two most significant environmental variables influencing diversity across sites in the two watersheds. These results suggest that diversity patterns in freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates are differentially influenced by levels of human-caused habitat transformation, especially that intermediately disturbed habitats may benefit species turnover, and further understanding how they relate to environmental variables is essential for protecting local to regional diversity and can provide useful information for conservation planning to maximise biodiversity at the watershed scale.

AB  - To conserve biological diversity, protected-area networks must be based not only on current species distributions but also on the landscape's long-term capacity to support populations. We used spatially explicit population models requiring detailed habitat and demographic data to evaluate the ability of existing park systems in the Rocky Mountain region (U.S.A. and Canada) to sustain populations of mammalian carnivores. Predicted patterns of extirpation agreed with those from logistic-regression models based only on park size and connectedness (or isolation) for the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) in developed landscapes (northern US. Rocky Mountains) and semideveloped landscapes (southern Canadian Rocky Mountains). The area-isolation model performed poorly where the landscape matrix contained large amounts of suitable habitat (northern Canadian Rocky Mountains). Park area and connectedness were poor predictors of gray wolf (Canis lupus) occurrence because of this species' broader-scale range dynamics and greater ability to inhabit the landscape matrix. A doubling of park area corresponded to a 47% and 57% increase in projected grizzly bear population persistence in developed and semideveloped landscapes, respectively. A doubling of a park's connectedness index corresponded to a 81% and 350% increase in population persistence in developed and semideveloped landscapes, respectively, suggesting that conservation planning to enhance connectivity may be most effective in the earliest stages of landscape degradation. The park area and connectivity required for population persistence increased as the landscape matrix became more hostile, implying that the relatively small combined area of parks in the boreal forest and other undeveloped regions may fall below the threshold for species persistence if parks become habitat islands. Loss of carnivores from boreal landscapes could further reduce the viability of temperate populations occupying refugia at the southern range margin. Spatially realistic population models may be more informative than simplerpatch-matrix models in predicting the effects of landscape change on population viability across a continuum of landscape degradation.

AB  - We investigated how the potential distribution of Histiotus velatus is affected by the addition of new records over decades (decade effect). Assuming that (1: hypothesis of the effect of the decade) the addition of new occurrence records over time increases the potential size of the species distribution; and (2: Wallacean distance hypothesis) over the years, the new points added are increasingly distant from the research centers. Considering the geographic knowledge gap of this species, our objective is to report a new record of this species and estimate its potential distribution in South America through environment niche models (ENMs). For this, we compiled records of occurrence of species, selected from 1900 to 2015. We used 19 bioclimatic variables available in the WorldClim database to estimate the potential distribution of the species, and we used three modeling algorithms: Maximum Entropy (MXT), Random Forest (RDF), and Support Vector Machine. To test the Wallacean distance hypothesis, we calculated the Euclidian distance from occurrences to bat research centers in Brazil, located using a national researchers' information dataset ("Plataforma Lattes"). To test the hypothesis of the decade effect, we used the beta regression analysis, taking conservative and non-conservative approaches. The results showed that the predicted area expanded and retracted with the addition of new occurrences over the decades, with an improvement in the accuracy of models. Most records are located in the southeastern region of Brazil, but algorithms predicted areas in regions where there are no records. Only the conservative approach has had a positive relationship over the decades. The distance from new points does not increase over the years of research centers.

AB  - We address the problem of robust decision making for stochastic network design. Our work is motivated by spatial conservation planning where the goal is to take management decisions within a fixed budget to maximize the expected spread of a population of species over a network of land parcels. Most previous work for this problem assumes that accurate estimates of different network parameters (edge activation probabilities, habitat suitability scores) are available, which is an unrealistic assumption. To address this shortcoming, we assume that network parameters are only partially known, specified via interval bounds. We then develop a decision making approach that computes the solution with minimax regret. We provide new theoretical results regarding the structure of the minmax regret solution which help develop a computationally efficient approach. Empirically, we show that previous approaches that work on point estimates of network parameters result in high regret on several standard benchmarks, while our approach provides significantly more robust solutions.

AB  - Conservation biology can benefit greatly from models that relate species' distributions to their environments. The foundation of successful modeling is a high-quality set of field data, and distribution models have specialized data requirements. The role of a distribution model may be primarily predictive or, alternatively, may emphasize relationships between an organism and its habitat. For the latter application, the environmental variables recorded should have direct, biological relationships with the organism. Interacting species may be valuable predictors and can improve understanding of distribution patterns. Sampling should cover the full range of environmental conditions within the study region, with samples stratified across major environmental gradients to ensure thorough coverage. Failure to sample correctly can lead to erroneous organism-environment relationships, affecting predictive ability and interpretation. Sampling ideally should examine a series of spatial scales, increasing the understanding of organism-environment relationships, identifying the most effective scales for predictive modeling and complementing the spatial hierarchies often used in conservation planning. Consideration of statistical issues could benefit most studies. The ratio of sample sites to environmental variables considered should ideally exceed a ratio of 10: 1 to improve the analytical power and reliability of subsequent modeling. Presence and/or absence models may suffer bias if training data detect the study organism at an atypical proportion of sites. We considered different strategies for spatial autocorrelation and recommend it be included wherever possible for the benefits in biological realism, predictive accuracy, and model versatility. Finally, we stress the importance of collecting independent evaluation data and suggest that, as with the training data, a systematic approach be used to ensure broad environmental coverage, rather than relying on a random selection of test sites.

AB  - Global climate change poses a new challenge for species and can even push some species toward an extinction vortex. The most affected organisms are those with narrow tolerance to the climatic factors but many large mammals such as ungulates with a wider ecological niche are also being affected indirectly. Our research mainly used wild sheep in central Iran as a model species to explore how the suitable habitats will change under different climatic scenarios and to determine if current borders of protected areas will adequately protect habitat requirements. To create habitat models we used animal-vehicle collision points as an input for species presence data. We ran habitat models using MaxEnt modeling approach under different climatic scenarios of the past, present and future (under the climatic scenarios for minimum (RCP2.6) and maximum (RCP8.5) CO2 concentration trajectories). We tried to estimate the overlap and the width of the ecological niche using relevant metrics. In order to analyze the effectiveness of the protected areas, suitable maps were concerted to binary maps using True Skill Statistic (TSS) threshold and measured the similarity of the binary maps for each scenario using Kappa index. In order to assess the competence of the present protected areas boundary in covering the distribution of species, two different scenarios were employed, which are ensemble scenario 1: an ensemble of the binary maps of the species distribution in Mid-Holocene, present, and RCP2.6; and ensemble scenario 2: an ensemble of binary suitability maps in Mid-Holocene, present, and RCP8.5. Then, the borders of modeled habitats with the boundaries of 23 existing protected areas in two central provinces in Iran were compared. The predicted species distribution under scenario 1 (RCP2.6) was mostly similar to its current distribution (Kappa = 0.53) while the output model under scenario 2 (RCP8.5) indicated a decline in the species distribution range. Under the first ensemble scenario, current borders of the protected areas in Hamedan province showed better efficiency to cover the model species distribution range. Analyzing MaxEnt spatial models under the second climatic scenario suggested that protected areas in both Markazi and Hamedan provinces will not cover "high suitability" areas in the future. Modeling the efficiency of the current protected areas under predicted future climatic scenarios can help the related authorities to plan conservation activities more efficiently.

AB  - Understanding the historical dynamics of animal species is critical for accurate prediction of their response to climate changes. During the late Quaternary period, Southeast Asia had a larger land area than today due to lower sea levels, and its terrestrial landscape was covered by extensive forests and savanna. To date, however, the distribution fluctuation of vegetation and its impacts on genetic structure and demographic history of local animals during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are still disputed. In addition, the responses of animal species on Hainan Island, located in northern Southeast Asia, to climate changes during the LGM are poorly understood. Here, we combined phylogeographic analysis, paleoclimatic evidence, and species distribution models to examine the response of the flightless Hainan Partridge (Arborophila ardens) to climate change. We concluded that A. ardens survived through LGM climate changes, and its current distribution on Hainan Island was its in situ refuge. Range model results indicated that A. ardens once covered a much larger area than its current distribution. Demographic history described a relatively stable pattern during and following the LGM. In addition, weak population genetic structure suggests a role in promoting gene flow between populations with climate-induced elevation shifts. Human activities must be considered in conservation planning due to their impact on fragmented habitats. These first combined data for Hainan Partridge demonstrate the value of paired genetic and SDMs study. More related works that might deepen our understanding of the responses of the species in Southeast Asia to late Quaternary Climate are needed.

AB  - Setting aside parcels of land is the main conservation strategy to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss worldwide. Because funding for biological conservation is limited, it is important to distinguish the most efficient ways to use it. Here, we assess implications of alternative measures to conserve biodiversity in managed boreal forest landscapes. We calculated four alternative spatio-temporal scenarios and compared these to the current management regime over 100-year time period. In the alternative scenarios, a fixed amount of funding was invested in (1) permanent large reserves (each tens of ha in size), (2) permanent small reserves (each a few ha in size), (3) temporary small reserves (based on 10-year contracts with private land owners), and (4) green-tree retention (small groups of trees retained on clear-cuts). To assess biodiversity implications, we used habitat suitability indices to calculate overall habitat availability for five groups of red-listed and habitat-specific species associated with decaying spruce logs. The possibilities for timber harvests did not differ among the scenarios, but biodiversity performance was different. The scenarios with permanent reserves tended to outperform other scenarios, suggesting that conservation policies based on permanent reserves are the most cost-efficient in the long term. Results, however, varied among time scales and species groups. In the short term, a strategy of investment in temporary small reserves was the most efficient. Habitat for species associated with old spruce dead-wood and preferring shade was rare throughout all simulations, and therefore, it is likely that these species cannot be sustained in managed forests. Species that live on fresh dead-wood and are associated with forest edges coped well in all scenarios suggesting that such species will persist in managed landscapes without additional conservation efforts. Explicit definition of conservation objectives and time frames for conservation action are thus prerequisites for successful conservation planning.

AB  - A common focus for conservation planning is to identify locations for siting potential protected areas, something that requires estimates for the costs of setting up these areas and benefits for biodiversity of doing so. When cost data are not available over relevant scales, conservation planners commonly rely on proxy data that they hope will estimate conservation costs. Here, we assessed how accurately agricultural land values, a commonly used proxy for cost data in conservation planning, estimate the actual acquisition costs of protected areas, focusing on a case study from the central and southern Appalachians. We compared plans based on cost estimates derived from different sources and that involved different levels of spatial aggregation to understand how a reliance on these estimates would impact conservation planning. We found that the average agricultural land value in a county did not accurately predict the acquisition costs of protected areas in that county. This lack of accuracy was a result of choosing agricultural land values as a proxy for acquisition costs, and not spatial averaging. A reliance on agricultural land values risks diverting limited funds for establishing protected areas away from parcels that offer the greatest return-on-investment. It would also lead a conservation organization to overestimate the budget needed to protect a given number of species. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating data on how much protected areas actually cost in future conservation planning studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species distribution models are popular statistical tools for inferring potential distribution range of species across space and time and are extensively used in conservation planning. Models based on presence-only data (e.g., MaxEnt) are widely used; however, these models assume perfect species detectability. Occupancy modelling is considered a better modelling technique since it accounts for species detectability. Presence-only models are relatively simpler, requiring only presence locations, while occupancy models are data hungry models requiring detection/non-detection data from multiple visits to the survey sites. We utilized data from the Kerala Bird Atlas (India) and modelled current distribution for 109 species using MaxEnt and occupancy approaches. MaxEnt performed well even with less occurrences, while occupancy model failed for species with fewer than 40 records. In terms of evaluation metrics, AUC and Root Mean Square Error, both models performed relatively better for species with low occurrences than those with high occurrences (generalist species). The comparison metrics (Relative-rank scores, Root Mean Square Error, Hellinger distance and Expectation of Shared Presences) were significantly correlated with the number of occurrences; MaxEnt and occupancy based SDMs for widespread species had more concordance than SDMs of narrowly distributed species. There was some discordance between algorithms with regards to diversity hotspot. Selection of best combination of variables and correction for overprediction can help improve performances of both models and improve consistency between them. Given the data hungry nature of occupancy models and marginal difference with the MaxEnt models; it appears that latter is better suited for predicting the distribution of rare species and studies dealing with cumulative data from multiple species.

AB  - Yunnan province is known for its extraordinarily rich biodiversity, but this is threatened by invasive species under climate change. In the present study, the current and future potential distribution of an invasive grass-Tithonia diversifolia A. Gray in Yunnan province were predicted by species distribution modeling, under two climate change conditions (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) through to 2050s. In addition, the potential risk of T. diversifolia to the protected areas of Yunnan was examined. Our results showed that the potential distribution areas of T. diversifolia would increase by 12 and 93% by 2050s, under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. Yunnan's protected areas are now susceptible to T. diversifolia, and the scope of this plant's effects would continue to expand under climate change. A total of 26 protected areas are currently impacted by T. diversifolia, in a total affected range area of 2,822 km(2), but by 2050s, this is predicted to increase by 23 and 53%, and would lead to one and 13 protected areas newly threatened under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. These results suggest that T. diversifolia would benefit from global warming, we should prevent further global warming. In addition, human disturbance should be reduced and prohibited to protect native plants and forest ecosystem in southern, southeastern and northwestern part of Yunnan.

AB  - For the effective conservation of vulnerable marine populations, knowledge of their distributions and spatially explicit management actions are essential. The use of physical features or coarse habitat types as surrogates of species distribution often does not provide an accurate enough (and hence useful) mapping of where species occur. This is further exacerbated in datapoor regions, where habitat maps in the marine environment are often patchy. A combination of satellite imaging analysis (for a rough classification of the main habitat types in shallow waters) and occupancy modelling based on data collected through dedicated underwater surveys is proposed as a relatively inexpensive and timely way to identify priority areas for the conservation of selected benthic species. The occupancy surveys provide estimates of the probability of presence, which can be used as weights of the importance of the available suitable habitat types in a potential habitat index (PHI). This approach was applied in the Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) for 6 benthic hard-bottom species of conservation importance. Repetitive SCUBA diving surveys were conducted at six 5 m depth zones between 0 and 30 m at 47 locations in the Aegean Sea to detect the presence of the target species. Occupancy was modelled using several environmental spatial covariates. The applied method explicitly incorporated imperfect detectability in the modelling process. Predictive distributional maps of PHI were produced for each species, identifying areas that could be prioritized for conservation measures. Despite some limitations, this approach can provide a baseline for the protection of vulnerable species, in the framework of adaptive management for marine conservation planning.

AB  - Assisted migration (AM) has been suggested as a management strategy for aiding species in reaching newly suitable locations as climate changes. Species distribution models (SDMs) can provide important insights for decisions on whether to assist a species in its migration; however, their application includes uncertainties. In this study, we use consensus SDMs to model the future suitable areas for 13 vascular plant species with poor dispersal capacity. Based on the outputs of SDMs under different climate change scenarios and future times, we quantify the predicted changes in suitable area by calculating metrics that describe the need and potential for migration. We find that, by the end of the 21st century, one of the species would benefit from AM under mild climate change, seven under moderate change, and for 12 out of 13 species studied AM appears to be a relevant conservation method under strong climate change. We also test the effect of different modeling attributes on the metrics and find little variation between SDMs constructed using different combinations of modeling methods and variable sets. However, the choice of climate variables had a larger influence on the level of the metrics than did the modeling method. We therefore suggest that the choice of climate variables should receive ample attention when measuring climate change threat using SDMs and that experiments aiming to uncover critical environmental factors for individual species should be extensively conducted. This study illustrates that dispersal assistance may be needed for many species under a wide range of possible future climates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the marine environment Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been used in hundreds of papers for predicting the present and future geographic range and environmental niche of species. We have analyzed ways in which SDMs are being applied to marine species in order to recommend best practice in future studies. This systematic review was registered as a protocol on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/tngs6/. The literature reviewed (236 papers) was published between 1992 and July 2016. The number of papers significantly increased through time (R-2 = 0.92, p < 0.05). The studies were predominantly carried out in the Temperate Northern Atlantic (45%) followed by studies of global scale (11%) and studies in Temperate Australasia (10%). The majority of studies reviewed focused on theoretical ecology (37%) including investigations of biological invasions by non-native organisms, conservation planning (19%), and climate change predictions (17%). Most of the studies were published in ecological, multidisciplinary, or biodiversity conservation journals. Most of the studies (94%) failed to report the amount of uncertainty derived from data deficiencies and model parameters. Best practice recommendations are proposed here to ensure that novice and advanced SDM users can (a) understand the main elements of SDMs, (b) reproduce standard methods and analysis, and (c) identify potential limitations with their data. We suggest that in the future, studies of marine SDMs should report on key features of the approaches employed, data deficiencies, the selection of the best explanatory model, and the approach taken to validate the SDM results. In addition, based on the literature reviewed, we suggest that future marine SDMs should account for uncertainty levels as part of the modeling process.

AB  - Knowledge of spatiotemporal distribution of biodiversity is still very incomplete in the tropics. This is one of the major problems preventing the assessment and effectiveness of conservation actions. Mega-diverse tropical regions are being exposed to fast and profound environmental changes, and the amount of resources available to describe the distribution of species is generally limited. Thus, the tropics is losing species at unprecedented rates, without a proper assessment of its biodiversity. Species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to fill such biogeographic gaps within a species' range and, when allied with systematic conservation planning (e.g. analyses of representativeness, gap analysis), help transcend such data shortage and support practical conservation actions. Within the Neotropics, eastern Amazon and northern Cerrado present a high variety of environments and are some of the most interesting ecotonal areas within South America, but are also among the most threatened biogeographic provinces in the world. Here, we test the effectiveness of the current system of Protected Areas (PAs), in protecting 24 threatened and endemic bird species using SDMs. We found that taxa with wider distributions are potentially as protected as taxa with smaller ranges, and larger PAs were more efficient than smaller PAs, while protecting these bird species. Nonetheless, Cerrado PAs are mostly misallocated. We suggest six priority areas for conservation of Neotropical birds. Finally, we highlight the importance of indigenous lands in the conservation of Neotropical biodiversity, and recommend the development of community management plans to conserve the biological resources of the region.

AB  - There is increasing awareness that the long-term success of ecological restoration efforts can be compromised if projected climate change is not effectively incorporated in restoration planning. We propose an approach that aims to support the decision-making process for seed provenance selection in ecological restoration when clear genetic-based guidelines for seed transfer are not available. The approach takes advantage of the increasing availability and refinement of user-friendly web-based GIS interfaces that allow non-experts to directly access biodiversity and environmental data, and build species distribution models. It offers an easily accessible desktop method that land managers and practitioners can use to gain insight: (1) on the overall spatial implications of projected climate change to their restoration project; (2) whether assisted gene flow through climate-adjusted provenance may be appropriate for a given species at a given restoration site; and (3) how far away and in which direction from the restoration site seeds should be collected from. This approach should be used in the early stages of the restoration project to help frame the decision-making process in a climate change context, and can also be used as a platform where other lines of evidence are integrated. We advocate that, in the context of rapid climate change, the climate-adjusted provenance is a promising approach to seed sourcing in ecological restoration, and we suggest its refinement in a way that hedges against uncertainty in climatic projections.

AB  - Monitoring populations and designing effective conservation actions for endangered species present significant challenges. An accurate understanding of current distribution, ecological traits and habitat requirements is imperative in formulating conservation strategies. Recent surveys on the southernmost Cuvier's Gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) population, an ungulate endemic to North Africa, showcase its importance in terms of numbers and genetic diversity. This population inhabits a remote region in the extreme north-western portion of the Sahara Desert and has not been well studied. Here, we examine the potential distribution of Cuvier's Gazelle and the environmental factors limiting the species in a Saharan environment, by combining broad-scale field survey data and species distribution models. Our objective was to identify high priority conservation areas in the southernmost known portion of the species' distribution by modelling habitat selection at the landscape scale using a predictive distribution map. Our results show that the distribution of Cuvier's Gazelle is strongly related to mountainous areas with heterogeneous terrain and remoteness from large human settlements over other ecological factors that had less impact on the species' presence and distribution. We also provide a quantitative estimate of the potential distribution range of Cuvier's Gazelle in southern Morocco, identifying two well-demarcated key areas. The two core areas currently contain enough rugged terrain isolated from human encroachment to support the endangered species in this harsh desert environment. We encourage the implementation of conservation planning for Cuvier's Gazelle as an "umbrella species", which will confer effective protection to higher-quality habitat zones and co-occurring species, leading to sustainable and ecologically responsible development in the region.

AB  - Premise Populations of species with large spatial distributions are shaped by complex forces that differ throughout their ranges. To maintain the genetic diversity of species, genepool-based subsets of widespread species must be considered in conservation assessments. Methods The population genetics of the lichenized fungus Lobaria pulmonaria and its algal partner, Symbiochloris reticulata, were investigated using microsatellite markers to determine population structure, genetic diversity, and degree of congruency in eastern and western North America. Data loggers measuring temperature and humidity were deployed at selected populations in eastern North America to test for climatic adaptation. To better understand the role Pleistocene glaciations played in shaping population patterns, a North American, range-wide species distribution model was constructed and hindcast to 22,000 years before present and at 500-year time slices from then to the present. Results The presence of two gene pools with minimal admixture was supported, one in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and one in eastern North America. Western populations were significantly more genetically diverse than eastern populations. There was no evidence for climatic adaptation among eastern populations, though there was evidence for range-wide adaptation to evapotranspiration rates. Hindcast distribution models suggest that observed genetic diversity may be due to a drastic Pleistocene range restriction in eastern North America, whereas a substantial coastal refugial area is inferred in the west. Conclusions Taken together the results show different, complex population histories of L. pulmonaria in eastern and western North America, and suggest that conservation planning for each gene pool should be considered separately.

AB  - Protection of area-limited species is an important component of plans to conserve biodiversity, but the habitat needs of such species can be different and important habitats may not align with existing reserves. We used empirically derived landscape suitability models for the spotted owl and the fisher to evaluate the overlap in habitat suitability for these two old forest-associated predators in an area of northern California affected by the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP), a bioregional conservation plan. The area includes designated Wilderness areas and new reserves (Late-Successional Reserves, LSRs) established under the NWFP. We used the site selection algorithm MARXAN to identify priority habitat areas for each species, and for both combined, and to compare these areas with reserves. Sites were selected under two constraints, to achieve a threshold proportion of total habitat value and to select new areas equal to the total current area in existing reserves. The rank correlation between predicted value for the two species was low (0.11), because areas of highest predicted habitat value were more widely distributed for the owl. This difference also meant that the sites selected to optimize habitat value were more aggregated for fishers than owls, resulting in greater overlap of owl habitat and current reserves. To capture 25%, 50% and 75% of total habitat value for the owl required 14.0%, 29.2%, and 47.3% of the planning units, respectively; capturing the same for the fisher required only 5.3%, 13.5%, and 27.2%. A combined owl-fisher scenario resulted in areas that overlapped only similar to 50% of existing reserves. The current location of LSRs may not be the best solution to maintaining well-connected habitats for these area-limited species in northwestern California. Whether LSRs are a better solution to protecting the diversity of other lesser-known taxa (i.e., salamanders and mollusks) is the subject of related work. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Male and female animals often segregate spatially among habitats and landscapes outside of breeding seasons, but it is unclear to what extent conservation efforts account for sexual segregation. Overlooking this phenomenon may result in conservation plans that don't meet the needs of both sexes, especially when resources or threats vary spatially. We assessed the prevalence of sexual segregation and degree to which current conservation efforts account for it with a review of nonbreeding ecology and conservation planning literature for 66 North American migratory landbirds of conservation concern. Sexual segregation was common in the group-reported for one-third of all species and two-thirds of those with published nonbreeding sex ratios-and did not differ with dimorphism or conservation status. Despite this, only 3% of species distribution models and 8% of conservation recommendations considered sexual segregation, indicating the pattern is widely overlooked. Next, we used the declining Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) as a case study to test for sex-bias in habitats prioritized by current conservation efforts. By modeling nonbreeding occupancy and forest cover loss for males and females, we show that females lost twice as much nonbreeding habitat as males from 2000 to 2016, yet existing conservation focal areas remain heavily biased towards male-dominated landscapes. Furthermore, female-dominated habitats face higher rates of conversion than male habitats for multiple species of Neotropical migrants, suggesting the failure to address sexual segregation may compromise the effectiveness of migratory landbird conservation. We recommend greater effort to report sex ratios and create sex-specific habitat assessments and distribution models.

AB  - Large protected areas have been created in Brazilian Amazon intending to safeguard as much of its biodiversity as possible. Despite these intentions, such megareserves were created predominantly focusing on terrestrial organisms and ecosystems. Here, we assessed the ability of the current Brazilian Amazon protected areas network to efficiently safeguard its stream-dwelling fish fauna. Ecological niche models were built for 138 stream fish species using MaxEnt software. We performed a gap analysis and spatial prioritization under three different Amazon protected areas scenarios: (1) strictly protected areas (SPAs) only; (2) SPA plus sustainable use areas (SPA + SUA); and (3) SPA + SUA plus indigenous territories (SPA + SUA + IT). The species were classified according to their distribution range size and required representation targets. Widespread species usually had lower area under the curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS) values, which would be expected for large and heterogeneous areas such as the Amazon. Only partial gap species were found, with 20% to 90% of required representation targets included in PAs, which was not enough for a complete protection. Most of the officially protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon do not correspond to areas with high direct conservation values for stream fishes, once the priority areas for these species conservation were outside the PAs, leaving a high portion of the regional vertebrate fauna inadequately protected. We conclude that fishes and other freshwater organisms and habitats should be explicitly included during systematic conservation planning in order to thoroughly protect the Brazilian Amazon biodiversity.

AB  - Logistic regression is being used increasingly to develop regional-scale predictive models of species distributions for use in regional conservation planning. These models are usually developed using automated stepwise procedures to select the explanatory variables to include in each model and to fit the functions relating each of these variables to the probability of species occurrence. Available procedures for fitting logistic regression models differ in terms of a number of factors, including the basic modelling technique employed (generalised linear or generalised additive modelling), the strategy used to select explanatory variables and to determine the complexity of fitted functions, and the approach used to correct for multiple testing. This study evaluates the effect that each of these factors has on the predictive accuracy of fitted models, using fauna and flora survey data from north-east New South Wales. The results suggest that predictive accuracy is maximised by employing variable selection procedures that stringently guard against the inclusion of extraneous variables in a model, such as forwards selection with a 5% significance level and removal of insignificant variables at each stage of the selection process. Models fitted using generalised additive modelling were more accurate than those derived using generalised linear modelling. The best approach to controlling the complexity of fitted models was less clear, as it tended to vary between the biological groups examined. Small reptile species were best modelled by complex relationships (3 or 4 df), and vascular plants and diurnal birds by simple relationships (1 or 2 df). Correction for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction factor did not improve the accuracy of models. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current techniques for estimating the extent of occurrence (EOO) of species, especially those with a naturally disjunct distribution and limited available data, lead to overestimations of their geographic distributions. Accurate EOO estimates are of great importance because they are used to assess conservation status. Topological methods, such as those proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are not able to estimate the geographical distribution of these species accurately because they do not consider the abiotic characteristics suitable to maintain viable populations. In this study, we propose the use of ecological niche models (ENMs) to estimate the EOO. We use the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm and the topological method suggested by IUCN (alpha-hull method) to estimate the EOO for a species with disjunct distribution and limited available data. The estimate obtained using the ENM was considered the most accurate because only areas with suitable abiotic conditions were taken into account Thus, analyses related to the conservation status of species become more accurate, especially when evaluating the effects of potential threats in the potential areas occupied by the taxon. The estimate obtained from ENM can also assist the design of conservation strategies for the species, by indicating areas for specific surveys and assessing changes in the EOO over time.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Climate change is a widely accepted threat to biodiversity. Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to forecast whether and how species distributions may track these changes. Yet, SDMs generally fail to account for genetic and demographic processes, limiting population-level inferences. We still do not understand how predicted environmental shifts will impact the spatial distribution of genetic diversity within taxa.
   METHODS: We propose a novel method that predicts spatially explicit genetic and demographic landscapes of populations under future climatic conditions. We use carefully parameterized SDMs as estimates of the spatial distribution of suitable habitats and landscape dispersal permeability under present-day, past, and future conditions. We use empirical genetic data and approximate Bayesian computation to estimate unknown demographic parameters. Finally, we employ these parameters to simulate realistic and complex models of responses to future environmental shifts. We contrast parameterized models under current and future landscapes to quantify the expected magnitude of change.
   KEY RESULTS: We implement this framework on neutral genetic data available from Penstemon deustus. Our results predict that future climate change will result in geographically widespread declines in genetic diversity in this species. The extent of reduction will heavily depend on the continuity of population networks and deme sizes.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide spatially explicit predictions of within-species genetic diversity using climatic, demographic, and genetic data. Our approach accounts for climatic, geographic, and biological complexity. This framework is promising for understanding evolutionary consequences of climate change, and guiding conservation planning.

AB  - Here we develop a framework to design multi-species monitoring networks using species distribution models and conservation planning tools to optimize the location of monitoring stations to detect potential range shifts driven by climate change. For this study, we focused on seven bat species in Northern Portugal (Western Europe). Maximum entropy modelling was used to predict the likely occurrence of those species under present and future climatic conditions. By comparing present and future predicted distributions, we identified areas where each species is likely to gain, lose or maintain suitable climatic space. We then used a decision support tool (the Marxan software) to design three optimized monitoring networks considering: a) changes in species likely occurrence, b) species conservation status, and c) level of volunteer commitment. For present climatic conditions, species distribution models revealed that areas suitable for most species occur in the north-eastern part of the region. However, areas predicted to become climatically suitable in the future shifted towards west. The three simulated monitoring networks, adaptable for an unpredictable volunteer commitment, included 28, 54 and 110 sampling locations respectively, distributed across the study area and covering the potential full range of conditions where species range shifts may occur. Our results show that our framework outperforms the traditional approach that only considers current species ranges, in allocating monitoring stations distributed across different categories of predicted shifts in species distributions. This study presents a straightforward framework to design monitoring schemes aimed specifically at testing hypotheses about where and when species ranges may shift with climatic changes, while also ensuring surveillance of general population trends.

AB  - Betula utilis is a native tree and important tree line species in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). Due to various natural and anthropogenic factors, the population of the species has become dwindling. Therefore, study was conducted to; assess population, regeneration, habitat suitability model, size class distribution and physico-chemical properties of the soil in sub-alpine ecosystem of Great Himalayan National Park. Total 64 populations assessed to determine the density, Total Basal Area, Species diversity index, Concentration of dominance and regeneration pattern of seedlings and saplings. Amongst the identified populations, total trees density ranged from 10-730 Ind ha(-1); total basal area 0.00-43.32 m(2) ha(-1); total shrubs density 340-3490 Ind ha(-1); total herbs density 8.54-152.77 Ind m(-2); total saplings density 9-3050 Ind ha(-1) and total seedlings density 10-1840 Ind ha(-1). Species diversity of trees was ranged from 0.00 to 0.37; Concentration of dominance ranged from 0.00 to 1.00. Size class distribution revealed that maximum number of individuals was fallen in the range of 52.6-73.5 cm whereas lowest numbers of individuals were fallen in the range of 136.6-157.5 cm and >= 220.6 cm. The model calibration test for B.utilis yielded satisfactory results (AUC (Mean) = 0.91 +/- 0.02) indicated that MaxEnt could be used to predict the potentially suitable habitats for in-situ or ex-situ conservation. The model predicted 268 km(2) area suitable for reintroduction. Frequent monitoring of populations for understanding the dynamics and identifying natural habitats for the in-situ conservation of the species are suggested.

AB  - Marine biodiversity is under extreme pressure from anthropogenic activity globally, leading to calls to protect at least 10% of the world's oceans within marine protected areas (MPAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures. Fulfilling such commitments, however, requires a detailed understanding of the distribution of potentially detrimental human activities, and their predicted impacts. One such approach that is being increasingly used to strengthen our understanding of human impacts is cumulative impact mapping; as it can help identify economic sectors with the greatest potential impact on species and ecosystems in order to prioritize conservation management strategies, providing clear direction for intervention. In this paper, we present the first local cumulative utilization impact mapping exercise for the Bioko-Corisco-Continental area of Equatorial Guinea's Exclusive Economic Zone - situated in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the most important and least studied marine regions in the Eastern Central Atlantic. This study examines the potential impact of ten direct anthropogenic activities on a suite of key marine megafauna species and reveals that the most suitable habitats for these species, located on the continental shelf, are subject to the highest threat scores. However, in some coastal areas, the persistence of highly suitable habitat subject to lower threat scores suggests that there are still several strategic areas that are less impacted by human activity that may be suitable sites for protected area expansion. Highlighting both the areas with potentially the highest impact, and those with lower impact levels, as well as particularly damaging activities can inform the direction of future conservation initiatives in the region.

AB  - Protected areas are often blamed for offering refuge to pest species populations, giving rise to the so-called "reserve effect". Nevertheless, this major conservation side effect has seldom been investigated or verified on a local scale. Along the borders of two protected areas of different size, we modelled wild boar individual likelihood of being either inside or outside the protected areas throughout the year, considering their activity rhythms and resource availability. No evidence of reserve effect was found in the small protected area, yet the percentage of wild boar moving across the border was smaller in the large one. Moreover, although wild boar use of the large protected area resulted to increase in autumn, we showed that this was not the consequence of hunting avoidance. Our results clearly highlighted the importance to verify reserve effect on a local scale with studies based on detailed information on animal spatial behaviour and environmental variables.

AB  - Background Medicinal plants have always played an important role in the history of human health. However, the populations and sustainable use of medicinal plants have been severely affected by human activities and climate change. Little is known about the current conservation status and distribution pattern of medicinal plants. In this study, based on accurate geographical distribution information of 9756 medicinal plants, we identified diversity hotspots and conservation gaps, evaluated conservation effectiveness of nature reserves, and predicted suitable habitat areas for medicinal plants in China to provide scientific guidance for their long-term conservation and sustainable use. Results A total of 150 diversity hotspot grid cells, mainly concentrated in central and southern China, were identified. These only accounted for 5% of the total distribution area but contained 96% of the medicinal plants of the country. The hotspot grid cells included all traditional hotspot areas, but we also detected three new hotspots, namely Mufu-Lushan Mountains, Tianshan-Altai Mountains, and Changbai Mountains. The current national and provincial nature reserves protect 125 hotspot grid cells, which harbor 94% of all medicinal plants. However, 25 hotspot grid cells, distributed in the Tianshan-Altai Mountains and Hengduan Mountains, are located outside the national and provincial nature reserves. An analysis of the predicted effects of climate change indicated that the suitable habitat areas will shift from southern to northern China, and that southern China will face a considerable loss of suitable habitat areas, while the east and west parts of China will encompass remarkably more suitable habitat areas in the future. Conclusions The current conservation networks have achieved high conservation effectiveness with regard to medicinal plants; however, the conservation gaps we identified should not be neglected, and conservation planning needs to take into account the predicted shifts of some hotspots of medicinal plants due to climate change.

AB  - Environmental changes are driving rapid geographic shifts of suitable environmental conditions for species. These might survive by tracking those shifts, however successful responses will depend on the spatial distribution of suitable habitats (current and future) and on their connectivity. Most herptiles (i.e., amphibians and reptiles) have low dispersal abilities, and therefore herptiles are among the most vulnerable groups to environmental changes. Here we assessed the vulnerability of herptile species to future climate and land use changes in fragmented landscapes. We developed and tested a methodological approach combining the strengths of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and of functional connectivity analysis. First, using SDMs we forecasted current and future distributions of potential suitable areas as well as range dynamics for four herptile species in Portugal. SDM forecasts for 2050 were obtained under two contrasting emission scenarios, translated into moderate (low-emissions scenario) or large (high-emissions scenario) changes in climate and land use conditions. Then, we calculated and analysed functional connectivity from areas projected to lose environmental suitability towards areas keeping suitable conditions. Landscape matrix resistance and barrier effects of the national motorway network were incorporated as the main sources of fragmentation. Potential suitable area was projected to decrease under future conditions for most test species, with the high-emissions scenario amplifying the losses or gains. Spatiotemporal patterns of connectivity between potentially suitable areas signalled the most important locations for maintaining linkages and migration corridors, as well as potential conflicts due to overlaps with the current motorway network. By integrating SDM projections with functional connectivity analysis, we were able to assess and map the vulnerability of distinct herptile species to isolation or extinction under environmental change scenarios. Our framework provides valuable information, with fairly low data requirements, for optimizing biodiversity management and mitigation efforts, aiming to reduce the complex and often synergistic negative impacts of multiple environmental change drivers. Implications for conservation planning and management are discussed from a global change adaptation perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Distribution of plant species in different habitats along a west-east transect across Bahrain Island was studied. Total cover, relative cover, life-form spectrum, and importance values for the dominant species were determined. Possible relationships between species distribution and some environmental factors are discussed. The study shows species distribution to be similar to that found in the corresponding habitats in the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. Species with the highest percentage of occurrence were Zygophyllum qatarense, Helianthemum kahiricum and Panicum turgidum. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB  - Although well-studied vertebrates such as the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) are often used as focal species in regional conservation plans, range shifts associated with climate change may compromise this role. I used the Maxent (maximum entropy) method to develop NSO distribution models from data on NSO locations, forest age, and an ensemble of climate projections. NSO presence was positively associated with the proportion of old and mature forest at two spatial scales. Winter precipitation was the most important climate variable, consistent with previous studies suggesting negative effects on survival and recruitment. Model results suggest that initial niche expansion may be followed by a contraction as climate change intensifies, but this prediction is uncertain due to variability in predicted changes in precipitation between climate projections. Although new reserves created by the US Northwest Forest Plan prioritized areas with greater biological importance for the NSO than did pre-existing reserves, the latter areas, which lie predominantly at higher elevations, increase in importance under climate change. In contrast with previous analyses of the region's localized old-forest-associated species, vegetation rather than climate dominated NSO distribution models. Rigorous assessment of the implications of climate change for focal species requires development of dynamic vegetation models that incorporate effects of competitor species and altered disturbance regimes. The results suggest that, lacking such data, models that combine climate data with current data on habitat factors such as vegetation can inform conservation planning by providing less-biased estimates of potential range shifts than do niche models based on climate variables alone.

AB  - Palms species (Arecaceae) are abundant in tropical forests and influence ecosystems in important ways. Moreover, they are a relevant feature in the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we seek to better understand the distribution of palm richness in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, with the aim to support conservation decisions and actions. Maps for 15 palm species were generated through species distribution modeling and then stacked into a palm richness map, which was further combined with current land-use and protected area maps to generate a realistic portrayal of the current situation of Arecaceae in the state. Our results revealed an increasing inland-to-coast pattern of richness that matches the biogeographical subdivision of the Atlantic Forest. Considering the land-use information, the palm species potential distribution is drastically reduced, especially for some species which already have a restricted distribution in the state. We also identified the most relevant protected areas for the conservation of palms in the state and those which might have been overlooked in floristic inventories, thus requiring more detailed investigation. Moreover, we point out those species with few points, for which species distribution models could not be built, and argue that they are the ones more likely to be threatened by habitat loss and should be the focus of specimen collection and recording. Finally, we draw attention to a large medium-richness remnant located between two protected areas which probably functions as a connection between them and should be a priority area for conservation.

AB  - While the importance of spatial scale in ecology is well established, few studies have investigated the impact of data grain on conservation planning outcomes. In this study, we compared species richness hotspot and representation networks developed at five grain sizes. We used species distribution maps for mammals and birds developed by the Arizona and. New Mexico Gap Analysis Programs (GAP) to produce 1-km(2), 100-km(2) 625-km(2), 2500-km(2), and 10000-km(2) grid cell resolution distribution maps. We used these distribution maps to generate species richness and hotspot (95th quantile) maps for each taxon in each state. Species composition information at each grain size was used to develop two types of representation networks using the reserve selection software MARXAN. Reserve selection analyses were restricted to Arizona birds due to considerable computation requirements. We used MARXAN to create best reserve networks based on the minimum area required to represent each species at least once and equal area networks based on irreplaceability values. We also measured the median area of each species' distribution included in hotspot (mammals and birds of Arizona and New Mexico) and irreplaceability (Arizona birds) networks across all species.
   Mean area overlap between richness hotspot reserves identified at the five grain sizes was 29% (grand mean for four within-taxon/state comparisons), mean overlap for irreplaceability reserve networks was 32%, and mean overlap for best reserve networks was 53%. Hotspots for mammals and birds showed low overlap with a mean of 30%. Comparison of hotspots and irreplaceability networks showed very low overlap with a mean of 13%. For hotspots; median species distribution area protected within reserves declined monotonically from a high of 11% for 1-km(2) networks down to 6% for 10000-km(2) networks. Irreplaceability networks showed a similar, but more variable, pattern of decline.
   This work clearly shows that map resolution has a profound effect on conservation planning outcomes and that hotspot and representation outcomes may be strikingly dissimilar. Thus, conservation planning is scale dependent, such that reserves developed using coarse-grained data do not subsume fine-grained reserves. Moreover, preserving both full species representation and species rich areas may require combined reserve design strategies.

AB  - Distribution data on biodiversity features is a major component of conservation planning that are often inaccurate; thus, the true distribution of each feature is commonly over- or underrepresented. The selection of distribution data sets may therefore lead to variability in the spatial configuration and size of proposed reserve networks and uncertainty regarding the extent to which these networks actually contain the biodiversity features they were identified to protect. Our goals were to investigate the impact on reserve selection of choosing different distribution data sets and to propose novel methods to minimize uncertainty about target attainment within reserves. To do so, we used common prioritization methods (richness mapping, systematic reserve design, and a novel approach that integrates multiple types of distribution data) and three types of data on the distribution of mammals (predicted distribution models, occurrence records, and a novel combination of the two) to simulate the establishment of regional biodiversity reserves for the state of Arizona (U. S. A.). Using the results of these simulations, we explored variability in reserve placement and size as a function of the distribution data set. Spatial overlap of reserve networks identified with only predicted distribution data or only occurrence distribution data never exceeded 16%. In pairwise comparisons between reserves created with all three types of distribution data, overlap never achieved 50%. The reserve size required to meet conservation targets also varied with the type of distribution data used and the conservation goal; the largest reserve system was 10 times the smallest. Our results highlight the impact of employing different types of distribution data and identify novel tools for application to existing distribution data sets that can minimize uncertainty about target attainment.

AB  - Although China has established more than 600 wetland nature reserves, conservation gaps still exist for many species, especially for freshwater fishes. Underlying this problem is the fact that top-level planning is missing in the construction of nature reserves. To promote the development of nature reserves for fishes, this study took the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLYRB) as an example to carry out top-level reserve network planning for fishes using approaches of systematic conservation planning. Typical fish species living in freshwater habitats were defined and considered in the planning. Based on sample data collected from large quantities of literatures, continuous distribution patterns of 142 fishes were obtained with species distribution modeling and subsequent processing, and the distributions of another eleven species were artificially designated. With the distribution pattern of species, Marxan was used to carry out conservation planning. To obtain ideal solutions with representativeness, persistence, and efficiency, parameters were set with careful consideration regarding existing wetland reserves, human disturbances, hydrological connectivity, and representation targets of species. Marxan produced the selection frequency of planning units (PUs) and a best solution. Selection frequency indicates the relative protection importance of a PU. The best solution is a representative of ideal fish reserve networks. Both of the PUs with high selection frequency and those in the best solution have low proportions included in existing wetland nature reserves, suggesting that there are significant conservation gaps for fish species in MLYRB. The best solution could serve as a reference for establishing a fish reserve network in the MLYRB. There is great flexibility for replacing selected PUs in the solution, and such flexibility facilitates the implementation of the solution in reality in case of unexpected obstacles. Further, we suggested adopting a freshwater management framework in the implementation of such solution.

AB  - The rate of deforestation in the Amazon is increasing. Predictive models estimate that as a result of agricultural expansion 40% of these forests will be lost by 2050. As a consequence the habitat of forest-dwelling species such as the Endangered black-faced black spider monkeyAteles chamekis being lost, particularly along the arc of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. We used species distribution modelling to (1) define the distribution of this spider monkey, using environmental predictors, (2) calculate the area of this distribution covered by the protected area network, and (3) calculate the expected loss of the species' habitat under future scenarios of deforestation. We found that the species occupies only c. 28% of its extent of occurrence. Only 32% of the species' area of occupancy is legally protected, and the modelling suggests that 31-40% of the species' habitat will be lost by 2050. We highlight three unprotected regions with extensive forest cover that are predicted to become severely deforested by 2050 as priority regions for expanding the protected area network. We also propose landscape management and restoration in three human-modified regions. Our study provides an example of how species distribution modelling can be applied to assess threats to species and support decision makers in implementing conservation actions.

AB  - Multi-criteria evaluation and simulated annealing for delimiting high priority habitats of Alectoris chukar and Phasianus colchicus in Iran. Habitat degradation and hunting are among the most important causes of population decline for Alectoris chukar and Phasianus colchicus, two of the most threatened game species in the Golestan Province of Iran. Limited data on distribution and location of high-quality habitats for the two species make conservation efforts more difficult in the province. We used multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) as a coarse-filter approach to refine the general distribution areas into habitat suitability maps for the species. We then used these maps as input to simulated annealing as a heuristic algorithm through Marxan in order to prioritize areas for conservation of the two species. To find the optimal solution, we tested various boundary length modifier (BLM) values in the simulated annealing process. Our results showed that the MCE approach was useful to refine general habitat maps. Assessment of the selected reserves confirmed the suitability of the selected areas (mainly neighboring the current reserves) making their management easier and more feasible. The total area of the selected reserves was about 476 km(2). As current reserves of the Golestan Province represent only 23 % of the optimal area, further protected areas should be considered to efficiently conserve these two species.

AB  - 1. Accounting for genetic diversity and evolutionary processes has long been recognised as an important goal in conservation planning. However, because genetic data are often lacking, surrogate approaches are widely used. Few studies have, however, assessed the capacity of surrogate data, such as higher taxonomic levels (e.g. species distributions) to portray intraspecific genetic diversity.
   2. Here, we contrast conservation plans based on traditional species distribution data, with those derived from intraspecific genetic data for a smaller subset of species, both using freshwater fish in northern Australia. We modelled the spatial distribution of 46 species and intraspecific genetic diversity within four common species. We then identified priority areas for conservation using both data sets and evaluated the extent to which solutions obtained from species distribution data portrayed genetic diversity.
   3. We found that genetic diversity could be adequately represented within priority areas identified using species distribution data, even at low conservation targets and for species with complex genetic structure. However, this was only true when using the entire fish community (i.e. all 46 species). In contrast, a substantial component of the genetic structure would not be represented in conservation priority areas when using a subset of species.
   4. Our results have important implications for the use of surrogates for genetic diversity in conservation planning. Sufficient genetic diversity might be represented in conservation priority areas by including a broad range of species with distributions ranging from common to rare elements in the community in the prioritisation analyses. We recommend focusing on improving accuracy of data on species distributions to reduce uncertainties in conservation recommendations derived from commission and omission errors, to avoid misuse of limited conservation funds and potential failure of conservation practice.

AB  - Conservation actors face the challenge of allocating limited resources despite uncertainty about future climate conditions. In many cases, the potential value and feasibility of proposed projects vary across climate scenarios. A key goal is to identify areas where conservation outcomes can balance both environmental and human needs.
   We developed a conservation prioritization framework that jointly considers the value and feasibility of candidate projects across future climate scenarios. We then applied this framework to the challenge of meeting environmental flow targets across the Red River basin of the south-central United States.
   To estimate the conservation feasibility of meeting environmental flow goals in a river reach in each climate scenario, we used a basin-wide hydrologic planning tool to quantify the reduction in societal water usage needed to meet environmental flow targets. To estimate the biodiversity value of each river reach in each climate scenario, we used climate-driven species distribution models and species' conservation status.
   We found that river reaches in the east-central portion of the basin may be good candidates for conservation investments, because they had high biodiversity value and high sociopolitical feasibility in all future climate scenarios. In contrast, sites in the arid western reaches of the basin had high biodiversity value, but low feasibility of achieving environmental flow goals.
   Our framework should have broad applicability given that the value and feasibility of conservation projects vary across climate scenarios in ecosystems around the world. It may serve as a coarse filter to identify sites for more detailed analyses and could be integrated with complementarity-based approaches to conservation planning to balance species' representation across projects.

   To incorporate evolutionary processes into conservation planning using species distribution patterns and environmental gradients as surrogates for genetic diversity.
   Location
   Western Mediterranean Basin.
   Methods
   Distributions of 154 herpetological species were predicted using maximum entropy models, and groups of significantly co-occurring species (biotic elements) were identified. Environmental gradients were characterized for the complete area and for the area covered by each biotic element, by performing a principal component analysis on the data matrix composed of nine environmental variables. The first two principal component analysis axes were classified into four categories each, and those categories were combined with each other resulting in an environmental classification with 16 categories. To identify priority conservation areas, biotic elements and environmental categories were used as surrogates for the neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity, respectively. Priority areas for conservation were identified under three scenarios: (1) setting targets for species only; (2) setting targets for species and for each environmental category of the overall area; and (3) setting targets for each species and for each environmental category within each biotic element.
   Results
   Nine biotic elements were identified - four for the amphibians and five for the reptiles. Priority areas identified in the three scenarios were similar in terms of amount of area selected, but exhibited low spatial agreement.
   Main conclusions
   Prioritization exercises that integrate surrogates for evolutionary processes can deliver spatial priorities that are fairly different to those where only species representation is considered. While new methods are emerging to incorporate molecular data in conservation prioritization, it is unlikely to be enough data for enough taxa for this to be feasible in many regions. We develop an approach using surrogates for both the neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity that may enhance biodiversity persistence and representation when molecular data are not available or geographically comprehensive.

AB  - We explored how presence data and expert opinions performed with respect to identifying the ecological preferences and the spatial needs of six butterfly species in the Federal State of Saxony, Germany. We used presence records and a land-cover map. In parallel we used expert responses to evaluate the 40 land-cover types occurring in the map, in terms of both suitability and permeability for the six species. Presence data were translated into preferences through Ivlev's electivity indices (IEI). Visual analysis of preference maps based on IEI showed a distinct pattern of suitable versus less suitable areas. Similarly, spatial analyses found that presence-points were closer to suitability areas based on IEI than those that were based on expert data. However, in case of mismatches between expert and presence-based evaluations, independent experts identified the expert evaluation as better and considered IEI outcomes as wrong. We found a medium to high correlation between land-cover class suitability and permeability based on expert opinions for all species. This indicates that expert evaluation of permeability is affiliated with habitat suitability. Integration of species-presence data and expert-knowledge about species could enhance our capabilities to understand and potentially map suitability while gathering information about suitability and permeability separately can improve species conservation planning.

AB  - Aim Defining priority areas for conservation is essential to minimize biodiversity loss, but the adoption of different methods for describing species distributions influences the outcomes. In order to provide a robust basis for the conservation of freshwater turtles in Africa, we compared the effect that different species-mapping approaches had on derived patterns of species richness, species vulnerability and protected-area representativeness.
   Location Africa.
   Methods We adopted three different approaches with increasing complexity for generating species distribution maps. The first approach was based on the geographic intersection of species records and grid squares; the second on the union of local convex polygons; and the third on inductive distribution modelling techniques. We used distribution maps, generated using these three approaches, to determine conservation priorities based on geographic patterns of species richness and vulnerability, as well as for conducting gap and irreplaceability analyses.
   Results We obtained markedly different distribution maps using the three methods, which in turn caused differences in conservation priorities. The grid-square approach underestimated range sizes and species richness, while the polygon approach overestimated these attributes. The distribution modelling approach provided the most realistic outcome in terms of diversity patterns, by minimizing both commission and omission errors. An integrated map of conservation priority - derived by combining individual measures of priority based on the distribution modelling approach - identified the Gulf of Guinea coast and the Albertine Rift as major priority areas.
   Main conclusions Each species-mapping approach has both advantages and disadvantages. The choice of the most appropriate approach in any given situation depends on the availability of locality records and on the relative importance of mitigating omission and commission errors. Our findings suggest that in most circumstances, the use of distribution modelling has many advantages relative to the other approaches. The priority areas identified in this study should be considered for targeting efforts to conserve Africa freshwater turtles in the coming years.

AB  - Civil society can play a relevant role in supporting local environmental management, as volunteer efforts can be carried out at low cost and therefore be sustained over time. We present in this paper the assessment of the effectiveness of a volunteer program for the control of invasive pines in a protected area (PA) in a coastal zone of southern Brazil. Volunteer work has been ongoing for 8years and the current state of invasion was compared with three simulation scenarios of species distribution that considered suitable habitats for pine invasion. Our results suggest that management actions have been effective. In the absence of any control efforts, pine trees would cover a high percentage of suitable habitats within the PA. Eliminating adult pine trees that function as seed sources and not allowing the next generation to reach maturity has been an efficient control strategy that has led to changes in the population structure of pines in the PA. Reaching neighboring private property owners is key for the future effective control of pines in the area, as all sources of pine seeds need to be eliminated. The approach used in our study may be applied to broader spatial scales to provide a baseline for management efforts needed to effectively control non-native invasive species.

AB  - Quantifying how animals use key habitats and resources for their survival allows managers to optimise conservation planning; however, obtaining representative sample sizes of wildlife distributions in both time and space is challenging, particularly in the marine environment. Here, we used unoccupied aircraft systems (UASs) to evaluate temporal and spatial variation in the distribution of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) at two high-density breeding aggregations in the Mediterranean, and the effect of varying sample size and survey frequency. In May-June of 2017 to 2019, we conducted 69 surveys, assimilating 10,075 inwater turtle records at the two sites. Optimal time interval between surveys to capture the dynamics of aggregations over the breeding period was 500 turtles (from the combined surveys). This minimum threshold was attributed to the core-area use of female turtles shifting across surveys in relation to wind direction to access warmer nearshore waters and male presence. Males were more widely distributed within aggregations than females, particularly in May when mating encounters were high. Most males were recorded swimming and oriented parallel to shore, likely to enhance encounter rates with females. In contrast, most females were generally stationary (resting on the seabed or basking), likely to conserve energy for reproduction, with orientation appearing to shift in relation to male numbers at the breeding area. Thus, by identifying the main factors regulating the movement and distribution of animals, appropriate survey intervals can be selected for appropriate home range analyses. Our study demonstrates the versatility of UASs to capture the fine-scale dynamics of wildlife aggregations and associated factors, which is important for implementing effective conservation.

AB  - Relative to target species, priority conservation species occur rarely in fishery interactions, resulting in imbalanced, overdispersed data. We present Ensemble Random Forests (ERFs) as an intuitive extension of the Random Forest algorithm to handle rare event bias. Each Random Forest receives individual stratified randomly sampled training/test sets, then down-samples the majority class for each decision tree. Results are averaged across Random Forests to generate an ensemble prediction. Through simulation, we show that ERFs outperform Random Forest with and without down-sampling, as well as with the synthetic minority over-sampling technique, for highly class imbalanced to balanced datasets. Spatial covariance greatly impacts ERFs' perceived performance, as shown through simulation and case studies. In case studies from the Hawaii deep-set longline fishery, giant manta ray Mobula birostris syn. Manta birostris and scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini presence had high spatial covariance and high model test performance, while false killer whale Pseudorca crassidens had low spatial covariance and low model test performance. Overall, we find ERFs have 4 advantages: (1) reduced successive partitioning effects; (2) prediction uncertainty propagation; (3) better accounting for interacting covariates through balancing; and (4) minimization of false positives, as the majority of Random Forests within the ensemble vote correctly. As ERFs can readily mitigate rare event bias without requiring large presence sample sizes or imparting considerable balancing bias, they are likely to be a valuable tool in bycatch and species distribution modeling, as well as spatial conservation planning, especially for protected species where presence can be rare.

AB  - Characterized as one of the largest biodiversity hot spots, the Cerrado ecoregion is home to a wide variety of endemic species. Several threats such as agricultural expansion and habitat fragmentation put the species of the Cerrado ecosystems and biodiversity at risk. Thus, this study analysed the genus Eremanthus, which has abundant species in the Cerrado and suffers from intense anthropogenic pressure due to overexploitation, mainly as a material utilized for the construction of fences and the extraction of essential oils. Environmental suitability was estimated for the genus for the present and future (2070), in order to characterize the importance of the climate in the species distribution and to analyse the conservation status of the genus. The Species Distribution Modelling and Gap Analysis showed that the areas of environmental suitability are limited and are found in a matrix composed of a high presence of anthropic activity, which can intensify the loss of species habitat and increase the vulnerability of the group. The studied species were classified as Endangered and Vulnerable according to IUCN criteria, presenting very reduced areas of environmental suitability projected in the future and a low percentage of species in protected areas, that may influence possible species extinctions in the genus. Thus, this study provides insights to assist in conservation planning and reinforces the importance of protecting the biodiversity of the Cerrado.

AB  - We introduce a new way of measuring and optimizing connectivity in conservation landscapes through time, accounting for both the biological needs of multiple species and the social and. nancial constraint of minimizing land area requiring additional protection. Our method is based on the concept of network. ow; we demonstrate its use by optimizing protected areas in the Western Cape of South Africa to facilitate autogenic species shifts in geographic range under climate change for a family of endemic plants, the Cape Proteaceae. In 2005, P. Williams and colleagues introduced a novel framework for this protected area design task. To ensure population viability, they assumed each species should have a range size of at least 100 km(2) of predicted suitable conditions contained in protected areas at all times between 2000 and 2050. The goal was to design multiple dispersal corridors for each species, connecting suitable conditions between time periods, subject to each species' limited dispersal ability, and minimizing the total area requiring additional protection. We show that both minimum range size and limited dispersal abilities can be naturally modeled using the concept of network. ow. This allows us to apply well- established tools from operations research and computer science for solving network. ow problems. Using the same data and this novel modeling approach, we reduce the area requiring additional protection by a third compared to previous methods, from 4593 km(2) to 3062 km(2), while still achieving the same conservation planning goals. We prove that this is the best solution mathematically possible: the given planning goals cannot be achieved with a smaller area, given our modeling assumptions and data. Our method allows for. exibility and re. nement of the underlying climate- change, species- habitat- suitability, and dispersal models. In particular, we propose an alternate formalization of a minimum range size moving through time and use network. ow to achieve the revised goals, again with the smallest possible newly protected area (2850 km(2)). We show how to relate total dispersal distance to probability of successful dispersal, and compute a trade- off curve between this quantity and the total amount of extra land that must be protected.

AB  - Balancing human well-being with the maintenance of ecosystem services (ES) for future generations has become one of the central sustainability challenges of the 21st century. In working landscapes, past and ongoing production-centered objectives have resulted in the conversion of ecosystems into simple land-use types, which has also altered the provision of most ES. These inevitable trade-offs between the efficient production of individual provisioning ES and the maintenance of regulating and cultural ES call for the development of a land-use strategy based on the multifunctional use of the landscape. Due to the heterogeneous nature of working landscapes, both protection and restoration actions are needed to improve their multifunctionality. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) offers a decision support framework that can support landscape multifunctionality by indicating where ES management efforts should be implemented. We describe an approach that we developed to include ES provision protection and restoration objectives in SCP with the goal of providing ongoing benefits to society. We explain the general framework of this approach and discuss concepts, challenges, innovations, and prospects for the further development of a comprehensive decision support tool. We illustrate our approach with two case studies implemented in the pan-Canadian project ResNet.

AB  - Complementarity and cost-efficiency are widely used principles for protected area network design. Despite the wide use and robust theoretical underpinnings, their effects on the performance and patterns of priority areas are rarely studied in detail. Here we compare two approaches for identifying the management priority areas inside the global protected area network: 1) a scoring-based approach, used in recently published analysis and 2) a spatial prioritization method, which accounts for complementarity and area-efficiency. Using the same IUCN species distribution data the complementarity method found an equal-area set of priority areas with double the mean species ranges covered compared to the scoringbased approach. The complementarity set also had 72% more species with full ranges covered, and lacked any coverage only for half of the species compared to the scoring approach. Protected areas in our complementarity-based solution were on average smaller and geographically more scattered. The large difference between the two solutions highlights the need for critical thinking about the selected prioritization method. According to our analysis, accounting for complementarity and area-efficiency can lead to considerable improvements when setting management priorities for the global protected area network.

AB  - Habitat transformations caused by human land-use change are considered major drivers of ongoing biodiversity loss(1-3), and their impact on biodiversity is expected to increase further this century(4-6). Here, we used global decadal land-use projections to year 2070 for a range of shared socioeconomic pathways, which are linked to particular representative concentration pathways, to evaluate potential losses in range-wide suitable habitat and extinction risks for approximately 19,400 species of amphibians, birds and mammals. Substantial declines in suitable habitat are identified for species worldwide, with approximately 1,700 species expected to become imperilled due to land-use change alone. National stewardship for species highlights certain South American, Southeast Asian and African countries that are in particular need of proactive conservation planning. These geographically explicit projections and model workflows embedded in the Map of Life infrastructure are provided to facilitate the scrutiny, improvements and future updates needed for an ongoing and readily updated assessment of changing biodiversity. These forward-looking assessments and informatics tools are intended to support national conservation action and policies for addressing climate change and land-use change impacts on biodiversity.

AB  - The African protected area (PA) network has the potential to act as a set of functionally interconnected patches that conserve meta-populations of mammal species, but individual PAs are vulnerable to habitat change which may disrupt connectivity and increase extinction risk. Individual PAs have different roles in maintaining connectivity, depending on their size and location. We measured their contribution to network connectivity (irreplaceability) for carnivores and ungulates and combined it with a measure of vulnerability based on a 30-year trend in remotely sensed vegetation cover (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Highly irreplaceable PAs occurred mainly in southern and eastern Africa. Vegetation cover change was generally faster outside than inside PAs and particularly so in southern Africa. The extent of change increased with the distance from PAs. About 5% of highly irreplaceable PAs experienced a faster vegetation cover loss than their surroundings, thus requiring particular conservation attention. Our analysis identified PAs at risk whose isolation would disrupt the connectivity of the PA network for large mammals. This is an example of how ecological spatial modelling can be combined with large-scale remote sensing data to investigate how land cover change may affect ecological processes and species conservation.

AB  - Climate change has the potential to severely threaten Taxuschinensis, an endangered endemic tree plant in China. Hence, we need to plan conservation areas for T. chinensis in light of climate change. We applied the common species distribution modelling software Maxent to generate maps of current and projected future distributions of T. chinensis. These distributional maps with conservation planning software were used to determine priority protection areas (PPAs). Then, we evaluated the ability of existing nature reserves to conserve T. chinensis and performed a gap analysis for the species under climate change. The PPAs of T. chinensis were mainly distributed within central and southern China. Nature reserves such as Zhangjiajiedani, Yangzie, Wolong, Baishuijiang and Dabashan have the greatest potential to protect T. chinensis under climate change. In situ and ex situ conservation of T. chinensis in the PPAs of these five nature reserves should be a priority. However, existing nature reserves lag far behind the PPAs with respect to total area. Therefore, more nature reserves are urgently needed for species like T. chinensis to cope with rapid climate change. Meanwhile, we should strengthen protection and management of areas that will experience an increase in T. chinensis while enhancing both monitoring and protection activities for T. chinensis in PPAs that are predicted to experience decreases in population size. Finally, we suggest that climate change must be integrated into conservation planning for the endangered plant species, T. chinensis.

AB  - Management of human activities which impact the seafloor in the deep ocean is becoming increasingly important as bottom trawling and exploration for minerals, oil, and gas continue to extend into regions where fragile ecosystems containing habitat-forming deep-sea corals and sponges may be found. Spatial management of these vulnerable marine ecosystems requires accurate knowledge of their distribution. Predictive habitat suitability modelling, using species presence data and a suite of environmental predictor variables, has emerged as a useful tool for inferring distributions outside of known areas. However, validation of model predictions is typically performed with non-independent data. In this study, we describe the results of habitat suitability models constructed for four deep-sea reef-forming coral species across a large region of the South Pacific Ocean using MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Tree modelling approaches. In order to validate model predictions we conducted a photographic survey on a set of seamounts in an un-sampled area east of New Zealand. The likelihood of habitat suitable for reef-forming corals on these seamounts was predicted to be variable, but very high in some regions, particularly where levels of aragonite saturation, dissolved oxygen, and particulate organic carbon were optimal. However, the observed frequency of coral occurrence in analyses of survey photographic data was much lower than expected, and patterns of observed versus predicted coral distribution were not highly correlated. The poor performance of these broad-scale models is attributed to lack of recorded species absences to inform the models, low precision of global bathymetry models, and lack of data on the geomorphology and substrate of the seamounts at scales appropriate to the modelled taxa. This demonstrates the need to use caution when interpreting and applying broad-scale, presence-only model results for fisheries management and conservation planning in data poor areas of the deep sea. Future improvements in the predictive performance of broad-scale models will rely on the continued advancement in modelling of environmental predictor variables, refinements in modelling approaches to deal with missing or biased inputs, and incorporation of true absence data.

AB  - Background. Large carnivores influence ecosystem functions at various scales. Thus, their local extinction is not only a species-specific conservation concern, but also reflects on the overall habitat quality and ecosystem value. Species-habitat relationships at fine scale reflect the individuals' ability to procure resources and negotiate intraspecific competition. Such fine scale habitat choices are more pronounced in large carnivores such as tiger (Panthera tigris), which exhibits competitive exclusion in habitat and mate selection strategies. Although landscape level policies and conservation strategies are increasingly promoted for tiger conservation, specific management interventions require knowledge of the habitat correlates at fine scale.
   Methods. We studied nine radio-collared individuals of a successfully reintroduced tiger population in Panna Tiger Reserve, central India, focussing on the species-habitat relationship at fine scales. With 16 eco-geographical variables, we performed Manly's selection ratio and K-select analyses to define population-level and individual-level variation in resource selection, respectively. We analysed the data obtained during the exploratory period of six tigers and during the settled period of eight tigers separately, and compared the consequent results. We further used the settled period characteristics to model and map habitat suitability based on the Mahalanobis D-2 method and the Boyce index.
   Results. There was a clear difference in habitat selection by tigers between the exploratory and the settled period. During the exploratory period, tigers selected dense canopy and bamboo forests, but also spent time near villages and relocated village sites. However, settled tigers predominantly selected bamboo forests in complex terrain, riverine forests and teak-mixed forest, and totally avoided human settlements and agriculture areas. There were individual variations in habitat selection between exploratory and settled periods. Based on threshold limits of habitat selection by the Boyce Index, we established that 83% of core and 47% of buffer areas are now suitable habitats for tiger in this reserve.
   Discussion. Tiger management often focuses on large-scale measures, but this study for the first time highlights the behaviour and fine-scale individual-specific habitat selection strategies. Such knowledge is vital for management of critical tiger habitats and specifically for the success of reintroduction programs. Our spatially explicit habitat suitability map provides a baseline for conservation planning and optimizing carrying capacity of the tiger population in this reserve.

AB  - Establishment of protected areas to maintain biodiversity requires identification, prioritization and management of stressors that may undermine conservation goals. Nonindigenous species and climate change are critical ecosystem stressors that need greater attention in the context of spatial planning and management of protected areas. Risk of invasion into protected areas needs to be quantified under current and projected climate conditions in conjunction with prioritization of key vectors and vulnerable areas to enable development of effective management strategies. We assessed the likelihood of invasion across networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) to determine how invaded MPAs may compromise MPA networks by sharing nonindigenous species. We evaluated invasion risk in 83 MPAs along Canada's Pacific coast for eight nonindigenous species based on environmental suitability under current and future (average conditions from 2041 to 2070) climate conditions and association with shipping and boating pathways. We applied species distribution models and network analysis of vessel tracking data for 805 vessels in 2016 that connected MPAs. The probability of occurrence within MPAs and the proportion of MPA area that is suitable to the modelled species significantly increased under future climate conditions, with six species reaching over 90% predicted occurrence across MPAs and over 70% of suitable area within MPAs. Vessel traffic created four network clusters of 61 highly connected MPAs that spanned the coastline. Occupancy of over 90% of the MPAs within the clusters was predicted for most species. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a high likelihood of marine protected area (MPA) network invasion based on current and future environmental conditions and vectors of spread, and the potential for extensive nonindigenous species distributions within MPAs. Our approach highlights how interacting stressors can exacerbate MPA susceptibility to nonindigenous species, adding further challenges for protected area management. Management planning that invests in understanding connectivity and vector processes (human behaviours) is more likely to derive effective policies to stem the flow of nonindigenous species under both current and future conditions. In particular, biosecurity measures including vessel biofouling regulations and MPA- and MPA network-specific plans for prevention, monitoring and mitigation of nonindigenous species are needed.

AB  - Population status of insects of Plecoptera order in Sierra Nevada National Park in Venezuela and its implications for conservation planning. Longitudinal distribution of Plecoptera species were examined along the Sierra Nevada National Park in the Andean region of Merida State, Venezuela. PNSN is one of the largest protected areas and consists of two major sub-basins. Quantitative samples were collected in 7 river tributaries along the PNSN from February to May of 2009, and a total of 135 individuals and 4 species of the genus Anacroneuria were collected. Only three rivers (Nuestra Senora, La Picon y Corcovada) found the presence of stoneflies, the principal component analysis show that the characterization of habitat, current velocity, dissolved oxygen and the absence of human disturbance sources of influence in a suitable habitat for populations. Stoneflies are endangered or have become extinct throughout much of its range due to human activities. Conservation plans must be implemented urgently, in order to avoid recreational areas and/or economic in vicinity thereof. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (4): 1299-1310. Epub 2010 December 01.

AB  - Regional conservation planning can often make more effective use of sparse biological data by linking these data to remotely mapped environmental variables through statistical modelling. While modelling distributions of individual species is the best known and most widely used approach to such modelling, there are many situations in which more information can be extracted from available data by supplementing, or replacing, species-level modelling with modelling of communities or assemblages. This paper provides an overview of approaches to community-level modelling employed in a series of major land-use planning processes in the northeast New South Wales region of Australia, and evaluates how well communities and assemblages derived using these techniques function as surrogates in regional conservation planning. We also outline three new directions that may enhance the effectiveness of community-level modelling by: ( 1) more closely integrating modelling with traditional ecological mapping ( e. g. vegetation mapping); ( 2) more tightly linking numerical classification and spatial modelling through application of canonical classification techniques; and ( 3) enhancing the applicability of modelling to data-poor regions through employment of a new technique for modelling spatial pattern in compositional dissimilarity.

AB  - Resources for addressing stream fish conservation issues are often limited and the stressors impacting fish continue to increase, so decision makers often rely on tools to prioritize locations for conservation actions. Because conservation networks already exist in many areas, incorporating these into the planning process can increase the ability of decision makers to carry out management actions. In this study we aim to identify priority areas within established networks to provide an approach which allows managers to focus efforts on the most valuable areas they control, while identifying areas outside of the network, which support species with minimal representation within the network, for acquisition or conservation partnerships. The goal of this approach is to prioritize sites to achieve high levels of species representation while also developing workable solutions. We applied a methodology incorporating established networks into a systematic conservation planning process for fish in temperate wadeable streams located in Missouri, USA. We compared how well species were represented in our approach with two commonly used alternatives: A blank slate approach which used the same systematic conservation planning technique but did not incorporate established networks, and a habitat integrity approach based solely on anthropogenic threat data. Relative to the blank slate approach, our approach required 210% more segments for representation of all species, and contained an average of 0.5 additional occurrences for the least well-represented species. Although the blank slate solution was more efficient in achieving species representation, 77% of segments in this solution were not already protected. This would likely pose a challenge for implementing conservation actions. Relative to habitat integrity-based priorities, our approach required only 38% of the number of stream segments to achieve representation of all species and contained an average of 5 additional occurrences of the least represented species, representing a substantial gain in representation. Incorporating established networks may allow managers to focus resources on areas with the greatest conservation value within established networks and to identify the most valuable areas complementary to the established networks, resulting in priorities which may be more actionable and effective than those developed by alternative approaches.

AB  - The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) is critically endangered and also the subspecies of the tiger with the most restoration potential in China. It is challenging to protect large-ranging carnivores like tigers under increasing pressure of human development. To provide a more technically robust foundation for tiger habitat conservation prioritization, we conducted a comprehensively empirical analysis based on a broadly collected occurrence dataset of tigers and their prey. We modeled tiger distribution by running an ensemble model integrating nine different algorithms. We found that the ensemble model performed well and outperformed any individual model regarding the discrimination ability. We used cumulative resistant kernel analysis to identify core habitats as with high predicted movement density and used factorial least-cost paths to model corridors among tiger occurrence locations. We found that core habitats for Amur tigers are distributed in three mountain areas, namely, eastern Wanda Mountain, southern Zhangguangcailing, and Laoyeling-Dalongling. We found significant protection gaps as existing protected areas only cover less than one-fourth of predicted core habitats, but this proportion will rise significantly with the establishment of the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park. Furthermore, we ranked spatial priorities for the expansion of the protected area network, simultaneously considering biological and socioeconomic dimensions under the Zonation framework. Our study presented the most up-to-date and detailed maps of the predicted potential distribution and area of the most important habitats for the Amur tigers in China, which can provide quantitative guidance in the effort to maximize the efficiency of conservation initiatives at a regional scale.

AB  - The Italian hare (Lepus corsicanus) is endemic to Central-Southern Italy and Sicily, classified as vulnerable due to habitat alterations, low density and fragmented populations and ecological competition with the sympatric European hare (Lepus europaeus). Despite this status, only few and local studies have explored its ecological features. We provided some key traits of the ecological niche of the Italian hare as well as its potential distribution in the Italian peninsula. All data derived from genetically validated presences. We generated a habitat suitability model using maximum entropy distribution model for the Italian hare and its main competitor, the European hare. The dietary habits were obtained for the Italian hare with DNA metabarcoding and High-Throughput Sequencing on faecal pellets. The most relevant environmental variables affecting the potential distribution of the Italian hare are shared with the European hare, suggesting a potential competition. The variation in the observed altitudinal distribution is statistically significant between the two species.The diet of the Italian hare all year around includes 344 plant taxa accounted by 62 families. The Fagaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae and Solanaceae (counts>20,000) represented the 90.22% of the total diet. Fabaceae (60.70%) and Fagaceae (67.47%) were the most abundant plant items occurring in the Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter diets, respectively. The Spring/Summer diet showed richness (N=266) and diversity index values (Shannon: 2.329, Evenness: 0.03858, Equitability: 0.4169) higher than the Autumn/Winter diet (N=199, Shannon: 1.818, Evenness: 0.03096, Equitability: 0.3435). Our contribution adds important information to broaden the knowledge on the environmental (spatial and trophic) requirements of the Italian hare, representing effective support for fitting management actions in conservation planning.

AB  - Competition for maritime space generates conflict between human activities and ecosystem conservation; Marine (Spatial) Plans provide conflict resolutions and clarify trade-offs. Spatial plans require appropriate scales, reliable maps of sites important to marine organisms. We present maps of hotspots of Essential Fish Habitats (EFH) at a high spatial resolution for English and Welsh waters. These outputs can be integrated into an improved spatial plan for these waters. We modelled the potential distribution for different life stages of commercially and ecologically important species, as a high-resolution indicator of the distribution of essential fish habitats. Model outputs were combined with observed, low-resolution fish distributions to derive 'hotspot' spawning and nursery areas. The Celtic Sea and coastal areas of the North Sea are highlighted as important spawning and nursery grounds. High pressure from human activities is expected to impact EFHs in the English Channel and the central-east Celtic Sea. Our approach maintains the high resolution of the model-derived maps while filling in information gaps. As fish share essential habitat preferences, protected hotspot areas are expected to sustain a multitude of species. Overlaying human activities, such as fishing, on the hotspot maps allows managers to identify areas of conservation interest and apply appropriate measures. The method is directly applicable to other areas and can be extended to use multiple sources of data for model development. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest fires can generate economic losses, social vulnerability, and environmental damage. Therefore, more knowledge about the causes and effects on the territory is needed. The present study aimed to develop a spatial model to determine the influence of socio-economic and environmental variables on the probability of fire in a protected area. The study was developed in La Primavera Flora and Fauna Protection Area, located on the periphery of Guadalajara's Metropolitan Area in western Mexico. We used remote sensing information and field data of hot spots of fire from 2012 to 2018 to model forest cover's susceptibility to wildfires based on a set of socio-economic and landscape variables in the Dinamica EGO software. We built and evaluated a fire occurrence probability map (AUC = 0.88) and estimated that 20 970.90 ha of forests in the area are prone to wildfires. Population density, communication routes, and agriculture were the variables with the highest weight of evidence. The protected area presents different levels of fire occurrence probability due to factors such as urban growth and land-use cover change.

AB  - Juniperus phoenicea is a medicinal conifer tree species distributed mainly in the Mediterranean region, and it is IUCN Red Listed species, locally threatened due to arid conditions and seed over-collection for medicinal purposes, particularly in the East-Mediterranean region. Several studies have addressed the potential distribution of J. phoenicea using bioclimatic and topographic variables at a local or global scale, but little is known about the role of soil and human influences as potential drivers. Therefore, our objectives were to determine the most influential predictor factors and their relative importance that might be limiting the regeneration of J. phoenicea, in addition, identifying the most suitable areas which could be assumed as priority conservation areas. We used ensemble models for species distribution modelling. Our findings revealed that aridity, temperature seasonality, and clay content are the most important factors limiting the potential distribution of J. phoenicea. Potentially suitable areas of the output maps, in which J. phoenicea populations degraded, could be assumed as decision-support tool reforestation planning. Other suitable areas, where there was no previous tree cover are a promising tool for afforestation and conservation planning. Finally, conservation actions are needed for natural habitats, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions, which are highly threatened by global warming.

AB  - Meadows are critical in arid and semi-arid Patagonia because of their importance for regional biodiversity. Despite this, little information on the spatial distribution of meadows is available, which hampers conservation planning. We modeled the spatial distribution of meadows across arid and semi-arid Patagonia, Argentina, and investigated conservation status of those areas predicted to contain meadows. We used high-resolution imagery available in Google Earth Software to visually estimate presence and absence of meadows. We used these observations and 11 socio-environmental predictor. variables to model the distribution of meadows using generalized linear, additive, boosting, and random forest models, as the basis for a final mean ensemble technique. The final ensemble model improved accuracy over any of the single models, with an accuracy (area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic plot) of 0.97. Based on the final ensemble model, only 0.14% of predicted meadows occur inside current International Union for Conservation of Nature level I, II or III protected areas. Our final ensemble model was an accurate representation of the distribution of. meadows in Patagonia and indicates they are severely under-represented within protected areas. This first regional map of meadow distribution across Argentinean Patagonia represents key information for planning actions to conserve this critical habitat. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Our aim is to model rare species (with few occurrences) but modelling the distribution of species with few occurrence data and many predictor variables leads to model overfitting. Thus, we use the recently developed ensemble of small models, which showed high predictive accuracy in modelling the distribution of rare species to estimate the current and future distribution of 56 rare (and endangered) saproxylic beetle species. Thus, we stacked predictions from individual species distribution models to derive rare species richness. We used current and five future general circulation models and three representative concentration pathways to test whether the distribution of hotspots for rare species shifts due to climate change under different future scenarios. Moreover, we verified the representativeness of existing protected area systems under future climate conditions in Italy. Specifically, we identified potential hotspots for rare species richness through a cumulative relative frequency distribution function. The current surface covered by hotspots is 50.4% of the study area corresponding to 151,223km(2) (mainly from central to northern Italy). Currently, only 35,124km(2) of rare saproxylic hotspots are covered by protected areas (PAs) and they will decrease by about 2-72% in 2070 depending on the future scenarios considered. Our results confirmed that the shift of the distribution of hotspots for rare species might occur due to climate change under different future scenarios and that the existing PAs system would be inadequate for assuring the conservation of rare saproxylic beetles in Italy under current and future climate conditions.

AB  - Reintroducing species into landscapes with persistent threats is a conservation challenge. Although historic threats may not be eliminated, they should be understood in the context of contemporary landscapes. Regenerating landscapes often contain newly emergent habitat, creating opportunities for reintroductions. The Endangered St Croix ground lizard Pholidoscelis polops was extirpated from the main island of St Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, as a result of habitat conversion to agriculture and predation by the small Indian mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus. The species survived on two small cays and was later translocated to two islands. Since the 1950s, new land-cover types have emerged on St Croix, creating a matrix of suitable habitat throughout the island. Here we examined whether the new habitat is sufficient for a successful reintroduction of the St Croix ground lizard, utilizing three complementary approaches. Firstly, we compared a map from 1750 to the current landscape of St Croix and found statistical similarity of land-cover types. Secondly, we determined habitat suitability based on a binomial mixture population model developed as part of the programme monitoring the largest extant population of the St Croix ground lizard. We estimated the habitat to be sufficient for > 142,000 lizards to inhabit St Croix. Thirdly, we prioritized potential reintroduction sites and planned for reintroductions to take place during 2020-2023. Our case study demonstrates how changing landscapes alter the spatial configuration of threats to species, which can create opportunities for reintroduction. Presuming that areas of degraded habitat may never again be habitable could fail to consider how regenerating landscapes can support species recovery. When contemporary landscapes are taken into account, opportunities for reintroducing threatened species can emerge.

AB  - Large carnivores maintain the balance of ecosystems. Understanding distribution and population changes are necessary prerequisites for scientific conservation strategy. The east of Jilin Province is the habitat of endangered Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica). The Chinese government has focused the monitoring on protecting the Amur tiger. However, little is known about Asiatic black bear (ABB, Ursus thibetanus) distribution, population dynamics in the wild, and protection awareness of local residents in Jilin Province, China. We conducted a integrative survey in mountain areas of eastern Jilin to determine ABB distribution. We explored the drivers of the distribution of ABB in Jilin using logstic regression, we further predicted the habitat suitability and potential suitable habitat of the ABB. Totally, we surveyed 112 grids (15 km x 15 km) from November 2015 to January 2019. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the main factors driving ABB distribution in Jilin are forest coverage, distance from protected areas, distance from main roads (railways and highways), and distance from water bodies. The results of questionnaire survey showed that the local residents' understanding of ABB distribution is congruent with our field research. They believed that the number of ABBs has gradually increased in the past ten years. Nevertheless, the local residents have a negative attitude toward the ABBs, which may adversely affect efforts to protect them, possibly leading to more conflicts between humans and bears. Therefore, there is a need to consider ways to change the attitude of the locals through the strengthening of the protection propaganda and advocating management as being critical for the protection of ABBs. Our research provides a scientific basis for future conservation planning. We recommend taking local people's attitude into consideration during conservation management strategy making to reduce human-bear conflicts and promote the coexistence of humans and bears.

AB  - Aim: Species require sufficiently large and connected areas of suitable habitat to support populations that can persist through change. With extensive alteration of unprotected natural habitat, there is increasing risk that protected areas (PAs) will be too small and isolated to support viable populations in the long term. Consequently, this study addresses the urgent need to assess the capacity of PA estates to facilitate species persistence.
   Location: Australia.
   Methods: We undertake the first assessment of the capacity of the Australian National Reserve System (NRS) to protect 90 mammal species in the long term, given the size and distribution of individual PAs across the landscape relative to species' habitat and minimum viable area (MVA) requirements and dispersal capabilities.
   Results: While all mammal ranges are represented within the NRS, the conservation capacity declined notably when we refined measures of representation within PAs to include species' habitat and area requirements. The NRS could not support any viable populations for between three and seven species, depending on the MVA threshold used, and could support less than 10 viable populations for up to a third of the species. Planning and managing PAs for persistence emerged as most important for species with large MVA requirements and limited dispersal capabilities.
   Main conclusions: The key species characteristics we identify can help managers recognize species at risk within the current PA estate and guide the types of strategies that would best reduce this risk. We reveal that current representation-based assessments of PA progress are likely to overestimate the long-term success of PA estates, obscuring vulnerabilities for many species. It is important that conservation planners and managers are realistic and explicit regarding the role played by different sizes and distributions of PAs, and careful in assuming that the representation of a species within a PA equates to its long-term conservation.

AB  - Conservation planning decisions are typically made on the basis of species distribution or occurrence data, which ideally would have complete spatial and taxonomic coverage. Agencies are constrained in the data they can collect, often pragmatically prioritising certain groups such as threatened species, or methods, such as volunteer surveys. This mismatch between goals and realities inevitably leads to bias and uncertainty in conservation planning outputs, yet few studies have assessed how data realities affect planning outputs. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the Protection Index, a method for assessing conservation progress and priorities, using an extensive dataset on species occurrences and distributions derived from the Florida Natural Areas Inventory. Analyses revealed a high proportion of occurrence records for threatened species and certain taxonomic groups, reflecting the agencies' priorities. We performed a sensitivity analysis on conservation planning outputs, simulating a 'data poor' scenario typical of many real situations; we deleted increasing amounts of data in both a biased (exaggerating patterns observed) and unbiased (random) manner. We assessed the effects of data paucity and bias on the value of potential conservation sites, and planning priorities. Certain high value sites with only a few important species occurrences were more sensitive to data depletion than those with many occurrences. Data bias based on taxonomic bias was more influential to site value than threat rank. To maximise benefit from surveys from a planning perspective, it would be better to focus on poorly surveyed areas rather than adding occurrences in already well represented sites. This study demonstrates the importance of sensitivity analysis in conservation planning, and that the effects of uncertainty and data quality on planning decisions should not be ignored.

AB  - Sharks play an important role in marine ecosystems as top predators and have been increasingly accepted in recent years as a group for priority conservation worldwide. However, as one of the regions with the highest marine shark species richness, there is still a limited understanding of shark diversity patterns and conservation needs in China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) seas. In this study, we applied an ensemble species distribution model of five algorithms to investigate the diversity distribution patterns of 149 shark species in China and the ASEAN seas for the first time. A systematic conservation planning approach involving diversity, scarcity, and biogeographical distinctiveness was used to identify and compare conservation priority settings. Our results showed that bathymetry and dissolved oxygen were the most important variables contributing to shark distribution. The distribution pattern of shark species richness peaked on the continental shelves at 22-26 degrees N, and a hotspot of shark diversity was identified around the Taiwan Strait. The spatial distribution of shark species in the nine orders and the 72 threatened shark species varied considerably. The existing marine protected area network only protects 2.1% of the ocean, 32.9% of the shark species, and 43.1% of the threatened species, highlighting a substantial conservation gap. Among the conservation priorities identified, the high conservation target scenario (30%) protects only 10%-15% more species than the low conservation target scenario (10%). However, under the high conservation target scenario, the conservation range of species tripled. Our results show that low conservation targets were only suitable for addressing the number of protected species, and that high targets would bring about improved outcomes for the number of protected species and the protected range of threatened species. Furthermore, planned priorities with a large clump pattern had slightly higher conservation achievements than those with small clumps.

AB  - Financial and human resources allocated to biodiversity conservation are often limited, making it impossible to protect all natural places, and priority areas for protection must be identified. In this study, we applied ecological niche models to predict fish assemblages in the stream network of France. Four non-correlated conservation objectives were derived from these species assemblages: taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, natural heritage importance and socio-economic value. We proposed a multi-objective prioritization method based on the Pareto optimality principle to rank the planning units (i.e. 6097 subcatchments) according to their inherent trade-offs between the four conservation objectives. Four types of hydrosystems of great conservation importance presenting specific fish assemblages were identified: (i) the most upstream areas of large catchments; (ii) the most downstream areas of large catchments; (iii) the small coastal catchments of the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean; and (iv) the Mediterranean streams of medium altitude. The fish assemblages characterizing these hydrosystems were complementary and representative of the entire fish fauna of France. Most of these priority subcatchments were found to be practically suitable for the implementation of conservation actions, which is very promising for the protection of river biodiversity.

AB  - How climate constrains species' distributions through time and space is an important question in the context of conservation planning for climate change. Despite increasing awareness of the need to incorporate mechanism into species distribution models (SDMs), mechanistic modeling of endotherm distributions remains limited in this literature. Using the American pika (Ochotona princeps) as an example, we present a framework whereby mechanism can be incorporated into endotherm SDMs. Pika distribution has repeatedly been found to be constrained by warm temperatures, so we used Niche Mapper, a mechanistic heat-balance model, to convert macroclimate data to pika- specific surface activity time in summer across the western United States. We then explored the difference between using a macroclimate predictor (summer temperature) and using a mechanistic predictor (predicted surface activity time) in SDMs. Both approaches accurately predicted pika presences in current and past climate regimes. However, the activity models predicted 8-19% less habitat loss in response to annual temperature increases of similar to 3-5 degrees C predicted in the region by 2070, suggesting that pikas may be able to buffer some climate change effects through behavioral thermoregulation that can be captured by mechanistic modeling. Incorporating mechanism added value to the modeling by providing increased confidence in areas where different modeling approaches agreed and providing a range of outcomes in areas of disagreement. It also provided a more proximate variable relating animal distribution to climate, allowing investigations into how unique habitat characteristics and intraspecific phenotypic variation may allow pikas to exist in areas outside those predicted by generic SDMs. Only a small number of easily obtainable data are required to parameterize this mechanistic model for any endotherm, and its use can improve SDM predictions by explicitly modeling a widely applicable direct physiological effect: climate-imposed restrictions on activity. This more complete understanding is necessary to inform climate adaptation actions, management strategies, and conservation plans.

AB  - Aim High-resolution spatial soil data are crucial to species distribution modelling for fundamental research and conservation planning. Recent globally modelled soil layers (e.g. SoilGrids) have transformed distribution modelling, but may fail to represent regional soil characteristics accurately. We hypothesize that in the Cape biodiversity hotspot of South Africa, the use of global soil layers has led to underestimation of the importance of edaphic factors as determinants of species' and vegetation distributions. We present a series of new, regionally modelled layers to address this deficiency. Location Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR, South Africa). Methods We georeferenced edaphic characteristics from literature and other sources and used boosted regression trees (BRT) to associate edaphic characteristics with spatially explicit topographic, climatic, soil texture and biotic variables. Multinomial BRTs were used to predict mapped vegetation types from the collated edaphic and other data. Results BRTs reliably predicted pH (92% of variance), Na (87%), K (85%), electrical conductivity (81%) and P (73%), but were less accurate for total N (55%) and total C (61%), for which data were sparser. Soil clay and pH values differed markedly in range and in spatial variation from those in SoilGrids. Using our new edaphic layers, we were able to accurately predict spatial distributions of vegetation types within the GCFR (multi-class AUC = 0.96). The multinomial BRT predicted vegetation less well when based on SoilGrids data alone (AUC = 0.84). Main conclusions The more faithful representation of soil properties in our model is attributable both to its use of ca. 10-fold more samples, and to its regional focus. Our model of edaphic characteristics captures important edaphic variability that is vital for understanding plant and consequently faunal distributions, with wide-ranging conservation implications. Ongoing development of global syntheses of soil data requires more samples, especially in areas with high spatial heterogeneity and extreme edaphic conditions.

AB  - Aim Our aim was to develop predictive statistical models for mapping the abundance of 18 waterfowl species at a pan-Canadian level. We refined the previous generation of national waterfowl models by (a) developing new, more interpretable statistical models that (b) explicitly account for spatiotemporal variations in waterfowl abundance, while (c) testing for associations with an updated suite of habitat covariates. Location All of Canada, excluding the Northern Arctic ecozone. Methods Our response variables were annual species counts on 2,227 aerial-survey segments over a period of 25 years (1990-2015). Combining machine-learning and hierarchical regression modelling, we devised an innovative covariate selection strategy to select for each species the best subset of a panel of 232 candidate habitat covariates. With the selected covariates, we implemented hierarchical generalized linear models in a Bayesian framework, using the integrated nested Laplace approximation and stochastic partial differential equation approaches. Results On average, our models explained 47% of the observed variance for spatiotemporal predictions and 74% for temporally averaged spatial predictions. The 18 species models included 94 significant waterfowl-habitat associations involving 42 distinct habitat covariates, with an average of 5.3 covariates per model. Covariates for forest attributes were the most represented in our models. The proportional biomass ofPopulus tremuloideswas the most frequently selected covariate (10/94 associations in 10/18 species). Model predictions generated spatial and spatiotemporal maps of species abundances over almost all of Canada. Main conclusions We showed that it is possible to efficiently combine machine-learning, variable selection and hierarchical Bayesian methods that exploit high-dimensional covariate spaces. Our approach yielded powerful and easily interpretable species distribution models with very few covariates, while accounting for residual autocorrelation. Possible applications of the resulting models and maps include the development of biodiversity indicators, the evaluation and execution of conservation planning strategies, and ecosystem services monitoring.

AB  - Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to determine threats to biodiversity and opportunities under climate change. Despite SDMs being based on the assumption of complete knowledge of the climate space of the modelled species, truncated occurrence datasets (and hence truncated climate spaces) such as national inventories are often employed. This may lead to prediction errors, which have been proposed to stemfrom: (1) the degree of climate space truncation and/or (2) instability of the modelling algorithms. Our aim was to explore the potential causes of prediction errors in SDMs using truncated training datasets.
   Location Europe 11 degrees W-32 degrees E, 34 degrees-72 degrees N.
   Methods SDMs employing commonly used bioclimatic variables were applied to seven forest tree species. We created two model training datasets covering: (1) Germany only (significantly truncated climate space) and (2) Europe (minimally truncated climate space). Differences between the climate space represented by Germany-only and European data were measured on two-dimensional climate spaces obtained through principal component analysis of the bioclimatic variables. Seven SDM algorithms were run, and the stability of the response function and variable selection for each species and model type were analysed.
   Results The degree of climate space truncation was less important for model performance than the instability of model algorithms and indiscriminate variable selection. The latter led to irrelevant relationships of species occurrence with bioclimatic variables. These instabilities caused pronounced prediction errors.
   Main conclusions Our results strongly suggest that erroneous model predictions stem from instability and ecological irrelevance of the statistical functions relating the probability of a species' occurrence to bioclimatic variables, compounded by a lack of consistency in variable selection. Models displaying these characteristics showed lower overall performance when trained with truncated datasets. Further, commonly used ensemble approaches do not compensate for the shortfalls of individual models. Detailed model-by-model and species-by-species analysis of response functions and variable importance is recommended.

AB  - In a changing environment, there is an increasing interest to monitor ecosystems to understand their responses to environmental change. Seagrass meadows are highly important ecosystems that are under constant pressure from human activities and climate impacts, with marked declines observed worldwide. Despite increasing efforts, monitoring of multispecific tropical seagrass meadows is scarce, particularly in low-income regions. Based on data from a monitoring programme in a marine protected area in Zanzibar (Tanzania), we assessed temporal changes in seagrass cover and species composition during a 10-year period in relation to local variability in environmental variables. We observed a strong, gradual decline in seagrass cover and changes in species composition, followed by a period of recovery. However, the timing and length of these temporal patterns varied in space (between transects). Multiple environmental variables-cloud cover, temperature, storm occurrence, sunspot activity, and tidal amplitude and height-influenced seagrass cover, although only to a minor extent, suggesting that the monitored seagrass meadow may be influenced by other unmeasured factors (e.g. water currents and sediment movement). Our results show that seagrass meadows can be highly dynamic at small (10-50 m) spatial scales, even in the absence of major local anthropogenic impacts. Our findings suggest that high-resolution monitoring programmes can be highly valuable for the detection of temporal changes in multispecific seagrass meadows; however, to understand the causes of change, there is a need of long-term (> 10 years) data series that include direct measurements of environmental variables and extreme events.

AB  - Light detection and ranging (lidar) is a useful tool for measuring three-dimensional habitat structure; hence, its use in habitat suitability models has been explored, both as a single resource and in combination with other remote-sensing techniques. Here, we evaluated the suitability of airborne lidar data in comparison with aerial photographs and field surveys for modelling the distribution of an endangered and cryptic forest species, the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). The study was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park of southeast Germany. Subsequently, a prediction map for conservation planning was generated for a large area, which encompassed the National Park. We examined the utility of lidar data for generating a hazel grouse distribution model by using machine learning (boosted regression trees), and then compared the results to variables derived from field surveys and aerial photographs, both separately and in combination. The cross-validated discrimination ability of the model was slightly higher when using lidar data (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.79) compared to models using aerial photographs (AUC, 0.75) or field survey data (AUC, 0.78). The predictive performance consistently increased when combining the predictors from different sources, with an AUC of 0.86 being produced in the model combining all three data sources. The three data sources complemented one another, with each data source probably having an advantage at deriving one of three key aspects of the hazel grouse habitat, namely, vertically well-structured forest stands, horizontally mixed successional vegetation stages, and certain deciduous trees as food resources such as mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). In addition, the diverse lidar metrics might be applied to simultaneously characterize vertically and horizontally well-structured forest stands. We conclude that public available airborne lidar data are a viable source for creating habitat suitability maps for large areas and may have increased utility for detecting forest characteristics and valuable wildlife habitats.

AB  - As urban development continues to encroach on the natural and rural landscape, land-use planners struggle to identify high priority conservation areas for protection. Although knowing where urban-sensitive species may be occurring on the landscape would facilitate conservation planning, research efforts are often not sufficiently designed to make quality predictions at unknown locations. Recent advances in occupancy modeling allow for more precise estimates of occupancy by accounting for differences in detectability. We applied these techniques to produce robust estimates of habitat occupancy for a subset of forest breeding birds, a group that has been shown to be sensitive to urbanization, in a rapidly urbanizing yet biological diverse region of New York State. We found that detection probability ranged widely across species, from 0.05 to 0.8. Our models suggest that detection probability declined with increasing forest fragmentation. We also found that the probability of occupancy of forest breeding birds is negatively influenced by increasing perimeter-area ratio of forest fragments and urbanization in the surrounding habitat matrix. We capitalized on our random sampling design to produce spatially explicit models that predict high priority conservation areas across the entire region, where interior-species were most likely to occur. Finally, we use our predictive maps to demonstrate how a strict sampling design coupled with occupancy modeling can be a valuable tool for prioritizing biodiversity conservation in land-use planning.

AB  - Background and aims - Climate change imposes new challenges on biodiversity conservation, especially in tropical areas where anthropogenic pressures have already increased the vulnerability of many species. New conservation strategies are needed to anticipate the impacts of future climate change and species distribution modeling remains the most useful approach in predicting these impacts and in assisting conservation planning. The objectives of this study were to develop species distribution models for threatened endemic plant species of Madagascar and to assess the impacts of climate change on the species distributions.
   Methods - Ten species belonging to the genera Mediusella and Xerochlamys of Madagascar's endemic plant family Sarcolaenaceae were included in this study. Potential distribution models using 19 climatic variables were developed for the ten species and projected onto the present and future to evaluate the potential distribution of each species. Future distributions of these species were predicted for 2050 using three general circulation models and two climate scenarios. We also assessed the patterns of range shifts by comparing present and future distributions under the different models and scenarios.
   Key results - Most species were predicted to undergo major range contraction as a result of climate change. Species in the Central High Plateau of Madagascar were predicted to experience the highest habitat loss, with narrow-range species being the most sensitive. Southward migration was predicted for species distributed in the northwest, whereas upland migration was predicted for some central species.
   Conclusions - Future climate change will drastically affect the distribution of our target species, seven of which will experience major range contraction by 2050. Among these, threatened endemic species will face higher risk of extinction due to habitat loss. Range expansion was also predicted for two species. In any case, species' adaptation to a changing climate may not happen soon enough, emphasizing the need to strengthen current conservation efforts, especially in areas where species are most likely to persist.

AB  - Human-induced effects on lowland conifer forests in hemiboreal regions are increasing because of expanded use of these northern ecosystems for raw materials, energy, and minerals as well as the potential effects of climatic changes. These forests support many breeding bird species across the Holarctic and allow the persistence of several boreal bird species in hemiboreal and even temperate regions. These bird species are of particular conservation concern as shifting patterns northward in forest composition caused by climate change will likely affect their populations. However, effective management and conservation options are limited because the specifics of these species' breeding habitats are not well understood. We modeled and mapped habitat suitability for 11 species of boreal birds that breed in the lowland conifer forests of the Agassiz Lowlands Ecological Subsection in northern Minnesota and are likely to have reduced breeding habitat in the future: Spruce Grouse (Falcipennis canadensis), Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Olivesided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (Empidonax flaviventris), Boreal Chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus), Goldencrowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Palm Warbler (Setophaga palmarum), and Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis). Sets of 7 to 16 potential environmental covariates, including both stand-level and landscape attributes, were used to develop individual species models. Within this lowland conifer-dominated ecosystem, we found significant selection for specific forest and landscape characteristics by all but one of these species, with the best models including between one and nine variables. Habitat suitability maps were developed from these models and predictions tested with an independent dataset. Model performance depended on species, correctly predicting 56-96% of test data. We present a map combining suitability scores for five species of conservation concern that has been used for conservation planning and management opportunities across a broad, lowland forest landscape. We recommend managers utilize the detailed model development and validation framework to address local and regional conservation issues.

AB  - Aim Climate change is pressing extra strain on the already degraded forest ecosystem in Tanzania. However, it is mostly unknown how climate change will affect the distribution of forests in the future. We aimed to model the impacts of climate change on natural forests to help inform national-level conservation and mitigation strategies. Location Tanzania. Methods We conducted maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling to simulate forest habitat suitability using the Tanzanian national forest inventory survey (1,307 occurrences) and environmental data. Changes in forest habitats were simulated under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) emission scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for 2055 and 2085. Results The results indicate that climate change will threaten forest communities, especially fragmented strips of montane forests. Even under optimistic emission scenario, the extent of montane forest is projected to almost halve by 2085, intersecting many biodiversity hotspots across the Eastern Arc Mountains. Similarly, climate change is predicted to threaten microhabitat forests (i.e. thickets), with losses exceeding 70% by 2085 (RCP8.5). Other forest habitats are predicted to decrease (lowland forest and woodland) representing essential ecological networks, whereas suitable habitats for carbon-rich mangroves are predicted to expand by more than 40% at both scenarios. Conclusions Climate change will impact forests by accelerating habitat loss, and fragmentation and the remaining land suitable for forests will also be subject to pressures associated with rising demand for food and biofuels. These changes are likely to increase the probability of adverse impacts to the country's indigenous flora and fauna. Our findings, therefore, call for a shift in conservation efforts, focusing on (i) the enhanced management of existing protected areas that can absorb the impacts of future climate change, and (ii) expanding conservation efforts into newly suitable regions through effective land use planning and land reclamation, helping to preserve and enhance forest connectivity between fragmented patches.

AB  - In the context of the global climate and biodiversity crises, forecasting the effectiveness of Protected Areas (PAs) and forest management to conserve biodiversity in the long-term is a high priority, especially in threatened environments. By combining distribution models and conservation planning protocols, we analyzed the effect of global climate and agriculture-linked activities in the long-term conservation opportunities of one most threatened deforestation hotspots: the South American Gran Chaco. We showed that assessing the effects of each driver of global change individually, promotes inaccurate long-term policies in deforestation hotspots. Our future scenarios indicated a low impact of climate change on the species distributions when it was analyzed individually. However, its effects were strongly exacerbated when both drivers of threat were combined in the same analyses, strongly diminishing conservation opportunities in the region: more than 50% of the remaining species' distribution and hotspot areas could be lost in the near future. In this dramatic context, we identified important opportunities to improve the level of long-term protection by increasing at least 5.6% the protection coverage and placing PAs strategically. It is imperative policymakers promote policies to generate a long-term improvement of conservation areas that are resilient to both threats as soon as possible for these threatened environments.

AB  - Climate change is likely to threaten forests in future. Because dominant tree species (DTS) play central roles in stabilizing forest ecosystems, to effectively protect forests, we need to pay more attention to the protection of DTS. Furthermore, we need to integrate potential impacts of climate change into conservation efforts of DTS for improving forest protection. We utilized species distribution modeling, coupled with conservation planning, to establish climate-informed conservation prioritization for 136 taxa of DTS in three forest types (broad-leaved forests, mixed broadleaf-conifer forests, and coniferous forests) in China. We considered both current and future distributions and assessed the ability of existing nature reserves in China to protect forests based on these DTS. Regions with the highest climate-informed conservation prioritization were distributed in the southern, southwestern, and northeastern regions of China. There was a small gap between existing nature reserves and predicted conservation prioritization areas for conserving forests: the proportions of overlap between existing reserves and areas prioritized under climate change scenarios were 87.8, 95.7, and 80.4% for broad-leaved forests, mixed broadleaf-conifer forests, and coniferous forests, respectively. Even so, we need to increase the number and/or area of nature reserves to protect coniferous forests in Tibet, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and broad-leaved forests in Guizhou, Guangxi, Hu'nan, Yunnan, and Sichuan. Our results demonstrate the importance of conservation planning under climate change, taking both current and future distributions of plant species into consideration. Nature reserves should develop different management strategies for different forest types.

AB  - Extrapolation of local abundance-environment relationships to broader scales provides species distribution models used for conservation planning. We investigated the importance of environmental heterogeneity and geographic distance on pteridophyte species spatial distribution on 38 plots of 250 x 2.5 m distributed over 90 km(2) in Central Amazon. Inclusion of canopy openness in our models increased the capacity of predicting community composition even under the narrow range of canopy openness found in our plots. Nevertheless, there was still a large amount of unexplained variance (55-65%). The response of the community to the light gradient was hierarchical and we did not find evidences of light partitioning. Most species were concentrated in low light plots but a few common and abundant occurred along the entire gradient. Soil properties were the major determinants of community composition. Contrary to similar studies, slope was not a good predictor of pteridophyte community composition, indicating that this relationship may be site-specific. There was no correlation between floristic distances and geographic distances. We concluded that mesoscale turnover is low, although locally environmental variation determines high turnover of species. Studies among different Amazonian physiognomies tend to find high levels of beta-diversity. However, coarse comparisons can not reveal subtle patterns that are relevant for biodiversity conservation planning. This study found some important changes on pteridophyte community within the same type of forest, mainly related to environmental heterogeneity, even in narrow ranges of environmental variation.

AB  - Despite the large number of species distribution modelling (SDM) applications driven by tracking data, individual information is most of the time neglected and traditional SDM approaches commonly focus on predicting the potential distribution at the species or population-level. By running classical SDMs (population approach) with mixed models including a random factor to account for the variability attributable to individual (individual approach), we propose an innovative five-steps framework to predict the potential and individual-level distributions of mobile species using GPS data collected from green turtles. Pseudo-absences were randomly generated following an environmentally-stratified procedure. A negative exponential dispersal kernel was incorporated into the individual model to account for spatial fidelity, while five environmental variables derived from high-resolution Lidar and hyperspectral data were used as predictors of the species distribution in generalized linear models. Both approaches showed a strong predictive power (mean: AUC > 0.93, CBI > 0.88) and goodness-of-fit (0.6 < adjusted R-2 < 0.9), but differed geographically with favorable habitats restricted around the tagging locations for the individual approach whereas favorable habitats from the population approach were more widespread. Our innovative way to combine predictions from both approaches into a single map provides a unique scientific baseline to support conservation planning and management of many taxa. Our framework is easy to implement and brings new opportunities to exploit existing tracking dataset, while addressing key ecological questions such as inter-individual plasticity and social interactions.

We performed a landscape analysis of the Bolivian Tropical Andes to determine whether remaining habitat patches were suitable in terms of ecological characteristics and potential connectivity for the long-term survival of the Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus). First we built a ruled-based model to identify key patches or areas large enough to sustain a viable population by using knowledge of Andean bear habitat requirements and movement patterns. Second, we estimated potential functional connectivity among these areas applying a cost-distance analysis based on estimates of the resistance to movement through the landscape. Finally, we quantified the proportion of these key patches and corridor habitats within the Bolivian protected area system. The rule-based model identified 13 key patches covering 21,113 km(2) corresponding to a maximum estimated population of 3,165 adult bears. Using cost-distance analysis, all 13 key patches were potentially connected to >= 1 other key patch. Twelve of the patches were at least partially protected by national parks, and 40% of areas considered suitable as corridors were included within a protected area. Although the current protected area system includes suitable bear habitat, large portions of key patches and corridors are unprotected, which could eventually lead to fragmentation and habitat loss if these areas are not protected.

AB  - Conservationists and protected area managers spend millions in establishing and maintaining protected areas every year. However, many studies revealed that the design and coverage of protected areas are still inadequate in representing key biodiversity features, are insufficient in the management approach to address the threats and pressures and have a low level of ecological integrity because of the increasing levels of environmental degradation. There is strong evidence of different anthropogenic pressures that deteriorate the effectiveness of existing protected areas, structurally, compositionally and functionally. Hence, the evaluation of a protected area's effectiveness is very crucial in maintaining long-term biodiversity conservation. Different evaluations have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of protected areas but focus only on certain issues or a single component. Current effectiveness evaluations still inadequately incorporate important criteria to make the evaluation of protected areas more comprehensive. Therefore, this paper will first focus on reviewing the current conditions and threats towards biodiversity conservation in tropical protected areas. Then, there will be a discussion on the relationship between the threats that cause issues with the effectiveness of protected areas. From issues that influence protected areas, the criteria or components that are crucial in developing the consolidated index model are identified. The main objective of this paper is to propose a consolidated index model that integrates the components of design and planning, ecological integrity and management to assess the conservation effectiveness of individual terrestrial protected areas in tropical regions. Hence, this paper presents the first step to develop a consolidated index model that can be implemented by park managers to assess conservation effectiveness.

AB  - P>Europe has the world's most extensive network of conservation areas. Conservation areas are selected without taking into account the effects of climate change. How effectively would such areas conserve biodiversity under climate change? We assess the effectiveness of protected areas and the Natura 2000 network in conserving a large proportion of European plant and terrestrial vertebrate species under climate change. We found that by 2080, 58 +/- 2.6% of the species would lose suitable climate in protected areas, whereas losses affected 63 +/- 2.1% of the species of European concern occurring in Natura 2000 areas. Protected areas are expected to retain climatic suitability for species better than unprotected areas (P < 0.001), but Natura 2000 areas retain climate suitability for species no better and sometimes less effectively than unprotected areas. The risk is high that ongoing efforts to conserve Europe's biodiversity are jeopardized by climate change. New policies are required to avert this risk.

AB  - Bioclimatic envelope models use associations between aspects of climate and species' occurrences to estimate the conditions that are suitable to maintain viable populations. Once bioclimatic envelopes are characterized, they can be applied to a variety of questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation. However, some have questioned the usefulness of these models, because they may be based on implausible assumptions or may be contradicted by empirical evidence. We review these areas of contention, and suggest that criticism has often been misplaced, resulting from confusion between what the models actually deliver and what users wish that they would express. Although improvements in data and methods will have some effect, the usefulness of these models is contingent on their appropriate use, and they will improve mainly via better awareness of their conceptual basis, strengths, and limitations.

AB  - Aim Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are among the most frequently used tools for conservation planning under climate and land use changes. Conservation-focused climate change studies are often conducted on a national or local level and can use different sources of occurrence records (e.g., local databases, national biodiversity monitoring) collated at different geographic extents. However, little is known about how these restrictions in geographic space (i.e., Wallacean shortfall) can lead to restrictions in environmental space (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall) and accordingly affect conclusions about a species' vulnerability to climate change.
   Location Americas with a focus on Mexico.
   Methods We present an example study constructing SDMs for three Mexican tree species (Alnus acuminata, Liquidambar styraciflua and Quercus xalapensis) using datasets collated at a global (Americas), national (Mexico) and local (cloud forests of eastern Mexico) level to demonstrate the potential effects of a Wallacean shortfall on the estimation of the environmental niche-and thus on a Hutchinsonian shortfall-its projection in space and time and, consequently, on species' potential vulnerability to climate change.
   Results The consequence of using the three datasets was species-specific and strongly depended on the extent to which the Wallacean shortfall affected estimations of environmental niches (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall). Where restrictions in geographic space lead to an underestimation of the environmental niche, vulnerability to climate change was estimated to be substantially higher. Additionally, the restrictions in geographic space may increase the likelihood of issues with non-analogue climates, increasing model uncertainty.
   Main conclusion We recommend assessing the extent to which a species' entire realized environmental niche is captured within the target conservation area, and increasing the geographic extent, if needed, to account for environments and occurrences reflecting potential future conditions. This way, the risk of underestimating the climatic potential of the species (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall), as well as the errors induced by extrapolation into "locally novel" climates, can be minimized.

AB  - In systematic conservation planning, species distribution data for all sites in a planning area are used to prioritize each site in terms of the site's importance toward meeting the goal of species representation. But comprehensive species data are not available in most planning areas and would be expensive to acquire. As a shortcut, ecologists use surrogates, such as occurrences of birds or another well-surveyed taxon, or land types defined from remotely sensed data, in the hope that sites that represent the surrogates also represent biodiversity. Unfortunately, surrogates have not performed reliably. We propose a new type of surrogate, predicted importance, that can be developed from species data for a q% subset of sites. With species data from this subset of sites, importance can be modeled as a function of abiotic variables available at no charge for all terrestrial areas on Earth. Predicted importance can then be used as a surrogate to prioritize all sites. We tested this surrogate with 8 sets of species data. For each data set, we used a q% subset of sites to model importance as a function of abiotic variables, used the resulting function to predict importance for all sites, and evaluated the number of species in the sites with highest predicted importance. Sites with the highest predicted importance represented species efficiently for all data sets when q = 25% and for 7 of 8 data sets when q = 20%. Predicted importance requires less survey effort than direct selection for species representation and meets representation goals well compared with other surrogates currently in use. This less expensive surrogate may be useful in those areas of the world that need it most, namely tropical regions with the highest biodiversity, greatest biodiversity loss, most severe lack of inventory data, and poorly developed protected area networks.

AB  - In polar environments, a lack of empirical knowledge about biodiversity prompts reliance on species distribution models to predict future change, yet these ignore the role of biotic interactions including the role of long past human exploitation. To explore how mammals of extreme elevation respond to glacial recession and past harvest, we combined our fieldwork with remote sensing and used analyses of,60 expeditions from 1850-1925 to represent baseline conditions for wildlife before heavy exploitation on the Tibetan Plateau. Focusing on endangered wild yaks (Bos mutus), we document female changes in habitat use across time whereupon they increasingly relied on steeper post-glacial terrain, and currently have a 20x greater dependence on winter snow patches than males. Our twin findings-that the sexes of a cold-adapted species respond differently to modern climate forcing and long-past exploitation-indicate that effective conservation planning will require knowledge of the interplay between past and future if we will assure persistence of the region's biodiversity.

AB  - Concern for climate change has not yet been integrated in protocols for reserve selection. However if climate changes as projected, there is a possibility that current reserve-selection methods might provide solutions that are inadequate to ensure species' long-term persistence within reserves. We assessed, for the first time, the ability of existing reserve-selection methods to secure species in a climate-change context. Six methods using a different combination of criteria (representation, suitability and reserve clustering) are compared. The assessment is carried out using European distributions of 1200 plant species and considering two extreme scenarios of response to climate change: no dispersal and universal dispersal. With our data, 6-11% of species modelled would be potentially lost from selected reserves in a 50-year period. Measured uncertainties varied in 6% being 1-3% attributed to dispersal assumptions and 2-5% to the choice of reserve-selection method. Suitability approaches to reserve selection performed best, while reserve clustering performed poorly. We also found that 5% of species modelled would lose their entire climatic envelope in the studied area; 2% of the species modelled would have nonoverlapping distributions; 93% of the species modelled would maintain varying levels of overlapping distributions. We conclude there are opportunities to minimize species' extinctions within reserves but new approaches are needed to account for impacts of climate change on species; especially for those projected to have temporally nonoverlapping distributions.

AB  - Interactions between ecological processes operating at different scales are critical aspects of habitat suitability requiring careful consideration in conservation planning. Our previous research indicated that local abundance and demographics of subpopulations of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus (L., 1758)), structured in 11 river canyons in northern Labrador, were influenced by predation risk from nest-site-limited raptors. At demographic extremes, where raptors were absent, Harlequin Ducks were stable at high densities, with positive-projected growth, suggesting that they were at carrying capacity and a Source of emigrants. In contrast, where raptors were abundant, low density, highly variable populations of ducks approached local extinction in some years, with subsequent increases suggestive of immigration rescue effects. A comparison of resources for Harlequin Ducks indicated no differences in habitat availability among these putative "source" and "sink" Subpopulations. In the present study, we used multivariate analysis to identify habitat characteristics important for home-range use within these river canyons and to develop habitat suitability indices (HSI). Despite similar habitat availability, different characteristics were locally important. In a sink where predation risk was high, only danger-reducing habitat characteristics (i.e., overhang vegetation) were identified as important, whereas invertebrates was a predominant characteristic of the source HSI. Despite similar habitat availability, HSI developed in source and sink habitats would, respectively, over- and under-estimate regional habitat availability. Informed conservation and management strategies will therefore require integrating individual trade-offs about predation risk and resources into a multiscale context.

AB  - With the high rate of ecosystem change, effective systematic conservation planning must account for ongoing and imminent threats to biodiversity to ensure its persistence. Accordingly, guidance on appropriate conservation actions in the face of climate change has been accumulating. We review this guidance and bring together the key recommendations needed to successfully account for climate change impacts, relevant to the scale at which natural resource management is carried out. We discuss how the traditional conservation tools of protection and restoration need to be adjusted to be effective in the face of climate change. We highlight the conservation innovations such as moveable and temporary reserves, and Targeted Gene Flow. We build on recent work to provide critical advice for considering climate change in conservation planning. In particular, we discuss how stating explicit objectives related to climate change adaptation, quantifying uncertainty, and exploring trade-offs will better place conservation plans to meet objectives for multiple goals such as protection of species, ecosystems, geophysical diversity and ecological processes.

AB  - In this paper, habitat models were used to predict potential habitat for endangered species, which is an important question in landscape and conservation planning. Based on logistic regression, we developed habitat distribution models for the burnet moth Zygaena carniolica and the nymphalid butterfly Coenonympha arcania in Northern Bavaria, Germany. The relation between adult occurrence and habitat parameters, including the influence of landscape context, was analyzed on, 118 sites. Habitat connectivity analyses were carried out on the basis of (1) habitat suitability maps generated from these models and (2) dispersal data from mark recapture studies. Our results showed that (1) the presence of the burnet depended mainly on the presence of nectar plants and of nutrient-poor dry grasslands in direct vicinity, that of the nymphalid on larger areas of extensively used dry grasslands within 100 m vicinity in combination with small patches of higher shrubs and bushes. (2) Internal as well as external validation indicated the robustness and general applicability of the models. Transferability in time and space indicated their high potential relevance for applications in nature conservation, such as predicting possible effects of land use changes. (3) Habitat connectivity analyses revealed a high degree of habitat connectivity within the study area. Thus, we could show no effects of isolation or habitat size for both species.

AB  - Rapid urbanization results in changes in land use, biogeochemical cycles, climate, hydrosystems, and biodiversity. Policy-makers have formulated ecological protection measures to facilitate sustainable development. However, traditional conservation planning mainly focuses on protecting specific green spaces, with limited consideration of the connectivity among green spaces from a habitat network perspective. Using citizen science data and occupancy modelling, we predicted habitat suitability, built habitat networks and identified key habitat patches based on their contribution to the functional connectivity of the habitat network for three focal water, forest, and open-habitat bird species. Based on the habitat requirement, small waterbodies and intermediate forest and open-habitat cover facilitate preserving water, forest and open-habitat birds. In regards to the network analysis, we found that key habitat patches with a high conservation priority were generally characterized by a relatively large patch size and/or located at critical positions in the habitat network (at central positions in the habitat network, or near large patches). We suggest that key habitat patches in restricted built-up areas are converted to protected areas or are kept as cropland under future urban planning. We emphasize the usefulness of the focal species concept in urban biodiversity conservation. Our study offers conservation recommendations from a habitat network perspective for urban planners to safeguard urban biodiversity and ecosystem health.

AB  - The endangered Cantabrian capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus) lives at the southern edge of tetraonids' distribution range, in entirely deciduous forests. Its conservation planning has been always lek-centred. There is very little information about the specific habitat requirements of hens and broods, even though reproductive success appears to be a limiting factor. We analysed summer surveys from 1997 to 2004, carried out to estimate the reproductive success of the population. We compared the habitat characteristics at different spatial scales of hens with broods, broodless hens, and cocks in summer, with the better known spring habitat in display areas. Summer habitat showed higher proportion of open areas and was associated with more rugged zones at moderate spatial scales (78 ha) than spring habitat at display areas. Cocks and hens showed summer habitat partitioning; hens were associated with higher proportions of open and shrubby habitats. Furthermore, broodless hens preferred areas with higher slope variability than the display and summer areas preferred by cocks. These differences may reflect the sexual dimorphism of the species in reproductive role, energetic demands and conspicuousness. At larger spatial scales a previously developed habitat suitability model performed well to predict good brood-rearing areas. Hens with broods were located in the best-preserved areas in the range, mainly characterized by higher proportion of forest cover at a large (50 km(2)) scale. We suggest that these characteristics indicate refuge habitats where Cantabrian capercaillie can still breed successfully.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of landscape change on species distributions can help inform decision-making and conservation planning. Unfortunately, empirical data that span large spatial extents across multiple taxa are limited. In this study, we used expert elicitation techniques to develop species distribution models (SDMs) for harvested wildlife species (n = 10) in the New England region of the northeastern United States. We administered an online survey that elicited opinions from wildlife experts on the probability of species occurrence throughout the study region. We collected 3396 probability of occurrence estimates from 46 experts, and used linear mixed-effects methods and landcover variables at multiple spatial extents to develop SDMs. The models were in general agreement with the literature and provided effect sizes for variables that shape species occurrence. With the exception of gray fox, models performed well when validated against crowdsourced empirical data. We applied models to rasters (30 x 30 m cells) of the New England region to map each species' distribution. Average regional occurrence probability was highest for coyote (0.92) and white-tailed deer (0.89) and lowest for gray fox (0.42) and moose (0.52). We then stacked distribution maps of each species to estimate and map focal species richness. Species richness (s) varied across New England, with highest average richness in the least developed states of Vermont (s = 7.47) and Maine (s = 7.32), and lowest average richness in the most developed states of Rhode Island (s = 6.13) and Massachusetts (s = 6.61). Our expert-based approach provided relatively inexpensive, comprehensive information that would have otherwise been difficult to obtain given the spatial extent and range of species being assessed. The results provide valuable information about the current distribution of wildlife species and offer a means of exploring how climate and land-use change may impact wildlife in the future.

AB  - Species distribution patterns are widely used to guide conservation planning and are a central issue in ecology. The usefulness of spatial correlation analysis has been highlighted in several ecological applications so far. However, spatial assumptions in ecology are highly scale-dependent, in which geographical relationships between species diversity and distributions can have different conservation concerns. Here, an integrative landscape planning was designed to show the spatial distribution patterns of taxonomic and functional diversity of amphibians and fishes, from multiple species traits regarding morphology, life history, and behavior. We used spatial, morphological, and ecological data of amphibians and fishes to calculate the functional diversity and the spatial correlation of species. Mapping results show that the higher taxonomic and functional diversity of fishes is concentrated in the West Atlantic Forest. Considering amphibians, are located in the East portion of the biome. The spatial correlation of species indicates the regions of the Serra do Mar and the extreme southern part of the Central Corridor as the main overlapped species distribution areas between both groups. New key conservation sites were reported within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot, revealing cross-taxon mismatches between terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. This study offers useful spatial information integrating suitable habitats of fishes and amphibians to complement existing and future research based on terrestrial and freshwater conservation. New priorities for biodiversity conservation in rich-species regions highlight the importance of spatial pattern analysis to support land-use planning in a macroecological context.

AB  - Aim The uncertainty associated with species distribution model (SDM) projections is poorly characterized, despite its potential value to decision makers. Error estimates from most modelling techniques have been shown to be biased due to their failure to account for spatial autocorrelation (SAC) of residual error. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) have the ability to account for SAC through the inclusion of a spatially structured random intercept, interpreted to account for the effect of missing predictors. This framework promises a more realistic characterization of parameter and prediction uncertainty. Our aim is to assess the ability of GLMMs and a conventional SDM approach, generalized linear models (GLM), to produce accurate projections and estimates of prediction uncertainty. Innovation We employ a unique historical dataset to assess the accuracy of projections and uncertainty estimates from GLMMs and GLMs. Models were trained using historical (19281940) observations for 99 woody plant species in California, USA, and assessed using temporally independent validation data (20002005). Main conclusions GLMMs provided a closer fit to historic data, had fewer significant covariates, were better able to eliminate spatial autocorrelation of residual error, and had larger credible intervals for projections than GLMs. The accuracy of projections was similar between methods but GLMMs better quantified projection uncertainty. Additionally, GLMMs produced more conservative estimates of species range size and range size change than GLMs. We conclude that the GLMM error structure allows for a more realistic characterization of SDM uncertainty. This is critical for conservation applications that rely on honest assessments of projection uncertainty.

AB  - The tayra (Eira barbara) is a common and broadly distributed Neotropical carnivore, yet is not well-studied. While this species is apparently associated with forested habitats, it also appears tolerant of some anthropogenic disturbance. We deployed 57 unbaited camera traps (n = 4923 trap-days) in and around a protected area (Furnas do Bom Jesus State Park, Sao Paulo, Brazil) to survey for tayra and two potentially interactive species: puma (Puma concolor) and free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris). We used encounter histories generated from photographs and occupancy models to quantify tayra landscape use in the human-dominated landscape composed of the protected area that was near a city and surrounded by agricultural lands dominated by small farms. We fit co-occurrence models to understand whether puma and free-ranging dogs affected landscape use by tayra. We detected tayra at 44% of sites and found that tayra landscape use increased with the proportion of forest cover within 500 m of the sampling site. Other factors predicting tayra landscape use included whether the sampling site was within the protected area, its distance to water, and slope. Dogs, which are common on the periphery of the protected area, seem to have a weak negative effect on tayra landscape use. Because of the concentration of forest within the park, this is an important protected area for the carnivore population within this human-modified landscape. Thus, environmental variables, such as forest cover, distance to water, as well as administrative protection status, are important for understanding local-scale tayra distribution.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to global biodiversity. Felids, among the many taxa experiencing population declines and range contraction around the world, are known as ecologically and politically powerful levers in conservation programs. Many felids are wide-ranging, and therefore, identifying and conserving their core habitat patches and corridors is essential for developing an umbrella strategy for protecting co-existing species. We employed a multi-scale, multi-species approach to model habitat suitability and connectivity for six felids across Iran. We identified potential core habitats and corridors of movement. We also quantified the spatial niche overlap to estimate the most important variables of habitat selection within the guild. We evaluated the effectiveness of conservation areas in conserving habitats and connectivity. Our findings revealed that each species' habitat use was influenced in a scale-dependent manner by different sets of environmental variables. Core habitats of felids were mostly located in conservation areas. We identified a number of small core habitats for most felids outside conservation areas. Maintaining corridors and stepping stone habitat patches along corridors may be needed to facilitate movement of individuals, especially between habitat remnants in unprotected areas. Our study highlights the importance of considering multiple spatial scales in management and conservation of carnivores. Our analysis shows that habitat selection and connectivity predictions are both very sensitive to scale, and incorrect scale of analysis can result in incorrect inferences that may lead to dramatically inefficient or ineffective conservation actions.

AB  - Recent climate projections have shown that the distribution of organisms in island biotas is highly affected by climate change. Here, we present the result of the analysis of niche dynamics of a plant group, Memecylon, in Sri Lanka, an island, using species occurrences and climate data. We aim to determine which climate variables explain current distribution, model how climate change impacts the availability of suitable habitat for Memecylon, and determine conservation priority areas for Sri Lankan Memecylon. We used georeferenced occurrence data of Sri Lankan Memecylon to develop ecological niche models and assess both current and future potential distributions under six climate change scenarios in 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. We also overlaid land cover and protected area maps and performed a gap analysis to understand the impacts of land-cover changes on Memecylon distributions and propose new areas for conservation. Differences among suitable habitats of Memecylon were found to be related to patterns of endemism. Under varying future climate scenarios, endemic groups were predicted to experience habitat shifts, gains, or losses. The narrow endemic Memecylon restricted to the montane zone were predicted to be the most impacted by climate change. Projections also indicated that changes in species' habitats can be expected as early as 2041-2060. Gap analysis showed that while narrow endemic categories are considerably protected as demonstrated by their overlap with protected areas, more conservation efforts in Sri Lankan forests containing wide endemic and nonendemic Memecylon are needed. This research helped clarify general patterns of responses of Sri Lankan Memecylon to global climate change. Data from this study are useful for designing measures aimed at filling the gaps in forest conservation on this island.

AB  - Assessing habitat quality to identify the highest priority sites for conservation planning is a complex task, and requires an understanding of which habitat attributes are most important for species population success. I explored the relative importance of biotic, abiotic, spatial, or disturbance-related habitat attributes to the population abundance of four edaphic-endemic, disturbance-dependent rare plant species. Variable selection provided a way to evaluate the relative importance of ecologically relevant groups of habitat attributes. Overall, biotic and disturbance history variables were the best predictors of population abundance for all four gabbro rare plant species, while spatial and abiotic variables were not found to be strong drivers of population abundance. Habitat quality for the four rare plants evaluated here may be best characterized by the associated species in the vegetation community, and an appropriate disturbance regime is a key component to maintain populations over time.

AB  - Protected area networks (PAN) are essential for conserving wide-ranging apex predators but their adequacy in species protection has rarely been assessed. Here, we assess the adequacy of Bhutan's PAN in conserving and providing connectivity to the endangered tiger (Panthera tigris). We determine the current extent of tiger habitat, predict new suitable habitat, identify potential corridors, and empirically estimate the range of tiger numbers that Bhutan can spatially support. We use two spatial models with different approaches to ascertain current tiger distribution and predict new suitable tiger areas: (a) an expert model based on tiger ecology and (b) an observation model from observed tiger distribution. The expert model identified more suitable tiger areas (32,887 km(2)) over the observation model (29,962 km(2)), with the PAN encompassing 46% and 45% of predicted suitable areas, respectively. Vast suitable tiger habitat remains unprotected. Based on our estimates of total suitable habitats, Bhutan can spatially support 138-151 tigers compared to the current estimate of 103, thereby precluding a doubling in tiger numbers. To ensure adequate protection of tigers in Bhutan, we recommend readjusting and/or expanding existing PAN boundaries, including the designation of new corridors, protecting habitats, and conserving prey populations.

AB  - The loss, alteration and fragmentation of faunal habitat affects the ability of species to persist in the landscape. Effective management and reconstruction of habitat to enhance species persistence needs to be informed by organism-centric approaches to evaluating alternative habitat scenarios. Such approaches need to be founded on sound ecological theory, be capable of integrating knowledge of dynamic ecological processes with data on the distribution and quality of habitat in spatially complex landscapes, and yet be simple and efficient enough for broad application.
   We describe a new methodology - rapid evaluation of metapopulation persistence (REMP) - that integrates a cost-benefit approach to measuring landscape connectivity, using continuously variable (i.e. raster) habitat surfaces, with existing analytical techniques for determining the metapopulation capacity of a given landscape and for predicting occupancy patterns within this landscape. By adapting these existing techniques to work with raster data structures REMP is particularly well-suited to analysis of highly variegated landscapes. REMP produces results rapidly using best-available habitat suitability mapping and a limited set of parameters defining species movement abilities and habitat area requirements. These parameters can be estimated from expert knowledge when no empirical data are available. The approach has been successfully integrated into landscape scenario development and evaluation systems, supporting conservation planning for native fauna in NSW, Australia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With climate change, terrestrial fauna in riparian floodplain ecosystems must adapt to a predicted increase in frequency and magnitude of fluvial perturbations. Seasonal migration to seek refuge from floodwaters represents a central adaptation strategy, but may entail risky navigation of anthropogenic spaces in heterogeneous landscapes. Here, we demonstrate the opportunities and constraints large-bodied mammalian herbivores face during an adaptive response of obligatory flood-driven refuge migration, across a human-dominated environment. Our study system, centred around a productive protected area--Kaziranga National Park in Assam, Northeast India-on the floodplains of the Brahmaputra River, is home to an abundance of large herbivores that undertake seasonal migrations in response to floods. We contrast species distribution data during a major flood event with those from the dry season to illustrate season-specific movement and space use decisions of large herbivores ranging in body mass from the 3000-kg Asian elephant Elephas maximus to the 20-kg muntjac Muntiacus muntjak. In the dry season, most large herbivores--a majority of which are endangered and threatened by anthropogenic pressures--avoided areas with a strong human footprint, while preferring spaces with high land-use diversity. During the floods, such species were pushed out of inundated habitats within the protected area, and they chose tomove through woodlands and areas under bamboo cover on private lands, as they migrated to forested refugia on higher ground. Our results showhowseasonal environmental constraints shaped by floods determine the internal motivation of animals to risk traversing a human-dominated space to seek refuge, which contextually defines how animals view and navigate the landscape. Such insights underscore the importance of dynamic and adaptive planning, and participatory conservation efforts, to facilitate connectivity in the changing environment and climate of the present Anthropocene.

AB  - The recent proliferation of high-quality global gridded environmental datasets has spurred a renaissance of studies in many fields, including biogeography. However, these data, often 1 km at the finest scale available, are too coarse for applications such as precise designation of conservation priority areas and regional species distribution modeling, or purposes outside of biology such as city planning and precision agriculture. Further, these global datasets likely underestimate local climate variations because they do not incorporate locally relevant variables. Here we describe a comprehensive set of 30 m resolution rasters for Hong Kong, a small tropical territory with highly variable terrain where intense anthropogenic disturbance meets a robust protected area system. The data include topographic variables, a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index raster, and interpolated climate variables based on weather station observations. We present validation statistics that convey each climate variable's reliability and compare our results to a widely used global dataset, finding that our models consistently reflect greater climatic variation. To our knowledge, this is the first set of published environmental rasters specific to Hong Kong. We hope this diverse suite of geographic data will facilitate future environmental and ecological studies in this region of the world, where a spatial understanding of rapid urbanization, introduced species pressure, and conservation efforts is critical.

AB  - Asiatic black bear Ursus thibetanus and sun bear Helarctos malayanus populations are declining throughout South-east Asia as a result of habitat loss and human disturbance. Knowledge of the distribution and status of each species is limited and largely anecdotal. Range maps are coarse, compiled by expert opinion, and presence or absence is unknown over large portions of South-east Asia. These two species co-occur in Lao People's Democratic Republic and may be faring better there than in neighbouring countries. During 2010-2013 we searched for bear sign along 99 transects within eight study sites throughout Lao. To explore countrywide relative abundance and habitat suitability, we modelled bear sign as a log-linear function of biological and anthropogenic predictors that were associated with habitat assemblages and human disturbance. Bears favored higher elevations and rugged terrain in areas less accessible to humans, and were most abundant in the north and east of Lao. Suitable habitats were rare in the southern lowland plains where bear abundance was relatively low. Our model predicted that Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area had the largest areas of suitable bear habitat, followed by the Nakai-Nam Teun and Nam Ha National Protected Areas. Using transects to survey for bear sign, we created a replicable geographical information system based assessment tool for bears in Lao that can be used to identify conservation opportunities and monitor changes in bear distribution over time.

AB  - Climate change will cause species range shift. However, conservation implications of species range shift are limited. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the efficacy of Protected Areas (PAs) in the conservation of Cordia Africana (Lam.) species under present and future climatic conditions in Tigray region, northern Ethiopia. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model, a species predictive modelling software was used to model both the present and future distributions of Cordia Africana species within the Protected Areas of Tigray region. An ensemble of three General Circulation Models ('CCSM4', HadGEM2-ES' and 'MIROC5') along with two Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios over two time periods (2050 and 2070) were used for modelling the future species distribution. Results indicate that suitable habitats for Cordia Africana species under current climatic conditions covers only 17% of the total area in PAs. However, the total area of suitable habitats for Cordia Africana within the PAs will increase up to 32% under future climate scenarios. The results suggest that PAs show low efficacy to protect Cordia Africana species. Therefore, conservation planning should integrate in situ and forest management strategies while taking into consideration climate change scenarios.

AB  - Although they are the foundations of most efforts to conserve biodiversity, protected areas in the United States have, historically, not always been located in the most important areas to accomplish this goal. We investigated the overlap between suitable habitat for wildlife species of conservation concern and the location of public and private highly protected areas to assess the degree to which current highly protected areas are providing fine-scale habitat for wildlife species of conservation concern, to explore the relationship between the size of total suitable habitat of a species and its vulnerability to extinction, and to identify the species that are poorly represented in highly protected areas and determine where their habitats overlap-i.e., where future protected areas may best be located. We found that nearly one third of terrestrial wildlife species in the contiguous U.S. are vulnerable to extinction and that even though there is a relationship between total suitable habitat area and vulnerability, we find that synthetic indices of endemism and rarity-weighted richness are not necessarily good indicators of whether a species will be of conservation concern. Of all 537 wildlife species of conservation concern, only 62 (11%) are well represented in highly protected areas. To increase representation of habitats of wildlife species of conservation concern, scientists and managers should look to preserve lands where there is the greatest overlap among habitats for species of concern that are currently poorly represented in the reserve system, with special focus on species with small ranges on public lands.

AB  - We report on the capture of an adult male Rufous-tailed Attila (Attila phoenicurus) in Mburucuya National Park, Corrientes, Argentina. This is the first record for this protected area, and also the first record for the province. Records for this species are scarce in Argentina, where it had been registered previously only in Misiones province. Populations of this species are believed to be declining, and it is considered a "threatened species" in Argentina. If confirmed, the regular presence and perhaps even breeding of the Rufous-tailed Attila in Mburucuya National Park would extend the species' distribution range approximately 200 km to the southwest, implying that this threatened species occurs in at least one large protected area of Argentina.

AB  - Species' response to climate change is already occurring and managers require scenario planning with tangible actions for effective conservation. We address this need by examining the impact of projected changes in maximum temperature and sea level rise (SLR), on the future suitability of current nesting sites for two globally endangered turtle species (Eretmochelys imbricata, hawksbill and Caretta caretta, loggerhead turtles). We parameterized the biophysical characteristics of nesting beaches in Western Australia (WA), Northern Territory (NT) and Queensland (Q.c1) and used climate change projections to assess future suitability. All current nesting beaches are predicted to experience increased maximum temperatures (up to 34.8 degrees C in NT and 38.9 degrees C in WA), sex ratios will become increasingly female-skewed, and embryo viability will be threatened at beaches in the north and west of Australia. Beaches in eastern Australia are less likely to flood than those in the west under sea level rise, although all beaches will experience increased flooding, with some sites projected to be below mean high water level by 2100. Many current beaches globally may become unsuitable for nesting under climate change and therefore other existing, or newly established, beaches will be critical for the persistence of turtle populations: thermally suitable climate space in Australia will undergo a southwards shift. This type of analysis can be repeated elsewhere to inform regional long-term conservation planning, such as implementation of protected areas. We demonstrate a valid approach to addressing the issue of conservation for species that use different habitats at different life stages in different parts of the world: by assessing future habitat suitability we highlight important areas for effective conservation planning and management.

AB  - The Iberian Peninsula (Iberia) is a key region for preserving many endangered habitats and species. High bio-diversity areas, such as Natura 2000 sites and High Nature Value farmlands, are widespread in Iberia. However, the massive, uncontrolled proliferation of exotic Eucalyptus globulus plantations in some regions may jeopardise conservation goals. It is thus important to assess the potential conflicts of E. globulus plantations with high biodiversity areas, both in current and future times. We applied species distribution models to project the current and future potential ranges of E. globulus plantations in Iberia, considering two representative concentration (of greenhouse gas) pathways (RCP): RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Projections include a range of environmental suitability for E. globulus plantations. These projections were assessed in relation to the distribution of the Natura 2000 sites and High Nature Value farmlands. Conflicts were rated based on the combination between the level of suitability for plantations and the level of biodiversity importance in a grid of cells covering Iberia.
   Eucalyptus globulus plantations are currently widespread inside the Natura 2000 network of the Iberian Peninsula. In a few Natura 2000 sites, E. globulus cover increased after their designation as a protected area. Overall, plantations expanded greatly around Natura 2000 sites. The species distribution model showed that the current potential range of E. globulus plantations extends over 18% of Iberia, mostly along the Atlantic shore, being mainly determined by the minimum temperature of the coldest month. The future projections show a northward contraction of the suitable range, especially under the RCP8.5 (warmer scenario). However, the suitability for E. globulus plantations will improve in most of the receding range, leading to an aggravation of the potential conflicts with those high biodiversity areas. This study helps identify priority areas to prevent further impacts of E. globulus plantations on Iberian biodiversity.

AB  - Background and goal
   The study is conducted to facilitate conservation of migratory wader species along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, particularly to 1) Identify hotspots of wader species richness along the flyway and effectively map how these might change between breeding, non-breeding and migratory phases; 2) Determine if the existing network of protected areas (PA) is sufficient to effectively conserve wader biodiversity hotspots along the EAAF; 3) Assess how species distribution models can provide complementary distribution estimates to existing BirdLife range maps.
   Methods
   We use a species distribution modelling (SDM) approach (MaxEnt) to develop temporally explicit individual range maps of 57 migratory wader species across their annual cycle, including breeding, non-breeding and migratory phases, which in turn provide the first biodiversity hotspot map of migratory waders along the EAAF for each of these phases. We assess the protected area coverage during each migration period, and analyse the dominant environmental drivers of distributions for each period. Additionally, we compare model hotspots to those existing range maps of the same species obtained from the BirdLife Internationals' database.
   Results
   Our model results indicate an overall higher and a spatially different species richness pattern compared to that derived from a wader biodiversity hotspot map based on BirdLife range maps. Field observation records from the eBird database for our 57 study species confirm many of the hotspots revealed by model outputs (especially within the Yellow Sea coastal region), suggesting that current richness of the EAAF may have been underestimated and certain hotspots overlooked. Less than 10% of the terrestrial zones area (inland and coastal) which support waders are protected and, only 5% of areas with the highest 10% species richness is protected.
   Main conclusions
   The study results suggest the need for new areas for migratory wader research and conservation priorities including Yellow Sea region and Russian far-East. It also suggests a need to increase the coverage and percentage of current PA network to achieve Aichi Target 11 for Flyway countries, including giving stronger consideration to the temporal dynamics of wader migration.

AB  - Protected areas are established to conserve biodiversity and facilitate resilience to threatening processes. Yet protected areas are not isolated environmental compounds. Many threats breach their borders, including transportation infrastructure. Despite an abundance of roads in many protected areas, the impact of roads on biota within these protected areas is usually unaccounted for in threat mitigation efforts. As landscapes become further developed and the importance of protected areas increases, knowledge of how roads impact on the persistence of species at large scales and whether protected areas provide relief from this process is vital. We took a two-staged approach to analysing landscape-scale habitat use and road-kill impacts of the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), a large, widely distributed herbivore, within New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Firstly, we modelled their state-wide distribution from atlas records and evaluated the relationship between habitat suitability and wombat road fatalities at that scale. Secondly, we used local-scale fatality data to derive an annual estimate of wombats killed within an optimal habitat area. We then combined these two approaches to derive a measure of total wombats killed on roads within the protected area network. Our results showed that common wombats have a broad distribution (290,981 km(2)), one quarter (24.9 %) of their distribution lies within protected areas, and the percentage of optimal habitat contained within protected areas is 35.6 %, far greater than the COP10 guidelines of 17 %. Problematically, optimal habitat within protected areas was not a barrier to the effects of road-kill, as we estimated that the total annual count of wombat road-kill in optimal habitat within protected areas could be as high as 13.6 % of the total NSW population. These findings suggest that although protected areas are important spatial refuges for biodiversity, greater effort should be made to evaluate how reserves confer resilience from the impacts of roads across geographic ranges.

AB  - Land use changes occurring in Europe in recent decades are generating important changes in the forest landscape characteristics and are having important effects on avian species richness and abundance. This is particularly important for some bird species of particular conservation concern that require heterogenous landscapes where breeding habitats are proximal to foraging habitats. Among these birds, the European Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur is particularly important because of its marked population decline. In southern Europe, forest landscapes have been considered important breeding areas for Turtle Doves. We assessed the influence of the foraging area characteristics - distance to cereal crops and wild seed species abundance - and water availability on Turtle Dove breeding habitat suitability in a Mediterranean forest landscape in southern Spain. Forty-six point locations were surveyed during the spring of 2014 and 2015 on two nearby farms of a forest protected area. The average local abundance of Turtle Doves found at each point location was 1.25 +/- 1.31 males, and it was significantly higher at the point locations closest to cereal crops, as well as at nesting sites where the wild seed species included in its local diet were abundant, especially Echium plantagineum. Distance to water in the studied range (average distance 475 m) did not show a significant effect on Turtle Dove local abundance, although the high availability of water in the study area could have a positive influence on the overall Turtle Dove breeding habitat suitability. To benefit Turtle Dove breeding habitat suitability, cultivated areas with cereals/legumes near those forest areas where Turtle Doves reproduce should be promoted. Likewise, the promotion of those herbaceous species that are locally important in the Turtle Dove diet, available, for example, through specific grazing management, should be taken into account when nesting habitat restoration is designed in forest areas, regardless of whether the distances to food resources are long.

AB  - The carnivorous wetland plant, Sarracenia purpurea (the northern pitcher plant) is native to eastern and Midwestern North America. This species is abundant within its habitat but suitable habitat is increasingly scarce, raising interest in S. purpurea restoration and conservation. Complicating conservation planning, two controversial subspecies of S. purpurea are historically defined primarily on morphologic traits: S. purpurea subsp. purpurea distributed north of Maryland and S. purpurea subsp. venosa distributed south of Maryland. S. purpurea is also found in three distinct habitat types defined by substrate: acidic Sphagnum peatlands, acidic sandy savannahs, and alkaline marl wetlands. In species level studies, S. purpurea leaves have exhibited morphological plasticity in response to environmental variability, bringing into question the validity of subspecies definitions based on morphology alone. This study examined morphologic and genetic variation throughout S. purpurea's natural distribution, encompassing both the traditional subspecies and three unique habitat types testing the validity of traditional subspecies definitions. Genetic analysis indicated possible ecological significance of considering a new grouping of S. purpurea populations into Midwest, N. East Coast and S. East Coast populations (AMOVA % variation = 13.34, P = 0.0078) based on genetic differentiation. Morphological variation in leaf shape measurements supported this division as well as indicating plasticity associated with environmental variables. This study conservatively suggests that new, geographical area conservation units may be a more important conservation unit for preserving S. purpurea genetic variation and morphological plasticity than traditional subspecies definitions.

AB  - AimAdvancement in ecological methods predicting species distributions is a crucial precondition for deriving sound management actions. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models are a popular tool to predict species distributions, as they are considered able to cope well with sparse, irregularly sampled data and minor location errors. Although a fundamental assumption of MaxEnt is that the entire area of interest has been systematically sampled, in practice, MaxEnt models are usually built from occurrence records that are spatially biased towards better-surveyed areas. Two common, yet not compared, strategies to cope with uneven sampling effort are spatial filtering of occurrence data and background manipulation using environmental data with the same spatial bias as occurrence data. We tested these strategies using simulated data and a recently collated dataset on Malay civet Viverra tangalunga in Borneo.
   LocationBorneo, Southeast Asia.
   MethodsWe collated 504 occurrence records of Malay civets from Borneo of which 291 records were from 2001 to 2011 and used them in the MaxEnt analysis (baseline scenario) together with 25 environmental input variables. We simulated datasets for two virtual species (similar to a range-restricted highland and a lowland species) using the same number of records for model building. As occurrence records were biased towards north-eastern Borneo, we investigated the efficacy of spatial filtering versus background manipulation to reduce overprediction or underprediction in specific areas.
   ResultsSpatial filtering minimized omission errors (false negatives) and commission errors (false positives). We recommend that when sample size is insufficient to allow spatial filtering, manipulation of the background dataset is preferable to not correcting for sampling bias, although predictions were comparatively weak and commission errors increased.
   Main ConclusionsWe conclude that a substantial improvement in the quality of model predictions can be achieved if uneven sampling effort is taken into account, thereby improving the efficacy of species conservation planning.

AB  - Background Habitat suitability models give insight into the ecological drivers of species distributions and are increasingly common in management and conservation planning. Telemetry data can be used in habitat models to describe where animals were present, however this requires the use of presence-only modeling approaches or the generation of 'pseudo-absences' to simulate locations where animals did not go. To highlight considerations for generating pseudo-absences for telemetry-based habitat models, we explored how different methods of pseudo-absence generation affect model performance across species' movement strategies, model types, and environments. Methods We built habitat models for marine and terrestrial case studies, Northeast Pacific blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and African elephants (Loxodonta africana). We tested four pseudo-absence generation methods commonly used in telemetry-based habitat models: (1) background sampling; (2) sampling within a buffer zone around presence locations; (3) correlated random walks beginning at the tag release location; (4) reverse correlated random walks beginning at the last tag location. Habitat models were built using generalised linear mixed models, generalised additive mixed models, and boosted regression trees. Results We found that the separation in environmental niche space between presences and pseudo-absences was the single most important driver of model explanatory power and predictive skill. This result was consistent across marine and terrestrial habitats, two species with vastly different movement syndromes, and three different model types. The best-performing pseudo-absence method depended on which created the greatest environmental separation: background sampling for blue whales and reverse correlated random walks for elephants. However, despite the fact that models with greater environmental separation performed better according to traditional predictive skill metrics, they did not always produce biologically realistic spatial predictions relative to known distributions. Conclusions Habitat model performance may be positively biased in cases where pseudo-absences are sampled from environments that are dissimilar to presences. This emphasizes the need to carefully consider spatial extent of the sampling domain and environmental heterogeneity of pseudo-absence samples when developing habitat models, and highlights the importance of scrutinizing spatial predictions to ensure that habitat models are biologically realistic and fit for modeling objectives.

AB  - Many protected area (PA) systems have developed in response to socio-economic and aesthetic criteria and need to be modified to increase their conservation value. National gap analyses are an important step in describing and addressing this problem, so we sought to determine the representativeness of English PAs devoted to biodiversity conservation by using Natural Areas (NAs), elevation and PA boundary data. We found that National Nature Reserves (NNRs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interests (SSSIs) cover only 6.3% of England and are generally small, with respective median areas of 1.1 and 0.2 km(2). The English PA system under-represents lowland areas and provides a median level of 2.5% protection for the NA types, with seventy nine per cent of NA types having less than 10% protection. Therefore, we suggest that England's PA system needs to be expanded, although this would probably entail modification of existing legislation to increase involvement by landowners. We also compare our results with previous appraisals that used species distribution record data and suggest that landscape-level analyses may give a more accurate and less positive assessment.

AB  - Aim Understanding how habitat loss and overhunting impact large carnivores is important for broad-scale conservation planning. We aimed to assess how these threats interacted to affect jaguar habitat (Panthera onca) between 1985-2013 in the Gran Chaco, a deforestation hotspot. Location Gran Chaco ecoregion in Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. Methods We modelled jaguar habitat change from 1985-2013 using a time-calibrated species distribution model that uses all occurrence data available for that period. We modelled habitat as a function of resource availability and hunting threats, which allowed us to separate core (high resource availability and low hunting threat), refuge (low resources but safe), attractive sink (high resources but risky) and sink (low resources and risky) habitat for 1985, 2000 and 2013. Results Jaguar core areas contracted by 33% (82,400 km(2)) from 1985-2013, mainly due to an expansion of hunting threats. Sink and attractive sink habitat covered 58% of the jaguar range in 2013 and most confirmed jaguar kill sites occurred in these areas. Furthermore, habitat loss and hunting threats co-occurred in 29% of jaguars' range in 2013. Hunting threats also deteriorated core areas within protected areas, but 95% of all core areas loss occurred outside protected lands. About 68% of the remaining core areas in 2013 remained unprotected, mostly close to international borders. Main conclusions Our study highlights the synergistic effects that habitat loss and hunting threats exert on large carnivores, even inside protected areas, emphasizing the need to consider the geography of threats in conservation planning. Our results also point to the importance of areas along international borders as havens for wildlife and thus the urgent need for cross-border planning to prevent the imminent extinction of jaguars from the Chaco. Opportunities lie in reducing jaguar mortality over the widespread attractive sinks, particularly in corridors connecting core areas.

AB  - We used predictive modeling of species distributions to identify conservation priority areas in the equatorial Pacific region of western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. Museum and herbarium data and predictive models of species distributions are increasingly being used to assess the conservation status of individual species. In this study, we assembled occurrence data for 28 species of vascular plants, birds, and mammals to assess the conservation priorities of the set of natural communities that they represent. Environmental variables were used to predict the species' distributions using correlative modeling as an alternative to point data, which has been the traditional approach to identify critical areas. Specific priority sites for conservation were identified using an area-selection algorithm based on simulated annealing. Four scenarios of prioritization were created using different criteria for the spatial compactness of the selected sites and fragmentation of remnant habitat. The results provide a preliminary assessment of conservation priorities for the dry ecosystems of the Equatorial Pacific region, and will serve as guidelines to focus future fieldwork.

AB  - The population of the medicinal plant, Malabar nut (Justicia adhatoda L) is shrinking in Dun valley due to habitat fragmentation, invasion by Lantana camara, over-exploitation, and an ever-increasing human population - the most important being the increasing demand on land for agriculture, industries and the urbanization. Predicting potential geographic distribution of the species is important from species and habitat restoration point of view. This paper reports the results of a study carried out in the Lesser Himalayan foothills in India (Dun valley) on potential distribution modeling for Malabar nut using Maxent model. The Worldclim bioclimatic variables, slope, aspect, elevation, and the land use/land cover (based on IRS LISS-III) data and 46 spatially well-dispersed species occurrence points were used to predict the potential distribution off. adhatoda in ca. 1877 km(2) study area. Jackknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modeling. Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 92.3. The approach could be promising in predicting the potential distribution of medicinal plant species and thus, can be an effective tool in species restoration and conservation planning.

AB  - Conservation planning decisions are constrained by three important factors: budgets are limited, important areas for biodiversity compete for space with other uses, and climate- and land-use changes are affecting the distribution of life thus compounding existing threats to biodiversity. Decisions about locating and allocating resources for conservation in such complex and dynamic world are far from trivial, with apparently optimal decisions in the present being potential suboptimal in the future. We propose a methodological framework for the dynamic spatial prioritization of conservation areas that optimizes long-term conservation goals under climate change. This approach involves a sequential scheduling of conservation areas designation, followed by the release of some areas when they stop contributing to the specified long-term conservation goals. The usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a case study involving ten species in the Iberian Peninsula under severe scenarios of climate change, but the framework could be applied more broadly. Species persistence under climate change is enhanced by the dynamic spatial prioritization strategy that assumes area release. With such strategy, the long-term persistence of species is consistently higher than expected with no release of redundant areas, particularly when the budgets to acquire and manage conservation areas are small. When budgets are small, long-term persistence of species might only be achieved when the release of previously selected areas is considered alongside the selection of new areas. Synthesis and applications. Given that conservation budgets are typically small, conservation strategies involving the release of some underperforming areas might be required to achieve long-term persistence of species. This should be the case when climate change forces species to move out of current protected areas with other areas becoming important to meet conservation objectives. Implementing such dynamic prioritization approach would require a paradigm shift in conservation planning because conservation areas, once selected, are rarely released. Dynamic selection of areas also involves risks that should be considered in a case-by-case situation.

AB  - Aim: To inform conservation planning in the face of climate change, our objectives were to map spatial patterns of tree and songbird macrorefugia; to identify climatic limiting factors by region and taxonomic group; and to quantify multi-scale topographic components of end-of-century biotic refugia.
   Location: United States and Canada outside the far north.
   Time period: End of the 21st century.
   Major taxa studiedL Trees and songbirds.
   Methods: We used species distribution models for 324 trees and 268 songbirds to develop a macrorefugia index using species-specific climate velocity. Maps of multispecies refugia potential were developed for each taxonomic/functional group and quantile regression was used to identify climatic limiting factors and relationships with multi-scale topographic variables.
   Results: End-of-century macrorefugia for both trees and songbirds were concentrated in western mountains and, to a lesser extent, in north-eastern coastal regions. For the highest-value refugia, precipitation was generally most limiting in the north, and warm temperatures and moisture availability were limiting in the south. Tree refugia were more limited by precipitation and moisture, while songbird refugia were more limited by temperature. Upper-percentile refugia, but not median values, were well explained by topographic conditions. Songbird refugia were strongly associated with elevation, while coastal proximity and landform composition (particularly headwaters) were important for both groups. There was a general lack of concordance between patterns of current species richness and future climate refugia.
   Main conclusions: Macrorefugia patterns are partly explained by steep elevational or latitudinal temperature gradients and/or moderate climates, such as coastal regions. However, climatic limiting factors for these refugia suggest contrasts in the ecological processes governing warm-end range limits for different taxa in different regions. Our framework can be applied to other regions, taxa, and time periods to generate and explain biologically meaningful indices of macrorefugia for conservation planning.

AB  - 1. The importance of monitoring biodiversity to detect and understand changes throughout time and to inform management is increasingly recognized. Monitoring schemes should be globally unified, spatially integrated across scales, long term, and cost-efficient.
   2. We propose a framework to design optimized multispecies-targeted monitoring networks over large areas. The method builds upon previous developments on systematic conservation planning in terms of optimizing resource allocation in space, and comprises seven steps: (a) determine which questions will be addressed, (b) define species to be monitored, (c) compile occurrence data for all defined species, (d) predict the overall distribution of each species, (e) collect relevant environmental data and identify homogeneous strata, (t) set targets for the minimum number of monitoring sites per species and/or stratum and (g) identify optimal monitoring sites.
   3. We tested whether the monitoring networks designed with our framework have increased performance when compared to networks obtained with simple-random or stratified-random sampling by using a set of different indicators. To that end, we designed monitoring networks using optimized and non-optimized sampling schemes, applied to a case study in Portugal, where the goal was to design a monitoring network for amphibians and reptiles, to complement the one currently established in Spain.
   4. Results allowed us to conclude that monitoring networks designed with our method tend to outperform the non-optimized ones, in terms of higher species diversity (i.e. higher number of species and equity across monitoring sites), higher representation of environmental strata, and particularly higher coverage of rare species, with less survey effort.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We developed a framework to allocate monitoring sites for multiple species at broad scales using predictive models and optimization algorithms currently applied in systematic conservation planning. This framework presents field survey cost-efficiency advantages when compared to other standard sampling designs and can significantly contribute to improving the design of monitoring schemes. Thus, we recommend its application to design new multispecies monitoring networks or to extend existing ones.

AB  - Aim Maps of species richness are the basis for applied research and conservation planning as well as for theoretical research investigating patterns of richness and the processes shaping these patterns. The method used to create a richness map could influence the results of such studies, but differences between these methods have been insufficiently evaluated. We investigate how different methods of mapping species ranges can influence patterns of richness, at three spatial resolutions.
   Location California, USA.
   Methods We created richness maps by overlaying individual species range maps for terrestrial amphibians and reptiles. The methods we used to create ranges included: point-to-grid maps, obtained by overlaying point observations of species occurrences with a grid and determining presence or absence for each cell; expert-drawn maps; and maps obtained through species distribution modelling. We also used a hybrid method that incorporated data from all three methods. We assessed the correlation and similarity of the spatial patterns of richness maps created with each of these four methods at three different resolutions.
   Results Richness maps created with different methods were more correlated at lower spatial resolutions than at higher resolutions. At all resolutions, point-to-grid richness maps estimated the lowest species richness and those derived from species distribution models the highest. Expert-drawn maps and hybrid maps showed intermediate levels of richness but had different spatial patterns of species richness from those derived with the other methods.
   Main conclusions Even in relatively well-studied areas such as California, different data sources can lead to rather dissimilar maps of species richness. Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different methods for creating a richness map can provide guidance for selecting the approach that is most appropriate for a given application and region.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) trained on presence-only data are frequently used in ecological research and conservation planning. However, users of SDM software are faced with a variety of options, and it is not always obvious how selecting one option over another will affect model performance. Working with MaxEnt software and with tree fern presence data from New Zealand, we assessed whether (a) choosing to correct for geographical sampling bias and (b) using complex environmental response curves have strong effects on goodness of fit. SDMs were trained on tree fern data, obtained from an online biodiversity data portal, with two sources that differed in size and geographical sampling bias: a small, widely-distributed set of herbarium specimens and a large, spatially clustered set of ecological survey records. We attempted to correct for geographical sampling bias by incorporating sampling bias grids in the SDMs, created from all georeferenced vascular plants in the datasets, and explored model complexity issues by fitting a wide variety of environmental response curves (known as "feature types" in MaxEnt). In each case, goodness of fit was assessed by comparing predicted range maps with tree fern presences and absences using an independent national dataset to validate the SDMs. We found that correcting for geographical sampling bias led to major improvements in goodness of fit, but did not entirely resolve the problem: predictions made with clustered ecological data were inferior to those made with the herbarium dataset, even after sampling bias correction. We also found that the choice of feature type had negligible effects on predictive performance, indicating that simple feature types may be sufficient once sampling bias is accounted for. Our study emphasizes the importance of reducing geographical sampling bias, where possible, in datasets used to train SDMs, and the effectiveness and essentialness of sampling bias correction within MaxEnt.

AB  - 1. Species reintroductions often aim to establish populations of threatened taxa over the long-term. However, climate change may jeopardize reintroduction efforts by altering the conditions of a recipient site beyond the tolerances of the focal species. To aid the selection of recipient sites that will retain their suitability under climate change, species distribution models (SDMs) have been proposed as a method of locating areas with a greater likelihood of facilitating species persistence. 2. We applied SDMs to predict macroclimatic suitability changes for 13 threatened plant and invertebrate species considered for reintroduction at four lowland raised bog sites undergoing restoration. We estimated suitability based on current and projected future conditions under two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios - one low (RCP2.6) and one high (RCP8.5) - using three general circulation models, for the period 2041-2060. 3. When considering current predicted suitability, our models indicated that nine species were viable candidates for reintroduction to at least one of the restoration sites. But when accounting for potential future changes in suitability, the number of candidates was reduced to seven species, based on the RCP8.5 climate change scenario. While three of the sites received consistently similar predictions of suitability across species and scenarios, the most northerly site, Red Moss, received divergent suitability predictions for some species. This site is predicted to remain suitable for Metrioptera brachyptera and Genista anglica under at least one scenario despite substantial losses forecast across the rest of their U.K. ranges, suggesting that it could act as a macroclimatic refuge as climate change advances. 4. The findings presented here made a valuable contribution to the reintroduction planning process, by facilitating the prioritization of reintroduction efforts towards species with a greater likelihood of establishing long-term populations at the prospective recipient sites.

AB  - We monitored the long-term residency of reef-associated ballan wrasse and sand-dwelling rays captured at the site of a potential future Marine Protected Area (MPA: Portelet Bay, Jersey) by implanting them with small transmitters and deploying underwater receivers inside the bay. Individual fish were detected at Portelet Bay for up to 618 days, but there were species-specific differences in residency and detection patterns. Ballan wrasse were year-round residents at the study site where they exhibited distinct, rhythmic, diel, tidal and seasonal patterns of behaviour, whereas rays were occasional visitors to Portelet Bay with no discernible pattern to their visits. Results indicate relatively small MPAs (<0.5 km(2)) that with suitable habitat could provide effective, long-term protection for ballan wrasse, but would likely be of little conservation benefit for rays. Our findings emphasize the importance of quantifying fish movements when planning MPAs which intend to protect multi-species assemblages of coastal fishes.

AB  - Aim Palms are an ecologically and societally important plant group, with high diversity in the Neotropics. Here, we estimated the impacts of future climate change on phylogenetic diversity (PD) of Neotropical palms under varying climatic and dispersal scenarios, assessed the effectiveness of the established network of protected areas (PAs) for conserving palms PD today and in 2070, and identified priority areas for the conservation of palm species and their evolutionary history in the face of climate change.
   Location Neotropics.
   Methods We used ecological niche modelling to estimate the distribution of 367 species in the present and for 2070 based on two greenhouse gas emission and two dispersal scenarios. We calculated Faith's PD within each five arc-minute grid cell to evaluate the effectiveness of PAs relative to null models and used phylogenetic spatial prioritisation analysis to detect priority areas.
   Results We found that even under the most optimistic climatic and dispersal scenarios, the established network of PAs performed poorly in safeguarding palms PD under both current conditions and those projected for 2070. Significant losses in PD inside PAs are expected under future climate conditions, especially if species are unable to disperse to suitable areas. Nevertheless, a modest and strategic increase in the number of PAs could considerably improve the protection of palms PD in the present and 2070.
   Main conclusions The PD of Neotropical palms is poorly represented within the established network of PAs, at both present and in 2070. A higher realised dispersal rates would diminish PD losses inside the network of PAs. The conservation of palm PD can be improved through the expansion of PAs in strategic regions such as the upper portion of the Amazon Basin, Tropical Andes and Mesoamerica.

AB  - In an era of rapid climate and land transformation, it is increasingly important to understand how future changes impact natural systems. Scenario studies can offer the structure and perspective needed to understand the impacts of change and help inform management and conservation decisions. We implemented a scenario-based approach to assess how two high impact drivers of landscape change influence the distributions of managed wildlife species (n= 10) in the New England region of the northeastern United States. We used expert derived species distribution models (SDMs) and scenarios developed by the New England Landscape Futures Project (NELFP) to estimate how species distributions change under various trajectories (n= 5) of landscape change. The NELFP scenarios were built around two primary drivers - Socio-Economic Connectedness (SEC) and Natural Resource Planning and Innovation (NRPI) - and provide plausible alternatives for how the New England region may change over 50 years (2010-2060). Our models generally resulted in species occurrence and richness declines by 2060. The majority of species (7 of 10) experienced declines in regional occurrence for all NELFP scenarios, and one species experienced a projected increase in mean regional occurrence for all scenarios. Our results indicate that the NRPI and SEC drivers strongly influenced projected distribution changes compared to baseline projections. NRPI had a greater impact on distribution change for five species (coyote, moose, striped skunk, white-tailed deer, and wild turkey), while SEC had a greater impact on four species (American black bear, bobcat, raccoon, and red fox); one species (gray fox) was equally influenced by both NRPI and SEC. These results emphasize the importance of integrating both natural resource planning and socio-economic factors when addressing issues of distribution change and offer insights that can inform proactive management and conservation planning.

AB  - Degradation, fragmentation, and loss of tropical forests has exponentially increased in the last decades leading to unprecedented rates of species extinctions and loss of ecosystems functions and services. Forest restoration is key to recover ecosystems health and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. However, restoring forests at the landscape scale presents many challenges, since it requires balancing conservation goals and economic development. In this study, we used a spatial planning tool (Marxan) to identify priority areas for restoration satisfying multiple objectives across a biological corridor in Costa Rica. Biological corridors are critical conservation instruments promoting forest connectivity while acknowledging human presence. Increasing forest connectivity requires restoration initiatives that will likely conflict with other land uses, some of them of high national economic importance. Our restoration plan sought to maximize the provision of forest-related services (i.e., seed dispersal, tourism and carbon storage) while minimizing the impact on current land uses and thus avoiding potential conflicts. We quantified seed dispersal and tourism services (birdwatching potential) using species distribution models. We used the carbon sequestration model of InVEST to quantify carbon storage potential. We tested different restoration scenarios that differed in whether land opportunity costs of current uses were considered or not when identifying potential restoration areas, or how these costs were estimated. We showed how a landscape-scale forest restoration plan accounting for only forest connectivity and ecosystem service provision capacity can greatly differ from a plan that considers the potential impacts on local livelihoods. Spatial planning tools can assist at designing cost-effective landscape-scale forest restoration plans, identifying priority areas where forest restoration can maximize ecosystem provision and increase forest connectivity. Special care must be paid to the use of adequate estimates of opportunity cost, to avoid potential conflicts between restoration goals and other legitimate land uses.

AB  - Aim: To assess the representativeness values of Mesoamerican endemic birds within the current network of protected areas (PAs) to determine high-priority and complementary conservation areas to maximize the long-term protection of species.
   Location: From central Mexico to southern Panama.
   Methods: We selected 180 bird species that are geographically restricted to Mesoamerica and estimated their potential ranges using species distribution models. Then, using two different removal rules in ZONATION software, we assessed the species' representativeness levels within the current PA network. We also defined forest remnants that could be used to strategically expand PAs (to reach Aichi biodiversity targets) and maximize the species protection, explicitly considering anthropic pressures.
   Results: Current PAs cover similar to 13% of the land area of Mesoamerica, representing an average of similar to 19% of the total potential distribution for the endemic bird species considered. We also observed that there is <30% overlap between current PAs and the priority areas we define. Our prioritization analyses showed that strategically increasing protection coverage to 17%, as stipulated in the Aichi targets, would substantially increase the representativeness values of PAs (regardless of the removal rule used) and would increase the range by >35% for all species and >29% for threatened species. The consensus priority conservation areas identified were mainly distributed in Costa Rica (similar to 48%), Mexico (similar to 28%), and Panama (similar to 10%).
   Main conclusions Consistent with the global picture, Mesoamerican PAs showed low representativeness of their vulnerable endemic avifauna; therefore, well-informed decisions to guide conservation strategies are imperative. We provide insights about where future conservation efforts should focus to accomplish a representative and well-connected regional PA network.

AB  - In recent years, scientific investigations on the effectiveness of Protected Areas (PM) in conserving biodiversity and sustaining ecosystem functions under the impact of climate change have increasingly received more attention from researchers and park managers. In this study, we used a combination of species distribution modelling (SDM) and spatial hierarchical systematic conservation planning technique to delineate and prioritize areas for endemic plant species conservation under current and future (2050s, 2070s) climate conditions in Sikkim Himalaya. Data on endemic plant species occurrence were sourced from our already published studies and their potential suitable habitats under current and future climates were modelled using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) SDM. The MaxEnt habitat suitability projections of species were used in Zonation software to identify priority conservation areas in Sikkim Himalaya. We found that the existing PA network in the region was inadequate in conserving the endemic plant diversity either in the current or future climate scenarios. Based on our results, we propose addition of 896 square kilometres (sq km) to the existing PA network in the study area to ensure meaningful conservation goals. Additionally, we propose creation of 3 new PM (Yumsedong, Lachen and Chungthang) and the need for expanding the boundaries of existing PM (Maenam, Fambong Lho and Barsey) in the study area. Our analyses show that to mitigate the effects of ensuing climate change, a single large PA with wide geographic and elevational extents instead of several smaller PM would be a more prudent strategy for conserving the plant diversity in the Himalaya.

AB  - Among the expected consequences of climate change are shifts in species' ranges. Most of current methods to predict such shifts in species distributions consider changes in suitability of climatic conditions for existence. With these models, it is possible to indicate the potential distribution of species that would arise under spatial conditions that cause unlimited landscape accessibility and habitat suitability. At the regional scale, however, detailed predictions of changes in species distributions and performance are pivotal for conservation planning. This study aims to predict species occurrences at the regional scale, incorporating demographic processes and dispersal to assess habitat accessibility and suitability in detail. We investigated a system with trophic dependence: the Alcon blue butterfly (Phengaris alcon) is fully dependent on the occurrence of its host plant species marsh gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe). We applied a model chain, consisting of a soil and biomass model, a plant species occurrence and dispersal model and a butterfly metapopulation model. We investigated the effect of future climate change, both under affected and unaffected habitat conditions as determined by host plant occurrence. Our modelled results show that the butterflies perform best when habitat conditions remain unaffected by climate change. However, when climate change does affect the occurrence of its host plant species, butterfly distribution and performance will be deteriorated. This implies that detailed predictions of changes in species distributions and performance should incorporate dispersal, demographic processes and biotic interactions explicitly. Our approach allows for the identification of locations that are potentially suitable for the measures increasing network robustness for P. alcon. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat-suitability modelling is being increasingly used as a tool for conservation biology. Although studies at large spatial scales are more appropriate for reserve design and management, there is a scarcity of published work on local, high-resolution applications of such models. In this work we develop high-resolution habitat models (1 ha) and study habitat preferences (focal points) of Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti, an endangered shrub-steppe passerine, in the partially overlapping Special Protected Area for birds (SPA) and Important Bird Area (IBA) of "paramos de Layna" (NW Spain), to assess both the adequacy of the reserve's limits and the effect of land-use changes on the species' population size. Both analytical approaches show that the Dupont's lark favours flat areas characterized by small shrubs with bare ground, so that, for example, a conversion of dry crops to shrubs promoted by agri-environment schemes under CAP could increase the population size up to 80%. Although the IBA and SPA are similar in size - as compelled by EU environmental policy - the latter shows rugged topography typically avoided by the species. We further discuss the possible conflict between EU environmental and agricultural policies on the conservation of this species and suggest it can be addressed with our study approach.

AB  - Urgent calls for biocultural conservation highlight the need to engage with Indigenous peoples, whose lands cover some of the most biodiverse regions on Earth. In these places, Indigenous knowledge can be strong, especially for culturally significant species; however, this knowledge tends to be overlooked and deemed incompatible with dominant Western systems of conservation decision-making. The practical mechanics of how Indigenous and Western knowledge systems can be respectfully synergized to inform species conservation decision-making on a regional scale are not well documented. In collaboration with Yolqu Indigenous rangers from northern Australia, we used a 'multiple evidence based' approach to synergize knowledge from senior Yolqu custodians with Western scientific species distribution modelling (SDM) to explore distribution shifts and bio-cultural knowledge of two culturally significant, near threatened (critical weight range) mammals: wan'kurra, (Northern Brown Bandicoot, Isoodon macrourus) and marrLATIN SMALL LETTER ENGu/rupu (Common Brushtail Possum, Trichosurus vul-pecula). Historical Yolqu species sightings and seasonal observations and the SDM revealed spatial contractions of both species to the northern and mesic regions of the Laynhapuy Indigenous Protected Area over the last 50 years. Knowledge custodians were concerned about the loss of these species and associated cultural knowledge in younger generations. Such cross-cultural knowledge gathering can guide biocultural conservation decision -making and facilitate intergenerational knowledge transmission of threatened cultural knowledge. This approach to collaborative cross-cultural fauna research can be applied globally, and we argue is imperative in contexts where: species and cultures are under threat, and where Indigenous knowledge and peoples can provide insight to inform inclusive biocultural conservation strategies.

AB  - One of the available tools for mapping the geographical distribution and potential suitable habitats is species distribution models. These techniques are very helpful for finding poorly known distributions of species in poorly sampled areas, such as the tropics. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) is a recently developed modeling method that can be successfully calibrated using a relatively small number of records. In this research, the MaxEnt model was applied to describe the distribution and identify the key factors shaping the potential distribution of the vulnerable Malayan Sun Bear (Helarctos malayanus) in one of the main remaining habitats in Peninsular Malaysia. MaxEnt results showed that even though Malaysian sun bear habitat is tied with tropical evergreen forests, it lives in a marginal threshold of bio-climatic variables. On the other hand, current protected area networks within Peninsular Malaysia do not cover most of the sun bears potential suitable habitats. Assuming that the predicted suitability map covers sun bears actual distribution, future climate change, forest degradation and illegal hunting could potentially severely affect the sun bear's population.

AB  - The spatial prediction of species distributions from survey data is a significant component of spatial planning and the ecosystem-based management approach to marine resources. Statistical analysis of species occurrences and their relationships with associated environmental factors is used to predict how likely a species is to occur in unsampled locations as well as future conditions. However, it is known that environmental factors alone may not be sufficient to account for species distribution. Other ecological processes including species interactions (such as competition and predation), and the impact of human activities, may affect the spatial arrangement of a species. Novel techniques have been developed to take a more holistic approach to estimating species distributions, such as Bayesian Hierarchical Species Distribution model (B-HSD model) and mechanistic food-web models using the new Ecospace Habitat Foraging Capacity model (E-HFC model). Here we used both species distribution and spatial food-web models to predict the distribution of European hake (Merluccius merluccius), anglerfishes (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa) and red mullets (Mullus barbatus and M. surmuletus) in an exploited marine ecosystem of the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. We explored the complementarity of both approaches, comparing results of food-web models previously informed with species distribution modelling results, aside from their applicability as independent techniques. The study shows that both modelling results are positively and significantly correlated with observational data. Predicted spatial patterns of biomasses show positive and significant correlations between modelling approaches and are more similar when using both methodologies in a complementary way: when using the E-HFC model previously informed with the environmental envelopes obtained from the B-HSD model outputs, or directly using niche calculations from B-HSD models to drive the niche priors of E-HFC. We discuss advantages, limitations and future developments of both modelling techniques.

AB  - Large mammals are declining globally due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Climate change is one of the factors known to alter the range of several mammalian species. An early understanding of the effect of climate change on species distributions can provide critical information for conservation planning. Nilgiritragus hylocrius (Nilgiri Tahr) is an endangered ungulate that is restricted to the montane grasslands of the Western Ghats, India. Currently, the Nilgiri Tahr is restricted to a fraction of its former range and is also prone to risks due to several ongoing anthropogenic pressures. However, the impact of global climate change on this emblematic species has seldom been estimated. The goal of our study was to use ecological niche models to quantify the effect of climate change on the habitats of Nilgiri Tahr. Using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, we modelled the potential distribution of Nilgiri Tahr in its native range. The models were developed under the current climatic conditions and then projected onto two future climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and for three different time frames in the future (years 2030, 2050 and 2080). We identified that most of the climatically suitable habitats of Nilgiri Tahr would become unsuitable when global warming intensifies. Our models predicted a complete loss of suitable habitats in many existing protected areas in the Western Ghats. We use insights provided by our modeling results to propose conservation management plans to increase the likelihood of persistence of Nilgiri Tahr in the Western Ghats.

AB  - Estimating absence locations of a species is important in conservation biology and conservation planning. For instance, using reliable absence as much as presence information, species distribution models can enhance their performance and produce more accurate predictions of the distribution of a species. Unfortunately, estimating reliable absence locations is difficult and often requires a deep knowledge of the species' distribution and of its abiotic and biotic environmental preferences and tolerance. In this paper, we propose a methodology to reconstruct reliable absence information from presence-only information, and the conditions that those presence-only data have to meet to make this possible.
   Large species occurrence data collections (otherwise called occurrence datasets) contain high quality and expert-reviewed species observation records from scientific surveys. These surveys can be used to retrieve species presence locations, but they also record places where the species in their target list were not observed. Although these absences could be simply due to sampling variation, it is possible to intersect many of these reports to estimate true absence locations, i.e. those due to habitat unsuitability or geographical hindrances. In this paper, we present a method to generate reliable absence locations of this type for marine species, using scientific surveys reports contained in the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), an authoritative species occurrence dataset. Our method spatially aggregates information from surveys focussing on the same target species. It detects absence locations for a given species as those locations in which repeated surveys (that included the species of interest in their target list) reported information only on other species. We qualitatively demonstrate the reliability of our method using distribution records of the Atlantic cod as a case study. Additionally, we quantitatively estimate its performance using another authoritative large species occurrence dataset, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). We also demonstrate that our approach has higher accuracy and presents complementary behaviour with respect to another method using environmental envelopes. Our process can support species distribution models (as well as other types of models, e.g. climate change models) by providing reliable data to presence/absence approaches. It can manage regional as well as global scale scenarios and runs within a collaborative e-Infrastructure (D4Science) that publishes it as-a-Service, allowing biologists to reproduce, repeat and share experimental results.

AB  - (Temporal variation of phytoplankton in a lake in a permanent protected area in Alagoas State, Northeast Brazil). The objective of this work is to determine the spatial and temporal variation of microphytoplankton and environmental variables in Lake Azul, a permanent protected area in the town of Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas State, Brazil. Samples were collected from April to September 2008. Phytoplankton samples were obtained by surface-horizontal trawling with a 45 mu m mesh net. Water samples were taken with a Van Dorn bottle, during the phytoplankton collection, in order to determine physical-chemical parameters. A total of 27 taxa were identified, Chlorophyta were the most abundant taxa (63% of the sample) followed by Bacillariophyta (26%) and Cyanobacteria (11%). The dominant species were Desmidium swartzii var. quadrangulatum (Ralfs) A. Roy (62.3%) and D. cylindricum Greville (55.1%). The slightly acid pH associated with low nutrient availability favors the development of Desmidiaceae: Closterium sp., Cosmarium goniodes West & West, C. margaritiferum Meneghini ex Ralfs, C. vogeciacum Gutwinski, Desmidium cylindricum Greville, D. pseudotreplonema West & West, D. swartzii var. quadrangulatum (Rails) A.

AB  - There is a growing pressure of human activities on natural habitats, which leads to biodiversity losses. To mitigate the impact of human activities, environmental policies are developed and implemented, but their effects are commonly not well understood because of the lack of tools to predict the effects of conservation policies on habitat quality and/or diversity. We present a straightforward model for the simultaneous assessment of terrestrial and aquatic habitat quality in river basins as a function of land use and anthropogenic threats to habitat that could be applied under different management scenarios to help understand the trade-offs of conservation actions. We modify the InVEST model for the assessment of terrestrial habitat quality and extend it to freshwater habitats. We assess the reliability of the model in a severely impaired basin by comparing modeled results to observed terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity data. Estimated habitat quality is significantly correlated with observed terrestrial vascular plant richness (R-2 = 0.76) and diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates (R-2 = 0.34), as well as with ecosystem functions such as in-stream phosphorus retention (R-2 = 0.45). After that, we analyze different scenarios to assess the suitability of the model to inform changes in habitat quality under different conservation strategies. We believe that the developed model can be useful to assess potential levels of biodiversity, and to support conservation planning given its capacity to forecast the effects of management actions in river basins.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The aim of the present study was to establish the effect of management type and of environmental variables on the structure, abundance and species richness of soil mites (Acari: Mesostigmata) in twelve urban green areas in Bucharest-Romania. Three categories of ecosystem based upon management type were investigated: protected area, managed (metropolitan, municipal and district parks) and unmanaged urban areas. The environmental variables which were analysed were: soil and air temperature, soil moisture and atmospheric humidity, soil pH and soil penetration resistance. In June 2017, 480 soil samples were taken, using MacFadyen soil core. The same number of measures was made for quantification of environmental variables. Considering these, we observed that soil temperature, air temperature, air humidity and soil penetration resistance differed significantly between all three types of managed urban green area. All investigated environmental variables, especially soil pH, were significantly related to community assemblage. Analysing the entire Mesostigmata community, 68 species were identified, with 790 individuals and 49 immatures. In order to highlight the response of the soil mite communities to the urban conditions, Shannon, dominance, equitability and soil maturity indices were quantified. With one exception (numerical abundance), these indices recorded higher values in unmanaged green areas compared to managed ecosystems. The same trend was observed between different types of managed green areas, with metropolitan parks having a richer acarological fauna than the municipal or district parks.

AB  - Despite wide evidence of a quickly changing world, systematic conservation planning analyses are usually static assuming that the biodiversity being preserved in sites do not change through time. Here we generated a comprehensive ensemble forecasting experiment for 444 amphibian species inhabiting the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot. Models were based on four methods for modeling ecological niches, and three future climate simulations. Combinations of these models were used to estimate species occurrences. We used species occurrences to optimize the current and future representation of amphibians with different conservation targets based on their geographic range size. We compared spatial priority outcomes (variance of site selection frequency scores) under dynamic conditions, using a bi-dimensional plot in which the relative importance of each site in achieving conservation targets was assessed both for current time and to 2050. Projections for 2050 show that species richness pattern will remain approximately constant, whereas high turnover rates are forecasted. Selection frequency of several locations varied widely, with recurrent sites located at the north and southeast of the biome. As for 2050, spatial priorities concentrate in the northern part of the biome. Thirty-three sites have high priority for conservation as they play an important role now and will still stand as priority locations in 2050. We present a conceptual model for dynamic spatial conservation prioritization that helps to identify priority sites under climate change. We also call attention to sites in which risk of investment is high, and to those that may become interesting options in the future.

AB  - Conservation planning and management typically require accurate and spatially explicit data at scales that are relevant for conservation objectives. In marine conservation, these data are often combined with spatial analytical techniques to produce marine habitat maps. While marine habitat mapping is increasingly used to inform conservation efforts, this field is still relatively young and its methods are rapidly evolving. Because conservation efforts do not always specify standards or guidelines for the production of habitat maps, results can vary dramatically. As representations of real environmental characteristics, habitat maps are highly sensitive to how they are produced. In this review paper, I present four concepts that are known to cause variation in spatial representation and prediction of habitats: the methodology used, the quality and scale of the data, and the choice of variables in regards to fitness for use. I then discuss the potential antinomy associated with the use of habitat maps in conservation: while habitat maps have become an invaluable tool to inform and assist decision-making, maps of the same area built using different methods and data may provide dissimilar representations, thus providing different information and possibly leading to different decisions. Exploring the theories and methods that have proved effective in terrestrial conservation and the spatial sciences, and how they can be integrated in marine habitat mapping practices, could help improve maps used to support marine conservation efforts and result in more reliable products to inform conservation decisions. Having a strong, consistent, transparent, repeatable, and science-based protocol for data collection and mapping is essential for effectively supporting decision-makers in developing conservation and management plans. The development of user-friendly tools to assist in the application of such protocol is crucial to a widespread improvement in practices. I discuss the potential to use interactive and collaborative Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to encourage the conservation and management community, from data collectors and mapmakers to decision-makers, to move toward a digital resilience and to develop such science-based protocol. Until standards and protocols are developed, habitat maps should always be interpreted with care, and the methods and metadata associated with their production should always be explicitly stated.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning (SCP) identifies priority areas for biodiversity conservation using surrogates for adequate representation of biodiversity content. The use of multiple well-known taxonomic groups rather than single ones as a surrogate set is expected to enable a better representation of most important biodiversity constituents in prioritizing conservation areas. We quantitatively analyzed if single- or multitaxa groups of terrestrial vertebrates serve best as surrogates for representing biodiversity constituents in the state of Oaxaca, a biodiversity hotspot in southern Mexico. We produced species distribution models for 1,063 terrestrial vertebrate species using a maximum entropy algorithm. To determine which fraction of each terrestrial vertebrate group best represented the remaining groups, we produced solutions requiring different proportions of species to be represented with a 10% target of the species' potential distribution in conservation area networks. Precedence to geographical rarity, minimizing area, and enhancing compactness in shape of the selected priority areas was established using ConsNet. We further evaluated performance with surrogacy graphs for determining the representation of each group of terrestrial vertebrates treated as biodiversity constituents. Inclusion of multiple terrestrial vertebrate groups as surrogates performed best for the representation of biodiversity constituents compared to a single terrestrial vertebrate group, in all solutions with different proportions of species in these conservation areas. Terrestrial vertebrate species were poorly represented in the few protected areas (<2% of species), but representation increased significantly (99% of species) when complemented with other established conservation initiatives. SCP should include multitaxa surrogate sets and all established conservation initiatives to ensure priority areas for conservation with an adequate biodiversity representation.

AB  - We used field surveys and Geographic Information System data to identify landscape-scale habitat associations of American martens (Martes americana) and to develop a model to predict their occurrence in northeastern California. Systematic surveys using primarily enclosed track plates, with 10-km spacing, were conducted across a 27,700 km(2) area of largely forested, mountain terrain. Martens were detected at 20/184 (10.8%) of the sample units, aggregated in three distinct regions. We investigated habitat selection at multiple scales using circular assessment areas of 3, 20, and 80 km(2). The model for the largest assessment area best fit the data and included the following predictors: amount of reproductive habitat, number of habitat patches and land ownership category. These results support the hypothesis that martens select habitat based upon broad scale landscape conditions and that these conditions vary with ownership. We tested the model using an independent set of data, collected primarily during the winter. Poor fit of the test data in some locations raised concerns that our model, which was developed using data collected during the snow-free season, may not predict winter distribution well. We are investigating possible causes for the seasonal variation and until they can be incorporated our model represents a conservative view of marten habitat suitability based on summer occupancy. During the summer months, which is the reproductive season, martens are predicted to occur largely in relatively undisturbed landscapes where high-elevation, late-successional forests are common.

AB  - Increasing pressures on global biodiversity and lack of data on the number and abundance of species have motivated conservation planners and researchers to use more readily available information as proxies or surrogates for biodiversity. "Habitat" is one of the most frequently used surrogates but its assumed value in marine conservation planning is not often tested. The present study developed and tested three alternative habitat classification schemes of increasing complexity for a large estuary in south-east Australia and tested their effectiveness in predicting spatial variation in macroinvertebrate biodiversity and selecting estuarine protected areas to represent species. The three habitat classification schemes were: (1) broad-scale habitats (e.g., mangroves and seagrass), (2) subdivision of each broad-scale habitat by a suite of environmental variables that varied significantly throughout the estuary, and (3) subdivision of each broad-scale habitat by the subset of environmental variables that best explained spatial variation in macroinvertebrate biodiversity. Macroinvertebrate assemblages differed significantly among the habitats in each classification scheme. For each classification scheme, habitat richness was significantly correlated with species richness, total density of macroinvertebrates, assemblage dissimilarity, and summed irreplaceability. However, in a reserve selection process designed to represent examples of each habitat, no habitat classification scheme represented species significantly better than a random selection of sites. Habitat classification schemes may represent variation in estuarine biodiversity; however, the results of this study suggest they are inefficient in designing representative networks of estuarine protected areas.

AB  - Spatial conservation prioritization should seek to anticipate climate change impacts on biodiversity and to mitigate these impacts through the development of dynamic conservation plans. Here, we defined spatial priorities for the conservation of amphibians inhabiting the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot that overcome the likely impacts of climate change on the distribution of this imperiled fauna. First, we built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 431 amphibian species both for current time and for the mid-point of a 30-year period spanning 2071-2099 (i.e. 2080). For modeling species' niches, we combined six modeling methods and three different climate models. We also quantified and mapped model uncertainties. Our consensus models forecasted range shifts that culminate with high species richness in central and eastern Atlantic Forest, both for current time and for 2080. Most species had a significant range contraction (up to 72%) and 12% of species were projected to be regionally extinct. Most species would need to disperse because suitable climatic sites will change. Therefore, we identified a network of priority sites for conservation that minimizes the distance a given species would need to disperse because of changes in future habitat suitability (i.e. climate-forced dispersal) as well as uncertainties associated to ENMs. This network also maximized complementary species representation across currently established protected areas. Priority sites already include possible dispersal corridors linking current and future suitable habitats for amphibians. Although we used the a top-ranked Biodiversity Hotspot and amphibians as a case study for illustrating our approach, our study may help developing more effective conservation strategies under climate change, especially when applied at different spatial scales, geographic regions, and taxonomic groups.

AB  - Incorporating climate change into conservation decision-making at site and population scales is challenging due to uncertainties associated with localized climate change impacts and population responses to multiple interacting impacts and adaptation strategies. We explore the use of spatially explicit population models to facilitate scenario analysis, a conservation planning approach for situations of high uncertainty. We developed dynamic, linked habitat suitability and metapopulation models using RAMAS GIS to consider management and monitoring options for a grassland reserve in Minnesota (USA) in order to support a hydrologically sensitive rare orchid (Cypripedium candidum). We evaluated 54 future scenarios combining changes in drought frequency, increased depth to water table, and multiple configurations of increased invasive species cover and management. Simulation results allowed us to prioritize adaptation strategies and monitoring guidelines to inform adaptive management for our model system. For example, preventing further spread of invasive species into the current C. candidum population is an important low-risk resilience strategy for this site. However, under more serious climate change scenarios, higher-risk strategies, such as protecting critical recharge areas, become essential. Additionally, allocating limited monitoring resources toward detecting changes in depth to water table and assessing C. candidum population responses to severe drought will more efficiently inform decisions about when to shift from low-risk resilience approaches to higher-risk resistance and facilitation strategies. Applying this scenario based modeling approach to other high-priority populations will enable conservation decision-makers to develop sound, cost-effective, site-specific management and monitoring protocols despite the uncertainties of climate change.

AB  - Ecological responses of nocturnal predatory birds to forest cover and other geospatial predictors vary both geographically and taxonomically. Considerable knowledge gaps exist regarding the habitat associations of the Sri Lanka Frogmouth, a nocturnal bird restricted to Sri Lanka and the Indian Western Ghats. via a 20-year island-wide survey, we searched for frogmouths in Sri Lanka to determine their habitat associations at both local and landscape scales and developed a habitat suitability model (HSM) to predict both current and future distribution. We confirmed frogmouth presence in 18% of the surveyed sites across all major bioclimatic zones (wet, intermediate, dry, and arid) from lower elevations (11-767m), comprising a broad geographic range. Frogmouth presence was mostly limited to forests (90%) with a few sites in agricultural mosaics. Land protection, altitude and both local and landscape-scale forest cover, as well as forest-cover loss at both spatial scales, were strong predictors of frogmouth presence. According to our HSM, the southwestern lowlands and parts of the intermediate zone contained the most suitable areas for frogmouths despite their smaller extent. Although the dry and intermediate zones contained extensive habitats for frogmouth, these regions were relatively less suitable. The habitat associations and geographic range of this species in Sri Lanka differ from that seen in India through negative associations with altitude and absence from montane zones, absence from degraded or severely disturbed habitats and independence from proximity to waterways. The Sri Lanka Frogmouth is sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances, including historical forest losses. We recommend landscape-scale conservation planning that incorporates both primary and mature persistent secondary forests to ensure the protection of this unique iconic species.

AB  - Analyses of species diversity and endemism patterns provide vital inputs for conservation planning. Therefore, it is an important dilemma of biodiversity conservation that in very diverse but poorly studied tropical countries those patterns can hardly be considered. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop prediction models that make the best use of existing data on species distribution and that can give hints on spatial conservation priorities. This paper presents the results of a pilot study on the diversity of the orchid subtribe Pleurothallidinae ( 331 mapped species) in the Andean rain forests of Bolivia. Results of a taxon-based mapping methodology, using abiotic ( humidity and temperature, the latter indicated by altitude) and historical factors ( taken into account as distance from collection localities) that determine species ranges, are compared with outcomes of an inventory-based mapping approach. The patterns of taxon-based diversity and endemism show a strong correlation with the distribution of sample localities. The inventory-based approach is more reliable, but it is interesting to apply both mapping methods in order to make a critical interpretation and comparison that facilitates some valuable conservation recommendations. We end with concrete conclusions for conservation planning and action.

AB  - The use of a charismatic umbrella species as surrogate for sympatric species is often advocated as an efficient approach. However, comprehensive evaluations from a spatio-temporal perspective are few, leaving the long-term effectiveness of such practices remain uncertain. We modeled the habitat change for giant panda and eight sympatric mammalian species using observations from extensive camera trap surveys and remotely-sensed environmental predictors during two time periods, early 2000s and early 2010s. We found that the degree and spatial pattern of the habitat suitability change varied among species. The overall habitat suitability improved between the early 2000s and early 2010s for seven target species including giant panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca, suggesting positive effects of several recent conservation projects in restoring natural landscapes for certain species groups. However, the current nature reserve system designed for giant pandas did not adequately cover critical landscapes for several species, including the two species who experienced net habitat loss, Endangered forest musk deer Moschus berezovskii and Vulnerble Asiatic black bear Ursus thibetanus. To conserve multiple species simultaneously in this region, we recommend establishing nature reserves for other threatened species who share dissimilar habitat needs with giant panda, and adding a widely distributed omnivores, Asiatic black bear, as a surrogate species in central and southwest China. These findings reveal the risk of using umbrella species as a conservation shortcut in protecting animal communities in China, and have substantial implications for other regions where the majority of the conservation funds are directed toward a single charismatic species.

AB  - Pine plantations established on former heathland are common throughout Western Europe and North America. Such areas can continue to support high biodiversity values of the former heathlands in the more open areas, while simultaneously delivering ecosystem services such as wood production and recreation in the forested areas. Spatially optimizing wood harvest and recreation without threatening the biodiversity values, however, is challenging. Demand for woody biomass is increasing but other pressures on biodiversity including climate change, habitat fragmentation and air pollution are intensifying too. Strategies to spatially optimize different ecosystem services with biodiversity conservation are still underexplored in the research literature. Here we explore optimization scenarios for advancing ecosystem stewardship in a pine plantation in Belgium. Point observations of seven key indicator species were used to estimate habitat suitability using generalized linear models. Based on the habitat suitability and species' characteristics, the spatially-explicit conservation value of different forested and open patches was determined with the help of a spatially-explicit conservation planning tool. Recreational pressure was quantified by interviewing forest managers and with automated trail counters. The impact of wood production and recreation on the conservation of the indicator species was evaluated. We found trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and both wood production and recreation, but were able to present a final scenario that combines biodiversity conservation with a restricted impact on both services. This case study illustrates that innovative forest management planning can achieve better integration of the delivery of different forest ecosystem services such as wood production and recreation with biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Understanding the effect of habitat characteristics on the distribution of threatened species are fundamental in conservation planning and management. Here, we explore the spatial distribution pattern of display site by the North African Houbara Bustard Chlatnydotis undulata undulata males. For this purpose, we examined 81 sites in an area of 255 km(2) located in the Jbil National Park. We hypothesised that in such an area, displaying males prefer sites that may ensure maximum survival, to find a mate and reproduce. We showed that the maximum display-sites density did not exceed 0.04 adult males km(-2) with significant patterns of non-random distribution. The fact that display sites exhibit significant positive spatial autocorrelation, as indicated by Moran's I, is consistent with a lek mating system. We also found a significant relationship between the selection of display sites and the following environmental variables: perennial species covers, annual species covers, percentage of gravel, percentage of other soil surface, plant height, and elevation. Moreover, simultaneous autoregressive models suggest that the inclusion of spatial autocorrelation globally gives better estimates of the regression coefficients.

AB  - Prosopis juliflora is a serious invader, causing great ecological and economic damage in Ethiopia. Thus, it is imperative to examine potential invasion dynamics of P. juliflora at national level under climate change scenario to better influence decision making processes on the management of this invasive species. We derived a consensus model from five modeling approaches to examine the current and future (2050 and 2070) climatic suitability for P. juliflora under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in Ethiopia. Under the current climatic scenario, 94.8% of the country was non-suitable for P. juliflora establishment and invasion while 0.4% (4.56 million ha) was highly suitable. In 2050, highly suitable area for P. juliflora is expected to increase by 55.6% and 63.6%, while moderately suitable area is projected to increase by 33.3% and 42.9% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, respectively. Compared to the current climatic condition, in 2070, highly suitable area for the species is projected to increase by 73.3% (3.43 million ha) and 80.0% (3.65 million ha) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario, respectively. With the current cover, this invasive species had already caused significant impact on rangelands in many parts of the country. Its further expansion would worsen the problem, leading to great environmental and economic damage, thereby threatening the livelihood of the community. Negative environmental and economical impacts caused by the species will be high if preventive and effective management measures are not earnestly taken, and it becomes one of the major challenges for the 21st century pastoralism and their livelihoods. We recommend a national effort be organized towards combating P. juliflora expansion to new areas, especially in regions and protected area predicted as frontiers of potential expansion.

AB  - Human disturbance, social interactions and habitat constraints usually influence the behavior of wild ungulates. Poaching and habitat degradation are threats to the guanaco, a native South-American herbivore adapted to arid environments. Flight and vigilance behaviors, and guanaco-observer distances, were seasonally surveyed in mountain Andean environments, inside a protected area and surroundings. Field surveys and GIS analyses estimated environmental variables. Linear mixed models estimated probability of the mentioned behaviors and distance based on predictions about influences of human disturbance, social interactions, environmental constraints, and their changes over time. Flight and vigilance behaviors and guanaco-observer distance were higher in less protected landscapes, and near urban sites. Flight probability and guanaco-observer distance decreased over the years, being this distance shorter within the protected area. Flight decreased in summer, while vigilance increased. Vigilance was higher in groups with young, and lower in larger groups. Flight and vigilance behaviors were lower in slopes and higher in tall shrublands. These results are in agreement with hypotheses of risk-allocation, learning habituation, fitness maximization, risk detection strategy and foraging hypothesis. Social and environmental influences on guanaco behavior will probably prevail over anthropogenic influences insofar as current efforts to discourage disruptive activities are maintained in these mountain environments.

AB  - Conservation of horseshoe crabs has recently received increasing attention as several populations are in decline. However, scarce information on their distributions in Southeast Asia is impairing conservation efforts. In this study, we sought to improve our understanding of the geographical range and distinct populations of the three Asian horseshoe crabs species in order to identify optimal conservation areas. We mapped the geographic range of Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, Tachypleus gigas, and T tridentatus using recent data from field work, literature, Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and unpublished data from our scientific network. The data were correlated with 23 different environmental variables of potential ecological importance for horseshoe crabs using the openModeller webservices, including new tidal variables. Ecological niche models were generated using two algorithms, Maximum Entropy and support vector machine, for the three species under present conditions, and projected into a climate change scenario of 2050. The niches of the Asian horseshoe crabs were mostly determined by tidal regime, chlorophyll A concentrations, depth, distance to land, and sea surface temperature. According to our predictions, horseshoe crabs in Southeast Asia are not expected to experience any severe change in extent and distribution of suitable habitat in the future. In order to conserve Asian horseshoe crabs, we suggest establishing Marine Protected Areas at locations where distinct populations and several species occur, such as northern Vietnam, China, Borneo, and southern Japan.

AB  - One of the basic questions in spatial ecology is: how much space does a population need to persist? The critical patch-size is the size of the suitable habitat where population gain through reproduction balances population loss through dispersal. The question of how large a certain habitat has to be to support a given population has important applications in conservation biology, e.g., when designing a protected area to ensure the survival of an endangered population. The analysis in this chapter is based on linearization, thereby implicitly assuming that the population growth function has no Allee effect. We explicitly compute the critical size when dispersal is described by a Laplace kernel. We then compare how different dispersal patterns affect this critical size. At the end of the chapter, we consider the class of separable kernels and introduce an approximation method.

AB  - The Pallas's Cat Otocolobus manul is among the rarest mammals of the Caucasus, being recorded only in the 1920-1930s in south-western Armenia and once observed (skin) in 1996 in the neighbouring areas of the Arax basin. For this reason, so far it was considered as regionally extinct in the Caucasus. In this paper we present a recent (January 2020) record of this species in north-eastern Armenia about 140 km away from the nearest historical sites. We provide details of this record and associated habitats, and discuss all published information known so far on the historical occurrence of the species in the Caucasus. We show that only five small areas are suitable for the existence of this species in Armenia. The western limits of Khosrov Forest State Reserve hold the largest tract of suitable habitats. Protected areas play a minor role in Pallas's Cat conservation.

AB  - Habitat models are fundamental tools for designing evidence-based conservation measures, particularly for locating sites with high potential for promoting a species' recolonisation and occupancy. However, it remains challenging to respond to both the need for large-scale general rules, and for fine-scale information concurrently. Multi-level habitat models provide all-in-one surfaces that explicitly account for conditional dependencies among single-level selection probabilities. We integrated occurrence data obtained from citizen-science species observation data with radio-tracking data to develop multi-level resource selection functions for the little owl (Athene noctua), a species of conservation concern in Central Europe. The results of our habitat selection analyses confirmed that suitable little owl habitat is located in widely open agricultural landscapes that often exist in the vicinity of human settlements. We mapped habitats at fine resolution (40 x 40 m) over an area covering 77,313 km(2) in Switzerland and Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. We validated the models with external out-of sample data, and we demonstrated good predictive ability and transferability over the broad landscape. Overall, a fifth of the modelled landscape was estimated to be suitable for little owls. Habitat suitability scores in Switzerland were generally lower than in Baden-Wurttemberg due to higher elevation, fewer orchards, and more forest patches. Extant populations currently occupy c. 15% of the potential suitable habitats in Baden-Wurttemberg, and 2% in Switzerland, suggesting that considerable space for recolonisation is available. However, while Baden-Wurttemberg offers vast open landscapes, lowlands in Switzerland show narrow swaths of habitat along valleys and lakes. We showed that the simultaneous integration of different levels of habitat selection behaviour into a multi-level habitat suitability map creates a promising tool for conservation planning of endangered species over large geographical areas. Our multi-level model allowed for identification of both large-scale habitat suitability patterns to develop conservation strategies, and fine-scale clusters of high quality habitats where conservation measures can be applied at once, thereby increasing relevance of such all-in-one habitat maps for policy makers, wildlife managers and conservations practitioners alike.

AB  - Liquid biofuel production will likely have its greatest impact on biodiversity through the large-scale changes in land use that will be required to meet the production of this energy source. In this study, we develop a framework which integrates species distribution models, land cover, land capability and various biodiversity conservation data to identify natural areas with (i) a potentially high risk of transformation for biofuel production and (ii) potential impact to biodiversity conservation areas. The framework was tested in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, a region which has been earmarked for the cultivation of biofuels. We expressly highlight the importance of biodiversity conservation data that enhance the protected area network to limit potential losses by comparing the overlap of areas likely to become cultivated with (i) protected areas; (ii) biodiversity hot spots not currently protected; and (iii) 'ecological corridors' (areas deemed important for the migration of species and linkages between important biodiversity areas). Results indicate that the introduction of spatial filters reduced available land from 54% to 45%. Including all biodiversity scenarios reduced available land to 15% of the Eastern Cape should avoiding conflict with biodiversity conservation areas be prioritized. The assumption that agriculturally marginal land offers a unique opportunity to be converted to biofuel crops does not consider the biodiversity value attached to these areas. We highlight that decisions relating to large-scale transformation and changes in land cover need to take account of broader ecological processes. Determining the spatial extent of threats to biodiversity facilitates the analysis of spatial conflict. This article demonstrates a proactive approach for anticipating likely habitat transformation and provides an objective means of mitigating potential conflict with existing land use and biodiversity.

AB  - Protected areas are becoming increasingly isolated. River corridors represent crucial links to the surrounding landscape but are also major conduits for invasion of alien species. We developed a framework to assess the risk that alien plants in watersheds adjacent to a protected area will invade the protected area along rivers. The framework combines species- and landscape-level approaches and has five key components: (l) definition of the geographical area of interest, (2) delineation of the domain into ecologically meaningful zones, (3) identification of the appropriate landscape units, (4) categorization of alien species and mapping of their distribution and abundance, and (5) definition of management options. The framework guides the determination of species distribution and abundance through successive, easily followed steps, providing the means for the assessment of areas of concern. We applied the framework to Kruger National Park (KAP) in South Africa. We recorded 231 invasive alien plant species (of which 79 were major invaders) in the domain. The KNP is facing increasing pressure from alien species in the upper regions of the drainage areas of neighboring watersheds. On the basis of the climatic modeling, we showed that most major riparian invaders have the ability to spread across the KNP should they be transported down the rivers, With this information, KNP managers can identify areas for proactive intervention, monitoring, and resource allocation. Even for a very large protected area such as the KNP, sustainable management of biodiversity will depend heavily on the response of land managers upstream managing alien plants. We suggest that this framework is applicable to plants and other passively dispersed species that invade protected areas situated at the end of a drainage basin.

AB  - Understanding habitat selection can be challenging for species surviving in small populations, but is needed for landscape-scale conservation planning.
   We assessed how European bison (Bison bonasus) habitat selection, and particularly forest use, varies across subpopulations and spatial scales.
   We gathered the most comprehensive European bison occurrence dataset to date, from five free-ranging herds in Poland. We compared these data to a high-resolution forest map and modelled the influence of environmental and human-pressure variables on habitat selection.
   Around 65% of European bison occurrences were in forests, with cows showing a slightly higher forest association than bulls. Forest association did not change markedly across spatial scales, yet differed strongly among herds. Modelling European bison habitat suitability confirmed forest preference, but also showed strong differences in habitat selection among herds. Some herds used open areas heavily and actively selected for them. Similarly, human-pressure variables were important in all herds, but some herds avoided human-dominated areas more than others.
   Assessing European bison habitat across multiple herds revealed a more generalist habitat use pattern than when studying individual herds only. Our results highlight that conflicts with land use and people could be substantial if bison are released in human-dominated landscapes. Future restoration efforts should target areas with low road and human population density, regardless of the degree of forest cover. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of considering multiple subpopulations and spatial scales in conservation planning.

AB  - Predictive species distributional models are a cornerstone of wildlife conservation planning. Constructing such models requires robust underpinning science that integrates formerly disparate data types to achieve effective species management. Greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus, hereafter sage-grouse' populations are declining throughout sagebrush-steppe ecosystems in North America, particularly within the Great Basin, which heightens the need for novel management tools that maximize the use of available information. Herein, we improve upon existing species distribution models by combining information about sage-grouse habitat quality, distribution and abundance from multiple data sources. To measure habitat, we created spatially explicit maps depicting habitat selection indices (HSI) informed by >35500 independent telemetry locations from >1600 sage-grouse collected over 15years across much of the Great Basin. These indices were derived from models that accounted for selection at different spatial scales and seasons. A region-wide HSI was calculated using the HSI surfaces modelled for 12 independent subregions and then demarcated into distinct habitat quality classes. We also employed a novel index to describe landscape patterns of sage-grouse abundance and space use (AUI). The AUI is a probabilistic composite of the following: (i) breeding density patterns based on the spatial configuration of breeding leks and associated trends in male attendance; and (ii) year-round patterns of space use indexed by the decreasing probability of use with increasing distance to leks. The continuous AUI surface was then reclassified into two classes representing high and low/no use and abundance.Synthesis and applications. Using the example of sage-grouse, we demonstrate how the joint application of indices of habitat selection, abundance and space use derived from multiple data sources yields a composite map that can guide effective allocation of management intensity across multiple spatial scales. As applied to sage-grouse, the composite map identifies spatially explicit management categories within sagebrush steppe that are most critical to sustaining sage-grouse populations as well as those areas where changes in land use would likely have minimal impact. Importantly, collaborative efforts among stakeholders guide which intersections of habitat selection indices and abundance and space use classes are used to define management categories. Because sage-grouse are an umbrella species, our joint-index modelling approach can help target effective conservation for other sagebrush obligate species and can be readily applied to species in other ecosystems with similar life histories, such as central-placed breeding.

AB  - Climate data created from historic climate observations are integral to most assessments of potential climate change impacts, and frequently comprise the baseline period used to infer species-climate relationships. They are often also central to downscaling coarse resolution climate simulations from General Circulation Models (GCMs) to project future climate scenarios at ecologically relevant spatial scales. Uncertainty in these baseline data can be large, particularly where weather observations are sparse and climate dynamics are complex (e.g. over mountainous or coastal regions). Yet, importantly, this uncertainty is almost universally overlooked when assessing potential responses of species to climate change. Here, we assessed the importance of historic baseline climate uncertainty for projections of species' responses to future climate change. We built species distribution models (SDMs) for 895 African bird species of conservation concern, using six different climate baselines. We projected these models to two future periods (2040-2069, 2070-2099), using downscaled climate projections, and calculated species turnover and changes in species-specific climate suitability. We found that the choice of baseline climate data constituted an important source of uncertainty in projections of both species turnover and species-specific climate suitability, often comparable with, or more important than, uncertainty arising from the choice of GCM. Importantly, the relative contribution of these factors to projection uncertainty varied spatially. Moreover, when projecting SDMs to sites of biodiversity importance (Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas), these uncertainties altered site-level impacts, which could affect conservation prioritization. Our results highlight that projections of species' responses to climate change are sensitive to uncertainty in the baseline climatology. We recommend that this should be considered routinely in such analyses.

AB  - Protected areas are increasingly considered to play a key role in the global maintenance of ecosystem processes and the ecosystem services they provide. It is thus vital to assess the extent to which existing protected area systems represent those services. Here, for the first time, we document the effectiveness of the current Chilean protected area system and its planned extensions in representing both ecosystem services (plant productivity, carbon storage and agricultural production) and biodiversity. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas based on their respective management objectives. Our results show that existing protected areas in Chile do not contain an unusually high proportion of carbon storage (14.9%), agricultural production (0.2%) or biodiversity (11.8%), and also represent a low level of plant productivity (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of 0.38). Proposed additional priority sites enhance the representation of ecosystem services and biodiversity, but not sufficiently to attain levels of representation higher than would be expected for their area of coverage. Moreover, when the species groups were assessed separately, amphibians was the only one well represented. Suggested priority sites for biodiversity conservation, without formal protection yet, was the only protected area category that over-represents carbon storage, agricultural production and biodiversity. The low representation of ecosystem services and species' distribution ranges by the current protected area system is because these protected areas are heavily biased toward southern Chile, and contain large extents of ice and bare rock. The designation and management of proposed priority sites needs to be addressed in order to increase the representation of ecosystem services within the Chilean protected area system.

AB  - Protected areas have a double mandate of both "protection" and "use." Nature-based tourism is considered an effective tool in terms of environmental conservation. Understanding the causes and consequences of a spatiotemporal succession of tourism construction is an important channel to explore the changes of tourism-environment interaction in the protected area. To analyze the spatio-temporal variations in tourism construction lands, we adopted Mt. Bogda as an example. We systematically quantified the interaction between these changes and environmental variables and explored the evolution process of tourism-environment interaction of the mountainous protected area in the northwest arid region. Our results revealed the following: (1) In the Bogda protected area, the proportion of tourism construction lands first appeared to be increasing, then decreasing dramatically, and finally growing slowly. The spatial expansion of tourism construction lands followed the "core-periphery" pattern, respectively showing shapely infilling, reasonable agglomeration, barycenter shift, and outlying growth from 1990 to 2018 as the stages of concentrating on the core. (2) The higher land-use intensity of tourism construction drove the changes of landscape fragmentation, diversity, stability, primitive, and nature degree in the protected area. The coupling coordination between tourism and the environment in the Bogda area decreased at first, and then slowly increased. Meanwhile, tourism did not cause irreversible damage to the natural environment, and the coupling coordination degree between tourism and the environment was still in the state of balanced development. It expressed the states of original balanced, development exceeds environment and barely balanced, and superiorly balanced. The historical evolution of tourism-environment interaction in Bogda reflects the pattern of periodic changes in China's protected areas to a certain extent.

AB  - Marine environmental variables can play an important role in promoting population genetic differentiation in marine organisms. Although fjord ecosystems have attracted much attention due to the great oscillation of environmental variables that produce heterogeneous habitats, species inhabiting this kind of ecosystem have received less attention. In this study, we used Sprattus fuegensis, a small pelagic species that populates the inner waters of the continental shelf, channels and fjords of Chilean Patagonia and Argentina, as a model species to test whether environmental variables of fjords relate to population genetic structure. A total of 282 individuals were analyzed from Chilean Patagonia with eight microsatellite loci. Bayesian and non-Bayesian analyses were conducted to describe the genetic variability of S. fuegensis and whether it shows spatial genetic structure. Results showed two well-differentiated genetic clusters along the Chilean Patagonia distribution (i.e. inside the embayment area called TicToc, and the rest of the fjords), but no spatial isolation by distance (IBD) pattern was found with a Mantel test analysis. Temperature and nitrate were correlated to the expected heterozygosities and explained the allelic frequency variation of data in the redundancy analyses. These results suggest that the singular genetic differences found in S. fuegensis from inside TicToc Bay (East of the Corcovado Gulf) are the result of larvae retention bya combination of oceanographic mesoscale processes (i.e. the west wind drift current reaches the continental shelf exactly in this zone), and the local geographical configuration (i.e. embayment area, islands, archipelagos). We propose that these features generated an isolated area in the Patagonian fjords that promoted genetic differentiation by drift and a singular biodiversity, adding support to the existence of the largest marine protected area (MPA) of continental Chile, which is the Tic-Toc MPA.

AB  - Due to the impact of anthropogenic activities on forest extent and integrity across Madagascar, it is increasingly necessary to assess how endangered lemur populations inhabiting human-dominated forest fragments can effectively sustain themselves ecologically. Our research addresses this concern by exploring how the distribution patterns of a small population of crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus), occupying a degraded forest fragment at Oronjia Forest New Protected Area in northern Madagascar, are impacted by the availability of key ecological and anthropogenic factors. We hypothesize that the distribution of E. coronatus within the fragment is limited by the availability of critical ecological resources and conditions and the intensity of anthropogenic features and activities. To examine this, we used MaxEnt to develop a species distribution model using presence-only occurrence records and 10 independent background covariates detailing the site's ecological and anthropogenic aspects. The results indicate that the realized distribution patterns of E. coronatus within human-dominated forest fragments are strongly associated with sections of forest that contain sparsely and sporadically distributed resources, such as freshwater and continuous hardwood vegetation. We conclude that the distribution of E. coronatus at Oronjia is shaped by their need to maximize foraging opportunities in a degraded forest landscape where they are subject to both environmental and anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Protected areas are a fundamental component of many conservation strategies. They safeguard some of the best examples of unfragmented natural landscapes in many regions, provide important habitat for rare and threatened species, and serve as a refuge from a human-dominated world. As climates continue to change, species distributions, ecological communities, and ecosystems will be altered. An understanding of the trends in these changes can allow protected area managers to develop more effective climate-adaptation strategies. Here, we quantify the relative amount of projected potential climate-driven ecological change across a protected area network by calculating three metrics. We assessed future projected changes in temperature and precipitation, shifts in major vegetation types, and vertebrate species turnover for the protected areas of the Pacific Northwestern region of North America. In general, the degree of projected change in the three metrics followed a longitudinal gradient from the Pacific coast inland toward the continental interior. Protected areas expected to experience the least change are at low elevations near the coast and throughout the Coastal Mountains, whereas areas expected to experience the most change are found at higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin regions. The resulting spatial variation in these impact measures underscores the importance of developing appropriate, location-specific, climate-adaptation strategies in response to disparate trends in future environmental change.

AB  - In Nepal, the red panda (Ailurus fulgens) has been sparsely studied, although its range covers a wide area. The present study was carried out in the previously untapped Chitwan Annapurna Landscape (CHAL) situated in central Nepal with an aim to explore current distributional status and identify key habitat use. Extensive field surveys conducted in 10 red panda range districts were used to estimate species distribution by presence-absence occupancy modeling and to predict distribution by presence-only modeling. The presence of red pandas was recorded in five districts: Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Myagdi, Baglung and Dhading. The predictive distribution model indicated that 1,904.44 km(2) of potential red panda habitat is available in CHAL with the protected area covering nearly 41% of the total habitat. The habitat suitability analysis based on the probability of occurrence showed only 16.58% (A = 315.81 km(2)) of the total potential habitat is highly suitable. Red Panda occupancy was estimated to be around 0.0667, indicating nearly 7% (218 km(2)) of the total habitat is occupied with an average detection probability of 0.4482 +/- 0.377. Based on the habitat use analysis, altogether eight variables including elevation, slope, aspect, proximity to water sources, bamboo abundance, height, cover, and seasonal precipitation were observed to have significant roles in the distribution of red pandas. In addition, 25 tree species were documented from red panda sign plots out of 165 species recorded in the survey area. Most common was Betula utilis followed by Rhododendron spp. and Abies spectabilis. The extirpation of red pandas in previously reported areas indicates a need for immediate action for the long-term conservation of this species in CHAL.

AB  - Ephedra equisetina, the Nitraria species complex (N. sibirica, N. roborowskii and N. sphaerocarpa), and Rheum nanum are the main dietary plants of the Gobi Bear (Ursus arctos gobiensis), a subspecies of the brown bear, found in the Gobi desert of Mongolia. Their location and distribution range are closely related to the Gobi Bear survival. Analyzing the impact of climate change on the possible distribution of these species is essential for the future conservation and management of the Gobi Bear. In this study, we modeled the current and future distribution of the main dietary plants of the Gobi Bear based on one representative concentration pathway (RCP2.6) for the period from 2041 to 2060 (2050s) and 2061-2080 (2070s) using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model. Our results showed that the precipitation-associated variables had the strongest effect on the distributions of these species. Among these variables, the precipitation of the coldest quarter (Bio19) was the most important variable affecting the suitability of the habitats. Under the current climate conditions, the areas of the highly suitable (>0.6) habitat for E. equisetina, the Nitraria species complex, and R. nanum were 3,888.51, 23,727.78 and 13,816.88 km(2), respectively, accounting for 8%, 52% and 30% of the Great Gobi "A" Strictly Protected Area. In the year 2050s and 2070s, the highly suitable habitat areas for E. equisetina and R. nanum will continue to increase and eventually reach to 23% and 36%, respectively. The Nitraria species complex would first be reduced to 33% in the 2050s and then increase to 36% in the 2070s. With the climate warming, the highly suitable habitats of the Gobi Bear's main dietary plants would shift to the southeast. These results, together with previous studies about the Gobi Bear distribution can provide useful information and a reasonable reference for managers to put forward suggestions for better protection of the Gobi Bear.

AB  - Ecological and environmental variables play a major role in the genetic structure of marine populations, but how oceanography affects their dispersal and associated connectivity remains far from being understood. To account for the effect of different dispersal strategies in terms of pelagic larvae and non-pelagic reproduction, we utilize the power of comparative phylogeographic analyses of five phylogenetically and functionally diverse intertidal species along the west coast of South Africa using population genetics and biophysical models within the Benguela Current system. Some broadcast spawners exhibit genetic panmixia, others show genetic structure similar to direct-developing species, suggesting complex recruitment patterns in rocky shore environments. Patterns of genetic structure do not correspond with pelagic larval competency period, with a broadcast spawning urchin displaying the highest levels of population structure. Biophysical models of larval dispersal reveal mixed dispersal patterns, with the strongest connections in a northward direction following the Benguela Current, yet most modeled species also show the capacity for southward (albeit weaker) migration among some sample localities. Some sites, particularly the most northern areas, show very low levels of potential connectivity. Lastly, we synthesized our results to highlight key areas for the development of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that capture the evolutionary patterns of marine species of the west coast and find that the results from our molecular and biophysical analyses are coherent with previous suggestions for a network of protected areas.

AB  - Tropical protected area management strategies have traditionally been heavily skewed towards high carbon, primary forests. This focus can result in areas, such as heavily logged forests, being viewed as low quality and thus offered up for conversion. We assessed the importance of intact to heavily logged forests for the Bornean elephant in the Malaysian state of Sabah. By modelling distributions of elephants throughout Sabah based on GPS telemetry tracking of 29 individuals and airborne three-dimensional forest mapping, we present the most wide-scale analysis of forest use by Bomean elephants to date. Forests of 13 m in stature were found to be of highest suitability for elephants, especially when these areas were flat and low lying. Forest statures of this order are consistent with degraded landscapes, often viewed as suitable for oil palm conversion. Less than a quarter of fully-protected intact forests in Sabah were of suitable stature for elephants, whereas disturbed commercial forest reserves were found to be highly suitable. We suggest that the importance of degraded landscapes for the future of elephants is currently underestimated, and thus, the need for the preservation of such habitats is not seen as a priority. The loss of these landscapes to large-scale agriculture could prove detrimental to the longevity of the species in Borneo.

AB  - 1. Applications of graph-theoretic connectivity are increasing at an exponential rate in ecology and conservation. Here, limitations of these measures are summarized.
   2. Graph-theoretic connectivity measures are fundamentally limited as they require specification of a habitat quality threshold to allow definition of habitat patches (nodes). Frequently, a second threshold (critical dispersal distance) is applied in the identification of graph edges.
   3. Graph-theoretic measures are poorly applicable to large-scale, high-resolution, grid-based data that describe distributions of species in habitats of varying quality.
   4. Graph-theoretic connectivity primarily concerns the emigration-immigration component of spatial population-dynamics. Therefore, it cannot alone answer questions about the regional population size, resilience or persistence of a focal species.
   5. Synthesis and applications: Conservation managers in particular should appreciate these limitations before applying graph-theoretic analysis to spatial conservation planning.

AB  - Spatial conservation tools usually focus on identifying areas having species groups of interest. Consequently, there is a need to identify the main factors influencing the concentration of species (hotspots) and their locations. We asked: whether existing strictly protected areas are efficient to cover the main regional biodiversity hotspots; what characteristics are associated with hotspot arrangement; what is the minimal distance from a biodiversity research center needed to cover the main biodiversity amount. We analyzed factors influencing the spatial arrangement of 164 threatened plant species in the Republic of Mordovia (European Russia). To quantify species distribution, we used a grid mapping approach using 100 km(2) quadrats. We identified four biodiversity research centers (BDRC) of threatened plant species in the study area, including two protected areas, the town of Saransk, and a regional key conservation area. About 50% of species and species locations were concentrated within a 24-km radius around BDRCs. From our results, buffer zones of protected areas should have a 5-10 km width and the establishment of new protected areas should be preceded by the identification of regional biodiversity hotspots. Additionally, the correctness of protected area arrangement with plant species richness in a region should be tested.

AB  - Threatspots are defined as areas having a high diversity of rare and threatened species. The paper examines whether or not threatspots for a particular taxon coincide with threatspots for other taxa at the regional level in Greece. A simple formula of conservation value is used to determine areas that are most biologically rich in threatened species in Greece using bird, mammal and plant species distribution data, available from the European Union's CORINE-biotopes database. The identification of a threatspot is dependent on the quality (essentially the spatial resolution) of species' distribution data. The threatspot for a taxonomic group contains a significant proportion of the species of the other groups. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Robust design of Marine Protected Areas in ocean environments is often challenging due to inadequate knowledge of biodiversity patterns, reflecting difficulties in the prediction of species distributions from sampling data that are often sparse or inadequate. Models that combine species and environmental data, such as Gradient Forests (GF), provide one analytical approach to this problem, efficiently combining available information to produce spatial models of species turnover throughout an area of interest. Spatial estimates of species turnover can then be classified to estimate spatial patterns in species composition; however, the performance of GF-based classifications within a conservation planning context has not previously been evaluated. Here we assess the utility for conservation planning (using the software Zonation) of a GF-based hierarchical classification that summarises spatial patterns in demersal fish composition in the oceans around New Zealand. Progressively more complex Zonation analyses assessed the effects of (i) varying the number of classification groups, (ii) adding information describing species turnover, and (iii) adding information describing spatial variation in demersal fish species richness. The best-performing GF-based conservation ranking used layers describing the distributions of 30 classification groups, demersal fish species turnover between these groups, and species richness. Conservation outcomes from this ranking were only marginally less efficient than those from a more conventional ranking that used 217 individual species distribution layers (7% less efficient). This indicates that GF-based classifications may provide a practical alternative for marine conservation planning. Additional advantages arise from the greater ease with which a single classification layer summarising complex biodiversity patterns can facilitate decision-making in participatory stakeholder processes.

AB  - Infectious diseases are important in the dynamics of many wildlife populations, but there is limited understanding of how landscape change influences susceptibility to disease.
   We aimed to quantify the time-delayed influence of spatial and temporal components of landscape change and climate variability on the prevalence of chlamydiosis in koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) populations in southeast Queensland, Australia.
   We used data collected over 14 years (n = 9078 records) from a koala hospital along with time-lagged measures of landscape change and rainfall to conduct spatial and temporal analyses of the influence of landscape and environmental variables on prevalence of chlamydiosis and koala body condition.
   Areas with more suitable habitat were associated with higher levels of disease prevalence and better body condition, indicating that koalas were less likely to be impacted by chlamydiosis. More intact landscapes with higher proportions of total habitat are associated with a reduction in prevalence of chlamydiosis and a decrease in body condition. Increased annual rainfall contributed to a decrease in prevalence of chlamydiosis and an increase in body condition. Urbanization was associated with an increase in disease, however the effects of urban landscape change and climate variability on chlamydiosis may not manifest until several years later when overt disease impacts the population via effects upon body condition and reproductive success.
   Our study highlights the importance of effects of landscape change and climate variability on disease prevalence in wildlife. This recognition is essential for long-term conservation planning, especially as disease often interacts with other threats.

AB  - The West Himalayan Yew (Taxus contorta Griff.) is an extremely important tree species as its bark and leaves are the source of the anti-cancer medicine Taxol (R) used in chemotherapy for the treatment of a number of different cancers. Unfortunately, the species is endangered because of unsustainable harvesting and over grazing coupled with a very low natural regeneration potential. The Maxent modelling algorithm was used to model the ecological niche and predict the habitat suitability of this species in the Western Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh. The purpose of the modelling was basically to restore the species in its native habitat. The model output had a reasonable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.905. The jackknife test showed that the land cover and the annual mean temperature were the most important environmental predictors that individually affected the information gain. The results suggested that the Great Himalayan National Park Conservation Area had the highest area (134.14 km(2)) under the very highly suitable category. Being an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category II protected area, it would be an ideal place to preserve and reintroduce the species. Among Wildlife Sanctuaries, the Kais Wildlife Sanctuary had the highest proportion of its area (92.46%) under very highly suitable category for T. contorta. Additionally, Churdhar and Tirthan Wildlife Sanctuaries are predicted to have more than 60% of their geographic areas as very highly suitable for the species. Overall, only 6% of the geographic area of Himachal Pradesh was predicted to be very highly suitable.

AB  - It is generally accepted that biodiversity will be better protected from anthropogenic disturbances after a region has been designated as a protected area. However, this common perception is not true in the case of the Yancheng Biosphere Reserve (YBR), which is widely regarded as the largest wintering habitat in the world for red-crowned cranes. Combining previous information with multisource remote sensing data, this study constructed a highly accurate habitat suitability index (HSI) model and produced a series of HSI hierarchical maps to fill in the blanks of long-term monitoring and regular data acquisition in the YBR. Based on the integrated methods of geographic information system analysis, landscape indices, and redundancy analysis, this study characterized the entire process of shrinkage and deterioration of the habitats of red-crowned cranes and revealed the underlying driving forces. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) The total area of suitable and secondary suitable habitats decreased significantly, from 43.3 to 24.6%, during 1991-2013, and suitable habitats became increasingly concentrated in the core zone. (2) The ecological quality of the habitats was significantly degraded, as reflected by increasing fragmentation, isolation, and scattering of suitable and secondary suitable habitats, as well as by expansion and aggregation of marginal suitable and unsuitable habitats. (3) The extensive transformation of the original natural wetlands to aquafarms is the main reason for habitat shrinkage, with construction of buildings and overall increased intensity of human activity being significantly responsible for the ecological deterioration.

AB  - Many cetacean species are at risk from anthropogenic disturbances including climate change, pollution, and habitat degradation. Identifying cetacean hotspots for conservation management is therefore required. Aotearoa-New Zealand waters are used by 53% of the world's cetacean species and are a global cetacean diversity hotspot. Using geographic predictions of cetacean taxa, we aimed to identify important areas within New Zealand waters using two methods: estimates of cetacean richness and a spatial prioritization analysis. For both methods, we investigated how varying levels of uncertainty in predictions of the taxa' occurrence layers would affect our interpretation of cetacean hotspots. Despite some marked spatial differences in distribution of important areas for cetacean diversity, both methods, across all uncertainty scenarios, highlighted six distinct deep offshore regions as important habitat. Generally, inshore areas had lower richness estimates than offshore areas, but these remain important for conservation for species with limited ranges (e.g., the endemic Maui and Hector's dolphins), and in some places had similar richness values to offshore hotspots. Furthermore, inshore hotspots had lower uncertainty in predicted taxa distribution and richness estimates. The use of two different uncertainty estimates allows the integration of distributional information from differing sources (different modeling methods with varying numbers of cetacean records) to be integrated in a robust and conservative way. Identification of cetacean hotspots with varying levels of uncertainty provides a robust and efficient step toward prioritizing areas for conservation management in a participatory process.

AB  - The crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), a species at the brink of extinction in 1981, remain restricted to a small (25 km radius) area of temperate forests in central China. To improve the chances of successful reintroduction into new areas we developed a multifactor logistic regression model of habitat association at multiple scales. Using habitat variables, i.e. vegetation, human impact, elevation, and wetland, we compared occupied and unoccupied sites at grain sizes ranging from I to 6400 ha. The goodness-of-fit of the habitat suitability model depended on grain size, with the best fit (most information) at a grain size of 2 ha. Semivariograms showed the habitat variables at control sites have a gradient pattern, yet the crested ibis had their specific habitat preferences, and only selected a narrow range from the available gradient. Our results indicated that spatial scale needs to be considered in developing habitat models for applications such as conservation planning.

AB  - The Landscape Species Approach is a framework developed by the Wildlife Conservation Society for planning landscape-scale conservation based on a suite of focal species. The approach has so far been implemented at 12 terrestrial and two marine sites. We demonstrate the approach using two sites, the Adirondack Park, USA, and San Guillermo-Laguna Brava Landscape, Argentina. We describe the spatially explicit components, including steps to map the attainable (Biological Landscape), current, and future distribution of Landscape Species, human activities (Human Landscapes) and their impacts on Landscape Species, the possible impacts of conservation actions (Conservation Landscapes), and a procedure to set spatial conservation priorities. We discuss advantages and innovations of the approach, including how it incorporates both vulnerability of biodiversity and possible recovery. Finally, we discuss improvements that can be made to the approach, costs, and implications for conservation at the two sites.

AB  - Prediction of invasive species distributions from survey data is widely recognized as a significant component of forest management and conservation planning. Leucaena leucocephala is the most aggressive invasive shrub and tree in the Hengchun peninsula in southern Taiwan. We analyzed geo-referenced data to identify potential variables of invasion and to predict likelihood of further invasion using boosted regression trees. Our results, which classified 92% of the cells correctly with regard to species presence and absence, indicated probability of invasion is correlated with climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation), landscape features (altitude; slope ratio and aspect; percentages of natural or secondary forest, agriculture land, developed area, and water bodies; and distances to the nearest forest edge and river), and anthropogenic factors (length of forest edge, and distances to the nearest road and agriculture land). The most influential variables are average annual temperature, altitude, piecipitation, and slope. Continued range expansion by L. leucocephala is most likely to proceed (1) from the eastern and western portions toward the central portion of Hengchun township and (2) throughout the southern and toward the eastern portions of Manjhou township. Our model should provide useful information to aid forest managers in the development of long term monitoring and control strategies for L. leucocephala, in the early detection and eradication of newly established invasions, and also a framework for the integration and analysis of new presence and absence field data as they become available.

AB  - Few studies on fish assemblages and relations with environmental factors in aquatic systems in southeastern Amazonia have been carried out when compared to other areas in the Amazon. Therefore, which are the main environmental variables and processes responsible for structuring them remains unknown. We hypothesized that fish assemblages respond the variation in the physical-chemistry variables between seasons of the hydrological cycle in a pristine river in the Amazon. The study was performed on fish assemblages of the Taruma River, Jaru Biological Reserve, Rondonia. Samplings were carried out in five sites along the river in March and September, 2015, which included fish collection and environmental data measurements. Principal component analysis was performed to ordinate the sites in high water and low water seasons, according to environmental variables. We used a similarity analysis in order to identify the individual contribution of species in hydrological period and a partial redundancy analysis for quantify the relative importance of environmental variables in the species composition. As predicted by our hypothesis, the species composition was influenced by dissolved oxygen and temperature. Myloplus rubripinnis, Serrasalmus compressus, and S. rhombeus were the most abundant during high water, while S. rhombeus, Myloplus lobatus, Prochilodus nigricans, and Hydrolycus armatus were the dominant species during the low water.

AB  - Many hornbill species in Thailand are categorized as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The objectives of this research were to predict hornbill distributions in Thailand and to assess the national conservation status of the species using extent of occurrence. We employed maximum entropy modelling, using 10 environmental variables that were believed to directly or indirectly influence hornbill distributions across Thailand, to predict the habitats potentially suitable for 10 of the country's 13 hornbill species. Data on the presence of hornbills were gathered from the Thailand Hornbill Project and additional field surveys in protected area complexes during 2004-2006. The results indicated that patch size is the most important factor affecting distribution, followed by latitude, ecoregion and distance to villages. All hornbill species were predicted to occur primarily in intact protected area complexes. The total extent of all hornbill habitats covers 9.3% of the country's land area. Seven of the 10 modelled species are at risk and the current distribution pattern is expected to reflect stochastic extinctions because of small population size. We recommend that the conservation status of Austen's brown hornbill Anorrhinus austeni and Tickell's brown hornbill Anorrhinus tickelli should be changed from Vulnerable to Endangered. The model identified five protected area complexes as hornbill hotspots in Thailand. These findings will help guide conservation management.

AB  - P>1. Where populations are confined to fragmented, human-dominated landscapes, preventing declines and extirpations will often rely on metapopulation management. Spatially-explicit population viability analyses provide tools to evaluate how well the local management efforts can be combined to conserve metapopulations across large areas. Yet, metapopulation models have rarely been combined with tools to assess the cost-effectiveness of different conservation strategies.
   2. European bison Bison bonasus only occur in small, fragmented populations, making their long-term survival dependent on establishing a metapopulation across eastern Europe. We parameterized a European bison metapopulation model based on time-series of bison demography and a habitat suitability map to assess the viability of bison populations in the Carpathians and the relative cost-effectiveness of (i) reintroductions, (ii) wildlife overpasses and (iii) anti-poaching measures in establishing a viable bison metapopulation.
   3. Our results suggest that the Carpathians could support a viable metapopulation of European bison provided that active efforts are taken to safeguard bison and connect isolated herds. With such steps, our model forecasts that bison numbers could increase substantially over the next 100 years as local populations increase and bison recolonize parts of the Carpathians.
   4. Reintroductions appear to be the most cost-effective approach for establishing a viable bison metapopulation among our scenarios, especially when coupled with wildlife overpasses to improve connectivity among herds. The most promising region for a bison metapopulation in the Carpathians was south-eastern Poland, Ukraine and northern Romania. We identified several candidate regions for reintroductions and wildlife overpasses, especially in the border region of Romania and Ukraine. Site-specific assessments of both habitat suitability, and the costs and benefits of a large bison population, should target those regions.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight how careful conservation planning can identify solutions to preserve large mammals in human-dominated landscapes. Choosing the most effective option from a range of management strategies is a central challenge for wildlife managers. We have shown that incorporating cost-effectiveness analyses into metapopulation models can elucidate the relative value (gain per unit cost) of different conservation management options, allowing decision makers to choose cost-effective options to preserve large mammals. Our model projections also provide hope for establishing a viable free-ranging European bison population in the Carpathians, one of the last relatively wild areas in Europe.

AB  - Tidal flats throughout the Yellow and Bohai Seas provide essential habitat for migrating shorebirds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Land reclamation threatens this habitat. Using bird-sighting data and environmental variables, we identify areas appropriate for prioritized protection for 46 shorebird species, using a MaxEnt species distribution model and Zonation protection planning software. We also assess changes in habitat status and conservation importance of tidal flats along the Rudong and Dongtai coasts, Jiangsu Province, a significant shorebird biodiversity area recently inscribed as a World Heritage site. A priority area of 4523 km(2), containing more saltpan and aquaculture areas than tidal flats, and more than 90% of all tidal flat areas in the priority area, is identified, of which only 12.05% is currently protected within existing National Nature Reserves. Tidal flats along the Rudong and Dongtai coasts have decreased in area from 2000 to 2015, and particularly from 2010 to 2015 at a rate nine times that for 2000-2010. An irreplaceability index for coastal habitat for Xiaoyangkou, Rudong county, increased from 2012 to 2015, signaling a need for urgent habitat management and protection, such as afforded by establishing new nature reserves. Effective management and restoration of saltpan and aquaculture habitat in Bohai and Laizhou bays is also necessary.

AB  - Introduction: Understanding how species respond to climate change is critical for implementing conservation strategies. Objective: We explain through potential distributions and changes in altitudinal variation, the possible impacts of climate change in an endangered micro-endemic rodent of Mexico with narrow altitudinal range, Heteromys nelsoni and a rodent with a wide distributional and altitudinal range, Heteromys goldmani. Methods: We obtained historical and current records of both Heteromys species. Potential distribution models were generated using Maxent, including altitudes for each species and bioclimatic layers. We determined the Extent of Occurrence and Area of Occupancy for H. nelsoni according to the criteria of the 1UCN in order to generate information about its risk status. Results: The altitude is not a variable that determines a shift in the distribution caused by climate change. In contrast, the temperature and precipitation are important for the potential distribution of both Heteromys species. The future changes in climatic conditions could reduce the area of suitable habitat for both species. Conclusions: The distribution surface is not greater than 33.44 km(2) for H. nelsoni. Therefore, is urgent to re-evaluate their conservation status by the IUCN, mainly in its B criterion, and to take specific actions for their conservation. We suggest the creation of a terrestrial protected area.

AB  - Scale is a vital component to consider in ecological research, and spatial resolution or grain size is one of its key facets. Species distribution models (SDMs) are prime examples of ecological research in which grain size is an important component. Despite this, SDMs rarely explicitly examine the effects of varying the grain size of the predictors for species with different niche breadths. To investigate the effect of grain size and niche breadth on SDMs, we simulated four virtual species with different grain sizes/niche breadths using three environmental predictors (elevation, aspect, and percent forest) across two real landscapes of differing heterogeneity in predictor values. We aggregated these predictors to seven different grain sizes and modeled the distribution of each of our simulated species using MaxEnt and GLM techniques at each grain size. We examined model accuracy using the AUC statistic, Pearson's correlations of predicted suitability with the true suitability, and the binary area of presence determined from suitability above the maximum true skill statistic (TSS) threshold. Habitat specialists were more accurately modeled than generalist species, and the models constructed at the grain size from which a species was derived generally performed the best. The accuracy of models in the homogenous landscape deteriorated with increasing grain size to a greater degree than models in the heterogenous landscape. Variable effects on the model varied with grain size, with elevation increasing in importance as grain size increased while aspect lost importance. The area of predicted presence was drastically affected by grain size, with larger grain sizes over predicting this value by up to a factor of 14. Our results have implications for species distribution modeling and conservation planning, and we suggest more studies include analysis of grain size as part of their protocol.

AB  - The environmental characteristics of the Taiwan Strait (TS) have been linked to variations in the abundance and distribution of greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) populations. Greater amberjack is a commercially and ecologically valuable species in ecosystems, and its spatial distribution patterns are pivotal to fisheries management and conservation. However, the relationship between the catch rates of S. dumerili and the environmental changes and their impact on fish communities remains undetermined in the TS. The goal of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of S. dumerili with environmental characteristics in the TS from south to north (20 degrees N-29 degrees N and 115 degrees E-127 degrees E), applying generalized additive models (GAMs) and spatiotemporal fisheries data from logbooks and voyage data recorders from Taiwanese fishing vessels (2014-2017) as well as satellite-derived remote sensing environmental data. We used the generalized linear model (GLM) and GAM to analyze the effect of environmental factors and catch rates. The predictive performance of the two statistical models was quantitatively assessed by using the root mean square difference. Results reveal that the GAM outperforms the GLM model in terms of the functional relationship of the GAM for generating a reliable predictive tool. The model selection process was based on the significance of model terms, increase in deviance explained, decrease in residual factor, and reduction in Akaike's information criterion. We then developed a species distribution model based on the best GAMs. The deviance explained indicated that sea surface temperature, linked to high catch rates, was the key factor influencing S. dumerili distributions, whereas mixed layer depth was the least relevant factor. The model predicted a relatively high S. dumerili catch rate in the northwestern region of the TS in summer, with the area extending to the East China Sea. The target species is strongly influenced by biophysical environmental conditions, and potential fishing areas are located throughout the waters of the TS. The findings of this study showed how S. dumerili populations respond to environmental variables and predict species distributions. Data on the habitat preferences and distribution patterns of S. dumerili are essential for understanding the environmental conditions of the TS, which can inform future priorities for conservation planning and management.

AB  - The black spider monkey Ateles fusciceps is categorized by the IUCN as Critically Endangered (CR) and it is estimated that more than 80 % of the population has been reduced in the last 45 years due to deforestation and hunting pressures. The scarce information about their presence and the current state of their populations prevents local efforts towards the conservation of this species. Here, we report a sighting of A. fusciceps in a non suitable habitat (1778 m) within Las Orquideas National Natural Park in northwestern Colombia, which raises attention on the need to focus conservation strategies within this protected area and increase direct efforts for the monitoring of their populations, habitat restoration and reduction of hunting pressures in optimal areas (<850 m) for the survival of the species.

AB  - Delineating priority areas for highly mobile marine megafauna represents a major challenge for conservation biology. To manage such areas, one must understand both their spatial properties (i.e., location, number, extent), and the level of exposure to a number of given pressures. Here, we used a combination of ensemble distribution models, field-based validation methods and a cumulative effect assessment to illustrate key foraging sites and risk hotspots for adult loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, in the Mediterranean Sea. We found that foraging sites covered about 10% of the neritic zone of the Mediterranean basin. We identified sites which are well recognized by scientists, but also other areas for which our knowledge on the potential importance is limited. The patterns of the habitat use generated by field data validated the accuracy of the distribution model. About one fifth of the foraging areas hosted in the Mediterranean could be considered as hotspots of risk, characterized by high or very high exposure to cumulative pressures. Our results suggest that management and conservation efforts should continue to be held at key, well-known foraging grounds of adult sea turtles (e.g., Northern Adriatic Sea, Tunisian Plateau) but there are several more potential sites (e.g., parts of the Aegean Sea and the Western Mediterranean) which deserve our attention in order to ensure viable populations.

AB  - Protected areas worldwide are facing increasing pressures to co-manage human development and biodiversity conservation. One strategy for managing multiple uses within and around protected areas is zoning, an approach in which spatial boundaries are drawn to distinguish areas with varying degrees of allowable human impacts. However, zoning designations are rarely evaluated for their efficacy using empirical data related to both human and biodiversity characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of zoning designations, we developed an integrated approach. The approach was calibrated empirically using data from Wolong Nature Reserve, a flagship protected area for the conservation of endangered giant pandas in China. We analyzed the spatial distribution of pandas, as well as human impacts (roads, houses, tourism infrastructure, livestock, and forest cover change) with respect to zoning designations in Wolong. Results show that the design of the zoning scheme could be improved to account for pandas and their habitat, considering the amount of suitable habitat outside of the core zone (area designated for biodiversity conservation). Zoning was largely successful in containing houses and roads to their designated experimental zone, but was less effective in containing livestock and was susceptible to boundary adjustments to allow for tourism development. We identified focus areas for potential zoning revision that could better protect the panda population without significantly compromising existing human settlements. Our findings highlight the need for evaluating the efficacy of zoning in other protected areas facing similar challenges with balancing human needs and conservation goals, not only in China but also around the world.

AB  - New populations of endangered plants may establish outside of protected areas if a suitable habitat becomes available. However, it is unclear whether such populations are genetically uniform, as a result of a founder effect, or whether they contain genetic variation resulting from continuous gene flow from source populations, and subsequent recruitment after establishment. We addressed this by examining haplotype variation in the endangered orchid,Anacamptis robusta, which has formed a new population outside of its protected area within the past 20 years. To assess population growth, the number ofA. robustaflowering plants were counted every year for 22 years in both the new population and populations within the reserve. Haplotype diversity and fine-scale structure were examined with spatial autocorrelation analysis, both in the new population and representative populations from the protected area. The number of flowering individuals in the new population increased from 9 to 2,277 between 2003 and 2012, whereas within the reserve flowering population sizes varied between years. Seventeen of 23 haplotypes detected forA. robustawere detected in the new population, with seven of these occurring more frequently in the new population than reserve populations. In the new population, there was strong fine-scale spatial structure of haplotypes, similar to patterns found in large populations from the protected area, suggesting multiple colonization events and subsequent local recruitment. This highlights that ongoing demographic and genetic monitoring of plant populations is vital to improve our understanding of population colonization and the conservation of narrow endemics.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are empirical models relating species occurrence to environmental variables based on statistical or other response surfaces. Species distribution modeling can be used as a tool to solve many theoretical and applied ecological and environmental problems, which include testing biogeographical, ecological and evolutionary hypotheses, assessing species invasion and climate change impact, and supporting conservation planning and reserve selection. The utility of SDM in real world applications requires the knowledge of the model's accuracy. The accuracy of a model includes two aspects: discrimination capacity and reliability. The former is the power of the model to differentiate presences from absences; and the latter refers to the capability of the predicted probabilities to reflect the observed proportion of sites occupied by the subject species.
   Similar methodology has been used for model accuracy assessment in different fields, including medical diagnostic test, weather forecasting and machine learning, etc. Some accuracy measures are used in all fields, e.g. the overall accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; while the use of other measures is largely restricted to specific fields, e.g. F-measure is mainly used in machine learning field, or is referred to by different names in different fields, e.g. "true skill statistic" is used in atmospheric science and it is called "Youden's J" in medical diagnostic field. In this paper we review those accuracy measures typically used in ecology. Generally, the measures can be divided into two groups: threshold-dependent and threshold-independent. Measures in the first group are used for binary predictions, and those in the second group are used for continuous predictions. Continuous predictions may be transformed to binary ones if a specific threshold is employed. In such cases, the threshold-dependent accuracy measures can also be used.
   The threshold-dependent indices used in or introduced to SDM field include overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, odds ratio, true skill statistic, F-measure, Cohen's kappa, and normalized mutual information (NMI). However, since NMI only measures the agreement between two patterns, it cannot differentiate the worse-than-random models from the better-than-random models, which reduces its utility as an accuracy measure.
   The threshold-independent indices used in or introduced to the SDM field include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Gini index, and point biserial correlation coefficient. The proportion of explained deviance D-2 and its adjusted form have been also introduced into SDM field. But this adjusted metric has no theoretical foundation in the context of generalized linear modeling. Therefore, we provide another adjusted form, which was proposed by H. V. Houwelingen based on the asymptotic chi(2) distribution of the log-likelihood statistics. Its superiority over other related measures has been found through previous simulation studies. We also provide another analogous measure, the coefficient of determination R-2, which has had a long history in weather forecast verification and was also recommended for use in medical diagnosis. Though these measures D-2 and R-2 are routinely used to evaluate generalized linear models (GLMs), we argue that nothing prevents them from being applied to other GLM-like models.
   In SDM accuracy assessment, discrimination capacity is often considered, but model reliability is frequently ignored. The primary reason for this is that no reliability measure has been introduced into the ecological literature. To meet this need we also suggest that root mean square error be used as a reliability measure. Its squared form, mean square error, has been used in meteorology for a long time, and is called Brier's score. We also discuss the effect of prevalence dependence of accuracy measures and the precision of accuracy estimates.

AB  - Octopus cyanea is a species of particular economic importance for coastal regions in the tropical Indo-Pacific, including the Mauritian island of Rodrigues. At present, little is known about their habitat preferences and how this may impact on their abundance from fishing pressure. This study aimed to investigate how the abundance of this octopus and their potential den sites differed between three areas of Rodrigues lagoon, Mauritius which were subjected to differing levels of fishing pressure and in which other marine species competed for the same space. A series of surveys over two months was conducted to measure octopus numbers, counted holes and abundance of selected invertebrates in 1000 m(2) belt transects, In total, 503 holes were counted that would be suitable for octopuses, and 17 octopuses were observed within the holes. A highly fished lagoon area, contained the most potential den holes. The other organisms found in the counted holes were fish, including eels, urchins and holothurians. I attribute the seemingly low abundance of octopus compared to previous surveys overall to the time of year and the lack of suitable habitat within these areas. Octopus abundance throughout the lagoon is low despite it being within a Marine Protected Area and does not follow the expected patterns of abundance when subjected to differing levels of fishing pressure, that is, it was expected that more would be found in the best protected area. Application of improved knowledge of octopus biology and habitat preferences could provide better management plans for their protection.

AB  - Ecological concepts and data may justify the selection of biodiversity conservation plans among different options, but can also lead to poor conservation guidelines if not properly used. The use and meaning of the 'surrogate' concept in ecology and conservation planning contexts is a typical example. Surrogates are entities such as species, environmental variables or habitats, which are used to represent a target entity such as genes, species, ecosystems or related metrics. 'Pattern-based surrogacy' identifies effective surrogates using statistical congruence, while 'selection-based surrogacy' identifies effective surrogates through a notional conservation plan or prioritization analysis where sites are added to a set of protected areas, often using a complementarity criterion between sites. With this clear framework in mind, an investigation of the coral reef literature revealed that most published studies on surrogates of reef biodiversity refer in fact to pattern-based surrogates. Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with both approaches. However, efficient pattern-based surrogates are often recommended for conservation planning, implying that they could be efficient selection-based surrogates. In fact, efficient pattern-based surrogates are not necessarily efficient selection-based surrogates and vice versa. The reason is the complementarity rules used by selection algorithms. We call for more clarity from authors on the context in which effective surrogates have to be used, and more caution from managers when surrogates are to be used in conservation plans.

AB  - Freshwater systems and their associated biodiversity are among the most threatened ecosystems globally. The greatest threats to freshwater fishes are the introduction and spread of non-native species, pollution, habitat degradation and loss, and overexploitation. While many regions across the world contain extensive networks of protected areas, these are largely ineffective for protecting riverine systems and their biodiversity. This is because they were designed with the aim of prioritising conservation of terrestrial biodiversity, with limited or no consideration for aquatic systems. The Cape Fold Ecoregion, located within the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa, is home to the highest percentage of threatened freshwater fishes in the country. The region has an extensive protected area network that protects a wide array of ecosystems, but limited information exists on the role of protected areas in conserving the endemic freshwater fish fauna of this region. This study evaluated the value of protected areas for protection of freshwater fishes in the Western Cape Province by setting species conservation targets and then intersecting species distribution data with protected area polygons. Conservation targets were set to protect the minimum viable population required for long-term persistence, with a minimum of 10 subpopulations as a target. This, along with other factors such as population viability and protected area effectiveness was used to determine whether a species was effectively protected by the current protected area network. Species were classified into one of four categories; (1) "well protected," (2) "moderately protected," (3) "poorly protected," and (4) "not protected." Our results indicate that the majority of native fishes are inadequately protected within the current protected area network in the province. This is mainly a result of the linear nature of riverine ecosystems that exposes them to impacts and threats that emanate from outside of the protected area. These limitations are not unique to the CFE, and our findings have broader implications as they highlight the need for integrating both the riverine and terrestrial ecosystems in the design, expansion and management of protected areas. This will enhance and maximise conservation and protection of riverine systems and their unique biodiversity.

AB  - We used nested subsets analysis to examine distribution patterns of birds and butterflies in the same set of 83 locations in canyons of three mountain ranges in the Great Basin of western North America. We tested whether the same environmental variables influenced nestedness among taxonomic groups and among mountain ranges within taxonomic groups. We also examined whether nestedness of birds and butterflies appeared to be sensitive to human use of riparian areas in the ecoregion. Site area and topography did not appear to differ in their influence on nestedness of birds. By contrast, area and topography differed in how strongly they affected nestedness of butterflies, but their respective influence varied among mountain ranges. Riparian dependence had little discernible effect on nested distribution patterns of either taxonomic group. Because processes influencing distribution patterns can differ among taxonomic groups, and the relative importance of those processes may vary spatially even within a taxonomic group, we urge restraint in using birds and butterflies as surrogates of other taxa for conservation planning.

AB  - AimWe still lack a comprehensive understanding of the relative importance of demographic, dispersal and landscape characteristics on species' rates of range expansion (RRE) and on how these factors interact. Here, we provide an analysis of these effects for passive dispersers, by investigating how habitat characteristics, such as habitat quality, availability and fragmentation, interplay with species' dispersal characteristics in determining species' RRE. In addition, we assessed the predictability of RRE in cases where we have the knowledge of a species' demography, dispersal and habitat availability.
   MethodsUsing the newly available individual-based modelling platform, RangeShifter we simulated the range expansion of species with different dispersal abilities, by varying mean dispersal distance and number of emigrants, on various landscapes. Landscapes varied in habitat quality (in terms of carrying capacity and species' growth rates) and in habitat availability (in terms of the proportion of suitable habitat and its degree of fragmentation).
   ResultsOur results show that 55% of the total variation in RRE was explained by our six main effects, being considerably faster in landscapes with more suitable habitat, but only slightly affected by the degree of habitat fragmentation. Also, synergies between the amount of suitable habitat and species dispersal characteristics had significant positive effects on range expansion. Notably, however, 33% of variation in RRE was not explained by any of the tested factors or interactions between them and can be considered inherent and irreducible uncertainty.
   Main conclusionsSimulation-based approaches provide important insights into the drivers of RRE that are relevant for conservation planning. For instance, our results indicate when it is likely to be better to allocate resources to improve existing habitat rather than creating new habitat, and vice versa. Additionally, our results emphasize that there will often be substantial uncertainty in the RRE, which needs to be taken into account for ecological management.

AB  - Designation of an effective marine protected area (MPA) requires substantial knowledge of the spatial use of the region by key species, particularly those of high mobility. Within the Ross Sea, Antarctica, the least altered marine ecosystem on Earth, unusually large and closely interacting populations of several marine bird and mammal species co-exist. Understanding how that is possible is important to maintaining the ecological integrity of the system, the major goal in designating the Ross Sea as an MPA. We report analyses of niche occupation, two-dimensional habitat use, and overlap for the majority (9) of mesopredator species in the Ross Sea considering three components: (1) diet, (2) vertical distribution and (3) horizontal distribution. For (1) and (2) we used information in the literature; for (3) we used maximum entropy modeling to project species' distributions from occurrence data from several ocean cruises and satellite telemetry, correlated with six environmental variables. Results identified and ranked areas of importance in a conservation prioritization framework. While diet overlapped intensively, some spatial partitioning existed in the vertical dimension (diving depth). Horizontal partitioning, however, was the key structuring factor, defined by three general patterns of environmental suitability: (1) continental shelf break, (2) shelf and slope, and (3) marginal ice zone of the pack ice surrounding the Ross Sea post-polynya. In aggregate, the nine mesopredators used the entire continental shelf and slope, allowing the large populations of these species to co-exist. Conservation prioritization analyses identified the outer shelf and slope and the deeper troughs in the Ross Sea shelf to be most important. Our results substantially improve understanding of these species' niche occupation and imply that a piecemeal approach to MPA designation in this system is not likely to be successful.

AB  - Effective scientific efforts and conservation actions transcend political boundaries, encompassing entire ecological units. We compiled a vascular plant species list for the Rio de la Plata grassland ecoregion, one of the largest continuous grassland ecosystems, in the Americas. Our list is based on existing regional plant lists, online databases and published literature, is taxonomically verified and is complemented by additional information on species distribution in the three countries (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay) and on the origin of the species. We compiled 4864 accepted species names belonging to 194 families. About eight percent of the species are endemic; naturalized non-native species comprise slightly > 10% of the dataset. This dataset will be useful in supporting conservation planning in the region and scientific efforts in understanding species distribution patterns and processes.

AB  - The "area-heterogeneity tradeoff" hypothesis predicts unimodal effects of habitat heterogeneity on species richness, implying that habitats with intermediate heterogeneity may be priority for spatial protection. Alternatively, if heterogeneity effects are positive, then protecting the most heterogeneous habitats may take precedence. We tested for unimodal effects of habitat heterogeneity on the species density (area-corrected richness) of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.): long-lived, benthic fishes vulnerable to overexploitation. Inconsistent with predictions, topographic structural complexity had a strong linear effect on species density; other heterogeneity measures had weaker, positive effects and the only unimodal effect (depth range) was weak. The clear implication is that, to protect the highest density of rockfish species, marine protected areas should include the most topographically complex substrates. Our results can also help refine and test species distribution models needed to inform spatial planning where in situ surveys are lacking. The area-heterogeneity tradeoff generates useful predictions for which support may be context-dependent.

AB  - Coral reef and reef-fish communities are complex systems that have spatial structures that are influenced by multiple factors and processes that interact at several scales. We analysed composition data of reef fish communities in the Yucatan Peninsula fringing reef system using a hierarchical multi-scale survey design to elucidate the origins of the species distribution patterns through multivariate canonical ordination and partitioning analysis. Twelve reef sites were surveyed along the fringing reef system, nested in three sectors, each with distinctive human interests (tourism, fishing, protection). Line transects were placed on reef lagoon, reef front, reef slope and reef terrace habitat for a total of 480 transects. The communities were composed of many rare and some dominant species (e.g., Thalasoma bifasciatum, Acanthurus bahianus, A. coeruleus, Sparisoma aurofrenatum). Redundancy analyses revealed that environmental variables explained between 11% and 22% of the variation in fish community data according to the habitat analysed. Spatial variables, represented by the geographic coordinates of transects, explained a low percentage (2-5%) of variation in the fish community data. Among the environmental variables that significantly explained (P < 0.05) the patterns of variation on the fish community were depth, topographical complexity, and the percentage of the substratum covered by algae, calcareous floor, rock and rubble. Although the total explained variation and proportion of the variation explained by each set of variables were consistently low, most of the effects on the fish community composition data were significant. Explanations are proposed concerning those results. Evincing the distribution patterns on the biological systems of multi-species as well as the causes that shape them is key for conservation planning and essential in highly threatened regions, such as the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula.

AB  - Climate change is affecting many freshwater species, particularly fishes. Predictions of future climate change suggest large and deleterious effects on species with narrow dispersal abilities due to limited hydrological connectivity. In turn, this creates the potential for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats, leading to physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The current extent of many freshwater fish species' spatio-temporal distribution patterns and their sensitivity to thermal impacts from climate change critical information for conservation planning are often unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is an ecologically important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally (Canada) and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to determine the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in projected suitable habitat for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN models). Statistically down scaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data was used to model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America for the period of 2041-2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and temperature variability were the main factors in determining Carmine shiner distribution. Patterns of projected habitat change by the 2050s suggest the spatial extent of the current distribution of Carmine shiner would shift north, with >50% of the current distribution changing with future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways for CO2 emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would become unsuitable for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to become available further north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority of habitat gains for Carmine shiner would be in areas currently inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting current populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century. These results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly vulnerable to a warming climate and suggest that management actions - such as assisted migration - may be needed to mitigate impacts from climate change and ensure the long-term persistence of the species.

AB  - Retention forestry is an approach in which live trees and other components of forest structure are retained within harvested areas. A primary objective of retention forestry is to maintain biodiversity and to hasten post-harvest recovery of forest structure and function. Retention is now a key element in sustainable forest management practices in many regions of the world. However, locating where retention should be placed to best achieve management objectives is a challenging problem, and evidence-based approaches to operational applications are rare. We suggest here that harvest planners could benefit from the use of systematic conservation planning principles and methods to inform retention design. Specifically, we used a conservation planning-or prioritization-tool, Zonation, to create spatially-explicit scenarios of retention harvesting in a boreal mixedwood forest in northwestern Alberta, Canada. Scenarios were informed by several environmental variables related to site productivity; in particular, we used a metric of wetness (depth-to-water from the Wet Areas Mapping algorithm) that is based on airborne lidar-derived terrain models previously shown to correlate with patterns in post-harvest forest regeneration and biodiversity. The nine retention scenarios examined here related to the placement of retention focused to drier, mesic, or wetter sites in combination with other prioritization constraints. Results were compared with an existing harvest plan to assess differences in the spatial pattern of retention (e.g., percent overlapping area, number of patches, size of the patches). We also tested for the homogeneity of forest attributes (e.g., tree species, deciduous density) between scenarios and the existing harvest plan using multivariate dispersion analysis. Our results showed limited commonalities among scenarios compared to the existing harvest plan; they were characterized as having limited spatial overlap, and more and smaller patches with the use of a timber-cost constraint further affecting retention patterns. While modeling results significantly differed from current retention practices, the approach presented here offers flexibility in testing different scenarios and assessing trade-offs between timber production and conservation goals using a standardized conservation planning toolkit.

AB  - Over the last decades agroforestry parklands in Burkina Faso have come under increasing demographic as well as climatic pressures, which are threatening indigenous tree species that contribute substantially to income generation and nutrition in rural households. Analyzing the threats as well as the species vulnerability to them is fundamental for priority setting in conservation planning. Guided by literature and local experts we selected 16 important food tree species (Acacia macrostachya, Acacia senegal, Adansonia digitata, Annona senegalensis, Balanites aegyptiaca, Bombax costatum, Boscia senegalensis, Detarium microcarpum, Lannea microcarpa, Parkia biglobosa, Sclerocarya birrea, Strychnos spinosa, Tamarindus indica, Vitellaria paradoxa, Ximenia americana, Ziziphus mauritiana) and six key threats to them (overexploitation, overgrazing, fire, cotton production, mining and climate change). We developed a species-specific and spatially explicit approach combining freely accessible datasets, species distribution models (SDMs), climate models and expert survey results to predict, at fine scale, where these threats are likely to have the greatest impact. We find that all species face serious threats throughout much of their distribution in Burkina Faso and that climate change is predicted to be the most prevalent threat in the long term, whereas overexploitation and cotton production are the most important short-term threats. Tree populations growing in areas designated as 'highly threatened' due to climate change should be used as seed sources for ex situ conservation and planting in areas where future climate is predicting suitable habitats. Assisted regeneration is suggested for populations in areas where suitable habitat under future climate conditions coincides with high threat levels due to short-term threats. In the case of Vitellaria paradoxa, we suggest collecting seed along the northern margins of its distribution and considering assisted regeneration in the central part where the current threat level is high due to overexploitation. In the same way, population-specific recommendations can be derived from the individual and combined threat maps of the other 15 food tree species. The approach can be easily transferred to other countries and can be used to analyze general and species specific threats at finer and more local as well as at broader (continental) scales in order to plan more selective and efficient conservation actions in time. The concept can be applied anywhere as long as appropriate spatial data are available as well as knowledgeable experts.

AB  - The distribution of forests can be hindcast or forecast when robust data and validation proofs are available. Distribution consequences for temperate coniferous forests during the Quaternary and future climatic fluctuations are little understood in China. Temperate coniferous forests are subdivided into two types where Pinus, Keteleeria, Tsuga and Cupressus species characterize the warm forests while Abies, Picea, Larix and Juniperus species characterize the cold forests. Both forest types were investigated using 12,675 unique records in the MaxEnt model to infer distribution patterns during six time periods: the present time, mid-Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum, Last Interglacial and the near- and far-future (2050, 2070). The results showed that the mean temperature of the driest quarter, followed by the temperature annual range and the precipitation of the warmest quarter were the most important variables controlling forests distribution. Suitable areas capable of supporting the presence of warm coniferous forests were highly contracted during the Quaternary; meanwhile, the cold coniferous forests expanded westwards from the last glacial maximum through the mid-Holocene to the present. The predicted future distributions showed a significant range-shift of warm forests northeastwards in response to climate change while cold coniferous forests are expected to migrate towards the Tibetan Plateau. Under increased global warming, the bioclimatic variables of the past and future periods were used as ecological indicators for the identification of areas showing "climatic stability", and predicted to be refugia for coniferous forests and as good tools for conservation planning in Sichuan and the Hengduan-Tibetan migration corridor.

AB  - Aim To examine whether benthic assemblages are more diverse in a region of high topographic and oceanographic complexity by comparing benthic invertebrate assemblages across continental margins with contrasting environments. Location Challenger Plateau and Chatham Rise, to the west and east of New Zealand, respectively. Methods Benthic faunal data were sourced from extensive seabed surveys in 2007, when both margins were sampled with an epibenthic sled and a towed video system. Three methods were used to investigate benthic assemblages in relation to environmental variables: one based on individual species distribution models (SDMs) using boosted regression trees analysis (BRT), and two community-based modelling methods using generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM) and gradient forest analysis (GF), respectively. Each method was used to model and predict the turnover in assemblages with respect to environment the biophysical patterns across the study region. Results Across Chatham Rise, a complex oceanographic environment arising from steep gradients in productivity and temperature at the Subtropical Front produced a high diversity of assemblages associated with the sub-Antarctic water mass, the Subtropical Front, steep-sloping regions and fast tidal currents. In contrast, Challenger Plateau lies entirely beneath a single (subtropical) water mass, and assemblage diversity was lower, with a distinctive assemblage on the plateau itself and a deep-water assemblage similar to the northern deep-water assemblage of Chatham Rise. Across both regions, assemblage turnover was fastest in cold waters, at shallow depths and in deep mixed layers. Main conclusions Benthic assemblages were more varied on Chatham Rise than on Challenger Plateau, supporting the hypothesis that environmentally heterogeneous margins have higher assemblage diversity. Differing assemblages on the northern and southern flanks of Chatham Rise suggest a biogeographical boundary for benthic taxa across the Subtropical Front. These results demonstrate that oceanographically and topographically complex margins have a diverse assemblage structure that should be considered in planning for the sustainable management of diversity.

AB  - Landscape-based population models are potentially valuable tools in facilitating conservation planning and actions at large scales. However, such models have rarely been applied at ecoregional scales. We extended landscape-based population models to ecoregional scales for three species of concern in the Central Hardwoods Bird Conservation Region and compared model projections against long-term trend data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We used a spatially-explicit demographic model and structured the regional population into ecological subsections on the basis of habitat, landscape patterns, and demographic rates to assess species viability. Our model projections were within 2% of the Breeding Bird Survey trends over the last 40 years for each species. Wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations remained relatively stable over the simulation and worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivonis) abundance increased throughout most of the time period until reaching carrying capacity. In contrast, the prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor) population steadily declined by 0.59% annually. The combination of habitat and demographic modeling allowed us to create models that address processes driving these populations at all scales, which is critical to understanding how regional populations respond to landscape processes such as habitat loss and fragmentation. Therefore, because it is spatially explicit and directly addresses population growth and viability, this approach provides a valuable foundation to planning conservation strategies, offering the ability to identify the most salient risks to viability and explore ways to address them.

AB  - Biodiversity founds ecosystem services which guarantee human survival and wellbeing. Halt biodiversity loss requires efficient conservation actions, and the establishment of protected areas is a crucial strategy. However, their planning is still hindered by shortfalls of data, particularly in neglected regions such as Caatinga, a Brazilian biome dominated by tropical dry forests. We used global range maps of tetrapods and local environmental information to mapping species' Area of Habitat (AOH) and support conservation assessment and spatial prioritization in Caatinga. We quantified biodiversity's representation in current protected areas (PAs) and indigenous lands (ILs), as well in priority areas (PRIs) proposed by government for future conservation. Following international targets for 2020 and 2030, we presented a prioritization solution to protect 17% and 30% of biome. PAs and ILs, covering 9.1% of the Caatinga, represent on average 9.8% of species' AOH, with 37 gap species. By protecting 15.3-32.0% of biome, PRIs networks might increase the current mean to 15.2%-37.5% of species' AOH, still resulting in gap species. Our solution represents on average 26.8-42.5% of species' AOH, with no gap species, and effectively represent more than 91% of tetrapods at higher risk. Opportunity costs displaced priorities to areas less affected by human activities, mainly reducing threatened species' representation. Optimized use of available data, including global maps refined by local information, help to support efficient conservation planning. Once that improve the conservation benefits becomes urgent nowadays, when science-based initiatives are under attack, our approach might contribute to other vulnerable and poorly known biomes.

AB  - Population persistence probability is valuable for characterizing risk to species and informing listing and conservation decisions but is challenging to estimate through traditional methods for rare, data-limited species. Modeling approaches have used citizen science data to mitigate data limitations of focal species and better estimate parameters such as occupancy and detection, but their use to estimate persistence and inform conservation decisions is limited. We developed an approach to estimate persistence using only occurrence records of the target species and citizen science occurrence data of non-target species to account for search effort and imperfect detection. We applied the approach to a highly cryptic and data-limited species, the southern hognose snake (Heterodon simus), as part of its USFWS Species Status Assessment, and estimated current (in 2018) and future persistence under plausible scenarios of varying levels of urbanization, sea level rise, and management. Of 222 known populations, 133 (60%) are likely extirpated currently (persistence probability < 50%), and 165 (74%) populations are likely to be extirpated by 2080 with no additional management. Future management scenarios that included strategies to acquire and improve habitat on currently unprotected lands with existing populations lessened the estimated rate of population declines. These results can directly inform listing decisions and conservation planning for the southern hognose snake by Federal, State, and other partners. Our approach - using occurrence records and auxiliary data from non-target species to estimate population persistence - is applicable across rare and at-risk species for evaluating extinction risk with limited data and prioritizing management actions.

AB  - In order to contribute to conservation planning efforts for golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in the western U.S., we developed nest site models using > 6,500 nest site locations throughout a > 3,483,000 km(2) area of the western U.S. We developed models for twelve discrete modeling regions, and estimated relative density of nest sites for each region. Cross-validation showed that, in general, models accurately estimated relative nest site densities within regions and sub-regions. Areas estimated to have the highest densities of breeding golden eagles had from 132-2,660 times greater densities compared to the lowest density areas. Observed nest site densities were very similar to those reported from published studies. Large extents of each modeling region consisted of low predicted nest site density, while a small percentage of each modeling region contained disproportionately high nest site density. For example, we estimated that areas with relative nest density values < 0.3 represented from 62.8-97.8% (<(x)over bar> = 82.5%) of each modeling area, and those areas contained from 14.7-30.0% ((x) over bar = 22.1%) of the nest sites. In contrast, areas with relative nest density values > 0.5 represented from 1.0-12.8% ((x) over bar = 6.3%) of modeling areas, and those areas contained from 47.7-66.9% ((x) over bar = 57.3%) of the nest sites. Our findings have direct application to: 1) large-scale conservation planning efforts, 2) risk analyses for land-use proposals such as recreational trails or wind power development, and 3) identifying mitigation areas to offset the impacts of human disturbance.

AB  - Identifying the spatio-temporal distribution hotspots of fishes and allocating priority conservation areas could facilitate the spatial planning and efficient management. As a flagship commercial fishery species, Largehead hairtail (Trichiurus japonicus) has been over-exploited since the early 2000s. Therefore, the spatio-temporal management of largehead hairtail nursery grounds could effective help its recovery. This study aims to predict juvenile largehead hairtail distribution patterns and identify priority conservation areas for nursery grounds. A two-stage hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal model was applied on independent scientific survey data (Catch per unit effort, CPUE) and geographic/physical variables (Depth, Distance to the coast, Sea bottom temperature, Dissolved oxygen concentration and Net primary production) to analyze the probability of occurrence and abundance distribution of juvenile largehead hairtail. We assessed the importance of each variable for explaining the occurrence and abundance. Using persistence index, we measured the robustness of hotspots and identified persistent hotspots for priority conservation areas. Selected models showed good predictive capacity on occurrence probability (AUC = 0.81) and abundance distribution (r = 0.89) of juvenile largehead hairtail. Dissolved oxygen, net primary production, and sea bottom temperature significantly affected the probability of occurrence, while distance to the coast also affected the abundance distribution. Three stable nursery grounds were identified in Zhejiang inshore waters, the largest one was located on the east margin of the East China Sea hairtail national aquatic germplasm resources conservation zones (TCZ), suggesting that the core area of nursery grounds occurs outside the protected areas. Therefore, recognition of these sites and their associated geographic/oceanic attributes provides clear targets for optimizing largehead hairtail conservation efforts in the East China Sea. We suggested that the eastern and southern areas of TCZ should be included in conservation planning for an effective management within a network of marine protected areas.

AB  - Aim We play the role of an ice age ecologist (IAE) charged with conserving biodiversity during the climate changes accompanying the last deglaciation. We develop reserve-selection strategies for the IAE and check them against rankings based on modern data. Location Northern and eastern North America. Methods Three reserve-selection strategies are developed. (1) Abiotic: the IAE uses no information about speciesclimate relationships, instead maximizing the climatic and geographic dispersion of reserves. (2) Species distribution models (SDMs): the IAE uses boosted-regression trees calibrated against pollen data and CCSM3 palaeoclimatic simulations from 21 to 15 ka bp to predict modern taxon distributions, then uses these as input to the Zonation reserve-ranking program. (3) Rank-and-regress: regression models are used to identify climatic predictors of zonation rankings. All strategies are assessed against a Zonation ranking based on modern pollen distributions. Analysis units are ecoregions and grid cells. Results The abiotic strategy has a negative or no correlation between predicted and actual rankings. The SDM-based strategy fares better, with a significantly positive area-corrected correlation (r= 0.474, P < 0.001) between predicted and actual rankings. Predictive ability drops when grid cells are the analysis unit (r= 0.217, P = 0.058). Predictive ability for the rank-and-regress strategy is similar to the SDM results. Main conclusions For the IAE, SDMs improve the predictive ability of reserve-selection strategies. However, predictive ability is limited overall, probably due to shifted realized niches during past no-analogue climates, new species interactions as species responded individually to climate change, and other environmental changes not included in the model. Twenty-first-century conservation planning also faces these challenges, and is further complicated by other anthropogenic impacts. The IAE's limited success does not preclude the use of climate scenarios and niche-based SDMs when developing adaptation strategies, but suggests that such tools offer at best only a rough guide to identifying possible areas of future conservation value.

AB  - Aim Invasive alien species (IAS) can cause profound impacts on ecosystem function and diversity, human health, well-being and livelihoods. Climate change is an important driver of biological invasions, so it is critical to develop models and climate-driven scenarios of IAS range shifts to establish preventive measures. In this study, we analyse how projected changes in the frequency and magnitude of climate extreme events could affect the spread of the six most widely distributed invasive vertebrate species in the Iberian Peninsula. Location Iberian Peninsula. Taxa Red avadavat (Amandava amandava), common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus), rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), American mink (Neovison vison) and pond slider (Trachemys scripta). Methods We followed best-practice standards for species distribution models (SDMs) regarding handling of the response and predictor variables, model building and evaluation using metrics that assess different facets of model performance. We used an ensemble approach with four modelling methods of varying complexity, including both regression-based and tree-based machine-learning algorithms. We analysed five regional models for current (1971-2000) and future climate (2021-2050). We used principal components analysis to assess consensus among model outputs and positively weighed predictions from well-performing models. Results Selected models showed high consensus and good predictive capacity on block cross-validation areas. Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models scored highest in reliability (calibration), but Bayesian Additive Regression Trees provided the best balance between calibration and discrimination capacity. Forecasts include visible changes in environmental favourability, with losses generally outweighing the gains, but with some areas becoming more favourable for several species. Main conclusions Increased frequency and/or intensity of climate extreme events associated with ongoing climate change are projected to reduce overall invasion risk for the species examined although increases in favourability should be expected locally.

AB  - Effective conservation of fish species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) requires an understanding of species-habitat relationships and distributional trends. Thus, modeling the distribution of fish species across large spatial scales may be a valuable tool for conservation planning. Our goals were to evaluate the status of 10 fish SGCN in wadeable Iowa streams and to test the effectiveness of Iowa Aquatic Gap Analysis Project (IAGAP) species distribution models. We sampled fish assemblages from 86 wadeable stream segments in the Mississippi River drainage of Iowa during 2009 and 2010 to provide contemporary, independent fish species presence-absence data. The frequencies of occurrence in stream segments where species were historically documented varied from 0.0% for redfin shiner Lythrurus umbratilis to 100.0% for American brook lamprey Lampetra appendix, with a mean of 53.0%, suggesting that the status of Iowa fish SGCN is highly variable. Cohen's kappa values and other model performance measures were calculated by comparing field-collected presence-absence data with IAGAP model-predicted presences and absences for 12 fish SGCN. Kappa values varied from 0.00 to 0.50, with a mean of 0.15. The models only predicted the occurrences of banded darter Etheostoma zonale, southern redbelly dace Phoxinus erythrogaster, and longnose dace Rhinichthys cataractae more accurately than would be expected by chance. Overall, the accuracy of the twelve models was low, with a mean correct classification rate of 58.3%. Poor model performance probably reflects the difficulties associated with modeling the distribution of rare species and the inability of the large-scale habitat variables used in IAGAP models to explain the variation in fish species occurrences. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying the confidence in species distribution model predictions with an independent data set and the need for long-term monitoring to better understand the distributional trends and habitat associations of fish SGCN.

AB  - Climate change is expected to have a profound impact on species distributions, contracting suitable climate space. Biodiversity areas are important to mitigate these negative effects but are static by design and thus do not account for future projections of species distributions. The Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja has a broad range across lowland Neotropical forests and thus its distribution could be negatively affected by climate change when combined with current rates of habitat loss. To test this hypothesis, we use spatial point process models fitted with climatic, topographical and landcover covariates to identify the current distribution. We then project to 24 future climate scenarios, using three General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two emission scenarios between the years 2021 and 2100 averaged over four, 20-year periods. Our current model identified a core range across Amazonia and the Guiana Shield, with evergreen forest (71%), mean diurnal temperature range (13%) and elevation (6%) the most important predictors. Reclassifying the current model to a binary prediction estimated a range size of similar to 7.6 million km(2), with the Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) network covering 18% of habitat (similar to 1.4 million km(2)) within this range. By 2090, range size was predicted to decrease on average by 14.4% under a higher emissions scenario, and 7.3% under a lower emissions scenario. The IBA network would cover 14% less area under a higher emissions scenario, and 3.3% less distribution area under a lower emissions scenario by 2090. Southern Amazonia is predicted to have the greatest reduction in range size and subsequently highest loss of Harpy Eagle habitat within the IBA network. Our work demonstrates that the combination of climate change and subsequent habitat loss may result in substantial losses in distribution for this raptor across the southern edge of its range.

AB  - Accurate mapping is a main challenge for endangered small-sized terrestrial species. Freely available spatio-temporal data at high resolution from multispectral satellite offer excellent opportunities for improving predictive distribution models of such species based on fine-scale habitat features, thus making it easier to achieve comprehensive biodiversity conservation goals. However, there are still few examples showing the utility of remote-sensing-based products in mapping microhabitat suitability for small species of conservation concern. Here, we address this issue using Sentinel-2 sensor-derived habitat variables, used in combination with more commonly used explanatory variables (e.g., topography), to predict the distribution of the endangered Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) in agrosilvopastorial systems. Based on vole surveys conducted in two different seasons over a similar to 176,000 ha landscape in Southern Portugal, we assessed the significance of each predictor in explaining Cabrera vole occurrence using the Boruta algorithm, a novel Random forest variant for dealing with high dimensionality of explanatory variables. Overall, results showed a strong contribution of Sentinel-2-derived variables for predicting microhabitat suitability of Cabrera voles. In particular, we found that photosynthetic activity (NDI45), specific spectral signal (SWIR1), and landscape heterogeneity (Rao's Q) were good proxies of Cabrera voles' microhabitat, mostly during temporally greener and wetter conditions. In addition to remote-sensing-based variables, the presence of road verges was also an important driver of voles' distribution, highlighting their potential role as refuges and/or corridors. Overall, our study supports the use of remote-sensing data to predict microhabitat suitability for endangered small-sized species in marginal areas that potentially hold most of the biodiversity found in human-dominated landscapes. We believe our approach can be widely applied to other species, for which detailed habitat mapping over large spatial extents is difficult to obtain using traditional descriptors. This would certainly contribute to improving conservation planning, thereby contributing to global conservation efforts in landscapes that are managed for multiple purposes.

AB  - Aim: Species distribution models built with geographically restricted data often fail to capture the full range of conditions experienced by species across their entire distribution area. Using such models to predict distribution shifts under future environmental change may, therefore, produce biased projections. However, restricted-scale models have the potential to include a larger sample of taxa for which distribution data are available and to provide finer-resolution projections that are better applied to conservation planning than the forecasts of broad-scale models. We examine the circumstances under which the projected shifts in species richness patterns derived from restricted-scale and broad-scale models are most likely to be similar.
   Location: Europe.
   Methods: The distribution of butterflies in Finland, Belgium/Netherlands and Spain was modelled based on restricted-scale (local) and broad-scale (continental) distribution and climate data. Both types of models were projected under future climate change scenarios to assess potential changes in species richness.
   Results: In Finland, species richness was projected to increase strongly based on restricted-scale models and to decrease slightly with broad-scale models. In Belgium/Netherlands, restricted-scale models projected a larger decrease in richness than broad-scale models. In Spain, both models projected a slight decrease in richness. We obtained similar projections based on restricted-scale and broad-scale models only in Spain because the climatic conditions available here covered the warm part of the distributions of butterflies better than in Finland and Belgium/Netherlands.
   Main conclusions: Restricted-scale models that fail to capture the warm part of species distributions produce biased estimates of future changes in species richness when projected under climatic conditions with no modern analogue in the study area. We recommend the use of distribution data beyond the boundaries of the study area to capture the part of the species response curves reflecting the climatic conditions that will prevail within that area in the future.

AB  - Aim Creating a network of marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean requires extensive knowledge on species' abundances, distributions and population trends especially in the Weddell Sea where year-round pack ice makes most of the Weddell Sea inaccessible. We combine satellite images and citizen science to model habitat suitability for crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) throughout the Weddell Sea. Location Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Methods High-resolution satellite images covering 18,219 km(2)of the Weddell Sea during crabeater seal breeding season (October-November) were hosted on the crowd-sourcing platform Tomnod (DigitalGlobe). Citizen scientists marked "maps" where seals were present/absent and these votes were compared with the votes of an experienced observer. Correction factors were used to correct votes to either a continuous probability of seal presence, or a binary seal presence/absence value. We modelled probability of seal presence using ensemble models of Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and used fitted Maxent models to model seal presence/absence data. Results Model predictive power was low (RF:R-2 = 0.076 +/- 0.002: BRT:R-2 = 0.086 +/- 0.0008; SVM:R-2 = 0.082 +/- 0.003) to average (Maxent: AUC = 0.71 +/- 0.004). Distance to the ice edge and bathymetry were the most important variables that influenced crabeater seal distribution. Main conclusions Crabeater seals were more likely to be present over abyssal water, which coincides with typical adult Antarctic krill habitat - crabeater seal preferred prey. Where ice concentrations were more variable, that is more accessible, crabeater seals were also more likely to occur. Results agreed with the known ecology of crabeaters seals and the abundance, distribution and ecology of Antarctic krill. We were able to survey the largest area ever surveyed in the Weddell Sea and provide a model to assist furthering policy around the proposed protected area.

AB  - The bentfin devil ray (Mobula thurstoni) is a migratory elasmobranch species with a wide distribution range. Despite the recent increase in mobulid research, critical habitats and home ranges are still being identified for these threatened species. In the present study, photo and video records opportunistically gathered by SCUBA diving effort were used to identify individuals and habitat usage by M. thurstoni in a marine protected area in the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean, Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (FNA). The bentfin devil ray was identified in five distinct records, in different years and sites around the archipelago. All the males showed developed claspers, suggesting mature individuals using the area. The UNESCO heritage site of FNA is considered an area of high biological importance, containing essential habitats for several species of fish, turtles and marine mammals. However, habitat usage by devil ray species is poorly reported in the region; therefore, the present study presents the first report of M. thurstoni at FNA, which adds the fifth mobulid ray species recorded in the region. Additionally, these results correspond to the second record of living specimens of M. thurstoni in Brazilian jurisdictional waters, highlighting new information on the species' distribution and the home range of mobulids in Brazil.

AB  - Over the last two millennia, and at an accelerating pace, the African elephant (Loxodonta spp. Lin.) has been threatened by human activities across its range.(1-7) We investigate the correlates of elephant home range sizes across diverse biomes. Annual and 16-day elliptical time density home ranges(8) were calculated by using GPS tracking data collected from 229 African savannah and forest elephants (L. africana and L. cyclotis, respectively) between 1998 and 2013 at 19 sites representing bushveld, savannah, Sahel, and forest biomes. Our analysis considered the relationship between home range area and sex, species, vegetation productivity, tree cover, surface temperature, rainfall, water, slope, aggregate human influence, and protected area use. Irrespective of these environmental conditions, long-term annual ranges were overwhelmingly affected by human influence and protected area use. Only over shorter, 16-day periods did environmental factors, particularly water availability and vegetation productivity, become important in explaining space use. Our work highlights the degree to which the human footprint and existing protected areas now constrain the distribution of the world's largest terrestrial mammal.(9,10) A habitat suitability model, created by evaluating every square kilometer of Africa, predicts that 18,169,219 km(2) would be suitable as elephant habitat-62% of the continent. The current elephant distribution covers just 17% of this potential range of which 57.4% falls outside protected areas. To stem the continued extirpation and to secure the elephants' future, effective and expanded protected areas and improved capacity for coexistence across unprotected range are essential.

AB  - This study determined the potential effects of present and future climates on the geographical distribution of Shorea palosapis (Blanco) Merr. and Shorea polysperma (Blanco) Merr in Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park (NSMNP) using Maximum Entropy model. A total of seven models were generated for each species: one Climatic Only model, four Partial models (combination of four variable groups with climatic variables), one Full model (used 30 original variables), and one Final model (used 18 uncorrelated variables after a series of variable reduction methods). The models 'relative predictive performance was evaluated using Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS). The Final model performed best both for S. palosapis (AUC = 0.8763; TSS = 0.8176) and S. polysperma (AUC = 0.8626; TSS = 0.8332). Analysis of variable importance: revealed that species distributions were largely determined by climatic variables (34.35%) followed by anthropogenic variables (27.25%) and topographic variables (24.15%), while vegetation-related (7.58%) and edaphic variables (6.67%) had relatively lesser contribution. The probabilities of occurrence of the species changed and were found to benefit from future climate with increasing suitable habitat range. This study will provide practitioners with early warning estimates of how climate change may affect the distribution of endangered species. Furthermore, this will also assist decision makers especially in mainstreaming climate change in the NSMNP management plan to better conserve potential suitable habitats of priority species.

AB  - 1. The lack of information about marine biodiversity is problematic for the selection of conservation reserves that aim to protect representative samples of biodiversity. A number of surrogate measures for biodiversity have been suggested as a potential solution to this problem.
   2. The present study tested the effectiveness of using higher taxa of macroinvertebrates as a surrogate for species-level identification to depict spatial variation in species richness and assemblage variation and to select conservation reserves in one estuary in south-east Australia.
   3. Spatial patterns of richness and assemblage variation for species were significantly correlated with patterns defined from genera, families, orders, classes, and phyla with a decline in the magnitude of correlation coefficients from finer to coarser resolutions. A network of reserves selected to include representatives of all phyla, classes, orders, families and genera coincidentally included 54%, 61.7%, 75%, 92.6%, 98.8% species in 8.3%, 13.9%, 17.7%, 44.4% and 58.3% of grid cells, respectively. However, only reserves selected for genera, families and orders performed significantly better than random selection.
   4. Percentage of species represented by orders, families and genera in a realistic level of available grid cells for conservation (i.e. 13.9%) were very close ranging between 70 and 73.5%. A factor diminishing the performance of order as surrogate for species richness was related to the difficulty of identifying many macroinvertebrates to the order level. Therefore, it is concluded that genus- and family-level identification is an effective surrogate for species-level identification for conservation planning in estuaries.

AB  - Ecological knowledge is considered an important factor in environmental policy-making. However, the opportunity for ecologists to influence policy can often occur within discrete time policy windows, and seizing these opportunities has been heavily emphasized as a recent global conservation need. In 2017 the Natura 2000 Conservation Measures have been finalized in Italy, and delineated the management policy and institutional responsibilities of Natura 2000 Sites, after obligations of the EU Habitat Directive. In this timeframe, we developed a multi-scalar hierarchical habitat selection model for wolf reproductive-sites to identify potentially favorable habitat for wolf reproduction in the western Italian Alps, based on 19 years of data. This habitat suitability model was useful for the definition of species conservation requirements within the Natura 2000 Sites, and has been adopted in legislation processes, representing a successful example of ecological modelling fitting into a relevant policy window and informing legal instruments to achieve nature conservation goals.

AB  - 1. Species distribution modelling is an important and well-established tool for conservation planning and resource management. Modelling techniques based on central estimates of species responses to environmental factors do not always provide ecologically meaningful estimates of species-environment relationships and are being increasingly questioned.
   2. Regression quantiles (RQ) can be used to model the upper bounds of species-environment relationships and thus estimate how the environment is limiting the distribution of a species. The resulting models tend to describe potential rather than actual patterns of species distributions.
   3. Model selection based on null hypothesis testing and backward elimination, followed by validation procedures, are proposed here as a general approach for constructing RQ limiting effect models for multiple species.
   4. This approach was applied successfully to 16 of the most abundant marine fish and cephalopods in the eastern English Channel. Most models were validated successfully and null hypothesis testing for model selection proved effective for RQ modelling.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Modelling the upper bounds of species-habitat relationships enables the detection of the effects of limiting factors on species' responses. Maps showing potential species distributions are also less likely to underestimate species responses' to the environment, and therefore have subsequent benefits for precautionary management.

AB  - Over 90% of the world's fisheries have been fully exploited or over-fished. Included is the large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), an important commercial fish species in China whose population was nearly depleted prior to the 1980s. Although overfishing and natural resources collapse present a daunting issue, some studies indicate that improved management strategies could aid in natural stock restoration to prevent depletion. We developed an integrated assessment method grounded on an ecosystem-based approach and deigned an integrated index with three key aspects of habitat suitability, natural population status and government & social interventions, to evaluate the potential restoration capacity of the species in a designated "national aquatic germplasm resource protected area" in Guanjinyang based on a data set spanning 1987 to 2015. The results show that although restoration efforts on research and rehabilitation have increased greatly since late 1990s, the effectiveness stays moderate and the natural population remains near depletion.

AB  - The representativeness of the inventory of shrub species of a natural protected area in Coahuila, Mexico was analyzed, with the following objectives: to describe the types of sampling bias; to define the environmental heterogeneity of the botanical records; to determine the level of spatial resolution that supports the information collected. Biases were significant (chi(2) = distance road 199.01; p< 0.01, by altitudinal range chi(2) = 391.02; p< 0.01 and vegetation chi(2) = 518.13; p< 0.01). The inventory sample exhibits significant differences between the control group and a randomized design for 5 bioclimatic variables (mean annual temperature (Bio1): U= 117,900; p< 0.01; isothermality (Bio3): U= 189.650, p< 0.01; precipitation wettest month (Bio13): U= 134.330, p<0.01; seasonality of precipitation (Bio15): U= 175.720, p< 0.01 and precipitation of the coldest quarter (Bio19): U=146.550, p< 0.01). Environmental variables and road distances, on the coverage of this infrastructure in the area, can contribute to a good characterization of the ANP. The information from collected records is adequate for small scales of analysis (1 and 0.5 degrees). All Rights Reserved (C) 2015 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Institut de Biologia.

AB  - Fish species richness (FSR) has been widely used as an indicator of both ecological variation and fish biodiversity. On global and local scales, FSR has been declining due to human impact. Species distribution models, such as conventional regression techniques and machine learning methods, have played a critical role in predicting the distribution of FSR in estuarine systems. The Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) is the largest estuarine ecosystem in the western Pacific Ocean. It is a muddy estuary providing many important ecosystem functioning services acting as spawning, feeding, and nursing grounds for a variety of valuable commercial species such as Coilia ectenes and Muraenesox cinereus. Despite this, the spatial distribution of FSR in the YRE has not been estimated. In this study, four modelling approaches (generalized linear model, generalized additive model, regression tree, and boosted regression tree) are applied to predict FSR in the YRE. Model performance was compared by evaluating the fit and predictive performance via deviation explained, root mean squared error, and cross-validation. Finally, the spatial distribution of FSR was estimated by the optimal model. It was shown that a regression tree approach outperformed the other methods. Additionally, regression tree modelling captured the overall distribution pattern of FSR in the YRE. The factors that appear to be contributing to the distribution pattern of FSR in the YRE included environmental conditions, fish migrations, and local physical characteristics (e.g. runoff and tide). The results from this study could provide guidance for the conservation planning and spatial management of the YRE. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change has created the need for new strategies in conservation planning that account for the dynamics of factors threatening endangered species.
   Here we assessed climate change threat to the European otter, a flagship species for freshwater ecosystems, considering how current conservation areas will perform in preserving the species in a climatically changed future. We used an ensemble forecasting approach considering six modelling techniques applied to eleven subsets of otter occurrences across Europe. We performed a pseudo-independent and an internal evaluation of predictions. Future projections of species distribution were made considering the A2 and B2 scenarios for 2080 across three climate models: CCCMA-CGCM2, CSIRO-MK2 and HCCPR HAD-CM3. The current and the predicted otter distributions were used to identify priority areas for the conservation of the species, and overlapped to existing network of protected areas.
   Our projections show that climate change may profoundly reshuffle the otter's potential distribution in Europe, with important differences between the two scenarios we considered. Overall, the priority areas for conservation of the otter in Europe appear to be unevenly covered by the existing network of protected areas, with the current conservation efforts being insufficient in most cases. For a better conservation, the existing protected areas should be integrated within a more general conservation and management strategy incorporating climate change projections. Due to the important role that the otter plays for freshwater habitats, our study further highlights the potential sensitivity of freshwater habitats in Europe to climate change.

AB  - Though one of the most vulnerable terrestrial ecosystems, wetlands provide multiple ecosystem services, most notably storing carbon. It is now widely recognized that climate change could have a large impact on high-latitude wetlands. A key question is how climate change will affect the distribution pattern of wetland plant communities, and to what extent the transitions among different wetland plant communities respond to regional warming? To answer this question, we estimated the total SOC storage with 139 soil profiles in the Xing'anling Mountains and performed ensemble species distribution modelling for 11 dominant wetland plant communities by using numerous vegetation plots. Results show that 4.5-23.8% of the high-latitude wetlands in the study area would be lost following widespread thawing of permafrost under different climate warming scenarios by the end of this century. The total wetland SOC in the Xing'anling Mountains is estimated to be 1.58 Pg, about 25.5-29.3% of the total of China's wetlands, however, predicted wetland loss could put 5.4-20.5% (0.08-0.32 Pg C) of the total SOC storage at risk of instability. Our results also predicted a significant northward migration of southern Deyeuxia angustifolia communities driven by future climate changes. This wetland succession could profoundly reduce future carbon sequestration capacity of wetlands in the study area. The findings presented here are helpful for both current reserve management and future conservation planning of wetlands in the study area.

AB  - Despite rampant coastal development throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific, studies of conservation genetics and ecology of vulnerable, coastal species are rare. Large bodied vertebrates with highly specialized habitat requirements may be at particular risk of extinction due to habitat degradation and fragmentation, especially if these habitats are naturally patchily distributed, marginal, otherwise geographically limited, or associated in space with high human population densities or heavy anthropogenic disturbance. Particularly telling examples of these conservation challenges are large Australasian reptiles with obligate habitat requirements for lowland, coastal and mangrove forests. Plagued by habitat destruction due to high human densities along coastlines, sprawling rural development, and rapidly developing estuarine fisheries industry, coastal forest reptiles are experiencing rapid declines. And yet studies of population biology, genetics, and habitat requirements of species depending on these environments are few. We undertook the present study in order to take a multifaceted approach to understanding a poignant conservation problem. We identify significant evolutionary units for conservation in large-bodied sailfin lizards (genus Hydrosaurus), model suitable habitat in the Philippines from extensive occurrence data and evaluate the efficacy of the current protected area network, and identify the source of hydrosaurs in the illegal pet trade. We determine that the extent of the species' habitat coincident with protected areas is low. Our forensic evaluation of the illegal pet trade in the Philippines determines the existence of a natural population that is at risk of systematic exploitation by traders. Together, this integrative study characterizes a conservation urgency of particular significance: the genetically distinct sailfin lizards of the Bicol faunal region, with suitable habitat virtually unprotected, and clear evidence of heavy exploitation for illegal trade. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first conservation genetic study to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the protected landscape coverage in the Philippines, a Megadiverse nation and Biodiversity Hotspot.

AB  - Southeast Asian biodiversity is a global priority for conservation, due to the high levels of diversity and endemistn, combined with some of the greatest levels of threat. Conservation planning is essential to ensure that hotspots of biodiversity and endemism have the protection needed to prevent deforestation, hunting and other forms of exploitation in some of the Southeast Asia's most diverse areas, yet this requires data which in many cases does not exist.
   Growing volumes of online available data provides the ability to develop accurate models of species distributions, and gain new perspectives on regional diversity patterns and provide essential baseline data for planning and conservation.
   Here, using the best available information I develop maps of the ranges of 2471 vertebrate (birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians) and 1198 plant species, and explore patterns of biodiversity and the adequacy of protection. Each taxon shows different patterns of diversity, and no taxa provided an effective surrogate for diversity patterns in different groups. I show that for the majority of biodiversity hotspots fall outside protected areas, with between 10 and 55% of areas with at least >75% of the maximum number of species unprotected. The percentage of species ranges protected areas also varies by taxa, from a maximum of 40% to reptiles with a mean of only 13.5% of species ranges protected. Furthermore comparison between my predictions and IUCN maps of diversity differed greatly for all taxa examined, with IUCN hotspots covering a much larger portion of the region and potentially overestimating the ranges of many species. Further efforts are needed to better protect centres of diversity, and the inclusion of these methods into regional conservation planning may greatly assist in increasing the effectiveness of conservation.

AB  - Rates of biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia are among the highest in the world, and the Indo-Burma and South-Central China Biodiversity Hotspots rank among the world's most threatened. Developing robust multi-species conservation models is critical for stemming biodiversity loss both here and globally. We used a large and geographically extensive remote-camera survey and multi-scale, multivariate optimization species distribution modelling to investigate the factors driving biodiversity across these two adjoining biodiversity hotspots. Four major findings emerged from the work. (i) We identified clear spatial patterns of species richness, with two main biodiverse centres in the Thai-Malay Peninsula and in the mountainous region of Southwest China. (ii) Carnivores in particular, and large ungulates to a lesser degree, were the strongest indicators of species richness. (iii) Climate had the largest effect on biodiversity, followed by protected status and human footprint. (iv) Gap analysis between the biodiversity model and the current system of protected areas revealed that the majority of areas supporting the highest predicted biodiversity are not protected. Our results highlighted several key locations that should be prioritized for expanding the protected area network to maximize conservation effectiveness. We demonstrated the importance of switching from single-species to multi-species approaches to highlight areas of high priority for biodiversity conservation. In addition, since these areas mostly occur over multiple countries, we also advocate for a paradigmatic focus on transboundary conservation planning.

AB  - Nomadic larks in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo, South Africa, depend on patches of temporally suitable habitat for breeding. These patches occur where rain has recently fallen, where there has been growth and seeding of grasses, and where invertebrates are locally abundant. They are also attractive to domestic livestock which may constitute a threat to successful breeding by the larks. Since rainfall in the Nama-Karoo is unpredictable in time and space on a regional scale, it is difficult a priori to select protected areas for such nomadic birds. As a first approach, we present a spatio-temporal model for estimating the survival of flocks in relation to different configurations of protected areas. The results show that neither one large protected area nor a high number of small protected areas provide the optimal solution. This is due to the impact of various spatial effects which affect the probability of a flock finding a suitable breeding area. These effects are identified and discussed. Furthermore, we are able to reproduce and explain the present spatial abundance of the larks on a regional stale with our model. The model is intended to complement and define the field studies needed to determine practical parameters more precisely. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The future of wild tigers is dire, and the Global Tiger Initiative's (GTI) goal of doubling tiger population size by the next year of the tiger in 2022 will be challenging. The GTI has identified 20 tiger conservation landscapes (TCL) within which recovery actions will be needed to achieve these goals. The Amur tiger conservation landscape offers the best hope for tiger recovery in China where all other subspecies have most likely become extirpated. To prioritize recovery planning within this TCL, we used tiger occurrence data from adjacent areas of the Russian Far East to develop two empirical models of potential habitat that were then averaged with an expert-based habitat suitability model to identify potential tiger habitat in the Changbaishan ecosystem in Northeast China. We assessed the connectivity of tiger habitat patches using least-cost path analysis calibrated against known tiger movements in the Russian Far East to identify priority tiger conservation areas (TCAs). Using a habitat-based population estimation approach, we predicted that a potential of 98 (83112) adult tigers could occupy all TCAs in the Changbaishan ecosystem. By combining information about habitat quality, connectivity and potential population size, we identified the three best TCAs totaling over 25?000?km2 of potential habitat that could hold 79 (6382) adult tigers. Strong recovery actions are needed to restore potential tiger habitat to promote recovery of Amur tigers in China, including restoring ungulate populations, increasing tiger survival through improved anti-poaching activities, land-use planning that reduces human access and agricultural lands in and adjacent to key TCAs, and maintaining connectivity both within and across international boundaries. Our approach will be useful in other TCLs to prioritize recovery actions to restore worldwide tiger populations.

AB  - Scientists increasingly rely on protected areas to assist in biodiversity conservation, yet the efficacy of these areas is rarely systematically assessed, often because of underfunding. Still, adaptive management strategies to maximize conservation success often rely on understanding the temporal and spatial dynamism of populations therein. Examination of environmental DNA (eDNA) is a time and cost-effective way to monitor species' distribution, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) provides information on organismal abundance. To date, however, such techniques remain underused for population assessments in protected areas. We determined eDNA concentration of the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) to describe its occurrence, range, and use of the Tian e-Zhou National Nature Reserve in Hubei, China, across seasons and hydrological depths. Despite the observation that total eDNA concentrations were highest in surface waters in summer, finless porpoise eDNA concentrations were significantly higher in deeper waters than in surface waters in summer. During the breeding season (spring), eDNA signals were site specific and restricted to the core area of the reserve. However, postbreeding eDNA concentrations were widespread across the reserve, encompassing sites previously thought to be unfrequented by the species. Our results suggest spatiotemporal idiosyncrasies in site, depth, and seasonal use of the reserve and a propensity for postbreeding population dispersal. With eDNA and qPCR we were able to assess an entire population's use of a protected area. Illuminating nuances in habitat use via eDNA could be valuable to set pragmatic conservation goals for this, and other, species.

AB  - Multiple-scale habitat assessment for rare plants is an important component of conservation and development planning. It is challenging, however, due to lack of information synthesis on the ecology of rare plants, lack of effective approaches for habitat assessment at multiple spatial scales, and lack of spatial data for relevant environmental attributes and scales. A multiple-scale habitat modeling approach was developed to meet this need. Regional-, landscape-, and site-scale habitat models were developed for eight rare plant species found in southern Texas, USA. The models were partially validated and used for planning of rare plant conservation and highway construction. Regional-scale habitat models were used to predict, based on coarse-scale geographic information system (GIS) data, spatial distribution of areas containing potential habitat of rare plant species and the probability of encountering potential rare plant habitats. Site-scale models, based on synthesis of the literature and field investigations, were developed for field survey and mapping of rare plant habitats to enable accurate assessment of potential and present habitat suitability of specific locations using fine-resolution field data on soil, landform and vegetation structure. The greatest need for assessing the presence and potential habitat of rare plants is at the landscape scales. Thus, landscape-scale models were developed for spatially explicit assessment of potential and present habitat suitability, based on site-scale models but using GIS and remote sensing-based data. These models can be used as effective tools for conservation planning, monitoring and management of rare plant habitat, as well as for reduction of land use conflicts and development cost, The processes of model development and application synthesizes the diffuse literature, identifies knowledge and data gaps to guide future research, and provides a framework for assimilating new information acquired in the future to improve habitat assessment.

AB  - Difficult to study species that inhabit inaccessible terrain, present significant challenges in obtaining accurate ecological, distributional, and conservation information. To address these challenges, we used an effective set of time- and cost-efficient methods including interview-based surveys assisted by Google earth 3D maps to document the distributional range of 32 native animal taxa in the biodiverse but difficult to access Gaoligong Mountains (GLGMS), located on the northern Sino-Myanmar Border. Five threatened flagship species, including the black snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus strykeri), the Skywalker hoolock gibbon (Hoolock tianxing), Shortridge's langur (Trachypithecus shortridgei), Sclater's monal (Lophophorus sclateri) and the Mishmi takin (Budorcas taxicolor) were selected for intensive surveys and used as surrogate taxa to study community biodiversity. Field surveys of each species were conducted to determine their presence/absence and to confirm the reliability of species distribution data obtained from interview-based surveys. Multicriteria Decision Analyses were used along with data on habitat suitability (MAXENT) to prioritize transboundary conservation areas. Our results indicate that approximately 83.4% (10,398.7 km(2)) of the remaining habitat with high biodiversity conservation value in the GLGMs is unprotected. This includes six large zones located along the northern Sino-Myanmar border, separated by rivers and human settlements. These areas should be designated as a transboundary World Nature Heritage Site, national parks, or wildlife sanctuaries. This study presents a reliable, rapid and integrative method for developing informed policies for conservation prioritization in data poor areas, which can be applied successfully to assess conservation priorities in other mountainous regions where obtaining data on biodiversity is difficult.

AB  - Effectiveness of the Italian national protected areas system in conservation of farmland birds: a gap analysis.
   Conservation measures, and particularly the selection of protected areas, at least in Italy, have always preferred areas characterised by low levels of human presence and intervention. One of the most evident consequences of this situation is the great disparity in the protection level afforded to the species with different ecological needs, e.g. those linked to woodland vs. those living in open habitats, above all in farmland. The object of this paper is to stress the effectiveness of the Italian protected area network in the protection of bird species breeding in agricultural landscapes. Starting from a national open-habitat breeding bird list, using the data of the MITO 2000 project (Italian breeding birds monitoring project), we have built for each of them a national-scale ecological model, comparing the percentage of suitable habitat occurring inside and outside four different protected-area types (National Parks, Other Protected Areas, Natura 2000 sites and IBAs). Models were built using MaxEnt, a presence-only modelling method. Our results show, with some differences among species, how the national protected areas system fails to guarantee an acceptable level of protection for farmland species, while those breeding in mountain open-habitat have a quite good protection rate.

AB  - The red slender loris is a nocturnal primate species endemic to Sri Lanka's biodiversity-rich, yet anthropogenically disturbed "Wet Zone". Until the '00s virtually nothing was known about the distribution or conservation status of this cryptic species. We present population data in relation to ecology from eight sites, and relate these data to an ecological niche model using MAXENT in order to predict what type of habitat is suitable for this species. Lorises were present at only six of eight sites, and density varied from 3.4 to 28 lorises/km(2) with an overall density across all sites of 32 lorises/km(2). Ecological niche modelling revealed that of the suitable habitat available for the species, only 25 % remained, and only 16 % of this is protected. Combining the population estimates, about 100,000 red slender lorises may remain in Sri Lanka, but most of these are outside the protected area network. Based on continued habitat declines and the species' total reliance on larger patches that are not exacerbated by humans, we suggest that the species be up-listed to Critically Endangered and that the protected area network in the Wet Zone be extended as soon as possible.

   Location China.
   Methods Range maps and occurrence records of amphibian species in China were analysed separately using ensemble species distribution modelling across three spatial scales to assess scale dependency. Climate velocity and corresponding residence time in protected areas and species' ranges were calculated, together with a number of other effectiveness indices.
   Results Predicted declines in amphibian richness, endemism, phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic endemism and suitable habitat were lower in protected than in unprotected areas, complementary-priority sites or richness hotspots. However, less-disturbed amphibian habitat, calculated from current and future projected land use data, in both protected and unprotected areas were consistently lost over time although this reduction was lower in protected areas. Although residence time of precipitation was longer in protected areas and within species' ranges in protected areas, resident time of temperature was significantly shorter in both. These results were consistent regardless of data sources and spatial scales.
   Main conclusions China's current protected areas are predicted to maintain future amphibian distribution and diversity, but are insufficient in preventing the losses of suitable climate and areas of less-disturbed habitat. The top 10% of future conservation gaps for amphibians were identified in China based on performance of effectiveness indices. The two largest gaps prioritized for future protected areas include the southern parts of Tibet and the Hengduan Mountains.

AB  - A major challenge of regional conservation planning is the identification of sets of sites that together represent the overall biodiversity of the relevant region. Environmental cluster analysis (ECA) has been proposed as a potential tool for efficient selection of conservation sites, but the consequences of methodological decisions involved in its application have not been tested so far We evaluated the performance of ECA with respect to two such decisions: the choice of the-clustering algorithm (single linkage, complete linkage, unweighted arithmetic average, unweighted centroid, Ward's minimum variance, and the ALOC algorithm) and the weight given to different groups of environmental variables (rainfall, temperature, and lithology). Specifically we tested bow these decisions affect the spatial configuration of clusters-of sites defined by the ECA, whether and bow they affect the effectiveness of the ECA (i.e., its ability to represent regional species diversity), and whether the effectiveness of alternative methods of hierarchical clustering can be predicted a priori based on the cophenetic correlation. We used an extensive database of the flora of Israel to test these questions, Differences in both the clustering algorithm and the weighting regime had considerable effects on the spatial configuration of the ECA clusters. The single-linkage algorithm produced mostly single-cell clusters plus a single large-sized cluster and was therefore found inappropriate for environmental regionalization. The effectiveness of the ECA was also sensitive to changes in the clustering algorithm and the weighting regime. Yet, most combinations of clustering algorithms and weighting regimes performed significantly better in capturing regional biodiversity than random null models. The main deviation was classifications based on Ward's minimum variance algorithm, which performed less well relative to all other algorithms. The two algorithms that showed the highest effectiveness (unweighted average and unweighted centroid clustering) also exhibited the highest values of the cophenetic correlation, suggesting that this index may serve as a potential indicator for the effectiveness of alternative ECA algorithms.

AB  - Habitat connectivity is crucial for the conservation of species restricted to fragmented populations within human-dominated landscapes. However, identifying habitat connectivity for apex predators is challenging because trophic interactions between primary productivity and prey species influence both the distribution of habitats, and predator movement. Our goal was to assess habitat connectivity for Indochinese tigers (Panthera tigris) in Thailand. We quantified suitable habitat and dispersal corridors based an ensemble species distribution model that included prey distributions, primary productivity, and abiotic variables and was based on camera-trap data from 1996 to 2013 in 15 protected areas. We employed graph theory to evaluate the relative importance of habitat patches and dispersal corridors to the overall connectivity network. We found that tiger occurrence models with and without prey distributions performed well (Area Under the Curve: 0.932-0.954). However, inclusion of prey distributions significantly improved model performance (P < 0.001). Protected areas with tigers at the time of our surveys were highly isolated with high resistance to movement within the dispersal corridors, and four of them have lost their tiger populations since. Potential habitat patches outside of protected areas were also mostly isolated, but it was encouraging to find that there is ample potential habitat that tigers are not occupying. The Huai Kha Kaeng - ThungYai habitat patch and Kaeng Krachan dispersal corridor were the most important for overall habitat connectivity. Generally, integrating prey distributions into assessments of connectivity is a promising approach that can be widely applied to predict species occurrence and delineate dispersal corridors, thereby supporting conservation planning of tigers and other large carnivores.

AB  - The Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita, NBI) is an endangered migratory species, which went extinct in Europe in the 17th century. Currently, a translocation project in the frame of the European LIFE program is carried out, to reintroduce a migratory population with breeding colonies in the northern and southern Alpine foothills and a common wintering area in southern Tuscany. The population meanwhile consists of about 200 individuals, with about 90% of them carrying a GPS device on their back. We used biologging data from 2021 to model the habitat suitability for the species in the northern Alpine foothills. To set up a species distribution model, indices describing environmental conditions were calculated from satellite images of Landsat-8, and in addition to the well-proven use of optical remote sensing data, we also included Sentinel-1 actively sensed observation data, as well as climate and urbanization data. A random forest model was fitted on NBI GPS positions, which we used to identify regions with high predicted foraging suitability within the northern Alpine foothills. The model resulted in 84.5% overall accuracy. Elevation and slope had the highest predictive power, followed by grass cover and VV intensity of Sentinel-1 radar data. The map resulting from the model predicts the highest foraging suitability for valley floors, especially of Inn, Rhine, and Salzach-Valley as well as flatlands, like the Swiss Plateau and the agricultural areas surrounding Lake Constance. Areas with a high suitability index largely overlap with known historic breeding sites. This is particularly noteworthy because the model only refers to foraging habitats without considering the availability of suitable breeding cliffs. Detailed analyses identify the transition zone from extensive grassland management to intensive arable farming as the northern range limit. The modeling outcome allows for defining suitable areas for further translocation and management measures in the frame of the European NBI reintroduction program. Although required in the international IUCN translocation guidelines, the use of models in the context of translocation projects is still not common and in the case of the Northern Bald Ibis not considered in the present Single Species Action Plan of the African-Eurasian Migratory Water bird Agreement. Our species distribution model represents a contemporary snapshot, but sustainability is essential for conservation planning, especially in times of climate change. In this regard, a further model could be optimized by investigating sustainable land use, temporal dynamics, and climate change scenarios.

AB  - We assessed the linkages between environmental variables and the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of larval abundance of coastal fish assemblages within and outside the Medes Islands marine protected area (MPA; NW Mediterranean) to explore possible fisheries effects such as larvae export of the latter. We analyzed small-scale fish larvae distribution of 28 representative taxa from the rocky fish assemblage and combined the former in different groups with the help of cluster analysis. Further we assessed the influence of selected abiotic variables on group and species distributions using Generalized Additive Models (CAM's). We found a high level of variability in the response of larvae groups and species to environmental variables over the two studied periods (spring and summer); depth and habitat of the adults being the most important factors. In addition, distance to the MPA was found as an important variable in defining the location of larvae of strictly coastal species. Our results provided evidence of larval export of three commercial species affected by the MPA (Epinephelus marginatus. Pagellus erythrinus and Scorpaena porcus). Thus our study contributes to the few empirical assessments of larvae export from MPAs and adds to the understanding of the functioning of MPAs as fisheries management tools. Nevertheless, in the future integrated assessments of fisheries effects of MPA; are required that measure the effect of larvae and biomass export on increased fishing yield while taking into account fishing effort dynamics.

AB  - Conservation planning requires identifying pertinent habitat factors and locating geographic locations where land management may improve habitat conditions for high priority species. I derived habitat models and mapped predicted abundance for the Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), a species of high conservation concern, using bird counts, environmental variables, and hierarchical models applied at multiple spatial scales. My aim was to understand habitat associations at multiple spatial scales and create a predictive abundance map for purposes of conservation planning for the Golden-winged Warbler. My models indicated a substantial influence of landscape conditions, including strong positive associations with total forest composition within the landscape. However, many of the associations I observed were counter to reported associations at finer spatial extents; for instance, I found Golden-winged Warblers negatively associated with several measures of edge habitat. No single spatial scale dominated, indicating that this species is responding to factors at multiple spatial scales. I found Golden-winged Warbler abundance was negatively related with Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera) abundance. I also observed a north-south spatial trend suggestive of a regional climate effect that was not previously noted for this species. The map of predicted abundance indicated a large area of concentrated abundance in west-central Wisconsin, with smaller areas of high abundance along the northern periphery of the Prairie Hardwood Transition. This map of predicted abundance compared favorably with independent evaluation data sets and can thus be used to inform regional planning efforts devoted to conserving this species.

AB  - Assessments of species distributions are crucial for informing conservation and management action. In this study, we used ensemble modelling to explain the distribution of Near Threatened Indo-Pacific (IP) bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in coastal waters at the North West Cape (NWC), Western Australia (WA), an area encompassing a marine protected area (MPA) and adjacent unprotected coastal waters. Analyses used dolphin sighting data collected during boat-based surveys conducted from 2013 to 2015 and 2018 to 2019. Overall, the distribution of IP bottlenose dolphins was best explained by distance to coast (up to 2,000 m) and distance to boat ramp (up to 7,000 m). Areas of high probability of occurrence for dolphins extended from the tip and down the eastern side of the NWC and overlapped with designated sanctuary zones as well as waters beyond the boundaries of the Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP). Distribution and habitat preferences varied slightly with season. In autumn, dolphin distribution was best explained by distance to coast and water depth with a higher likelihood of observing dolphins 1,000-2,000 m from the coast and in water depths of 7-10 m deep. During winter months, distance to coast (1,000-2,000 m) and sea surface temperature (SST) (21.5-23.5 degrees C) were the most important explanatory variables, with presence in coastal lagoons to the west of the NWC more likely than other seasons. During spring, areas of moderate to high probability of dolphin occurrence were mainly located outside the NMP, with marine park zone (outside the NMP and Sanctuary zones within the NMP, the two zones with the highest probability of IP bottlenose dolphin occurrence) and water depth (waters 7-13 m deep) best explaining dolphin distribution. This study highlights the importance of inshore areas of the NWC for IP bottlenose dolphins and the potential vulnerability of this species to increasing and cumulative anthropogenic stressors associated with these areas. Results of this study should be considered in future zoning reviews and adaptive management efforts of the NMP allowing for effective management of this Near Threatened species.

AB  - The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) provides one of the United States' greatest protected area networks for wildlife conservation. As climate changes beyond historical ranges of variability, refuge managers are confronted with assessing the utility of refuges, including how to best manage refuges both individually and as a system to help species cope with rapid change. Using published species distribution models, we projected species-specific changes in environmental suitability for 590 native North American bird species under a 2 degrees C future warming scenario (similar to 2050s under RCP8.5) at 525 refuges. For each species, we classified projected changes in suitability (i.e., improving, stable, or worsening suitability) and whether they crossed a model-derived persistence threshold at a refuge (i.e., potential colonization or potential extirpation). Overall, we found that a quarter of species (23% in summer, 26% in winter) could be different (i.e., turnover) across the refuge system despite protections. Summer and winter communities are not equally affected, so managers should consider different strategies for the different seasons. We forecast a slight net species loss in summer, from a mean of 109.0 +/- 0.8 to 102.0 +/- 0.7 species per refuge. In winter, we forecast a net gain in species, from a mean of 97.1 +/- 2.2 to 118.5 +/- 1.8 species per refuge. This includes an average of 12 species per refuge that may overwinter rather than migrate south. Refuges at northern latitudes will see relatively more turnover in species, while southern and coastal refuges will see fewer changes. Despite these species changes, dominant habitat association groups (e.g., waterbirds, forest birds) will generally stay the same across most of the NWRS. Some species may be lost from the entire NWRS and can benefit in the near term from targeted management. Regions of high extirpation and colonization (i.e., at northern latitudes) can be prioritized for strategic additions of new refuges.

AB  - Fish populations undertaking ontogenetic or spawning migrations pose challenges to marine protected area (MPA) planning because of the large extent of their distribution areas. There is a need to identify the juvenile and spawner hotspots of these populations that could be set aside as MPAs. Species distribution models making comprehensive use of available monitoring data and predicting the realized juvenile and spawner hotspots of migratory fish populations will assist resource managers with MPA planning. We developed a statistical modelling approach relying on multiple, regional monitoring datasets for assisting spatial protection efforts targeting the juveniles, spawners, or both life stages, of migratory fish species and species complexes. This approach predicts juvenile and spawner hotspot indices, and critical life stage (CLS) hotspot indices, which integrate both juvenile and spawner hotspot indices. We applied the approach to 11 vulnerable species of the grouper-snapper complex of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which all form fish spawning aggregations (FSAs). The CLS hotspot index was predicted to be highest in the Pulley Ridge and Flower Garden Banks areas, followed by the West Florida Shelf, southwestern Florida waters and portions of the Louisiana-Mississippi-Alabama shelf. The Pulley Ridge Habitat Area of Particular Concern and Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary are two important existing MPAs of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, whose possible expansion is being considered. The predicted CLS hotspot indices suggest that expanding these MPAs or increasing harvest regulations within them would offer substantial protection to both the juveniles and spawners of many FSA-forming species of the grouper-snapper complex. Synthesis and applications. As the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) continues to increase worldwide, statistical modelling approaches making comprehensive use of available data are urgently needed to support resource managers' abilities to establish sound and efficient spatial protection plans. The outputs of our statistical models can serve as inputs to conservation planning software packages seeking optimal marine protected areas configurations or can be directly employed by resource managers for formulating spatial protection plans.

AB  - Spatial patterns of beta diversity are a major focus of ecology. They can be especially valuable in conservation planning. In this study, we used a generalized dissimilarity modeling approach to analyze and predict the spatial patterns of beta diversity for commercially exploited, demersal marine species assemblages along the Tunisian coasts. For this study, we used a presence/absence dataset which included information on 174 species (invertebrates and fishes) and 9 environmental variables. We first performed the modeling analyses and assessed beta diversity using the turnover component of the Jaccard's dissimilarity index. We then performed nonmetric multidimensional scaling to map predicted beta diversity. To delineate the biogeographical regions, we used fuzzy cluster analysis. Finally, we also identified a set of indicator species which characterized the species assemblages in each identified biogeographical region. The predicted beta diversity map revealed two patterns: an inshore-offshore gradient and a south-north latitudinal gradient. Three biogeographical regions were identified and 14 indicator species. These results constitute a first contribution of the bioregionalisation of the Tunisian waters and highlight the issues associated with current fisheries management zones and conservation strategies. Results could be useful to follow an Ecosystem Based Management approach by proposing an objective spatial partitioning of the Tunisian waters. This partitioning could be used to prioritize the adjustment of the actual fisheries management entities, identify current data gaps, inform future scientific surveys and improve current MPA network.

AB  - There is high-level political support for the use of green infrastructure (GI) across Europe, to maintain viable populations and to provide ecosystem services (ES). Even though GI is inherently a spatial concept, the modern tools for spatial planning have not been recognized, such as in the recent European Environment Agency (EEA) report. We outline a toolbox of methods useful for GI design that explicitly accounts for biodiversity and ES. Data on species occurrence, habitats, and environmental variables are increasingly available via open-access internet platforms. Such data can be synthesized by statistical species distribution modeling, producing maps of biodiversity features. These, together with maps of ES, can form the basis for GI design. We argue that spatial conservation prioritization (SCP) methods are effective tools for GI design, as the overall SCP goal is cost-effective allocation of conservation efforts. Corridors are currently promoted by the EEA as the means for implementing GI design, but they typically target the needs of only a subset of the regional species pool. SCP methods would help to ensure that GI provides a balanced solution for the requirements of many biodiversity features (e.g., species, habitat types) and ES simultaneously in a cost-effective manner. Such tools are necessary to make GI into an operational concept for combating biodiversity loss and promoting ES.

AB  - Reserve site selection models can be enhanced by including habitat conditions that populations need for food, shelter, and reproduction. We present a new population protection function that determines whether minimum areas of land with desired habitat features are present within the desired spatial conditions in the protected sites. Embedding the protection function as a constraint in reserve site selection models provides a way to select sets of sites that satisfy these habitat requirements. We illustrate the mechanics and the flexibility of the protection function by embedding it in two linear-integer programming models for reserve site selection and applying the models to a case study of Myotis bat conservation on Lopez Island, United States. The models capture high-resolution, species-specific habitat requirements that are critical for Myotis persistence. The models help quantify the increasing marginal costs of protecting Myotis habitat and show that optimal site selection strategies are sensitive to the relative importance of habitat requirements.

AB  - The black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) is a keystone species of North American short- and mixed-grass temperate grasslands with critical importance for multiple species of conservation concern. Low population numbers due to habitat and social constraints as well as disease require conservation and management actions. To identify potential habitat and future relocation sites, we evaluated 6 statistical techniques to predict the optimal resource selection function model for black-tailed prairie dog habitat in 3 Native nations of Montana. Random forest models performed best across our study area and included grass coverage and climatic and topographic variables as the most important predictors of prairie dog occupancy. Using predictive habitat models in conjunction with land-use designations can refine conservation planning to support wildlife population objectives where there are foundations for long-term success. Our analysis also serves as a guide for assessing habitat suitability, connectivity, and restoration for additional species dependent or interconnected with black-tailed prairie dogs.

AB  - Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) are dependent on sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) for food and shelter during winter, yet few studies have assessed winter habitat selection, particularly at scales applicable to conservation planning. Small changes to availability of winter habitats have caused drastic reductions in some sage-grouse populations. We modeled winter habitat selection by sage-grouse in Alberta, Canada, by using a resource selection function. Our purpose was to 1) generate a robust winter habitat-selection model for Alberta sage-grouse; 2) spatially depict habitat suitability in a Geographic Information System to identify areas with a high probability of selection and thus, conservation importance; and 3) assess the relative influence of human development, including oil and gas wells, in landscape models of winter habitat selection. Terrain and vegetation characteristics, sagebrush cover, anthropogenic landscape features, and energy development were important in top Akaike's Information Criterion-selected models. During winter, sage-grouse selected dense sagebrush cover and homogenous less rugged areas, and avoided energy development and 2-track truck trails. Sage-grouse avoidance of energy development highlights the need for comprehensive management strategies that maintain suitable habitats across all seasons.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is performed to limit potential impacts of development projects on species and ecosystem functions. However, the methods related to EIA actually pay little attention to the landscape-scale effects of development projects on biodiversity. In this study we proposed a methodological framework to more properly address the landscape-scale impacts of a new stadium project in Lyon (France) on two representative mammal species exemplary for the endemic fauna, the red squirrel and the Eurasian badger. Our approach combined species distribution model using Mutant and landscape functional connectivity model using Graphab at two spatial scales to assess habitat connectivity before and after development project implementation. The development project had a negative impact on landscape connectivity: overall habitat connectivity (PC index) decreased by -6.8% and -1.8% and the number of graph components increased by +60.0% and +17.6% for the red squirrel and the European badger respectively, because some links that formerly connected habitat patches were cut by the development project. Changes affecting landscape structure and composition emphasized the need to implement appropriate avoidance and reduction measures. Our methodology provides a useful tool both for EIA studies at each step of the way to support decision-making in landscape conservation planning. The method could be also developed in the design phase to compare the effectiveness of different avoidance or mitigation measures and resize them if necessary to maximize habitat connectivity.

AB  - Fish hosts are critical for freshwater mussels. However, correlation between mussel and fish species richness (SR) is variable. Here, we examine how the environment affects this variability. We calculated mussel-fish SR ratios for 459 stream sites to capture the different responses of mussel and fish SR to environmental variables. We used Random-Forests (RF) to model how the SR ratio varied with environmental gradients. We also modeled the percent SR of mussel guilds with different hosting and life-history strategies. The SR ratio was generally low, but highly variable across sites. The ratio variability strongly affected mussel-fish SR correlations and can be explained by environmental factors. Given that environmental gradients also differ among datasets or regions, mussel-fish SR correlation can be expected to vary. The responses of the SR of mussel guilds agree with the expectations. However, land-use and climate co-vary with other environmental variables, and their effects are difficult to assess. We conclude that mussel and fish respond differently to many environmental variables; the importance of fish SR to mussel SR may vary with the environmental settings of streams but often appears to be low. Thus, environmental data may be generally sufficient for mussel-SR modelling and mussel diversity conservation planning.

AB  - The allocation of land to biological diversity conservation competes with other land uses and the needs of society for development, food, and extraction of natural resources. Trade-offs between biological diversity conservation and alternative land uses are unavoidable, given the realities of limited conservation resources and the competing demands of society. We developed a conservation-planning assessment for the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal, which forms the central component of the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany biological diversity hotspot. Our objective was to enhance biological diversity protection while promoting sustainable development and providing spatial guidance in the resolution of potential policy conflicts over priority areas for conservation at risk of transformation. The conservation-planning assessment combined spatial-distribution models for 646 conservation features, spatial economic-return models for 28 alternative land uses, and spatial maps for 4 threats. Nature-based tourism businesses were competitive with other land uses and could provide revenues of >US$60 million/year to local stakeholders and simultaneously help meeting conservation goals for almost half the conservation features in the planning region. Accounting for opportunity costs substantially decreased conflicts between biological diversity, agricultural use, commercial forestry, and mining. Accounting for economic benefits arising from conservation and reducing potential policy conflicts with alternative plans for development can provide opportunities for successful strategies that combine conservation and sustainable development and facilitate conservation action.

AB  - Predicting where threatened species occur is useful for making informed conservation decisions. However, because they are usually rare, surveying threatened species is often expensive and time intensive. Here, we show how regions where common species exhibit high genetic and morphological divergence among populations can be used to predict the occurrence of species of conservation concern. Intraspecific variation of common species of birds, bats and frogs from Ecuador were found to be a significantly better predictor for the occurrence of threatened species than suites of environmental variables or the occurrence of amphibians and birds. Fully 93 per cent of the threatened species analysed had their range adequately represented by the geographical distribution of the morphological and genetic variation found in seven common species. Both higher numbers of threatened species and greater genetic and morphological variation of common species occurred along elevation gradients. Higher levels of intraspecific divergence may be the result of disruptive selection and/or introgression along gradients. We suggest that collecting data on genetic and morphological variation in common species can be a cost effective tool for conservation planning, and that future biodiversity inventories include surveying genetic and morphological data of common species whenever feasible.

AB  - Understanding the environmental contributors to population structure is of paramount importance for conservation in urbanized environments. We used spatially explicit models to determine genetic population structure under current and future environmental conditions across a highly fragmented, human-dominated environment in Southern California to assess the effects of natural ecological variation and urbanization. We focused on 7 common species with diverse habitat requirements, home-range sizes, and dispersal abilities. We quantified the relative roles of potential barriers, including natural environmental characteristics and an anthropogenic barrier created by a major highway, in shaping genetic variation. The ability to predict genetic variation in our models differed among species: 11-81% of intraspecific genetic variation was explained by environmental variables. Although an anthropogenically induced barrier (a major highway) severely restricted gene flow and movement at broad scales for some species, genetic variation seemed to be primarily driven by natural environmental heterogeneity at a local level. Our results show how assessing environmentally associated variation for multiple species under current and future climate conditions can help identify priority regions for maximizing population persistence under environmental change in urbanized regions.

AB  - Acridid communities are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance and the community structure of acridids plays vital role in functioning the forest ecosystem. They are potentially useful bioindicators for conservation planning and habitat disturbances. Acridid assemblages of three different habitat types based on degree of disturbance as follows five natural sites, five moderately disturbed sites and five highly disturbed sites in Chaupahari forest, West Bengal, India were studied. Diversity, abundance, equitability and species richness of acridid were observed in respect to undisturbed and disturbed habitats. The species richness and diversity of the sites tracked the intensity of disturbance, the greatest value being associated with the natural site followed by the moderately disturbed site and highly disturbed site. The highest species richness and diversity index indicate the suitable habitat for acridid population. Statistical analysis infers that different species show different behavior and the sites are also different in relation to different habitat types.

AB  - Biodiversity is being threatened by human activities worldwide. Inside protected areas, anthropogenic activities are mostly under control. However, outside protected areas, threatened or endangered species still need protection, and identification of a species' habitat requirements is essential for conservation planning. We gathered information on habitat characteristics of and anthropogenic threats to the Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla), a critically endangered species for which such baseline data are scarce. We found closed-canopy forest nearest water sources at an altitude from 555 to 1,740 m to be suitable habitat for Chinese pangolins. Forest fires, livestock grazing, distance to nearest footpath, and distance to nearest household were negatively associated with presence of Chinese pangolins. To protect the Chinese pangolin outside of the reserve system, we recommend public awareness programs and campaigns to protect habitat in addition to directly protecting this species against hunting and trading.

AB  - Threatened species with restricted ranges are at risk from habitat fragmentation and loss, which amplifies genetic bottleneck and impacts of small changes to their environments. Ecological models including population viability analyses (PVAs) can predict the trajectory of populations in a way that is not invasive or detrimental to the study species. They can therefore be a vital tool in modeling populations for conservation purposes. Although habitat suitability models have been used in studies to suggest areas for protected area designation, PVAs are generally not used in this regard. Dryophytes suweonensis and Dryophytes flaviventris are two threatened treefrog species endemic to the Korean Peninsula. The two species face threats of habitat loss and degradation and predation by invasive species among others. We used an integrated modeling approach combining ecological niche, connectivity, and PVAs in Vortex to determine the likelihood of extinction of each species under baseline and protected area designation scenarios. Designation scenarios were simulated in Vortex through halting future reduction in carrying capacity (halting future degradation to sites through protected area status), reducing effects of catastrophes (mitigating the effects of drought), and reducing mortality rates (controlling invasive predator populations and ex situ raising of tadpoles to maturity). We classified the combination of these management efforts as "active management" as opposed to "no management," which is currently being practiced. We additionally used a stepwise approach to determine designation priority of individual patches. Under current conditions (no management), the resulting effective metapopulations after 100 years were 167 +/- 325 individuals with an 86.5% extinction probability for D. suweonensis and 165 +/- 200 individuals with a 90.3% extinction probability for D. flaviventris. Under active management of all sites (93 sites covering 426.9 km(2)), the extinction probability was 0% for both species with significantly increased metapopulation sizes, 15 910 +/- 2855 for D. suweonensis, and 4400 +/- 874 for D. flaviventris. Determining designation priority can inform the regulatory bodies on which habitat to designate and whether active or passive management should be applied. Without intervention, these species will be likely to face imminent extinction. In addition to being useful for government-imposed conservation management, our study can be followed by future studies as a methodology for prioritizing sites for protected area designation.

AB  - The world's freshwater molluscan fauna is facing unprecedented threats from habitat loss and degradation. Declines in native populations are mostly attributed to the human impact, which results in reduced water quality. The objectives of our survey were to analyse the structure of the mollusc communities in a medium-sized lowland river and to determine the most important environmental variables at different spatial scales, including landscape structure, catchment land use and instream environmental factors that influence their structure. Our survey showed that a medium-sized river, that flows through areas included in the European Ecological Natura 2000 Network Programme of protected sites, provides diverse instream habitats and niches that support 47 mollusc species including Unio crassus, a bivalve of Community interest, whose conservation requires the designation of a special conservation area under the Habitats Directive Natura 2000. This survey showed that mollusc communities are impacted by several environmental variables that act together at multiple scales. The landscape structure within buffer zones, catchment land use and instream environmental variables were all important and influenced the structure of mollusc communities. Therefore, they should all be taken into consideration in the future restoration of the river, future management projects and programmes for the conservation of biodiversity in running waters. The results of this study may be directly applicable for the rehabilitation of river ecosystems and are recommended to stakeholders in their future decision concerning landscape planning, monitoring species and their habitats, conservation plans and management in accordance with the requirements of sustainable development.

AB  - 1. Although it is widely recognized that protection may enhance size, abundance, and diversity of fish, its effect on spatial heterogeneity of fish assemblages and species turnover is still poorly understood.
   2. Here the effect of full protection within a Mediterranean marine protected area on beta-diversity patterns of fish assemblages along a depth gradient comparing a no-take zone with multiple unprotected areas is explored. The no-take zone showed significantly higher synecological parameters, higher beta-diversity among depths, and lower small-scale heterogeneity of fish assemblages relative to unprotected areas.
   3. Such patterns might likely depend on the high level of fishing pressure outside the no-take zone, as also abundance-biomass curves seemed to indicate. Results suggested that full protection could play a role in maintaining high beta-diversity, thus reducing the fragility of marine communities and ecosystems, and spatial heterogeneity may represent a reliable predictor of how management actions could provide insurance against undesirable phase shifts.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are essential for safeguarding marine biodiversity. Various international and regional agreements require that nations designate sufficient marine areas under protection. Assessing the functionality and coherence of MPA networks is challenging, unless extensive data on species and habitats is available. We evaluated the efficiency of the Finnish MPA network by utilizing a unique dataset of similar to 140,000 samples, recently collected by the Finnish Inventory Programme for the Underwater Marine Environment, VELMU. Using the quantitative conservation planning and the spatial prioritization method Zonation, we identified sites of high biodiversity and developed a balanced ranking of marine conservation values. Only 27% of the ecologically most valuable features were covered by the current MPA network. Based on the analyses, a set of expansion sites were identified that efficiently complement the ecological and geographical gaps in the current MPA network. Increasing protected sea area by just one percent point, would double the mean conservation cover, and specifically increase the protection levels of habitat types based on IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, key species, threatened species and fish reproduction areas. We also discovered that a large part of ecologically valuable species, such as many brown and red algae, blue mussels and eelgrass, exist in the underwater parts of rocky islands and sandy shores. These areas do not belong to the present (Finnish) interpretation of the habitats (e.g., reefs and underwater sandbanks) listed in the EU Habitats Directive. Neglecting these environments may lead to lack of protection of functionally important biodiversity. We emphasize that, in addition to establishing MPAs, also ecosystembased marine spatial planning is needed to safeguard the integrity of marine biodiversity in the northern Baltic Sea. The spatial prioritization maps produced in this study are essentially environmental value maps which can also be used in impact avoidance, such as siting of wind energy and aquaculture, or in avoiding overfishing in the most valuable fish areas. Our approach and analytical procedure can be replicated in the Baltic Sea or elsewhere provided that sufficient data exist.

AB  - In this study, the vegetation of the Natural Monument and Protected Landscape Loma de Las Tapias (San Juan Province), is described. This protected area was created with the aim to protect the landscape of huayquerias (badlands) and the fossiliferous deposits comprising vertebrate fossils from the Middle Pliocene. To analyze the vegetation, 43 inventories were carried out following the Braun-Blanquet (1979) field methodology, recording environmental variables such as slope, associated geological formation, altitude and vegetal cover. The inventories were grouped through multivariate dendrogrammetric analysis. A total of 72 species of vascular plants was registered. The general physiognomy of the vegetation corresponds to an open xerophilous shrubland dominated by species of Zygophyllaceae and Fabaceae accompanied by other shrubs, cacti and an open herbaceous layer, typical of the Phytogeographic Monte Province. Four vegetation units were detected through the multivariate analysis; these units were related to geology, altitude, slope and plant cover. Since this document could be used by the provincial authorities in charge of the protected area, some topics related to the conservation and use of the area are finally discussed.

AB  - Questions: Does the vegetation composition of the forests of Nandiar Valley correlate with climatic, topographic and edaphic variables? Is it possible to identify plant communities through indicator species in relation to environmental gradients? Can this approach of classification and ordination will be helpful for conservation planning?
   Location Forests of Nandiar Valley, Moist temperate Western Himalayas Pakistan.
   Methods: Eighty stands were selected for quantitative and qualitative characteristic of vegetation between an elevations of 525-3817 m. Species composition was recorded by using 400 m long transects. GPS, climatic, edaphic and topographic data were recorded for each sampling site. The relationship between habitat types, species composition and distribution along with climatic, edaphic and topographic variables were analyzed using TWINSPAN, Cluster analysis and DCA ordination.
   Results: Sum 325 vascular plants species belonging to 97 families were recorded. Diversity index and species richness was maximum in the moist temperate zone. Classification and ordination showed that the variance in species data was 7.07. Two-ways indicator species analysis classified the vegetation into eight plant communities. Indicator species analysis revealed that slope aspect, wind speed, temperature, dew point, wet bulb, pH, organic matter and phosphorous were the strongest parameters (p <= 0.05) determining plant community composition and indicator species in each habitat. The results also show the strength of the environment species relationship using Monte Carlo procedures. DCA ordination grouped different species having similar habitat and habitats having common species.
   Conclusions: The multivariate analysis of the vegetation along with environmental variables of Nandiar valley confirmed the indicators of each sort of vegetation communities/microclimatic zones which could further be used in conservation planning and management not only in studied area but also in the adjacent regions as well as in the areas exhibit similar sort of climatic, edaphic and topographic conditions.

AB  - With the implementation of marine spatial planning in many coastal regions of the world, there is a need to understand how marine species and communities respond to environmental heterogeneity. Predictive modelling approaches are one efficient method for associating marine communities with variations across the seascape. These approaches, along with increasing access to spatially explicit environmental data, provide improved opportunities for modelling fish assemblages. Baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) are a popular means of gathering fish assemblage data in the coastal zone, but have biases in bait attraction, trophic groups sampled, and behavioral conditions. To account for these biases, spatial and temporal scales of analyses must be considered. In this study, we combined time-series BRUVS observations with seafloor and oceanographic variables in generalized additive models to model patterns of relative species richness and abundance in temperate coastal fish assemblages across multiple habitat types, functional trophic groups, and spatial scales from 5-500 m. We show that the spatial and temporal scale of analyses and behavioral characteristics of target species (such as mobility) are important considerations when predicting the spatial distribution of a particular assemblage or functional subset. The resulting models performed well, with prediction accuracies up to 79% while explaining between 24 and 83 % of variance. These models were then used to extrapolate assemblage characteristics over broader areas of the seafloor to expand our understanding of fish distributions, providing valuable insights for marine spatial planning, including marine protected area assessment.

AB  - The Banc d'Arguin is a marine ecosystem of global conservation significance, the largest bird sanctuary of western Africa, supported by one of the most extensive seagrass beds in the world composed by three seagrass species, two temperate near their southern limit (Zostera noltei and Cymodocea nodosa) and one tropical at its northern limit (Halodule wrightii). Here we predict the fate of this seagrass ecosystem under climate change scenarios during the 21st century, using species distribution models and sea level rise estimates. We forecast a probable decline in total seagrass area of 3340 Km(2) (78%) by 2100, involving the loss of both temperate seagrasses (Z. noltei, C. nodosa), the foundational ecosystem components. By 2050, only the tropical species (H. wrightii) would remain, which forms thin and sparse shallow stands functionally distinct from the previous tall dense meadows that span wider vertical ranges. Intertidal flats, the essential bird foraging habitats, would become unvegetated and also suffer a major reduction in area (114 km(2) by 2050, 587 km(2) by 2100). The large projected loss of foundational seagrass species portends a collapse of major ecosystem functions with profound impacts on biodiversity, fishery resources and ecosystem services.

AB  - Sky islands are unique systems composed of well-defined biotic communities established along an elevation gradient. Habitat restrictions associated to climate change make the species vulnerable. This study aimed to forecast the changes in the distribution patterns, altitude and the slope effect in selected plant and vertebrate species inhabiting the sky island Sierra La Laguna as a result of the temperature increase in the near future. We modelled present-day and future potential geographic distributions of two sets of vertebrate and plant species one associated with dry warm conditions and another with cold conditions - using a maximum entropy algorithm. The future geographic distribution was modelled considering three global circulation models and two extreme representation concentration pathways. Our results showed an elevational change of species composition from cold to warm conditions, increasing the range of the xeric and decreasing of the mesic, with the potential extinction of the endemic species associated to the cooler conditions. The species associated to cooler environment probably could be restricted to the canyons in the western slope of the sierra, that might function as refugia. It is critical for the management of the protected area, and the restriction of human and economic activities in the western slope.

AB  - Protected areas have been established around the world to preserve samples of biodiversity from pressing threats. Yet the adequacy of protected area systems in many tropical nations is poorly understood, and assessments are usually focused on vertebrates. Here, we model the occurrence of 246 butterfly species, and determine the extent to which they occur in protected areas in Bangladesh, a country that forms part of the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. We develop ecological niche models, and measure overlap with protected areas using three methods to map species distributions (habitat suitability, area of occupancy, and extent of occurrence). Suitability maps identify the north-east and south-east regions as the main centres of butterfly diversity, yet there is marked variation among families, and between non-threatened and threatened species. Using the suitability map approach, a mean of 1.27% of the geographic range of species is covered by protected areas. Only two species (Euploea crameri and Danaus melanippus) have >15% coverage, 25% of species have no coverage and 70% of species have <1% coverage. Overall, protected area coverage is slightly higher for threatened species. Tracts of suitable, but unprotected habitat still exist in the north-east and south-east regions of Bangladesh, and designation of new protected areas in these regions will strengthen butterfly conservation in the country. Enhanced management of existing protected areas, and a strategy for conserving butterflies and other insects outside protected areas will also help secure the long-term future for biodiversity in Bangladesh.

AB  - There is a great need for accurate, comprehensive maps of seafloor habitat for use in fish stock assessments, marine protected area design, and other resource management pursuits. Recent advances in acoustic remote sensing technology have made it possible to obtain high-resolution (meter to sub-meter) digital elevation models (DEMs) of seafloor bathymetry that can rival or surpass those available for the terrestrial environment. The acquisition and processing of these data are expensive, however, requiring specialized equipment, expertise, and large amounts of both field and laboratory effort per unit area mapped. Further, the interpretation and classification of these data into maps of habitat type is typically (and appropriately) performed only by trained experts that are familiar with both seafloor geomorphology and the nature and limitations of the data sources. Because it is done visually, this interpretation can be very time-consuming and may yield subjective results that are not comparable from site-to-site or between individual interpreters.
   We applied an algorithmic terrain analysis approach to efficiently and objectively classify seafloor habitats using the quantifiable landscape metric Topographic Position Index (TPI). We used high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, together with precisely geolocated (+/- 5 m) ROV observations of fish distribution, to produce a preliminary genus-specific habitat suitability model for eight rockfish (Sebastes) species in the Del Monte shale beds of Monterey Bay, California. A high-resolution (2 m) multibeam bathymetry Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was generated and used to produce a derived TPI surface model using repeatable, algorithmic methods. This data layer, together with the positions and counts by species from 229 rockfish observations (2892 total fish) was then used to create preliminary predictive models of habitat suitability and fish distribution, as well as stock estimates for the study area. A second, independent fish observation data set was used to validate the models.

AB  - The South Sandwich Islands (SSI) are a chain of volcanic islands located to the east of the Scotia Sea, approximately 700 km south-east of South Georgia. To date, knowledge of the SSI benthic environment remains limited. In this context, the Blue Belt Programme conducted a scientific survey in the SSI Marine Protected Area (MPA) during February/March 2019 to examine the biodiversity and distribution of benthic communities and their potential vulnerability to licensed longline research fisheries. Here we report results from analysis of multibeam echosounder (MBES) data and drop camera imagery data collected in selected locations around the SSI. A total of eight vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) indicator morphotaxa were mapped along the slopes of the SSI, showing a substantial variation in taxon composition and frequency of occurrence, both along bathymetric and latitudinal gradients. Our results suggest that VME indicator taxa are mostly restricted to waters shallower than 700 m. As such, based on our present understanding of the region's benthic environment the MPA, as currently established, offers effective protection for the majority of the VME indicator taxa.

In this study, we investigate these threats and delineate priority areas for conservation by comparing current (1950-1999) with future (2080-2100) distribution predicted by climatic niche modelling. Distribution changes encompass centroid displacement of up to 1067 km, range contractions of up to 460 km(2), and fragmentation into up to 29 populations. Some felids may expand their distribution by up to 1016 km(2), which could facilitate the reconnection of isolated populations if appropriate management plans are implemented. The protected area network overlaps with just 5.85% of the current distribution of felids and would decline to 3.69% in the future scenario, necessitating an expansion of protected areas in areas of felids distribution. However, countries that are subject to the greatest landcover changes worldwide (e.g. Brazil, China, and India) are also home to the priority areas to felids conservation, underscoring the urgency and potential challenges of safeguarding felids.

AB  - Background: Identifying biodiversity hotspots on a local scale, using multiple data sources, and ecological niche modeling, has the potential to contribute to more effective nature reserve management.
   Methods: In this study, we used infrared-triggered camera trapping, field surveys, and interviews to create a dataset on the distribution of species (mammals and birds) in Hebei Wulingshan Nature Reserve (Hebei Province, China).
   Results: We identified 101 species (14 orders, 38 families), 64 of which (2,142 effective records) were selected for environmental niche modeling. All results were reclassified into three groups: "priority areas" (areas including the potential distributions of over 80% of species), ''important areas" (those with 50% of species), and "normal areas" (all other areas). Our results show that priority areas (1.31-1.82 km(2)) and important areas (7.73-21.44 km(2)) for conservation were mainly covered by the core and experimental zones of the reserve; additionally, a kilometer-wide margin around the outside of the nature reserve seems to be important to maintaining biodiversity.
   Discussion: We close by suggesting some actions for enhancing conservation of biodiversity in the reserve, including monitoring, strengthen law enforcements, introducing popular science, and co-operating with local people.

AB  - Due to the decline of fisheries throughout the world, there is an ever-increasing demand among fisheries managers for more and better data regarding the distribution and abundance of commercially important fishes. Along the Pacific coast of North America, there are insufficient stock data for most rockfish species, which compose one of the most valuable commercial and recreational fisheries in California. One approach being explored for increasing our understanding of fish distribution patterns and potentially generating stock assessment data over large areas is the use of habitat-based assessment. The general hypothesis is that because rockfish are not randomly distributed across habitats, it should be possible to model and predict their distribution and abundance based on habitat maps and biological data. Furthermore, to the extent that these models are robust and portable, they should be applicable across a variety of locations and physical settings. We attempt to test these hypotheses using predictive models created for two species of rockfish [Sebastes flavidus (yellowtail) and S. rosaceus (rosy)] within Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBMNS). These models, created as part of a recent study, were applied to and tested against distribution data from a previous study of the two species in question at Del Monte shalebeds in Monterey Bay, California. The general linear models (GLMs) were created using rugosity, slope, aspect, depth, and topographic position index analyses of bathymetric digital elevation along with presence/absence data for the two species of rockfish. The model for S. flavidus generated at CBNMS proved to be at least as efficient at predicting yellowtail rockfish distribution at Del Monte as in the setting in which it was created, while the model for S. rosaceus failed to predict rosy rockfish distribution at Del Monte with any reliability.
