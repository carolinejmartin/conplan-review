AB  - Natural Community Conservation Plans (NCCPs) represent the most powerful tool in statute for regional and systematic conservation planning for species at risk in California. This study examines the use of species conceptual models (SCMs) and species distribution models (SDMs) in such planning. Eighteen Natural Community Conservation Plans (NCCPs) were analyzed to determine if or how explicit connections were made between both types of models for a covered species and key components of its conservation strategy. Results indicate plans were strong in the use of SDMs, however, each deferred preparing or using SCMs to later management and monitoring phases. A more effective best planning practice for developing a conservation strategy is to explicitly integrate SCMs and SDMs during plan preparation.

AB  - The management of protected areas (PAs) is widely used in the conservation of endangered plant species under climate change. However, studies that have identified appropriate PAs for endangered fern species are rare. To address this gap, we must develop a work flow to plan appropriate PAs for endangered fern species that will be further impacted by climate change. Here, we used endangered fern species in China as a case study, and we applied conservation planning software coupled with endangered fern species distribution data and distribution modeling to plan conservation areas with high priority protection needs under climate change. We identified appropriate PAs for endangered fern species under climate change based on the IUCN protected area categories (from la to VI) and planned additional PAs for endangered fern species. The high priority regions for protecting the endangered fern species were distributed throughout southern China. With decreasing temperature seasonality, the priority ranking of all endangered fern species is projected to increase in existing PAs. Accordingly, we need to establish conservation areas with low climate vulnerability in existing PAs and expand the conservation areas for endangered fern species in the high priority conservation regions.

AB  - Most spatial conservation planning for wide-ranging or migratory species is constrained by poor knowledge of species' spatiotemporal dynamics and is only based on static species' ranges. However, species have substantial variation in abundance across their range and migratory species have important spatiotemporal population dynamics. With growing ecological data and advancing analytics, both of these can be estimated and incorporated into spatial conservation planning. However, there is limited information on the degree to which including this information affects conservation planning. We compared the performance of systematic conservation prioritizations for different scenarios based on varying the input species' distributions by ecological metric (abundance distributions versus range maps) and temporal sampling resolution (weekly, monthly, or quarterly). We used the example of a community of 41 species of migratory shorebirds that breed in North America, and we used eBird data to produce weekly estimates of species' abundances and ranges. Abundance distributions at a monthly or weekly resolution led to prioritizations that most efficiently protected species throughout the full annual cycle. Conversely, spatial prioritizations based on species' ranges required more sites and left most species insufficiently protected for at least part of their annual cycle. Prioritizations with only quarterly species ranges were very inefficient as they needed to target 40% of species' ranges to include 10% of populations. We highlight the high value of abundance information for spatial conservation planning, which leads to more efficient and effective spatial prioritization for conservation. Overall, we provide evidence that spatial conservation planning for wide-ranging migratory species is most robust and efficient when informed by species' abundance information from the full annual cycle.

AB  - The main role of conservation planning is to design reserve networks to protect biodiversity in situ. Research within the field of conservation planning has focused on the development of theories and tools to design reserve networks that protect biodiversity in an efficient and representative manner. Whilst much progress has been made in this regard, there has been limited assessment of the sensitivity of conservation planning outcomes to uncertainty associated with the datasets used for conservation planning. Predicted species distribution data are commonly used for conservation planning because the alternatives (e.g. survey data) are incomplete or biased spatially. However, there may be considerable uncertainty associated with the use of predicted species distribution data, particularly given the variety of approaches available to generate a dataset from such predictions for use in conservation planning. These approaches range from using the probabilistic data directly to using a threshold identified a priori or a posteriori to convert the probabilistic data to presence/absence data. We assess the sensitivity of conservation planning outcomes to different uses of predicted species distribution data. The resulting reserve networks differed, and had different expected species representation. The choice of approach will depend on how much risk a conservation planner is willing to tolerate and how much efficiency can be sacrificed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Systematic conservation planning is vital for allocating protected areas given the spatial distribution of conservation features, such as species. Due to incomplete species inventories, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used for predicting species' habitat suitability and species' probability of occurrence. Currently, SDMs mostly ignore spatial dependencies in species and predictor data. Here, we provide a comparative evaluation of how accounting for spatial dependencies, that is, autocorrelation, affects the delineation of optimized protected areas. Location Southeast Australia, Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf, Danube River Basin. Methods We employ Bayesian spatially explicit and non-spatial SDMs for terrestrial, marine and freshwater species, using realm-specific planning unit shapes (grid, hexagon and subcatchment, respectively). We then apply the software gurobi to optimize conservation plans based on species targets derived from spatial and non-spatial SDMs (10%-50% each to analyse sensitivity), and compare the delineation of the plans. Results Across realms and irrespective of the planning unit shape, spatially explicit SDMs (a) produce on average more accurate predictions in terms of AUC, TSS, sensitivity and specificity, along with a higher species detection probability. All spatial optimizations meet the species conservation targets. Spatial conservation plans that use predictions from spatially explicit SDMs (b) are spatially substantially different compared to those that use non-spatial SDM predictions, but (c) encompass a similar amount of planning units. The overlap in the selection of planning units is smallest for conservation plans based on the lowest targets and vice versa. Main conclusions Species distribution models are core tools in conservation planning. Not surprisingly, accounting for the spatial characteristics in SDMs has drastic impacts on the delineation of optimized conservation plans. We therefore encourage practitioners to consider spatial dependencies in conservation features to improve the spatial representation of future protected areas.

AB  - Aim Species' distributions are generally treated as static for the purposes of prioritization, but many species such as migrants and nomads have distributions that shift over time. Decisions about priority actions for such species must account for this temporal variation, making planning for their conservation a complex problem. Here, we explore how dynamic distributions can be incorporated into a spatial prioritization, and suggest approaches for prioritizing conservation action when knowledge of species' movements is uncertain.
   Location Australian rangelands, including the arid and semi-arid zones of central Australia and adjoining monsoonal tropics, although methods are applicable for any dynamic biodiversity feature.
   Methods We used the decision-support software MARXAN to explore the impact of temporal dynamics on spatial conservation planning for a suite of 42 highly mobile birds across the study region. We explored scenarios comparing a static representation of species' distributions with four methods of integrating temporal dynamics: (1) accounting for temporal variability in distribution across months and years, (2) considering only monthly variability in distribution, (3) considering only annual variability in distribution and (4) considering only minimal distributions during spatial bottlenecks, ignoring distributions at other times.
   Results Incorporating the temporal dynamics of species into spatial prioritization substantially changes the spatial pattern of conservation investment, increasing the overall area needed to be placed under conservation measures to achieve a specific target level of species protection. Targeting bottlenecks, locations critical to each species when its distribution is at a minimum, prioritizes a very different suite of sites to those chosen using the traditional approach of static distribution maps based on occurrences pooled across time.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight the need to consider dynamic movements in the conservation planning process to ensure that mobile species are adequately protected. A static approach to conservation planning may misdirect resources and lead to inadequate conservation for mobile species.

AB  - 1. Accounting for genetic diversity and evolutionary processes has long been recognised as an important goal in conservation planning. However, because genetic data are often lacking, surrogate approaches are widely used. Few studies have, however, assessed the capacity of surrogate data, such as higher taxonomic levels (e.g. species distributions) to portray intraspecific genetic diversity.
   2. Here, we contrast conservation plans based on traditional species distribution data, with those derived from intraspecific genetic data for a smaller subset of species, both using freshwater fish in northern Australia. We modelled the spatial distribution of 46 species and intraspecific genetic diversity within four common species. We then identified priority areas for conservation using both data sets and evaluated the extent to which solutions obtained from species distribution data portrayed genetic diversity.
   3. We found that genetic diversity could be adequately represented within priority areas identified using species distribution data, even at low conservation targets and for species with complex genetic structure. However, this was only true when using the entire fish community (i.e. all 46 species). In contrast, a substantial component of the genetic structure would not be represented in conservation priority areas when using a subset of species.
   4. Our results have important implications for the use of surrogates for genetic diversity in conservation planning. Sufficient genetic diversity might be represented in conservation priority areas by including a broad range of species with distributions ranging from common to rare elements in the community in the prioritisation analyses. We recommend focusing on improving accuracy of data on species distributions to reduce uncertainties in conservation recommendations derived from commission and omission errors, to avoid misuse of limited conservation funds and potential failure of conservation practice.

AB  - Conservation planning analyses often employ data on biodiversity and sometimes vulnerability and these data are generally assumed to be accurate and correct. Here, different ways of exploring uncertainty associated with typical input data used for conservation planning are illustrated. First the uncertainty associated with predicted species distribution data is measured, summarised, and visualised. Second the uncertainty associated with the choice of vulnerability model is evaluated using Bayesian Model Averaging and the implication of this uncertainty on inference about key relationships associated with native forest conversion is assessed. The approaches used to assess uncertainty are applicable to any conservation planning exercise and such assessments will increase confidence in the products developed and reduce the risk that conservation effort is misdirected.

AB  - Decisions regarding the level of detail included in conservation planning and the importance given to feasibility considerations can greatly influence management in terms of total area required, achievement of conservation targets and costs. This work had two main objectives: (1) to compare priority sites proposed by the Chilean commission for the environment in a politically driven process to the results of alternative systematic conservation planning scenarios; and (2) to compare the efficacy of systematic conservation planning based on different types of conservation targets (forest types and bird species) and minimum area thresholds. To address these issues, we used vegetation cover as well as field data on forest birds in central Chile. Bird species distributions were modeled using a variety of climatic and environmental layers, allowing for the integration of environmental heterogeneity into the planning process. We then ran several conservation planning scenarios considering conservation targets based on vegetation types alone, birds alone, or a combination of vegetation and birds. Collectively these results show that conservation planning results differ significantly when considering birds or vegetation types, and that minimum area requirements for each conservation feature has a great influence on the final results. Moreover, important conservation sites are not represented in the current government plan, and these sites are related to the small representation of rare vegetation types. This study suggests that using appropriate minimum area requirements can greatly affect the results of a conservation planning exercise and therefore represents a key knowledge gap in the region.

AB  - To accommodate climate-driven changes in biological communities, conservation plans are increasingly making use of models to predict species' responses to climate change. To date, species distribution models have been the most commonly used approach for assessing species' vulnerability to climate change. Biological trait-based approaches, which have emerged recently, and which include consideration of species' sensitivity and adaptive capacity, provide alternative and potentially conflicting vulnerability assessments and present conservation practitioners and planners with difficult choices. Here we discuss the differing objectives and strengths of the approaches, and provide guidance to conservation practitioners for their application. We outline an integrative methodological framework for assessing climate change impacts on species that uses both traditional species distribution modelling approaches and biological trait-based assessments. We show how these models can be used conceptually as inputs to guide conservation monitoring and planning. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective conservation planning requires biotic data across an entire region. In data-poor ecosystems conservation planning is informed by using environmental surrogates (e.g. temperature) predominantly in two ways: to develop habitat classification schemes (1) or develop species distribution models (2). We test the utility of both approaches for conservation planning of marine ecosystems, and rank environmental surrogates, such as depth and distance from shore, according to their power to predict the distribution and abundance of biotic species. Specifically, we compared a habitat classification scheme; based on coarse levels of habitat types derived from depth and distance from shore; against species distribution models, which predict fish abundance and prevalence as a function of environmental surrogates (depth, distance from shore, latitude, reef area, zoning, and several metrics of habitat structural complexity). We consistently set conservation target levels to 21% of each conservation feature, following global standards and a sensitivity analyses. Thus when running scenarios to protect fish species we aimed to protect at least 21% of each species, and when running scenarios of habitat classes, we aimed to protect at least 21% of each habitat class. We found that when aiming to protect 21% of the chosen conservation targets, distribution models protected 21% of the predicted abundance/occurrence of all modelled species and functional groups, but did not protect most habitats. Contrastingly, using a habitat classification scheme protected 21% of all habitat types and 34% of all species and functional groups, but required protecting three times more area. Thus, using only distribution models as targets in data-poor ecosystems could be a risky conservation planning strategy. Ultimately the best conservation outcomes were achieved by incorporating local knowledge to synthesize the conservation outcomes of both scenarios.

AB  - Identifying priority conservation areas plays a significant role in conserving biodiversity under climate change, but uncertainties create challenges for conservation planning. To reduce uncertainties in the conservation planning framework, we developed an adaptation index to assess the effect of topographic complexity on species adaptation to climate change, which was incorporated into the conservation framework as conservation costs. Meanwhile, the species distributions were predicted by the Maxent model, and the priority conservation areas were optimized during different periods in Sichuan province by the Marxan model. Our results showed that the effect of topographic complexity was critical for species adaptation, but the adaptation index decreased with the temperature increase. Based on the conservation targets and costs, the distributions of priority conservation areas were mainly concentrated in mountainous areas around the Sichuan Basin where may be robust to the adaptation to climate change. In the future, the distributions of priority conservation areas had no evident changes, accounting for about 26% and 28% of the study areas. Moreover, most species habitats could be conserved in terms of conservation targets in these priority conservation areas. Therefore, our approach could achieve biodiversity conservation goals and be highly practical. More importantly, quantifying the effect of topography also is critical for options for planning conservation areas in response to climate change.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) have been selected using either subjective or objective criteria applied to an extremely limited subset of biodiversity. Improved availability of species distribution data, better statistical tools to predict species distributions and algorithms to optimize spatial conservation planning allow many impediments to be overcome, particularly on small islands. This study analyses whether 219 species are adequately protected by PAs on Pico Island (the Azores, Portugal), and if they are as efficient as possible, maximizing species protection while minimizing costs. We performed distribution modelling of species' potential distributions, proposed individual conservation targets (considering the context of each species in the archipelago and their current conservation status) to determine the efficiency of current PAs in meeting such targets and identify alternative or complementary areas relevant for conservation. Results showed that current PAs do not cover all taxa, leaving out important areas for conservation. We demonstrate that by using optimization algorithms it is possible to include most species groups in spatial conservation planning in the Azores with the current resources. With increasing availability of data and methods, this approach could be readily extended to other islands and regions with high endemism levels.

AB  - With the high rate of ecosystem change already occurring and predicted to occur in the coming decades, long-term conservation has to account not only for current biodiversity but also for the biodiversity patterns anticipated for the future. The trade-offs between prioritising future biodiversity at the expense of current priorities must be understood to guide current conservation planning, but have been largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we compared the performance of four conservation planning solutions involving 662 vertebrate species in the Wet Tropics Natural Resource Management Cluster Region in north-eastern Australia. Input species data for the four planning solutions were: 1) current distributions; 2) projected distributions for 2055; 3) projected distributions for 2085; and 4) current, 2055 and 2085 projected distributions, and the connectivity between each of the three time periods for each species. The four planning solutions were remarkably similar (up to 85% overlap), suggesting that modelling for either current or future scenarios is sufficient for conversation planning for this region, with little obvious trade-off. Our analyses also revealed that overall, species with small ranges occurring across steep elevation gradients and at higher elevations were more likely to be better represented in all solutions. Given that species with these characteristics are of high conservation significance, our results provide confidence that conservation planning focused on either current, near-or distant-future biodiversity will account for these species.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems show more biodiversity loss than terrestrial or marine systems. We present a systematic conservation planning analysis in the Arctic Ocean drainage basin in Ontario, Canada, to identify key watersheds for the conservation of 30 native freshwater fish, including four focal species: lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, brook trout, and walleye. We created species distribution models for 30 native fish species and accounted for anthropogenic impacts. We used the "prioritizr" package in R to select watersheds that maximize species targets, minimize impacts, and meet area-based targets based on the Convention on Biological Diversity commitment to protect 17% of terrestrial and freshwater areas by 2020 and the proposed target to protect 30% by 2030. We found that, on average, 17.4% and 29.8% of predicted species distributions were represented for each of the 30 species in the 17% and 30% area-based solutions, respectively. The outcomes were more efficient when we prioritized for individual species, particularly brook trout, where 24% and 36% of its predicted distribution was represented in the 17% and 30% solutions, respectively. Future conservation planning should consider climate change, culturally significant species and areas, and the importance of First Nations as guardians and stewards of the land in northern Ontario.

AB  - In a perfect world, systematic conservation planning would use complete information on the distribution of biodiversity. However, information on most species is grossly incomplete. Two main types of distribution data are frequently used in conservation planning: observed and predicted distribution data. A fundamental question that planners face is - which kind of data is better under what circumstances? We used simulation procedures to analyse the effects of using different types of distribution data on the performance of reserve selection algorithms in scenarios using different reserve selection problems, amounts of species distribution known. conservation targets and costs. To compare these scenarios we used occurrence data from 25 amphibian and 41 reptile species of the Iberian Peninsula and assumed the available data represented the whole truth. We then sampled fractions of these data and either used them as they were, or converted them to modelled predicted distributions. This enabled us to build three other types of species distribution data sets commonly used in conservation planning: "predicted", "transformed predicted" and "mixed". Our results suggest that reserve selection performance is sensitive to the type of species distribution data used and that the most cost-efficient decision depends most on the reserve selection problem and on how much we have of the species distribution data. Choosing the most appropriate type of distribution data should start by evaluating the scenario circumstances. While there is no one best approach for every scenario, we discovered that using a mixed approach usually provides an acceptable compromise between species representation and cost.

AB  - Aim To assess how the inclusion of predicted climate-change-related range shifts alters the spatial prioritization of habitats and predicted biodiversity benefits from systematic conservation planning under alternative realized climates.
   Location Victoria, Australia.
   Methods We combined predicted distribution patterns of freshwater fish under multiple climate scenarios with marginal benefit conservation planning algorithms to compare conservation outcomes from multiple planning scenarios based on predicted present and future range-shifted distributions. For each of these planning options, we examined the outcomes under a range of possible realized climates.
   Results Expected conservation outcomes under future climate scenarios were always better when potential range shifts were incorporated into the planning process, irrespective of which climate scenario was realized. However, the differences in conservation outcomes between planning strategies were often small, and expected conservation outcomes always were worse under altered climate scenarios than under a stable baseline climate scenario. River segments with variable rankings across planning scenarios reflected areas where risks of maladaptive prioritization are potentially high.
   Main conclusions This study highlights that greatest conservation gains will come from ongoing efforts to limit the degree of global warming. Nevertheless, within the constraints imposed by a changing climate, the inclusion of future range shifts in conservation plans can help insure against ineffective and potentially maladaptive prioritization decisions. The acknowledged caveats around statistical predictions of species distributions and range shifts also need to be considered when acting on the outputs from modelled predictions such as these.

AB  - Plant species play an important role in maintaining the stability of arid ecosystems. Due to low biodiversity, species distribution patterns and richness are infrequently investigated in arid lands. Here, we take the Xinjiang Urgur Autonomous Region (Province), a large area in arid northwest China, as a case to investigate the patterns of woody species diversity and their relationship to environmental factors. At the same time, we aim to evaluate the current protected areas network and improve conservation planning based on woody plant diversity of Xinjiang. In this study, we sampled 133 woody forest species and 220 woody xerophytic species, which are about 10% of the plant species and near 80% of woody species in this region, and modeled current and last glacial maximum (LGM) distributions of these species using the method of species distribution modeling (SDM). Based on the results of SDMs, species richness and LGM refugia were estimated for forest and xerophytic species. Then, we assessed correlations between current species richness and environmental variables as well as glacial refugia. Finally, we applied the digital approach of systematic conservation planning to determine priority areas based on patterns of species diversity. Precipitation variables and glacial refugia have influenced the distribution patterns of woody species diversity for forest and xerophytic species in this province. In our proposed network for biodiversity conservation, high priority areas mostly coincided with zones having low species diversity, and many of these concerned areas fall outside of the ranges of the current existing conservation network.

AB  - Effective decision-making in conservation often is constrained by data quality. Uncertainties associated with poor quality or sparse data can lead to the misuse of limited resources and potentially the failure of conservation practice. Data acquisition, which can help improve decision-making, is constrained by limited budgets and time. This is especially concerning for rare species, the most in need of conservation, but the most difficult to accurately represent in conservation plans. Here we test the suitability of three different sampling design strategies (two systematic vs random) designed to improve the quality of information available for conservation planning involving rare species. We modelled the spatial distribution of freshwater fish species in a data rich area in northern Australia using a large dataset (representing the best attainable data or true distribution) and simulate increasing subsets of data acquired through the three alternative sampling designs. We then evaluated omission and commission errors in conservation planning outcomes, efficiency and return on investment of data acquisition for conservation planning outcomes obtained from the different data availability x sampling design strategies. Even though we were able to find new species more effectively through systematic sampling designs, this did not 1) translate into reduced errors in conservation planning outcomes for rare species and 2) meet our goal of enhancing cost-effectiveness of conservation planning. Our results suggest that collecting more biodiversity data, irrespective of the sampling design used, does not necessarily reduce data uncertainty issues and could lead to the misuse of the limited resources and ultimately the failure of conservation practice.

AB  - Although China has established more than 600 wetland nature reserves, conservation gaps still exist for many species, especially for freshwater fishes. Underlying this problem is the fact that top-level planning is missing in the construction of nature reserves. To promote the development of nature reserves for fishes, this study took the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLYRB) as an example to carry out top-level reserve network planning for fishes using approaches of systematic conservation planning. Typical fish species living in freshwater habitats were defined and considered in the planning. Based on sample data collected from large quantities of literatures, continuous distribution patterns of 142 fishes were obtained with species distribution modeling and subsequent processing, and the distributions of another eleven species were artificially designated. With the distribution pattern of species, Marxan was used to carry out conservation planning. To obtain ideal solutions with representativeness, persistence, and efficiency, parameters were set with careful consideration regarding existing wetland reserves, human disturbances, hydrological connectivity, and representation targets of species. Marxan produced the selection frequency of planning units (PUs) and a best solution. Selection frequency indicates the relative protection importance of a PU. The best solution is a representative of ideal fish reserve networks. Both of the PUs with high selection frequency and those in the best solution have low proportions included in existing wetland nature reserves, suggesting that there are significant conservation gaps for fish species in MLYRB. The best solution could serve as a reference for establishing a fish reserve network in the MLYRB. There is great flexibility for replacing selected PUs in the solution, and such flexibility facilitates the implementation of the solution in reality in case of unexpected obstacles. Further, we suggested adopting a freshwater management framework in the implementation of such solution.

AB  - For species that are increasingly threatened by the combined impacts of habitat loss and climate change, the identification of priority regions for conservation planning efforts is urgently required. In the case of specialist folivores, consideration of the effects of climate change on the distributions of their essential food resources should be a key component of conservation planning. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) was listed in 2012 as vulnerable under Australian Commonwealth Government law. Here, we incorporate species distribution models for the koala, an arboreal marsupial, and its specialized food resources, to identify broad-scale priority conservation regions. We demonstrate a spatial prioritization approach that informs conservation planning and that links the shifting distribution of this declining species and its critical food resources under climate change. We find that the inclusion of food plants affected the identification of priority regions for conserving koalas, and that priority regions for the conservation of this species are predicted to shift considerably, often outside the current range of this species, posing additional challenges for its conservation.

AB  - Conservation planning is crucial for megadiverse countries where biodiversity is coupled with incomplete reserve systems and limited resources to invest in conservation. Using Peru as an example of a megadiverse country, we asked whether the national system of protected areas satisfies biodiversity conservation needs. Further, to complement the existing reserve system, we identified and prioritized potential conservation areas using a combination of species distribution modeling, conservation planning and connectivity analysis. Based on a set of 2,869 species, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and plants, we used species distribution models to represent species' geographic ranges to reduce the effect of biased sampling and partial knowledge about species' distributions. A site-selection algorithm then searched for efficient and complementary proposals, based on the above distributions, for a more representative system of protection. Finally, we incorporated connectivity among areas in an innovative post-hoc analysis to prioritize those areas maximizing connectivity within the system. Our results highlight severe conservation gaps in the Coastal and Andean regions, and we propose several areas, which are not currently covered by the existing network of protected areas. Our approach helps to find areas that contribute to creating a more representative, connected and efficient network.

AB  - Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a promising tool for priority setting, conservation decision-making and overall support for species conservation. We developed a participatory modeling process (PMP) to ensure both the proper use of SDMs as well as their efficacy and impact as a conservation tool. The PMP using SDM has assisted conservation planning in a number of situations, including more than 25 endangered species and supported IUCN SSC Red List assessments. PMP focuses on stakeholder engagement to co-develop SDMs that will in turn support and guide conservation decisions. This participatory approach to SDMs allowed us to: (a) update potential species distributions; (b) evaluate environmental suitability; (c) identify potential corridors and priority areas for implementing different conservation and management actions; (d) identify new potential areas for species searching; (e) predict potential impact under deforestation and climate change scenarios; and (f) provide valuable input for population viability analysis (PVA). Most often the level of successful stakeholder engagement will influence how the model will guide the decision-making process. The modeler must play a technical role as well as act as a translator and facilitator to engage and bridge the gap between researchers, conservation planners and decision makers, which is essential for effective conservation.

AB  - Robust design of Marine Protected Areas in ocean environments is often challenging due to inadequate knowledge of biodiversity patterns, reflecting difficulties in the prediction of species distributions from sampling data that are often sparse or inadequate. Models that combine species and environmental data, such as Gradient Forests (GF), provide one analytical approach to this problem, efficiently combining available information to produce spatial models of species turnover throughout an area of interest. Spatial estimates of species turnover can then be classified to estimate spatial patterns in species composition; however, the performance of GF-based classifications within a conservation planning context has not previously been evaluated. Here we assess the utility for conservation planning (using the software Zonation) of a GF-based hierarchical classification that summarises spatial patterns in demersal fish composition in the oceans around New Zealand. Progressively more complex Zonation analyses assessed the effects of (i) varying the number of classification groups, (ii) adding information describing species turnover, and (iii) adding information describing spatial variation in demersal fish species richness. The best-performing GF-based conservation ranking used layers describing the distributions of 30 classification groups, demersal fish species turnover between these groups, and species richness. Conservation outcomes from this ranking were only marginally less efficient than those from a more conventional ranking that used 217 individual species distribution layers (7% less efficient). This indicates that GF-based classifications may provide a practical alternative for marine conservation planning. Additional advantages arise from the greater ease with which a single classification layer summarising complex biodiversity patterns can facilitate decision-making in participatory stakeholder processes.

AB  - Target-based planning is an integral component of systematic conservation planning. Using empirical data, we investigate a prior conceptual proposition that target-based planning may lead to lower average protection levels across biodiversity features due to its prescriptive nature where conservation outcome is measured in terms of achievement of many independently developed targets. We used spatial distribution models and externally provided targets set for 253 biodiversity features from the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot and compared target-based planning to alternative approaches, such as maximum-utility planning, which can operate without the specification of strict targets. We found that target-based planning retained on average a significantly lower fraction of the distributions of all biodiversity features than did alternative methods. This sub-optimality fundamentally follows from the nestedness of species distributions being ignored in target setting, leading to investment in features that occur in relatively species-poor and expensive areas. Consequently, benefit-based alternatives to target-based planning will achieve higher overall conservation performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecuador has the largest number of species by area worldwide, but also a low representation of species within its protected areas. Here, we applied systematic conservation planning to identify potential areas for conservation in continental Ecuador, with the aim of increasing the representation of terrestrial species diversity in the protected area network. We selected 809 terrestrial species (amphibians, birds, mammals, and plants), for which distributions were estimated via species distribution models (SDMs), using Maxent. For each species we established conservation goals based on conservation priorities, and estimated new potential protected areas using Marxan conservation planning software. For each selected area, we determined their conservation priority and feasibility of establishment, two important aspects in the decision-making processes. We found that according to our conservation goals, the current protected area network contains large conservation gaps. Potential areas for conservation almost double the surface area of currently protected areas. Most of the newly proposed areas are located in the Coast, a region with large conservation gaps and irreversible changes in land use. The most feasible areas for conservation were found in the Amazon and Andes regions, which encompass more undisturbed habitats, and already harbor most of the current reserves. Our study allows defining a viable strategy for preserving Ecuador's biodiversity, by combining SDMs, GIS-based decision-support software, and priority and feasibility assessments of the selected areas. This approach is useful for complementing protected area networks in countries with great biodiversity, insufficient biological information, and limited resources for conservation.

AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that distribution of Neotropical seasonally dry forests (NSDFs) and the survival of the species and communities that inhabit them have been negatively affected by land-use modifications and global climate change (GCC). Protected Areas (PAs) in the region are inefficient and insufficient, and these human-driven threats are expected to further diminish their effectiveness. Research on the long-term effectiveness of these areas for NSDFs protection is therefore a high priority. Here, using birds as a study group, we combined both species distribution modelling and systematic conservation planning techniques to delineate priority areas where species are predicted to persist into the 2050's in the face of GCC and land conversion across the NSDFs distribution. These analyses showed an imperative need to improve the performance of PAs, which covered only -11% of the NSDFs area and included on average just 13% of species' remaining distributions in the 2050's. The most important opportunity for improving NSDFs conservation status is provided by protecting -6% more surface area, which could increase the level of protection in the near future: 24.8-28.2% of species distributions on average and 36.9-39.5% for those threatened and Data Deficit species. Besides, 21.6% for these proposed areas coincide with areas currently defined as priority for NSDFs, and 22.8% coincides with priority areas for conservation and research of terrestrial vertebrates. The priority areas identified are mainly distributed in Mexico (70.8%). Our findings pinpoint major opportunities for efficient conservation planning in the region, if there is political will to do so.

AB  - Sharks play an important role in marine ecosystems as top predators and have been increasingly accepted in recent years as a group for priority conservation worldwide. However, as one of the regions with the highest marine shark species richness, there is still a limited understanding of shark diversity patterns and conservation needs in China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) seas. In this study, we applied an ensemble species distribution model of five algorithms to investigate the diversity distribution patterns of 149 shark species in China and the ASEAN seas for the first time. A systematic conservation planning approach involving diversity, scarcity, and biogeographical distinctiveness was used to identify and compare conservation priority settings. Our results showed that bathymetry and dissolved oxygen were the most important variables contributing to shark distribution. The distribution pattern of shark species richness peaked on the continental shelves at 22-26 degrees N, and a hotspot of shark diversity was identified around the Taiwan Strait. The spatial distribution of shark species in the nine orders and the 72 threatened shark species varied considerably. The existing marine protected area network only protects 2.1% of the ocean, 32.9% of the shark species, and 43.1% of the threatened species, highlighting a substantial conservation gap. Among the conservation priorities identified, the high conservation target scenario (30%) protects only 10%-15% more species than the low conservation target scenario (10%). However, under the high conservation target scenario, the conservation range of species tripled. Our results show that low conservation targets were only suitable for addressing the number of protected species, and that high targets would bring about improved outcomes for the number of protected species and the protected range of threatened species. Furthermore, planned priorities with a large clump pattern had slightly higher conservation achievements than those with small clumps. The results of this study will contribute to the development of a priority area network for sharks and provide a scientific basis for shark conservation and management in the China and ASEAN seas.

AB  - The effectiveness of conservation plans depends on environmental, ecological, and socioeconomic factors. Global change makes conservation decisions even more challenging. Among others, the components of most concern in modern-day conservation assessments are as follows: the magnitude of climate and land-use changes; species dispersal abilities; competition with harmful socioeconomic activities for land use; the number of threatened species to consider; and, relatedly, the available budget to act. Here, we provide a unified framework that quantifies the relative effects of those factors on conservation. We conducted an area-scheduling work plan in order to identify sets of areas along time in which the persistence expectancies of species are optimized. The approach was illustrated using data of potential distribution of ten nonvolant mammal species in Iberia Peninsula from current time up to 2080. Analyses were conducted considering possible setups among the factors that are likely to critically impact conservation success: three climate/land-use scenarios; four species' dispersal kernel curves; six land-use layer types; and two planning designs, in which assessments were made independently for each species, or joining all species in a single plan. We identified areas for an array of investments levels capable to circumvent the spatial conflicts with socioeconomic activities. The effect of each factor on the estimated species persistence scores was assessed using linear mixed models. Our results evidence that conservation success is highly reliant on the resources available to abate land-use conflicts. Nonetheless, under the same investment levels, planning design and climate change were the factors that most shaped species persistence scores. The persistence of five species was especially affected by the sole effect of planning design and consequently, larger conservation investments may retard climatic debts. For three species, the negative effects of a changing climate and of multiple-species planning designs added up, making these species especially at risk. Integrated assessments of the factors most likely to limit species persistence are pivotal to achieve effectiveness.

AB  - Understanding species' historical ranges can provide important information for conservation planning in the face of environmental change. Cromsigt et al. (this issue) comment on our recent European bison (Bison bonasus) range reconstruction, suggesting that bison were already 8000 years ago a refugee species (i.e. restricted to marginal habitat due to past human pressure) and that species distribution models (SDM) are generally of limited use for refugee species conservation. While we welcome this discussion, we find no evidence for the claim that human pressure prior to 8000 BP determined where bison occurred. More importantly, as human pressure is generally high and increasing, attempts to restore species across their former range may fail where the factors that relegated species into refugee status are still at play or where their optimal habitat has vanished. Identifying areas where human pressure is low and where refugee species have persisted over the last millennia is crucial, and SDM based on historical data are important for doing so. Refugee species suffer from the shifting baseline syndrome, but careful reality checks are needed and all available data should be considered before determining the baseline that should inform conservation planning.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning has a substantial theoretical underpinning that allows optimization of tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation and other socioeconomic goals. However, this theory assumes perfect spatial information about the locations of biodiversity features (e.g., species distributions). In practice, planners represent well-known taxa and other biodiversity "surrogates" in protected area systems, hoping that unmapped species will also be conserved. However, empirical research finds that surrogates predict species presence imperfectly, and sometimes rather poorly, at scales relevant to planning, and existing theory provides no further guidance. We developed new theory, explicitly incorporating aspects of spatial scale, for the representation problem when the locations of species distributions are unknown. Using probability theory and simulated and real species distributions, we found that the probability of adequately representing an unmapped species in a protected area system will be low unless the total fraction of the region being protected is larger than the species representation target. Furthermore, successful conservation depended critically on the relative sizes of the species distribution and of the individual protected areas; fewer, larger protected areas allowed the entire species distribution to fall into an unprotected gap. This scale-dependence varied with the configuration of the protected area system, with the conservation objective most likely to be attained if the individual protected areas were hyperdispersed (evenly spaced across the planning region). Using these results, we developed three design principles for representing unmapped species in protected areas: (1) The fraction of the region placed in protected areas should be substantially larger than the species-level representation target; (2) Individual protected areas must be at least one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the unmapped species' distribution; and (3) Protected areas should be evenly dispersed over geographic space. We also performed preliminary investigations of the effects of surrogates and socio-economic cost data on the probability of adequately representing unmapped species, finding that the primary effect of surrogates may simply be to promote hyperdispersion of protected areas across the planning region, and that seeking to minimize opportunity costs gives poorer conservation results than random protected area placement.

AB  - Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) have become an essential tool in conservation and restoration planning. Given the current threats to freshwater biodiversity, it is of fundamental importance to address scale effects on the performance of niche-based SDMs of freshwater species' distributions. The scale effects are addressed here in the context of hierarchical catchment ordering, considered as counterpart to coarsening grain-size by increasing grid-cell size. We combine fish occurrence data from the Danube River Basin, the hierarchical catchment ordering and multiple environmental factors representing topographic, climatic and anthropogenic effects to model fish occurrence probability across multiple scales. We focus on 1st to 5th order catchments. The spatial scale (hierarchical catchment order) only marginally influences the mean performance of SDMs, however the uncertainty of the estimates increases with scale. Key predictors and their relative importance are scale and species dependent. Our findings have useful implications for choosing proper species dependent spatial scales for river rehabilitation measures, and for conservation planning in areas where fine grain species data are unavailable.

AB  - The distributions of many species are dynamic in space and time, and movements made by individuals range from regular and predictable migrations to erratic, resource-driven nomadism. Conserving such mobile species is challenging; the effectiveness of a conservation action taken at one site depends on the condition of other sites that may be geographically and politically distant (thousands of kilometers away or in another jurisdiction, for example). Recent work has shown that even simple and predictable linkages among sites caused by "to-and-fro" migration can make migratory species especially vulnerable to habitat loss, and substantially affect the results of conservation prioritizations. Species characterized by more erratic or nomadic movements are very difficult to protect through current conservation planning techniques, which typically view species distributions as static. However, collaborations between migration ecologists, conservation planners, and mathematical ecologists are paving the way for improvements in conservation planning for mobile species.

AB  - Climate change has a profound impact on the conservation and management of the Picea species, and establishing more nature reserves would be an effective way to conserve wild species in general. Based on a novel computational method using ecological niche modeling to predict the potential geographical distribution of species and a spatial decision support system, the planning process could predict the future distribution of the Picea species and thus select appropriate nature reserves. In this research, we utilized systematic conservation planning to define priority conservation areas for the Picea species in China according to future climate predictions. We hypothesized that: (1) the distribution of the Picea species could be changed under predicted climate conditions in China; (2) the current national nature reserves had sufficient capacity to conserve Picea species under predicted climate conditions in China; and (3) there were still deficiencies in the planned conservation for the Picea species based on predicted climate predictions in China. The results of a spatial analysis showed that the predicted climate would have an impact on the area of distribution of the Picea species. Current nature reserves have a strong potential to conserve the Picea species. However, the conservation of the Picea species in the existing nature reserves was not adequate. There were still many Picea specimens outside the reserve that would be threatened. This research systematically improved the research on the Picea species, and it also scientifically identified the suitable growth and conserved areas of the Picea species in China to provide an empirical basis for the conservation and management of the Picea species.

AB  - Systematic conservation initiatives attempt to cater to the needs of many species via the integration of multiple species distribution models (SDMs), or via the integration of Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) software, such as Zonation. Unfortunately, due to limited data and knowledge, it is often difficult to select the most suitable model for specific species, let alone an appropriate ensemble modeling method for multiple species. In general, model selection criteria are based on either model performance or consensus. The former integrates the highest-performing SDM for all focal species, whereas the latter integrates multiple SDM outputs based on consensus. While higher-performing ensemble models presumably identify high-quality habitats better, many have argued that high consensus ensemble models have less uncertainty originating from sporadic model variability. This study develops and validates seven ensemble-modeling strategies for integrating outputs of the systematic conservation tool Zonation. First, we considered the distributions of 11 bird species via 100 runs of five SDMs across Taiwan. Second, we evaluated the local and global uncertainty of all five models. Third, we used Zonation to obtain conservation priorities. We then used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to quantify different sources of uncertainty. Finally, we used independent third-party habitat data to validate each strategy. On average, the 'best model' strategy (based on the highest ADC value) performed best. Based on our modeling exercise we present a comprehensive framework for conservation prioritization, validation and the quantification of uncertainty intrinsic to SDMs according to different conservation scenarios and goals.

AB  - Data on the occurrence of species are widely used to inform the design of reserve networks. These data contain commission errors (when a species is mistakenly thought to be present) and omission errors (when a species is mistakenly thought to be absent), and the rates of the two types of error are inversely related. Point locality data can minimize commission errors, but those obtained from museum collections are generally sparse, suffer from substantial spatial bias and contain large omission errors. Geographic ranges generate large commission errors because they assume homogenous species distributions. Predicted distribution data make explicit inferences on species occurrence and their commission and omission errors depend on model structure, on the omission of variables that determine species distribution and on data resolution. Omission errors lead to identifying networks of areas for conservation action that are smaller than required and centred on known species occurrences, thus affecting the comprehensiveness, representativeness and efficiency of selected areas. Commission errors lead to selecting areas not relevant to conservation, thus affecting the representativeness and adequacy of reserve networks. Conservation plans should include an estimation of commission and omission errors in underlying species data and explicitly use this information to influence conservation planning outcomes.

AB  - Threatened species are inadequately represented within protected areas (PAs) across the globe. Species conservation planning may be improved by using public species-occurrence databases, but empirical evidence is limited of how that may be accomplished at local scales. We used the Three Parallel Rivers Region of China as a case to investigate the utility of public species data in improvement in conservation planning. We mapped the distribution of each species as suitable habitat ranges using species distribution models (for 261 plants and 29 animals with >= 5 occurrences) or as point locations (for 591 plants and 328 animals with <5 occurrences). Systematic conservation planning was then applied to identify three optimized portfolios of priority conservation areas (PCAs) for achieving increasing targets of 17, 31, and 50% of the total study area. We then compared the distributions of PCAs in this study with those in two existing PCA datasets. PCAs in this study covered greater areas in the southeastern highly-disturbed regions and along valleys of great rivers than two existing datasets that had a focus on intact ecosystems in remote mountain areas. The three portfolios of PCAs had some overlap with two existing PCA datasets, with the overlapping area accounting for 26.4-39.0% of the total areas of our PCAs. Our PCAs could complement existing PCAs by identifying more priority areas in developed landscapes; this is critical for protecting biodiversity in such areas as they face greater pressures. PCAs in this study received a much lower PA coverage (32.9-43.1%) than existing PCAs (60.2-60.8%) because of biased PA distribution toward mountain areas. Our results suggest that conservation planning based on limited public species data could improve local-scale priority-setting practices. The analysis supports effective integration of species targets in China's new national park system by identifying optimized networks of PCAs.

AB  - We used endangered orchid species as a case study for establishing priority protected areas (PPAs). We conducted a detailed investigation of 2,884 plots in northeastern China and selected 6 nationally protected orchid species (the number of plots for each species a parts per thousand yen5) to plan PPAs in order to conserve these endangered plants. First, we estimated the potential habitat distributions of 6 orchid species using species distribution models (in the program Maxent). Second, we identified PPAs using the results of both Maxent and systematic conservation planning software (Zonation). We found that the PPAs we identified were all distributed in the eastern, northeastern, and northern parts of the study region on which we focused. We observed that existing nature reserves in those areas were much smaller than the PPAs we identified, suggesting the need for expansion of these zones. Finally, we identified some recommended protection areas based on our PPAs, which we believe are suitable areas of in situ conservation. These areas could assist in the formulation of protection policies for these endangered orchid species. Our results have broad implications for conservation biology and the redefinition of protective zones for at-risk species.

AB  - Madagascar is one of the most biodiverse countries in Africa, due to its level of endemism and species diversity. However, the pressure of human activities threatens the last patches of natural vegetation in the country and conservation decisions are undertaken with limited data availability. In this study, we use free online datasets to generate distribution models of 1539 endemic trees and prioritise for conservation and restoration considering threat, alongside conservation value and cost. Threats considered include illegal logging, forest degradation and agriculture or slash and burns activities. We found that the areas with the highest potential concentration of species are along the north and south-east of the country where more than 400 tree species can be found. Most scenarios identify a common conservation and restoration priority area along the north east of the country. Our findings guide managers, conservation organizations or governments in decisions about where to invest their limited conservation resources.

AB  - The effectiveness of a system of reserves may be compromised under climate change as species' habitat shifts to nonreserved areas, a problem that may be compounded when well-studied vertebrate species are used as conservation umbrellas for other taxa. The Northwest Forest Plan was among the first efforts to integrate conservation of wide-ranging focal species and localized endemics into regional conservation planning. We evaluated how effectively the plan's focal species, the Northern Spotted Owl, acts as an umbrella for localized species under current and projected future climates and how the regional system of reserves can be made more resilient to climate change. We used the program maxent to develop distribution models integrating climate data with vegetation variables for the owl and 130 localized species. We used the program zonation to identify a system of areas that efficiently captures habitat for both the owl and localized species and prioritizes refugial areas of climatic and topographic heterogeneity where current and future habitat for dispersal-limited species is in proximity. We projected future species' distributions based on an ensemble of contrasting climate models, and incorporating uncertainty between alternate climate projections into the prioritization process. Reserve solutions based on the owl overlap areas of high localized-species richness but poorly capture core areas of localized species' distribution. Congruence between priority areas across taxa increases when refugial areas are prioritized. Although core-area selection strategies can potentially increase the conservation value and resilience of regional reserve systems, they accentuate contrasts in priority areas between species and over time and should be combined with a broadened taxonomic scope and increased attention to potential effects of climate change. Our results suggest that systems of fixed reserves designed for resilience can increase the likelihood of retaining the biological diversity of forest ecosystems under climate change.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning tools offer powerful and flexible means for addressing the protection of biodiversity in freshwater systems. Tools such as the software Zonation can be used to prioritize streams for protection, restoration, and management of aquatic resources. The flexible nature of these tools allow analyses to be tailored to specific objectives but also introduces uncertainty regarding the effects of selected input options on the rankings of stream segments and the representation of fish species within prioritized streams. The objective of our research was to evaluate the effectiveness of several species distribution modeling techniques (generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, boosted regression trees, and random forest models, including an ensemble based on these techniques) for characterizing distributions of fish communities and to identify the influence of different prioritization options of Zonation conservation planning software within five input classes (species occurrence data, removal rule, species weighting, connectivity, and protected area masking) on both the resulting stream segment rankings and the representation of species within priority streams. All combinations of input options were compared based on the correlation and congruence of stream rankings and the mean richness of species, minimum level of species representation, and representation of rare species within streams across priority levels. Of the distribution modeling types we evaluated, boosted regression trees performed the best, followed closely by random forest models. The use of an ensemble approach allowed for the largest number of species with robust predicted distributions. Our results also suggested that protected area masking had the largest effects on conservation priority results, followed by choice of removal rule, while species occurrence data type had limited impacts. The information contained in this chapter is meant to aid planners in understanding how their selection of conservation planning inputs is likely to impact results.

AB  - When protected areas reduce threats within their boundaries, they often displace a portion of these threats into adjacent areas through a process known as 'leakage', undermining conservation objectives. Using theoretical models and a case study of terrestrial mammals in Indonesia, we develop the first theoretical explanation of how leakage impacts conservation actions, and highlight conservation strategies that mitigate these impacts. Although leakage is a socio-economic process, we demonstrate that its negative impacts are also affected by the distribution of species, with leakage having larger impacts in landscapes with homogeneous distribution of species richness. Moreover, leakage has a greater negative effect when conservation strategies are implemented opportunistically, even creating the potential for perversely negative consequences from protected area establishment. Leakage thereby increases the relative benefits of systematic conservation planning over opportunism, especially in areas with high leakage and heterogeneously distributed species. Although leakage has the potential to undermine conservation actions, conservation planning can minimize this risk.

AB  - Nature reserves in China are undergoing adjustments in functional zoning. Currently, one urgent problem is determining how to delineate core conservation zones more scientifically and rationally. This case study focused on the Houhe National Nature Reserve, Wufeng County, Hubei Province, China, and was based on the distribution data of seven species (Moschus berezovskii, Elaphodus cephalophus, Muntiacus reevesi, Naemorhedus griseus, Capricornis sumatraensis, Prionailurus bengalensis, and Ursus thibetanus), vegetation types, meteorological factors, human disturbance, terrain, and hydrological variables. Species distributions were predicted through MaxEnt modeling, and MARXAN software was used for systematic conservation planning. The results showed that (1) for the MaxEnt model simulations of one critically endangered (CR) species and six vulnerable (VU) species in Houhe National Nature Reserve, the area under curve (AUC) values of seven species were all greater than 0.8, of which the AUC of M. berezovskii was 0.961, indicating a high modeling accuracy; (2) based on the analysis of the MaxEnt model, MARXAN was used to delineate the core conservation zone of Houhe National Nature Reserve. When the boundary length modifier was set as 100 and planning units as hexagons with a boundary length of 200 m, the priority conservation areas had the fewest fragments. Thus, using these parameters for conservation planning is more reasonable; and (3) among the four proposals obtained from the MARXAN analysis that were based on different conservation targets, those with a conservation target of 80% for CR species and 60% for VU species had the largest priority conservation areas. According to the principles of maintaining ecosystem integrity and habitat connectivity of species and ensuring consistent conservation management, we propose a new functional zoning plan for Houhe National Nature Reserve. In this plan, the core conservation zone will have an area of 5947.76 ha, which will be greater than the sum of the areas of the current buffer and core zones, whereas the area of the general control zone will be 4395.64 ha.

AB  - Current methods in conservation planning for promoting the persistence of biodiversity typically focus on either representing species geographic distributions or maintaining connectivity between reserves, but rarely both, and take a focal species, rather than a multispecies, approach. Here, we link prioritization methods with population models to explore the impact of integrating both representation and connectivity into conservation planning for species persistence. Using data on 288 Mediterranean fish species with varying conservation requirements, we show that: (1) considering both representation and connectivity objectives provides the best strategy for enhanced biodiversity persistence and (2) connectivity objectives were fundamental to enhancing persistence of small-ranged species, which are most in need of conservation, while the representation objective benefited only wide-ranging species. Our approach provides a more comprehensive appraisal of planning applications than approaches focusing on either representation or connectivity, and will hopefully contribute to build more effective reserve networks for the persistence of biodiversity.

AB  - With over 35,000 higher plants recorded, China is among the countries with the highest plant diversity. However, due to increasing human population, land-use intensification, and economic development, the habitat of most species is under considerable threat. Here we develop conservation priority maps covering all of China based on plant species distribution models in combination with spatially explicit decision making tools for systematic conservation planning. Our aim was to find spatial scenarios that maximize the success of conservation goals while minimizing the required land area to achieve these goals, so that economic development can proceed with minimal damage to existing biodiversity resources. We built species distribution models for 7427 vascular plant species at a 10 x 10' resolution covering whole China, using geo-referenced herbarium collections and detailed environmental data, corrected for spatial bias using a null model. Based on these models we mapped: (1) species richness centers for common species (3535), endemic species (1965) and Chinese red list species (1927); (2) priority areas for conservation, distinguishing between conservation targets for common species (15% of the predicted suitable habitat), endemic species (25% the predicted suitable habitat) and red list species (35% the predicted suitable habitat); and (3) downscaled land-use pattern in each priority area for conservation. Clear priorities for the development of a sustainable and feasible biodiversity conservation strategy can now be provided based on our maps at national and regional levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Part of the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, Yunnan province in China is a highly diverse terrestrial region, particularly in the wide range of natural forest types. These forests are under considerable conversion pressure as land use intensifies with expanding human population and economic development. Conservation strategies based on the geographic patterns of botanical species richness, including the identification of meaningful floristic regions and priority areas for conservation, could improve the effectiveness of forest policy and management. These strategies should also include current threats of loss due to forest conversion to address the more urgent challenges for sustainable development. Here, we produce distribution models at similar to 10 km(2) resolution for 2319 plant species, using geo-referenced herbarium collections, corrected for spatial bias using a null model, and detailed environmental variables. Based on 1996 species with significant non-random habitat preferences, we identify four important aspects of plant species distribution in Yunnan: (1) species diversity hotspots; (2) seven major floristic regions, using a cluster analysis of species presence/absence; (3) priority areas for conservation based on the concept of the 'irreplaceability' value of planning units and (4) the percentage remaining natural forest among the species rich and conservation priority areas, to assess the level of endangerment. Our maps provide clear priorities for the development of a sustainable and feasible biodiversity conservation strategy for Yunnan. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global biodiversity priorities are primarily addressed through the establishment or expansion of conservation areas (CAs). Spatial prioritization of these CAs can help minimize biodiversity loss by accounting for the uneven distribution of biodiversity and conservation considerations (e.g., accessibility, cost, and biodiversity threats). Furthermore, optimized spatial priorities can help facilitate the judicious use of limited conservation resources by identifying cost effective CA designs. Here, we demonstrate how key species and ecosystems can be incorporated into systematic conservation planning to propose the expansion and addition of new CAs in the biodiversity-unique and data-poor region of Qinghai Plateau, China. We combined species distribution models with a systematic conservation planning tool, MARXAN to identify CAs for biodiversity on Qinghai Plateau. A set of 57 optimal CAs (273,872 km(2), 39.3 % of this Province) were required to achieve the defined conservation targets in Qinghai Province. We also identified 29 new CAs (139,216 km(2), 20% of Qinghai Province) outside the existing nature reserve (NRs) that are necessary to fully achieve the proposed conservation targets. The conservation importance of these 29 new CAs was also indicated, with 10 labeled as high priority, 11 as medium priority, and 8 as low priority. High priority areas were more abundant in the eastern and southeastern parts of this region. Our results suggest that many species remain inadequately protected within the Qinghai Plateau, with conservation gaps in eastern and northwestern regions. The proposed more representative and effective CAs can provide useful information for adjusting the existing NRs and developing the first National Park in China.

AB  - Species distribution models are an essential tool for biodiversity conservation, with important applications such as spatial prioritisation of conservation actions and elucidating relationships between environmental predictors and species responses. These models are most useful to conservation managers when they include factors that can be readily manipulated, such as fire. In this study, we collated a comprehensive dataset of mammal records from a fire-prone region in south-east Australia where mammals have suffered declines in recent decades. We used species distribution modelling to (1) determine the relative influence of climate, fire, vegetation and topography on ground-dwelling mammal distributions; (2) determine species responses to time since fire, and; (3) provide spatial predictions of habitat suitability for conservation planning. Climate was the predominant driver of habitat suitability for most species, although other factors were influential in some cases. Time since fire was an important factor driving the distribution of only two of 16 modelled species which were more likely to be recorded in recently burnt vegetation. Habitat suitability varied spatially among species however multi-species habitat suitability was highest in the drier and hotter eastern section of the landscape, highlighting a key area for conservation efforts. The outputs from our models can be used for practical conservation actions such as finding new populations or identifying sites for reintroductions. We conclude that presence-only species distribution models are useful for determining species fire responses, complementing more systematic methods, and that including dynamic variables, such as time since fire, can increase their conservation relevance.

AB  - Setting operational targets for the protection of species is crucial for identifying conservation priorities and for monitoring conservation actions' effectiveness. The use of quantitative targets for global species conservation has grown in the past ten years as a response to the commitment of reducing extinction rates established by the Convention on Biological Diversity. We reviewed the use of conservation targets in global scale conservation analyses, and found that most of the publications adopted species representation targets, corresponding to an amount of area to be protected. We found no work adequately targeting species' persistence, i.e. the complement to species extinction risk. Despite the adoption of pragmatic population targets, consisting in a number of individuals to be protected, has been recently proposed for global species conservation, the use of these targets at the species level is not always warranted. Pros and cons of using population persistence targets for species conservation have been discussed, yet the fundamental issue of how to scale these targets from populations to species is still unresolved. We discuss the process of "scaling up" population persistence targets to the species level using habitat distribution models, and test our approach in a case study on the European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus). We identified three main steps to be followed: (i) definition of a population target, (ii) characterisation of the species' populations by means of a habitat suitability model, and (iii) definition of a scaled species target. An up-scaled species target should include multiple conditions reflecting species persistence (number, size, location of the populations to be protected), uniqueness (e.g. evolutionary potential) and representativeness (e.g. presence in different ecosystems). Adopting scaled up species persistence targets within conservation planning approaches can allow protected area plans to give the highest contribution to reducing global species extinction risk.

AB  - Conservation planning has generally used models with a static spatial distribution of species to predict the likely occurrence of species. However, static data do not usually capture rapid changes in the abundance of endangered species or cryptic life stages such as the dormancy stage of eggs and seeds. Little is known about how neglecting dynamic population processes, such as recovery processes, can affect the outcomes of spatial prioritization in conservation planning. In this study, we investigated the distribution of 62 aquatic plant species, including 23 threatened species, in 415 agricultural ponds for 37 years to examine the importance of including recovery processes in conservation planning. Using long-term historical presence-absence data and seedbank longevity data for aquatic macrophytes, we estimated rates of population disappearance and recovery for each species in each pond over the next 100 years. Average rates of recovery exceeded 0, 0.2, and 0.4 in 85.4%, 40.3%, and 4.8% of aquatic plant species, respectively. Simulation results suggested that the extinction risk for a species greatly decreased when recovery processes were considered. We found that including recovery processes in target species populations increased the performance of spatial prioritization by protecting more species in a smaller number of protected ponds. Spatial ranking of ponds for species conservation differed substantially among scenarios that included and excluded population recovery processes, suggesting that conservation priorities based on complementarity analysis are sensitive to underlying assumptions. Synthesis and applications. Our dynamic approach, which considers recovery processes of species, contributes to more effective conservation planning by reducing bias in the prediction of species' state, given that cryptic life stages are ubiquitous among many plants and some animals. Time-series presence/absence data on target species are quite useful for the approach and are often archived by participatory monitoring. Thus, the opportunities for applying our method are broad, especially for conservation prioritization and decision-making at the local scale.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) offer great potential for inclusion into the toolbox of today's marine environmental manager, especially with regard to marine conservation and planning. The application of SDMs in the marine environment over recent years has been varied but there are still relatively few examples in comparison with terrestrial application, and this is especially true in deep-sea marine ecosystems. This short article builds upon two recent review articles concerning the application of species distribution modelling studies in the marine realm, offering additional practical considerations for discussion. Recommendations for progressing the improved application of SDMs to support marine conservation planning are given, including combining model outputs with other data layers, metadata standards and model error. SDMs have both an urgent and long term contribution to make to marine conservation planning globally, and it is hoped that this article, in combination with developing research on marine SDMs, will contribute to some much needed discussion and inform best practice and new research to enable these models to be of greater use to marine managers.

AB  - Recent assessments have identified significant shortfalls in the current Natura 2000 network approach for identifying protected areas throughout the European Union. A more systematic conservation network planning approach that adopts strategic development options and considers the occurrences of species and habitats within the distribution ranges of species across larger areas is needed in order to support decision making processes on the potential expansion, establishment and/or maintenance of conservation areas. Using high-nature-value forest habitats across a large test region, i.e. the state of Lower Saxony in Germany, we developed a method aimed at systematically locating and appraising temperate forest habitats using indicator species distribution maps. Forest community indicator species were determined using forest habitat affinity criteria (derived from an existing database) and community fidelity (based on a review of 5338 vegetation releves). Known habitat occurrences were derived from habitat surveys and relevant literature and were related to model data on indicator species distribution on a grid of 1739 raster cells (each 30 km(2)) using logistic regression. The predictive power of the distribution models increased with the number of indicator species. However, tight correlations between indicator species distribution and habitat occurrence were only found when indicator species with a high affinity to forests were used exclusively. Field inspection of grid cells with outlying occurrences of five upland forest communities revealed several new forest habitat locations and led to greatly improved distribution models. We conclude that the distribution of high-nature-value forest habitats can be predicted from large-scale raster data on plant species distributions when only indicator species with close association to forest habitats and a high fidelity to a single community are selected. Our approach may therefore facilitate a review of the existing Natura 2000 forest conservation network, be used to identify additional conservation areas or to monitor the success of forest conservation management measures.

AB  - Climate change has the potential to severely threaten Taxuschinensis, an endangered endemic tree plant in China. Hence, we need to plan conservation areas for T. chinensis in light of climate change. We applied the common species distribution modelling software Maxent to generate maps of current and projected future distributions of T. chinensis. These distributional maps with conservation planning software were used to determine priority protection areas (PPAs). Then, we evaluated the ability of existing nature reserves to conserve T. chinensis and performed a gap analysis for the species under climate change. The PPAs of T. chinensis were mainly distributed within central and southern China. Nature reserves such as Zhangjiajiedani, Yangzie, Wolong, Baishuijiang and Dabashan have the greatest potential to protect T. chinensis under climate change. In situ and ex situ conservation of T. chinensis in the PPAs of these five nature reserves should be a priority. However, existing nature reserves lag far behind the PPAs with respect to total area. Therefore, more nature reserves are urgently needed for species like T. chinensis to cope with rapid climate change. Meanwhile, we should strengthen protection and management of areas that will experience an increase in T. chinensis while enhancing both monitoring and protection activities for T. chinensis in PPAs that are predicted to experience decreases in population size. Finally, we suggest that climate change must be integrated into conservation planning for the endangered plant species, T. chinensis.

AB  - Conservation planning depends on reliable information regarding the geographic distribution of species. However, our knowledge of species' distributions is often incomplete, especially when species are cryptic, difficult to survey, or rare. The use of species distribution models has increased in recent years and proven a valuable tool to evaluate habitat suitability for species. However, practitioners have yet to fully adopt the potential of species distribution models to inform conservation efforts for information-limited species. Here, we describe a species distribution modeling approach for at-risk species that could better inform U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's species status assessments and help facilitate conservation decisions. We applied four modeling techniques (generalized additive, maximum entropy, generalized boosted, and weighted ensemble) to occurrence data for four at-risk species proposed for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (Papaipema eryngii, Macbridea caroliniana, Scutellaria ocmulgee, and Balduina atropurpurea) in the Southeastern United States. The use of ensemble models reduced uncertainty caused by differences among modeling techniques, with a consequent improvement of predictive accuracy of fitted models. Incorporating an ensemble modeling approach into species status assessments and similar frameworks is likely to benefit survey efforts, inform recovery activities, and provide more robust status assessments for at-risk species. We emphasize that co-producing species distribution models in close collaboration with species experts has the potential to provide better calibration data and model refinements, which could ultimately improve reliance and use of model outputs.

AB  - The Hangang River and Imjingang River estuaries in Korea are part of the main transit route for many migratory birds that use the East Asia-Pacific flyway. Despite the global importance of this area as a seasonal bird stopover site and resting area, conservation areas have not been established in this area based on ecological properties. This study aimed to examine the umbrella effect of the white-naped crane (Antigone vipio), which is one of the best-known flagship species in East Asia, and to determine the effectiveness of establishing a conservation plan in the western DMZ based on the distribution of white-naped cranes. Species distribution modeling was performed for the white-naped crane; other threatened waterbirds wintering in the western DMZ; Group 1, including species with ecological traits similar to those of the white-naped crane; and Group 2, including species with ecological traits different from those of the white-naped crane. The modeling was based on field survey data from a citizen science project, and a systematic conservation planning approach was adopted for each species group. The results showed no significant differences between the plan for the target species and the plans for the other species groups, indicating that protecting white-naped cranes habitat can also protect the habitat of other threatened waterbirds.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used in conservation and land-use planning as inputs to describe biodiversity patterns. These models can be built in different ways, and decisions about data preparation, selection of predictor variables, model fitting, and evaluation all alter the resulting predictions. Commonly, the true distribution of species is unknown and independent data to verify which SDM variant to choose are lacking. Such model uncertainty is of concern to planners. We analyzed how 11 routine decisions about model complexity, predictors, bias treatment, and setting thresholds for predicted values altered conservation priority patterns across 25 species. Models were created with MaxEnt and run through Zonation to determine the priority rank of sites. Although all SDM variants performed well (area under the curve >0.7), they produced spatially different predictions for species and different conservation priority solutions. Priorities were most strongly altered by decisions to not address bias or to apply binary thresholds to predicted values; on average 40% and 35%, respectively, of all grid cells received an opposite priority ranking. Forcing high model complexity altered conservation solutions less than forcing simplicity (14% and 24% of cells with opposite rank values, respectively). Use of fewer species records to build models or choosing alternative bias treatments had intermediate effects (25% and 23%, respectively). Depending on modeling choices, priority areas overlapped as little as 10-20% with the baseline solution, affecting top and bottom priorities differently. Our results demonstrate the extent of model-based uncertainty and quantify the relative impacts of SDM building decisions. When it is uncertain what the best SDM approach and conservation plan is, solving uncertainty or considering alterative options is most important for those decisions that change plans the most.

AB  - In conservation planning, the data related to size, growth and diffusion of populations is sparse, hard to collect and unreliable at best. If and when the data is readily available, it is not of sufficient quantity to construct a probability distribution. In such a scenario, applying deterministic or stochastic approaches to the problems in conservation planning either ignores the uncertainty completely or assumes a distribution that does not accurately describe the nature of uncertainty. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a robust optimization approach to problems in conservation planning that considers the uncertainty in data without making any assumption about its probability distribution. We explore two of the basic formulations in conservation planning related to reserve selection and invasive species control to show the value of the proposed robust optimization. Several novel techniques are developed to compare the results produced by the proposed robust optimization approach and the existing deterministic approach. For the case when the robust optimization approach fails to find a feasible solution, a novel bi-objective optimization technique is developed to handle infeasibility by modifying the level of uncertainty. Some numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in finding more applicable conservation planning strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The importance of expert input to spatial conservation prioritization outcomes is poorly understood. We quantified the impacts of refinements made during consultation with experts on spatial conservation prioritization of Christmas Island. There was just 0.57 correlation between the spatial conservation priorities before and after consultation, bottom ranked areas being most sensitive to changes. The inclusion of a landscape condition layer was the most significant individual influence. Changes (addition, removal, modification) to biodiversity layers resulted in a combined 0.2 reduction in correlation between initial and final solutions. Representation of rare species in top ranked areas was much greater after expert consultation; representation of widely distributed species changed relatively little. Our results show how different inputs have notably different impacts on the final plan. Understanding these differences helps plan time and resources for expert consultation.

AB  - Agriculture, global biodiversity and distribution of species are increasingly influenced by changing climate. Assessing the future distribution of biodiversity under different climate change scenarios is an essential step towards conservation planning and policy implementations. To understand the climate change impacts, the present study usedGarcinia gummi-guttacash crop species as a case study that is even exported, adding the nation's foreign reserve. Given the importance of this crop for local and national economy, the main objectives of the study were to analyse the impact of present and future climates on ecologically susceptibleG. gummi-guttaspecies in the Western Ghats based on maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). Future projections with RCP scenarios for 2050 and 2070 were made using the data of 84 species occurrence and climatic variables of three climate models from IPCC 5th assessment. The contribution of climatic variables was analysed by jackknife test, and 0.888 of AOC indicates high accuracy of the model results. It was found that annual precipitation, coldest quarter precipitation, and precipitation seasonality were the key determining factors for the suitability of this species. In addition, the results of all scenarios showed that the current suitability of the species would be dramatically decreased by 2050 and 2070. The study suggests how the MaxEnt approach can be an important tool for agricultural development, management of species habitats, conservation of biodiversity, and climate change rehabitation planning.

AB  - Indonesia harbours a high diversity of cetaceans, yet effective conservation is hampered by a lack of knowledge about cetacean spatial distribution and habitat preferences. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap at an adequate resolution to support national cetacean conservation and management planning. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) modelling was used to map the distribution of 15 selected cetacean species in seven areas within Indonesian waters using recent cetacean presence datasets as well as environmental predictors (topographic and oceanographic variables). We then combined the individual species suitable habitat maps and overlaid them with provincial marine spatial planning (MSP) jurisdictions, marine protected areas (MPAs), oil and gas contract areas, and marine traffic density. Our results reflect a great heterogeneity in distribution among species and within species among different locations. This heterogeneity reflects an interrelated influence of topographic variables and oceanographic processes on the distribution of cetacean species. Bathymetry, distance to- coast and the -200m isobaths, and chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature were important variables influencing distribution of most species in many regions. Areas rich in species were mainly related to coastal areas or insular-reef complexity, representing high productivity and upwelling-modified waters. Although some important suitable habitats currently fall within MPAs, other areas are not and overlap with oil and gas exploration activities and marine traffic, indicating potentially high risk areas for cetaceans. The results of this study can support national cetacean conservation and management planning, and be used to reduce or avoid adverse anthropogenic threats. We advise to consider currently unprotected suitable cetacean habitats in MPA and MSP development.

AB  - The Laristan mouflon is the smallest species of the genus Ovis with isolated populations spread mostly in the Laristan region in southern Iran. In recent years, this charismatic species has been considered as a conservation-oriented game species by the Department of Environment of Iran. Designating conservation planning of the Laristan mouflon necessitates identifying suitable habitats of the species and the habitat connectivity among protected areas of the region. In this study, habitat suitability of the species was investigated using species distribution modelling method based on the maximum entropy model. The map of habitat suitability was then used to assess habitat connectivity among protected areas based on least-cost path and circuit theory methods. The results showed that a mixture of undulating grass-shrub covers with proper availability of escaping terrains far from human-dominated areas characterizes suitable ranges for the species. The habitat connectivity analyses revealed that there is a strong connection among the existing protected areas, however, in some parts, due to the development of road networks, the bottleneck in habitat connectivity was observed. Results of this study could be considered as a practical tool for the conservation planning of this charismatic species in southern Iran.

AB  - Most of the European diadromous fish species are endangered and listed in the habitats fauna and flora directive, the bern convention and the IUCN Red List. Current conservation plans do not address global warming issues and consider the 1900 distribution range as the reference without taking into account the potential re-distribution of these species under global warming. However, for other taxa, predictive models have been used successfully to relate conservation assessment with the impact of global warming. We investigated the distribution of the various diadromous species regularly encountered in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East at the beginning of the 20th century. For each species, we related the observed distribution to a set of environmental variables describing the prevailing climate in the basins, the physical nature of the basins and reflecting historical events known to have affected freshwater fish distribution. We successfully built twenty-one accurate species-specific models out of twenty-eight during both the calibration and the validation phases. Longitude, a factor we interpret as related to biogeographical history, was selected in all models and temperature was included in fifteen models, in six it was the most explanatory variable. These models allowed us to separate the roles of ecology and history in explaining distribution patterns at species level. Historical events such as glaciations constrained the continental distribution of all diadromous species and six of these were also highly temperature-dependent. Based on these results, we claim that these models can be used to predict the potential distribution under changing climatic conditions and provide two relevant examples (i.e. for Alosa alosa and Pe tromyzon marinus). Predictive models could be useful as a preliminary tool to prepare long-term conservation plans on European, national and regional scales. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) provide robust inferences about species-specific site suitability and are increasingly used in systematic conservation planning (SCP). SDMs are subjected to intrinsic uncertainties, and conservation studies have generally overlooked these. The integration of SDM uncertainties in conservation solutions requires the development of a suitable optimization algorithm. Exact optimization algorithms grant efficiency to conservation solutions, but most of their implementations generate a single binary and indivisible solution. Therefore, without variation in their parameterization, they provide low flexibility in the implementation of conservation solutions by stakeholders. Contrarily, heuristic algorithms provide such flexibility, by generating large amounts of sub-optimal solutions. As a consequence, efficiency and flexibility are implicitly linked in conservation applications: mathematically efficient solutions provide less flexibility, and the flexible solutions provided by heuristics are sub-optimal. To avoid this trade-off between flexibility and efficiency in SCP, we propose a reserve-selection framework, based on exact optimization combined with a post-selection of SDM outputs. This reserve-selection framework provides flexibility and addresses the efficiency and representativeness of conservation solutions. To exemplify the approach, we analyzed an experimental design, crossing pre- and post-selection of SDM outputs versus heuristics and exact mathematical optimizations. We used the Mediterranean Sea as a biogeographical template for our analyses, integrating the outputs of eight SDM techniques for 438 fish species.

AB  - Protected areas and ecotourism are both conservation measures for plant resources, but for one specific plant species, the priority of them needs a reasonable planning. The suitable habitat distribution of species is the basis for planning, and the impact of climate change on habitat distribution should also be considered. Based on maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), we assessed the current and future suitable habitat distributions of seven species of genus Rhododendron in Northeast China. Combined with the distributions of existing protected areas and tourist attractions, the conservation planning is recommended. Our results showed that: (1) the suitable habitat areas of R. redowskianum and R. aureum were mainly distributed in the Changbai Mountains covering only 2.05% and 3.84% of the total area of Northeast China, and showed decreasing trends in the future. (2) The suitable habitat areas for R. schlippenbachii were mainly distributed in the southeast and southwest of Liaoning Province, with a cover of 4.29% in Northeast China. For R. mucronulatum and R. micranthum, suitable habitat areas were mainly distributed in the east and west of Liaoning Province, covering 14.27% and 7.95% respectively. For R. dauricum and R. lapponicum, suitable habitat areas were mainly distributed in the Greater Khingan Range, Lesser Khingan Range, and Changbai Mountains, covering 43.76% and 22.24% respectively. Moreover, they all showed increasing trends in the future. (3) Therefore, protected area was recommended for R. redowskianum and R. aureum, while ecotourism or both protected area and ecotourism was recommended for R. schlippenbachii, R. mucronulatum, R. micranthum, R. dauricum, and R. lapponicum. This study provides planning suggestions for the conservation of Rhododendron and is a reference for the conservation of other plant species.

AB  - Deciding which areas to protect, and where to manage and how, are no easy tasks. Many protected areas were established opportunistically under strong political and economic constraints, which may have resulted in inefficient and ineffective conservation. Systematic conservation planning has helped us move from ad-hoc decisions to a quantitative and transparent decision-making process, identifying conservation priorities that achieve explicit objectives in a cost-efficient manner. Here we use Finnish butterflies to illustrate different modeling approaches to address three different types of situations in conservation planning at three different spatial scales. First, we employ species distribution models at the national scale to construct a conservation priority map for 91 species at the resolution of 10x10 km. Species distribution models interpolate sparse occurrence data to infer variation in habitat suitability and to predict species responses to habitat loss, management actions and climate change. Second, at the regional scale we select the optimal management plan to protect a set of habitat specialist species. And third, at the landscape scale, we use a metapopulation approach to manage a network of habitat patches for long-term persistence of a single butterfly species. These different modeling approaches illustrate trade-offs between complexity and tractability and between generality and precision. General correlation-based models are helpful to set priorities for multiple species at large spatial scales. More specific management questions at smaller scales require further data and more complex models. The vast numbers of insect species with diverse ecologies provide a source of information that has remained little used in systematic conservation planning.

AB  - The concept of Plant Species with Extremely Small Populations (PSESP) has been employed to guide conservation of threatened plant species in China. Climate change has a high potential to threaten PSESP. As a result, it is necessary to integrate climate change effects on PSESP into conservation planning in China. Here, ecological niche modelling is used to project current and future habitat distributions of six PSESP in China under climate change scenarios and conservation planning software is applied to identify priority conservation areas (PCAs) for these PSESP based on habitat distributions. These results were used to provide proposals for in-situ and ex-situ conservation measures directed at PSESP. It was found that annual precipitation was important for habitat distributions for all six PSESP (with the percentage contribution to habitat distributions ranging from 18.1 % to 74.9 %) and non-climatic variables including soil and altitude have a large effect on habitat suitability of PSESP. Large quantities of PCAs occurred within some provincial regions for these six PSESP (e.g. Sichuan and Jilin for the PSESP Cathaya argyrophylla, Taxus cuspidata, Annamocarya sinensis and Madhuca pasquieri), indicating that these are likely to be appropriate areas for in-situ and ex-situ conservation measures directed at these PSESP. Those nature reserves with large quantities of PCAs were identified as promising sites for in-situ conservation measures of PSESP; such reserves include Yangzie and Dongdongtinghu for C. argyrophylla, Songhuajiangsanhu and Chang-baishan for T. cuspidata and Shiwandashanshuiyuanlian for Tsoongiodendron odorum. These results suggest that existing seed banks and botanical gardens occurring within identified PCAs should allocate more resources and space to ex-situ conservation of PSESP. In addition, there should be additional botanical gardens established for ex-situ conservation of PSESP in PCAs outside existing nature reserves. To address the risk of negative effects of climate change on PSESP, it is necessary to integrate in-situ and ex-situ conservation as well as climate change monitoring in PSESP conservation planning.

AB  - One of the most important tools in conservation biology is information on the geographic distribution of species and the variables determining those patterns. We used maximum-entropy niche modeling to run distribution models for 222 amphibian and 371 reptile species (49% endemics and 27% threatened) for which we had 34,619 single geographic records. The planning region is in southeastern Mexico, is 20% of the country's area, includes 80% of the country's herpetofauna, and lacks an adequate protected-area system. We used probabilistic data to build distribution models of herpetofauna for use in prioritizing conservation areas for three target groups (all species and threatened and endemic species). The accuracy of species-distribution models was better for endemic and threatened species than it was for all species. Forty-seven percent of the region has been deforested and additional conservation areas with 13.7% to 88.6% more native vegetation (76% to 96% of the areas are outside the current protected-area system) are needed. There was overlap in 26 of the main selected areas in the conservation-area network prioritized to preserve the target groups, and for all three target groups the proportion of vegetation types needed for their conservation was constant: 30% pine and oak forests, 22% tropical evergreen forest, 17% low deciduous forest, and 8% montane cloud forests. The fact that different groups of species require the same proportion of habitat types suggests that the pine and oak forests support the highest proportion of endemic and threatened species and should therefore be given priority over other types of vegetation for inclusion in the protected areas of southeastern Mexico.

AB  - Creating and managing protected areas is critical to ensure the persistence of species but dynamic threats like land-use change and climate change may reduce the effectiveness of protected areas planned under a static approach. Here we defined spatial priorities for the conservation of non-flying mammals inhabiting the Cerrado Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil, that overcome the likely impacts of land-use and climate change to this imperiled fauna. We used cutting-edge methods of species distribution models combining thousands of model projections to generate a comprehensive ensemble of forecasts that shows the likely impacts of climate change in mammal distribution. We also generate a future land-use model that indicates how the region would be impacted by habitat loss in the future. We then used our models to propose priority sites for mammal conservation minimizing species climate-forced dispersal distance as well as the mean uncertainty associated to species distribution models and climate models. At the same time, our proposal maximizes complementary species representation across the existing network of protected areas. Including land-use changes and model uncertainties in the planning process changed significantly the spatial distribution of priority sites in the region. While the inclusion of land-use models altered the spatial location of priority sites at the regional scale, the effects of climate change tended to operate at the local scale. Our solutions already include possible dispersal corridors linking current and future priority sites for mammal. conservation, as well as a formal risk analysis based on planning uncertainties. We hope to provide decision makers with conservation portfolios that could be negotiated at the decision level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Choice of variables, climate models and emissions scenarios all influence the results of species distribution models under future climatic conditions. However, an overview of applied studies suggests that the uncertainty associated with these factors is not always appropriately incorporated or even considered. We examine the effects of choice of variables, climate models and emissions scenarios can have on future species distribution models using two endangered species: one a short-lived invertebrate species (Ptunarra Brown Butterfly), and the other a long-lived paleo-endemic tree species (King Billy Pine). We show the range in projected distributions that result from different variable selection, climate models and emissions scenarios. The extent to which results are affected by these choices depends on the characteristics of the species modelled, but they all have the potential to substantially alter conclusions about the impacts of climate change. We discuss implications for conservation planning and management, and provide recommendations to conservation practitioners on variable selection and accommodating uncertainty when using future climate projections in species distribution models.

AB  - Limited conservation resources mean that management decisions are often made on the basis of scarce biological information. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed as a way to improve the representation of biodiversity features in conservation planning, but the extent to which SDMs are used in conservation planning is unclear. We reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey conservation planning literature to explore if and how SDMs are used in conservation prioritisations. We use text mining to analyse 641 peer-reviewed conservation prioritisation articles published between 2006 and 2012 and find that only 10% of atticles specifically mention SDMs in the abstract, title, and/or keywords. We use topic modelling of all peer-reviewed articles plus a detailed review of a random sample of 40 peer-reviewed and grey literature plans to evaluate factors that might influence whether decision-makers use SDMs to inform prioritisations. Our results reveal that habitat maps, expert-elicited species distributions, or metrics representing landscape processes (e.g. connectivity surfaces) are used more often than SDMs as biodiversity surrogates in prioritisations. We find four main reasons for using such alternatives in place of SDMs: (i) insufficient species occurrence data (particularly for threatened species); (ii) lack of biologically-meaningful predictor data relevant to the spatial scale of planning; (iii) low concern about uncertainty in biodiversity data; and (iv) a focus on accounting for ecological, evolutionary, and cumulative threatening processes that requires alternative data to be collected. Our results suggest that SDMs are perceived as best-suited to dealing with traditional reserve selection objectives and accounting for uncertainties such as future climate change or mapping accuracy. The majority of planners in both the grey and peer-reviewed literature appear to trade off the benefits of using SDMs for the benefits of including information on multiple threats and processes. We suggest that increasing the complexity of species distribution modelling methods might have little impact on their use in conservation planning without a corresponding increase in research aiming at better incorporation of a range of ecological, evolutionary, and threatening processes.

AB  - Guerrero is one of the most diverse states of Mexico, containing a large number of endemic and endangered amphibian species. However, it is one of the less protected and studied states of the country. Here, we determined the potential distribution of all amphibian species in a risk category present in Guerrero and defined priority areas for amphibian conservation in the state. We modelled the potential distribution of 32 species using the maximum entropy modelling algorithm. These models were used to define priority areas through systematic conservation planning tools. The most important variables explaining species' potential distribution were measures of climate variability, particularly temperature seasonality. The priority areas for amphibian conser-vation identified covered a total area of 12,212.72 km(2) and contained an important proportion (almost a third) of the cloud mountain forests of the state. The most important planning units for meeting species targets and the most important planning units in terms of biodiversity overlapped in approximately the same planning units, located in the biogeographic regions of the Sierra Madre del Sur and the Pacific Coast. Finally, from the total priority areas identified, only 0.31% (38.17 km(2)) is currently protected within the existing natural protected areas in Guerrero. Thus, we consider that it is essential to protect additional natural areas in the state. Areas Voluntarily Destined for Conservation (ADVC) may be a good option; however, action must be taken to ensure the legitimacy of the processes by the local people and to avoid privileging only certain members of the community.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Primates play an essential role in human life and its ecosystem. However, Indonesian primates have suffered many threats due to climate change and altered landscapes that lead to extinction. Therefore, primate conservation planning and strategies are important in maintaining their population. We quantified how extensively the protected areas overlapped primate hotspots and how it changes under mitigation and worst-case scenarios of climate change. Finally, we provide protected areas recommendations based on species richness and land-use changes under the worst-case scenario for Indonesian primate conservation planning and management options.
   Indonesia has a large number of primate diversity where a majority of the species are threatened. In addition, climate change is conservation issues that biodiversity may likely face in the future, particularly among primates. Thus, species-distribution modeling was useful for conservation planning. Herein, we present protected areas (PA) recommendations with high nature-conservation importance based on species-richness changes. We performed maximum entropy (Maxent) to retrieve species distribution of 51 primate species across Indonesia. We calculated species-richness change and range shifts to determine the priority of PA for primates under mitigation and worst-case scenarios by 2050. The results suggest that the models have an excellent performance based on seven different metrics. Current primate distributions occupied 65% of terrestrial landscape. However, our results indicate that 30 species of primates in Indonesia are likely to be extinct by 2050. Future primate species richness would be also expected to decline with the alpha diversity ranging from one to four species per 1 km(2). Based on our results, we recommend 54 and 27 PA in Indonesia to be considered as the habitat-restoration priority and refugia, respectively. We conclude that species-distribution modeling approach along with the categorical species richness is effectively applicable for assessing primate biodiversity patterns.

AB  - Only limited research on conservation planning to mitigate the impacts of synergies between land use and climate change have been conducted in Asia. The objectives of this research were to determine shifts in habitats of 17 mammal species resulting from land-use and climate change scenarios in 2050 in northern Thailand and to assess the proposed expansion of protected areas to mitigate the predicted impacts. Qualitative vulnerability assessment of species was determined by using national conservation status, shifts in distribution and coping capacity of protected areas. The potential expansion areas were identified using gravity model. The results indicated that the existing protected areas cannot guarantee the long-term survival of many species. Most selected species would substantially shift their current distributions and will be upgraded from moderate to high-risk. The proposed expansion areas of 5,200 km(2)or 3% of the region would substantially minimize the risk level and increase the average coping capacity of the protection of suitable habitats from 82% as the current plan to 90%. Such patches adjoining existing protected areas should be included in the current system, while patches that are relatively far should be managed as stepping stones or habitat corridors to facilitate movements of wildlife in the landscape.

AB  - Aim Presence-only data represent a significant source of information for quantifying biodiversity distributions and provide opportunities for use in conservation planning. The large databases of presence-only records that are available and the lower cost of acquisition could help overcome the traditional problem of lack of data for conservation. However, there are risks associated with the use of presence-only data inherent with the lack of true absences that might cause omission errors (species are erroneously thought to be absent) and loss of efficiency (more areas are thought to be necessary than needed). These errors could constrain the economic viability of conservation plans and thus the success of conservation practice. We therefore evaluated the opportunities and risks of using presence-only data for conservation planning.
   Location Northern Australia.
   Methods The effects of using two different types (presence-only and presence-absence) and different quantities of data were simulated by building predictive models on different subsets of data with increasing numbers of presence-absence or presence-only records or a combination of both, for 80 freshwater fish species. We then compared the performance of conservation planning outcomes with the best information attainable (a true model built on the complete set of presence-absence data). We measured omission and commission errors in conservation planning outcomes, and the efficiency of and return on the investment in data acquisition.
   Results Including presence-only data helped reduce commission and omission errors in conservation planning outcomes, but only when used in combination with at least some presence-absence data. The use of just a large quantity of presence-only data resulted in significant reductions in the efficiency of conservation planning outcomes, as more areas than actually needed were required to achieve conservation targets. This reduction in efficiency was mainly related to inflated omission errors.
   Main conclusions We recommend using presence-only data cautiously if this is the only source of data available; whenever possible, presence-only data should be complemented with presence-absence data.

AB  - Background
   Climate change has been widely accepted as one of the major threats for global biodiversity and understanding its potential effects on species distribution is crucial to optimise conservation planning in future scenarios under global change. Integrating detailed climatic data across spatial and temporal scales into species distribution modelling can help to predict potential changes in biodiversity. Consequently, this type of data can be useful for developing efficient biodiversity management and conservation planning. The provision of such data becomes even more important in highly biodiverse regions, currently suffering from climatic and landscape changes. The Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Meseta Iberica (BRMI; Portugal-Spain) is one of the most relevant reserves for wildlife in Europe. This highly diverse region is of great ecological and socio-economical interest, suffering from synergistic processes of rural land abandonment and climatic instabilities that currently threaten local biodiversity.
   Aiming to optimise conservation planning in the Reserve, we provide a complete dataset of historical and future climate models (1 x 1 km) for the BRMI, used to build a series of distribution models for 207 vertebrate species. These models are projected for 2050 under two climate change scenarios. The climatic suitability of 52% and 57% of the species are predicted to decrease under the intermediate and extreme climatic scenarios, respectively. These models constitute framework data for improving local conservation planning in the Reserve, which should be further supported by implementing climate and land-use change factors to increase the accuracy of future predictions of species distributions in the study area.
   New information
   Herein, we provide a complete dataset of state-of-the-art historical and future climate model simulations, generated by global-regional climate model chains, with climatic variables resolved at a high spatial resolution (1 x 1 km) over the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Meseta Iberica. Additionally, a complete series of distribution models for 207 species (168 birds, 24 reptiles and 15 amphibians) under future (2050) climate change scenarios is delivered, which constitute framework data for improving local conservation planning in the reserve.

AB  - Biodiversity loss and habitat degradation are big challenges to be tackled by conservation planning since their effects on both ecological and social-economic systems are remarkably detrimental. Efforts to limit anthropogenic impacts on species and habitats need to be assisted by tools for biodiversity monitoring. Effective monitoring tools could help bridge the gap between science and policy, better assess trade-offs between biodiversity and other services, and potentially reduce the associated social costs of conservation. Here, we assessed the feasibility of monitoring habitat quality for bird communities in Central Italy using the InVEST Habitat Quality model. InVEST was parameterized using outputs from species distribution models (SDMs) and expert-based models to explore their viability to support conservation planning. Our results highlight that InVEST parameterized by SDMs produced habitat quality maps that correlated highly with spatial patterns of observed species richness, while the expert-derived InVEST outcomes showed lower correlation. However, the latter approach proved useful as a first-line analysis to identify large-scale areas of conservation concern, where field data and modeling approaches such as SDMs are needed to assess fine-scale conservation value. We show SDM-informed habitat quality maps can accurately identify conservation priority areas, though their applicability is overall limited by data availability. On the other hand, expert-based habitat quality maps can be used as a surrogate approach for preliminary and/or exploratory studies, especially in contexts characterized by poor data availability/quality and budgetary constraints.

AB  - Distributions were predicted for 1430 native plant species as part of a biodiversity assessment in the forests of south-west Western Australia. From these predicted distributions, an index of plant species richness was generated for the forest area. The most common predictors for distribution were found to be climatic surfaces incorporating some aspect of seasonality in temperature and precipitation. Although coarse, the index confirmed existing knowledge of areas of high biodiversity within the study area and introduced a new area, the Blackwood Plateau, for consideration as a conservation reserve with high species richness. An additional survey was conducted to sample actual species richness in 11 test sites. When actual richness was regressed against predicted richness, a significant correlation was obtained if both annuals and geophytes were excluded from the analysis. With refinement of the model and further data collection targeted at areas of low effort, the species richness index is proposed as a useful tool for conservation planning.

AB  - Conservation planning based on the occurrence of rare species has been criticized as being too limited in scope to conserve biodiversity as a whole. Conversely, planning based on indicator taxa may lack sufficient focus to conserve those species in greatest need of conservation. An alternative approach is to identify a variety of species at risk that are associated with areas of conservation value, which is defined based on species-independent characteristics. We identified potential indicators of conservation value using occurrence data on species at risk and independent information on conservation value that incorporated indices of ecosystem integrity. We propose a taxonomically diverse group of indicator species that-are strongly associated with areas of exceptional ecosystem integrity, to serve as a focus for further research and in planning for biodiversity conservation.
   We identify potential indicator species by defining a null model in which species at risk are equally associated with areas of high ecosystem integrity, then by conducting randomization tests to identify noncompliant species in the state of Michigan, USA. Areas of high ecosystem integrity are selected using criteria to flag (1) secure biotic communities with structural integrity and few exotic species, (2) natural areas subjected to expert review, (3) contiguous relict areas of forest interior, (4) contiguous areas of unmodified wetland, and (5) all these areas combined. We determine the spatial occurrence of species at risk using data from Michigan's statewide Natural Heritage database.
   The potential indicators include plants, insects, and birds. Their species identity and distribution of occurrences varies with the five scenarios, and together the species broadly cover the entire state. These species at risk, many of which occur throughout the Great Lakes region, may be used to identify additional areas potentially high in conservation value and to monitor their conservation. The ecological criteria and numerical methods we employ may be broadly applicable as Heritage Program databases in North America and parts of Latin America grow to become representative of species distributions.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning methods to design marine protected area (MPA) networks can provide more meaningful results by addressing the spatiotemporal variability of biota, and by using these data to inform target assignment. This study used Marxan software to design candidate MPA networks to meet conservation targets for 67 coastal fish species on the east coast of South Africa. Species were selected for conservation importance, and included both resident and seasonal migrants. The distribution range of three phases of a species life cycle was generated using either cartographic habitat range models or maximum entropy models, and each used as a separate conservation feature. Two sets of conservation features were developed from this: A static set of 77 distribution models for features which ignored seasonal dynamics, and a seasonal set of 147 distribution models which included seasonal dynamics. Conservation targets depended on a species' extinction vulnerability and its seasonal abundance. Three scenarios were used to test the effects of incorporating seasonal spatial and abundance dynamics into MPA design: Scenario 1 tested the effect of using static or seasonal distribution data; Scenario 2 tested the additional effect of adjusting conservation targets based on seasonal variations in abundance; and Scenario 3 tested the additional effect of incorporating existing MPAs into the MPA network. In all three scenarios, the spatial configuration of MPA networks differed between the two datasets (Kappa 0.37, 0.25, 0.3), and static-designs did not fully meet targets for a number of species or critical life cycle phases of some species, however, larger and more expensive areas were required to design MPAs that could meet all conservation targets for seasonal features. Seasonal abundance adjusted targets was useful to elevate the prioritisation of seasonally abundant migratory species. Including existing MPAs did not change the differences observed between static and seasonal outcomes. We believe this will be true for any marine system that demonstrates seasonal spatial life-history differentiation and abundance dynamics, and advocate its use while giving due consideration to the increased cost associated with spatiotemporal planning.

AB  - Climate change is causing shifts in species distributions worldwide. Understanding how species distributions will change with future climate change is thus critical for conservation planning. Impacts on oceanic islands are potentially major given the disproportionate number of endemic species and the consequent risk that local extinctions might become global ones. In this study, we use species climate envelope models to evaluate the current and future potential distributions of Azorean endemic species of bryophytes, vascular plants, and arthropods on the Islands of Terceira and Sao Miguel in the Azores archipelago (Macaronesia). We examined projections of climate change effects on the future distributions of species with particular focus on the current protected areas. We then used spatial planning optimization software (PRION) to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas at preserving species both in the present and future. We found that contractions of species distributions in protected areas are more likely in the largest and most populated island of Sao Miguel, moving from the coastal areas towards inland where the current protected areas are insufficient and inadequate to tackle species distribution shifts. There will be the need for a revision of the current protected areas in Sao Miguel to allow the sustainable conservation of most species, while in Terceira Island the current protected areas appear to be sufficient. Our study demonstrates the importance of these tools for informing long-term climate change adaptation planning for small islands.

AB  - Smart growth land use planning seeks to balance the infrastructure needs of a growing human population and protection for the environment. Unfortunately, the data required to adequately incorporate biodiversity objectives into land use plans is often not available to planners. One problem is that there are few documented methods that detail how biodiversity data held by resource management agencies can be converted to a format useful for inclusion into smart growth plans. Here we demonstrate an approach that allows for state, provincial, or federal resource management agencies to disseminate data on (1) biodiversity conservation, and (2) conservation of wildlife of recreational value for incorporation into local land use plans. Our approach uses modeled threats and species richness data to identify high priority conservation areas and areas more suitable for future development. This approach provides a transparent mechanism to facilitate inclusion of biodiversity objectives into smart growth planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predicting the geographical distribution of a species is a central topic in ecology, conservation and management of natural resources especially for invasive organisms. Invasive species can modify the structure and function of invaded ecosystems, altering their biodiversity, and causing significant economic losses locally and globally. Therefore, measuring and visualizing the uncertainty inherent in species' potential distributions is fundamental for effective biodiversity monitoring and planning conservation interventions. This paper discusses a new Bayesian approach to mapping this uncertainty using cartograms, previously published knowledge, and presence/absence data.

AB  - Knowledge of geographical distributions and habitat preferences are central to the conservation and management of threatened species. Ecological niche models can be used to map potentially suitable habitat, making them valuable tools in conservation biology. These models can assist in searching for new populations of species with poorly known distributions and can also be used to guide area selection for systematic biodiversity planning. These models have traditionally required ten or more occurrence records for calibration and this has limited the use of these tools in conservation biology, since many threatened species are known from fewer records. However, recently models have been successfully calibrated using few records. To illustrate this, we developed an ecological niche model to map the potential distribution of the endangered Juliana's golden mole (Neamblysomus julianae) in South Africa so that it could be used in searching for unrecorded populations and for area selection in systematic biodiversity plans. A model was calibrated in Maxent using only four occurrence records. Predictor variables included various bioclimatic, soil and vegetation types. The model identified limited suitable habitat within the map region. The first model facilitated the identification of two previously unrecorded populations. A second model was calibrated using the two additional occurrence records. This increased the proportion of correctly predicted presence records. Jackknife analyses indicated that the models were successful at predicting known presences as suitable. This paper demonstrates the use of ecological niche modelling to conservation of a cryptic endangered species with a poorly known distribution and discusses issues that are relevant for the application of this approach to other species.

AB  - The global extent of habitat degradation and accelerated rate of diversity loss requires conservation managers to quickly develop conservation plans within political, financial and time constraints. Despite the important role of surrogate species for structuring site-based conservation, these species have often been selected using unsupervised approaches. We aimed to incorporate the strengths of several surrogate species approaches within a new single species selection framework in order to select a suite of ecologically and culturally suitable landscape species as a complement to the network of current protected areas (PAs) for conservation of central Iranian deserts. Using carnivores, we utilised multiple decision making criteria, combining decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) with analytic network process (ANP) methods, to rank the most important criteria in selecting landscape species. We then applied weighted criteria, ecological niche modelling, experts' information, and attitudes of local communities to score ten candidate species based on the thirteen criteria. Finally we identified a suite of complementary landscape species for ecological planning of the landscape. This framework is as an effective approach for selecting landscape species especially in habitats where there are few data on candidate species.

AB  - The ongoing biodiversity crisis is pushing ecologists and conservation biologists to develop models to foretell the effects of human-induced transformation of natural resources on the distribution of species, although ecology and biogeography still lacks a paradigmatic body of theory to fully understand the drivers of biodiversity patterns. Two decades of research on ecological niche models and species distributions have been characterized by technical development and discussions on a plethora of methods or algorithms to infer and predict species distributions. Here we suggest a metaphorical classification scheme for some of the most popular models based on their complexity, interpretability and suitability for specific applications in ecology and conservation biology. Our purpose is not to compare methods by their capacity to accurately predict the observed distribution of species, nor to criticize how they are commonly used in applied studies. Instead, we believe that a simple classification scheme can potentially highlight how some methods are more suited for specific applications in ecology and conservation biology. Envelope and distance-based models are grouped into the "fish bowl" category, for their transparency and simplicity. Statistical models are classified as "turbine" models, because of their hidden complexity and general applicability. Finally, machine-learning models are classified as "vault" models, for their high complexity and lack of interpretability of fit parameters. We conclude that the diversity of species distribution models used today is expected for a young research field, but the choice of modeling strategy depends on the purpose of the study. We provide some general guidelines for choosing models for studies of conservation planning and climate change mitigation and suggest models of intermediate complexity for conservation planning and forecast of climate change effects on biodiversity as they provide a good balance between interpretability, predictive power and robustness to model over-fit.

AB  - Aim
   We seek to demonstrate that whilst information derived from phylogeographic and landscape genetic approaches has been used broadly to further ecological and evolutionary hypothesis testing, it can also be used to further species modelling approaches, particularly where bioclimatic and demographic methodologies are to be combined to tackle climate change adaptation and conservation planning.
   Location
   General application.
   Methods
   We start with a review of species distribution modelling studies that have used data derived from molecular marker studies, and identify which parameters can realistically be derived from molecular marker studies for inclusion in species and ecosystem distribution prediction and conservation planning.
   Results
   We find that the uptake of phylogeographic and landscape genetic methods to inform species distribution modelling studies has to date been limited (particularly the latter approaches), despite offering clear potential to improve species modelling approaches that aim to combine climatic envelope and demographic parameters. Using a series of cases studies, we demonstrate that phylogeographic approaches can be particularly useful for identifying biogeographic barriers and refugia, testing alternative demographic models, identifying concordant demographic patterns between species within a single ecosystem and testing temporal niche conservatism. We also find that landscape genetic approaches are particularly useful for quantifying landscape permeability and source/sink dynamics of meta-populations and identifying adaptive variation in the landscape. A summary of parameters that are derivable from such studies for modelling and conservation applications is provided.
   Main conclusions
   Molecular marker methods have much to offer species distribution modelling, particularly in the field of climate adaptation. Molecular information can inform on species historical dynamics and contemporary demography necessary to advance species modelling paradigms that seek to integrate climatic and demographic drivers. Furthermore, recognizing diversity below species level and incorporating this information into modelling frameworks will enable conservation managers to plan for the capture of areas of evolutionary potential.

AB  - Network expansion of marine protected areas in a changing world is a difficult task for conservation planners. Brazil experiences a combination of low and uneven protection of marine environmets, increasing anthropogenic pressures, climate change, and gaps in information regarding the geographical distribution of many species (Wallacean shortfall). Here, we addressed these issues and present a strategy for identifying priority marine areas for conservation in Brazil that would contribute to increasing species representation and achievement of conservation targets. Within this strategy, we accounted for (i) species range shifts due to climate change and their influence on species distribution, (ii) the lack of species geographical distribution data, and (iii) anthropic pressures on oceans. First, we built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 12 threatened starfish species in both present and future (2100) times using Maxent. We also quantified and mapped species range shifts. Second, we developed three conservation spatial solutions and compared the 10% top-ranked areas. The results showed that ENMs had a good performance in representing the distribution of species, even those that had few occurrence records. Our models forecasted a significant range expansion for the majority of species (10 out 12) by 2100. We found that the priority sites covering the top-ranked 10% in the study area identified in ours conservation spatial solutions would protect between 10.41% and 15.88%, on average, of suitable areas for the starfish species. Our results indicated priority sites for conservation less affected by anthropic pressures (similar to 2%) when data on human impacts on oceans were incorporated into the spatial prioritization process. We identified a network of priority marine sites for conservation that minimized human influence and considered the effects of climate change on species distribution. We used threatened starfish species as a case study for illustrating our approach; however, such an approach could be applied to any taxonomic group, which supports the development of more effective conservation actions that represent biodiversity under such threats.

AB  - A detailed understanding of species' responses to global climate change provides an informative baseline for designing conservation strategies to optimize protection of biodiversity. However, such information is either limited or not available for many tropical species, making it difficult to incorporate climate change into conservation planning for most tropical species. Here, we used correlative ecological niche models to assess potential distributional responses of 3 range-restricted West African birds, Timneh Parrot (Pscittacus erithracus timneh), Ballman's Malimbe (Malimbus balimanni), and White-necked Rockfowl (Picathartes gymnocephalus), to global climate change. We used primary biodiversity occurrence records for each species obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, eBird, and VertNet; for environmental data, we used climatic variables for the present and future, the latter characterized by 2 IPCC representative concentration pathways (4.5, 8.5) future emissions scenarios and 27 general circulation models for a 2050 time horizon. We found broad present-day potential distributions with respect to climate for all 3 species. Future potential distributions for Ballman's Malimbe and White-necked Rockfowl tended to be stable and closely similar to their present-day distributions; by contrast, we found marked climate change-driven potential range loss across the range of Timneh Parrot. Our results suggest that impacts of climate change on the present distributions of West African birds will in some cases be minimal, but that individual species may respond differently to future conditions. Thus, to optimize conservation of these species, and of bird diversity in general, we recommend that regional-to-national species conservation action plans incorporate climate change adaptation strategies for individual species; ecological niche models could provide an informative baseline information for this planning and prioritization.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDM) are increasingly used in conservation planning to identify priority areas for the establishment of protected areas. Nevertheless, the quality of SDM varies widely and may compromise the effectiveness of protected areas. Here we reviewed whether SDM overprediction is considered in spatial conservation prioritization exercises and evaluated how model overprediction influences the effectiveness and the spatial arrangement of priority areas. To do so, we carried out a systematic review to analyze how researchers have handled SDM overprediction when identifying priority areas for conservation. To show how spatial conservation prioritization outcomes are affected by SDM overprediction, we used SDM of native palm at three geographic scales (Neotropics, Amazon ecoregion, and Ecuadorian Amazon). We found that only 10% of the evaluated manuscripts accounted for model overprediction. Our spatial conservation prioritization based on SDM with overprediction conferred high priority rank values in a region where species do not occur, underestimated the efficiency of selected priority areas, and over or underestimated the efficiency of current protected areas. Such effects were lower at smaller geographic extents. Our findings highlight the importance of improving future spatial conservation prioritization studies through the correction of SDM overprediction, resulting in the detection of more adequate areas for species conservation, especially at broader extents.

AB  - Detailed and reliable information about the spatial distribution of species provides critical information for effective conservation planning. In Victoria, Australia, this responsibility is held by the Department of Sustainability and Environment, which maintains and curates a database of site records for species: the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas. But the information is provided in point form, and therefore, it does not provide an adequate view of species distributions for all management purposes. By integrating known occurrences of species with environmental GIS data layers using a machine learning algorithm, random forest, we have built species distribution models for 523 vertebrate fauna species across the whole state, providing predictive 'maps' that are available for use in various conservation planning activities. In this paper, we introduce and discuss the methods we developed and implemented for producing these models. Specifically, 26 explanatory variables were used for the modelling; three versions of models were built using different sets of explanatory variables; pseudo-absences were chosen by filtering random points with a profile model; model accuracy was assessed using several measures, especially lift curve-related ones; a threshold was selected for each model to transform continuous result to binary one by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and (pseudo) specificity, which was proved to be valid for presence-only data.

AB  - This study had two purposes: (1) to inform a public process that would propose land use zoning for the Chico Creek Watershed in Washington State, USA and (2) to develop and demonstrate the use of readily accessible analytical tools and data for similar public processes across Washington. Three development alternatives (Planned Trend, Moderate, and Conservation) were designed by local citizens and county planners. We created artificial landscapes that depicted how land use zoning and land management practices would effect the spatial distribution of vegetation types. Wildlife-habitat relationship models were constructed for nine focal species. Using computer software known as HABSCAPES, the spatial distributions of habitats were mapped for each species. Under all alternatives the amount of forest vegetation decreased but the amount of mature conifer forest increased relative to current conditions. The relative habitat area index was 0.75, 0.69, 0.71, and 0.71 for the current condition, Planned Trend, Moderate, and Conservation alternatives, respectively. For six species, all future alternatives resulted in less habitat than the current condition, but for three species, all future alternatives resulted in more habitat. When species status was used to weight outcomes, the moderate alternative provided slightly more conservation benefit than the conservation alternative. Lessons learned about public land use planning processes are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change will cause species range shift. However, conservation implications of species range shift are limited. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the efficacy of Protected Areas (PAs) in the conservation of Cordia Africana (Lam.) species under present and future climatic conditions in Tigray region, northern Ethiopia. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model, a species predictive modelling software was used to model both the present and future distributions of Cordia Africana species within the Protected Areas of Tigray region. An ensemble of three General Circulation Models ('CCSM4', HadGEM2-ES' and 'MIROC5') along with two Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios over two time periods (2050 and 2070) were used for modelling the future species distribution. Results indicate that suitable habitats for Cordia Africana species under current climatic conditions covers only 17% of the total area in PAs. However, the total area of suitable habitats for Cordia Africana within the PAs will increase up to 32% under future climate scenarios. The results suggest that PAs show low efficacy to protect Cordia Africana species. Therefore, conservation planning should integrate in situ and forest management strategies while taking into consideration climate change scenarios.

AB  - Mangrove forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services, yet they are declining rapidly due to climate change and human activities. Identification of conservation priority targets across spatial and temporal scales may assist in planning and decision making, especially in areas having rich mangrove diversity but with limited response capacity. In this study, we aimed to identify the species and areas which should be prioritized for conservation in the IndoWest Pacific (IWP) region, one of the two global hotspots of mangroves. We used an ensemble species distribution modelling framework to map the potential distribution of ten species, including true mangroves and mangrove associates, in current, past, and future environmental conditions. The priority targets were then identified through a weighted-scoring approach with the current distribution and the modelled outputs. Our study revealed that precipitation and surface elevation could influence the distribution of the true mangroves, while the temperature was the important variable for the mangrove associates. Although suitable habitat for the mangroves is predicted to increase in future, primarily due to the northward range expansion of six species, areas with high species richness would decrease. We found 7.09% and 4.16% areas of the IWP should be prioritized for conservation of the true mangroves and mangrove associates, respectively. The characteristics of these priority sites indicated that the inclusion of the anthropogenic component in the conservation framework and species-targeted management plans in the protected areas are required for the effective implementation of conservation actions. Five of the studied species, namely Acanthus ilicifolius, Dolichandrone spathacea, Heritiera littoralis, Pemphis acidula and Xylocarpus granatum, were found to have the highest priority score for conservation. The glacial refugia of the species, mostly distributed in the Philippines, New Guinea, southern India and Madagascar, should be explored further for species-specific conservation actions.

AB  - Extending assessments of climate change-induced range shifts via correlative species distribution models by including species traits is crucial for conservation planning. However, comprehensive assessments of future distribution scenarios incorporating responses of biotic factors are poorly investigated. Therefore, the aim of our study was to extend the understanding about the combined usage of species traits data and species distribution models for different life stages and distribution scenarios. We combine global model predictions for the 2050s and thermal performances of Salmo trutta and Salmo salar under consideration of different life stages (adults, juveniles, eggs), timeframes (monthly, seasonally, yearly), and dispersal scenarios (no dispersal, free dispersal, restricted dispersal). We demonstrate that thermal performances of different life stages will either increase or decrease for certain time periods. Model predictions and thermal performances imply range declines and poleward shifts. Dispersal to suitable habitats will be an important factor mitigating warming effects; however, dams may block paths to areas linked to high performances. Our results emphasize enhanced inclusion of critical periods for species and proper dispersal solutions in conservation planning.

AB  - Quantifications of spatial distribution and abundance of animals are essential to identifying key landscape characteristics and targeting locations for conservation action. Since conservation decisions often focus on multiple species aggregated in groups, e. g., guild-level, rather than individual species, predictions of species group abundance are of central importance. However, areas chosen for conservation action may differ if results from various modeling strategies also differ. Therefore, we compared three different strategies for modeling species group distribution and abundance: predict first, assemble later (PA); assemble first, predict later (AP); and the combined assemble, predict, then assemble (APA). All strategies were performed using Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs), which were fit to individual species data and then grouped after modeling, or fit to datasets that were grouped before modeling. Modeling strategies produced very similar results in terms of statistical performance assessed through four evaluation metrics and in spatial patterns in predicted abundance. To further assess potential functional implications of any numeric differences to conservation planning, we examined the relative proportion of the predicted population within existing Canadian protected areas. This metric further confirmed similarity in predictions from the three modeling strategies. Our results suggest that locations targeted for conservation action would be highly consistent among modeling strategies. Slight differences we observed in spatial predictions may be due to data coverage across species ranges, data quality, and the flexibility of the BRTs.

AB  - AimTo propose and compare priority sites for conservation and restoration of woody plants under diverse climate and land use scenarios, considering socio-economic costs, presence of protected areas and distribution of forest remnants.
   LocationThe Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil.
   MethodsWe used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10%, 17% and 20% of the Atlantic Forest extent.
   ResultsCurrent forest remnants cover only 12% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17% and 20% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17% and 20% captured most species and represented on average 26%-34% of species' distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios.
   Main conclusionsProtection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity.

AB  - The use of indicator species in forest conservation and management planning can facilitate enhanced preservation of biodiversity from the negative effects of forestry and other uses of land. However, this requires detailed and spatially comprehensive knowledge of the habitat preferences and distributions of selected focal indicator species. Unfortunately, due to limited resources for field surveys, only a small proportion of the occurrences of focal species is usually known. This shortcoming can be circumvented by using modeling techniques to predict the spatial distribution of suitable sites for the target species. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and other remote sensing (RS) techniques have the potential to provide useful environmental data covering systematically large areas for these purposes. Here, we focused on six bird of prey and woodpecker species known to be good indicators of boreal forest biodiversity values. We used known nest sites of the six indicator species based on nestling ringing records. Thus, the most suitable nesting sites of these species provide important information for biodiversity-friendly forest management and conservation planning. We developed fine-grained, that is, 96 x 96 m grid cell resolution, predictive maps across the whole of Finland of the suitable nesting habitats based on ALS and other RS data and spatial information on the distribution of important forest stands for the six studied biodiversity indicator bird species based on nesting-habitat suitability modeling, that is, the MaxEnt model. Habitat preferences of the study species, as determined by MaxEnt, were in line with the previous knowledge of species-habitat relations. The proportion of suitable habitats of these species in protected areas (PAs) was considerable, but our analysis also revealed many potentially high-quality forest stands outside PAs. However, many of these sites are increasingly threatened by logging because of increased pressures for using forests for bioeconomy and forest industry based on National Forest Strategy. Predicting habitat suitability based on information on the nest sites of indicator species provides a new tool for systematic conservation planning over large areas in boreal forests in Europe, and a corresponding approach would also be feasible and recommendable elsewhere where similar data are available.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation policies focus on securing the survival of species and habitats according to their current distribution. This basic premise may be inappropriate for halting biodiversity decline under the dynamic changes caused by climate change. This study explores a dynamic spatial conservation prioritization problem where climate change gradually changes the future habitat suitability of a site' current species. This has implications for survival probability, as well as for species that potentially immigrate to the site. The problem is explored using a set of heuristics for both of two policy objectives focusing on (1) the protection on current (native) species, and (2) all species, including immigrating species. The trade-offs between the protection of native species versus all species is illustrated. The study shows that the development of prediction models of future species distributions as the basis of decision rules can be crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of conservation plans. Finally, it is discussed how more adaptive strategies, that allow for the redirection of resources from protected sites to privately-owned sites, may increase the effectiveness of the conservation networks. Climate change induced shifts in the suitability of habitats for species may increase the value of such adaptive strategies, the benefit decreasing with increasing migration probabilities and species distribution dynamics.

AB  - 1. Range maps represent the geographic distribution of species, and they are commonly used to determine species coverage within protected areas and to find additional places needing protection. However, range maps are characterized by commission errors, where species are thought to be present in locations where they are not. When available, habitat suitability models can reduce commission errors in range maps, but these models are not always available. Adopting a coarse spatial resolution is often seen as an alternative approach for reducing the effect of commission errors, but this comes with poorly explored conservation trade-offs.
   2. Here, we characterize these trade-offs by identifying scenarios of protected area expansion for the world's threatened terrestrial mammals under different resolutions (10-200 km) and distribution data deriving from range maps and habitat suitability models.
   3. We found that planning new protected areas using range maps results in an overestimation of the species protection level when compared with habitat suitability models (which are more closely related to species presence). This overestimation increases when more area is selected for protection and is higher when higher spatial resolutions are employed.
   4. Adopting coarse resolutions reduced the overestimation of species protection and also halved the spatial incongruence between protected areas prioritized from range maps or habitat suitability models. However, this came at a very high cost, with an area of up to four times greater (12 M km(2) vs. 3 M km (2)) needed to adequately protect all species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that adopting coarse resolutions in protected area planning results in unsustainable increases in costs, with limited benefits in terms of reducing the effect of commission errors in species range maps. We recommend that, if some level of uncertainty is acceptable to practitioners, using range maps at resolutions of 20-30 km is the best compromise for reducing the effect of commission errors while maintaining cost-efficiency in conservation analyses.

AB  - Analyses of species diversity and endemism patterns provide vital inputs for conservation planning. Therefore, it is an important dilemma of biodiversity conservation that in very diverse but poorly studied tropical countries those patterns can hardly be considered. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop prediction models that make the best use of existing data on species distribution and that can give hints on spatial conservation priorities. This paper presents the results of a pilot study on the diversity of the orchid subtribe Pleurothallidinae ( 331 mapped species) in the Andean rain forests of Bolivia. Results of a taxon-based mapping methodology, using abiotic ( humidity and temperature, the latter indicated by altitude) and historical factors ( taken into account as distance from collection localities) that determine species ranges, are compared with outcomes of an inventory-based mapping approach. The patterns of taxon-based diversity and endemism show a strong correlation with the distribution of sample localities. The inventory-based approach is more reliable, but it is interesting to apply both mapping methods in order to make a critical interpretation and comparison that facilitates some valuable conservation recommendations. We end with concrete conclusions for conservation planning and action.

AB  - Natural habitats in urban areas provide benefits for both humans and biodiversity. However, to achieve biodiversity gains, we require new techniques to determine habitat suitability and ecological connectivity that will inform urban planning and development. Using an example of an urban population of water voles Arvicola amphibius, we developed a habitat suitability model and a resistance-surface-based model of landscape connectivity to identify potential connectivity between areas of suitable habitat. We then updated the environmental variables according to new urban development plans and used our models to generate spatially explicit predictions of both habitat suitability and connectivity. To make models accessible to urban and conservation planners, we developed an interactive mapping tool that provided users with a graphical user interface (GUI) to inform conservation planning for this species. The model found that habitat suitability for water voles was related to the proportion and distance from key environmental variables, such as built-up areas and urban green spaces, while the connectivity model identified important corridors connecting areas of potential distribution for this species. Future development plans altered the potential spatial distribution of the water vole population, reducing the extent of suitable habitat in some core areas. The interactive mapping tool made available suitable habitat and connectivity maps for conservation managers to assess new planning applications and for the development of a conservation action plan for water voles. Synthesis and applications. We believe this approach provides a framework for future development of nature conservation tools that can be used by planners to inform ecological decision-making, increase biodiversity and reduce human-wildlife conflict in urban environments.

AB  - Understanding the vulnerability of tree species to anthropogenic threats is important for the efficient planning of restoration and conservation efforts. We quantified and compared the effects of future climate change and four current threats (fire, habitat conversion, overgrazing and overexploitation) on the 50 most common tree species of the tropical dry forests of northwestern Peru and southern Ecuador. We used an ensemble modelling approach to predict species distribution ranges, employed freely accessible spatial datasets to map threat exposures, and developed a trait-based scoring approach to estimate species-specific sensitivities, using differentiated trait weights in accordance with their expected importance in determining species sensitivities to specific threats. Species-specific vulnerability maps were constructed from the product of the exposure maps and the sensitivity estimates. We found that all 50 species face considerable threats, with an average of 46% of species' distribution ranges displaying high or very high vulnerability to at least one of the five threats. Our results suggest that current levels of habitat conversion, overexploitation and overgrazing pose larger threats to most of the studied species than climate change. We present a spatially explicit planning strategy for species-specific restoration and conservation actions, proposing management interventions to focus on (a) in situ conservation of tree populations and seed collection for tree planting activities in areas with low vulnerability to climate change and current threats; (b) ex situ conservation or translocation of populations in areas with high climate change vulnerability; and (c) active planting or assisted regeneration in areas under high current threat vulnerability but low climate change vulnerability, provided that interventions are in place to lower threat pressure. We provide an online, user-friendly tool to visualize both the vulnerability maps and the maps indicating priority restoration and conservation actions.

AB  - Background: Mexico is one of the world's centers of species diversity (richness) for Opuntia cacti. Yet, in spite of their economic and ecological importance, Opuntia species remain poorly studied and protected in Mexico. Many of the species are sparsely but widely distributed across the landscape and are subject to a variety of human uses, so devising implementable conservation plans for them presents formidable difficulties. Multi-criteria analysis can be used to design a spatially coherent conservation area network while permitting sustainable human usage.
   Methods and Findings: Species distribution models were created for 60 Opuntia species using MaxEnt. Targets of representation within conservation area networks were assigned at 100% for the geographically rarest species and 10% for the most common ones. Three different conservation plans were developed to represent the species within these networks using total area, shape, and connectivity as relevant criteria. Multi-criteria analysis and a metaheuristic adaptive tabu search algorithm were used to search for optimal solutions. The plans were built on the existing protected areas of Mexico and prioritized additional areas for management for the persistence of Opuntia species. All plans required around one-third of Mexico's total area to be prioritized for attention for Opuntia conservation, underscoring the implausibility of Opuntia conservation through traditional land reservation. Tabu search turned out to be both computationally tractable and easily implementable for search problems of this kind.
   Conclusions: Opuntia conservation in Mexico require the management of large areas of land for multiple uses. The multi-criteria analyses identified priority areas and organized them in large contiguous blocks that can be effectively managed. A high level of connectivity was established among the prioritized areas resulting in the enhancement of possible modes of plant dispersal as well as only a small number of blocks that would be recommended for conservation management.

AB  - The integration of spatial area prioritization algorithms and species distribution modelling has shown great promise in conservation planning in recent years. However, despite the fact that reptiles and amphibians have the highest threat status of all terrestrial vertebrates, these species are often under-represented in conservation planning. The Kingdom of Morocco possesses the richest and most varied herpetofauna in the Maghreb and the western Mediterranean, and is characterized by high species richness, endemism and number of European relict species. Despite the fact that Moroccan reptiles and amphibians have been the subject of numerous studies by a large number of international herpetologists since the beginning of the 20th century, few or none of these concerned their conservation. This study had three main objectives: (1) to identify those areas that harbour the highest species richness; (2) to evaluate the existing and proposed future 'important biological and ecological sites' (SIBES) conservation area network (CAN) with respect to their ability to protect the herpetofauna adequately; and (3) to identify priority areas into which the existing protected areas can be augmented. We used maximum-entropy species distribution modelling to run distribution models for 11 amphibian and 86 reptile species (27.6% endemics and 12.4% threatened) for which we had 2,170 single geographic records. A total of 97 models were used to create a richness map of the Moroccan herpetofauna and thereby detect both areas of high species richness and the distribution patterns of individual species. This map was subsequently used as a basis for performance evaluation of the CAN and area prioritization using the ConsNet conservation planning software initialized by "Rarity" first, while using representation targets of 5% and 10%. Additionally, the proposed future Moroccan CAN (SIBES) was evaluated in terms of its overlay and proximity with ConsNet solutions using visual interpretation and distance measurements in a GIS. Our results show that Moroccan herpetofauna is poorly protected under the existing and future CAN. Prioritization of areas shows that a major increase in conservation area is required to guarantee the persistence of individual herpetofauna species even with a global minimum representation target of only 10%. An increase of the existing CAN is especially needed along parts of the Atlantic coast, in the north-western Mediterranean region, on the north-eastern Moroccan coast, as well as in several areas in the Sahara, notably vast proportions of the Vallee du Haut and Bas Draa.

AB  - Environmental Diversity (ED) has been proposed as a potential biodiversity surrogate for use in spatial biodiversity planning. The concept is based on the premise that differences in species composition between areas are correlated with differences in environmental conditions. If this is true then sites selected to represent the full range of environmental conditions in an area should provide good coverage of species diversity. This is potentially significant for conservation planning because environmental data are more easily available while species distribution data are often incomplete, but empirical tests of ED have been inconclusive. We explored the value of ED as a biodiversity surrogate using species distribution data from South Africa, focusing on how implementation affects its performance. We used empirical distribution datasets for birds, butterflies, frogs, and reptiles as well as artificial species distributions and modeled distributions for butterflies. Our results show that the form of the underlying optimization model and the number of environmental variables have a significant effect on the performance of ED while the choice of heuristic procedures for selecting sites has no significant effect. We conclude that ED can perform well as a biodiversity surrogacy strategy if it is implemented correctly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - North America has a diverse array of mammalian species. Model projections indicate significant variations in future climate conditions of North America, and the habitats of woodland mammals of this continent may be particularly sensitive to changes in climate. We report on the potential spatial distributions of 13 wide-ranging, relatively common species of North American woodland mammals under future climate scenarios. We examined the potential influence of the mean and seasonal climate variables on the distribution of species. Presence-only occurrence records of species, four predictor variables, two future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5), and two time steps (current and 2070) were used to build species' distribution models using a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). Our results suggested that overall, 11 of the 13 species are likely to gain climatically suitable space (regions where climate conditions will be similar to those of area currently occupied) at the continental scale, but American martenMartes americanaand 'woodland' caribouRangifer tarandusare likely to lose suitable climate range by 2070. Furthermore, climate space is likely to be expanding northwards under future climate scenarios for most of the mammals, and many jurisdictions in the border region between Canada and the USA are likely to lose iconic species, such as mooseAlces alces. We identified regions as potential in situ and ex situ climate change refugia, which are increasingly considered to be important for biodiversity conservation. The model results suggest significant implications for conservation planning for the 13 mammalian species under global climate change, especially at fine spatial scales. Numerous species that are presently common at their southern range edge will be functionally or completely extirpated in 50 years. The potential in situ and ex situ climate change refugia could provide an effective support for adaptive strategies aimed at species conservation planning.

AB  - Aquifer ecosystems provide a range of important services including clean drinking water. These ecosystems, which are largely inaccessible to humans, comprise a distinct invertebrate fauna (stygofauna), which is characterized by narrow distributions, high levels of endemism and cryptic species. Although being under enormous anthropogenic pressure, aquifers have rarely been included in conservation planning because of the general lack of knowledge of species diversity and distribution. Here we use molecular sequence data and phylogenetic diversity as surrogates for stygofauna diversity in aquifers of New South Wales, Australia. We demonstrate how to incorporate these data as conservation features in the systematic conservation planning software Marxan. We designated each branch of the phylogenetic tree as a conservation feature, with the branch length as a surrogate for the number of distinct characters represented by each branch. Two molecular markers (nuclear 18S ribosomal DNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I) were used to evaluate how marker variability and the resulting tree topology affected the site-selection process. We found that the sites containing the deepest phylogenetic branches were deemed the most irreplaceable by Marxan. By integrating phylogenetic data, we provide a method for including taxonomically undescribed groundwater fauna in systematic conservation planning.

AB  - Climate change conservation planning relies heavily on correlative species distribution models that estimate future areas of occupancy based on environmental conditions encountered in present-day ranges. The approach benefits from rapid assessment of vulnerability over a large number of organisms, but can have poor predictive power when transposed to novel environments and reveals little in the way of causal mechanisms that define changes in species distribution or abundance. Having conservation planning rely largely on this single approach also increases the risk of policy failure. Mechanistic models that are parameterized with physiological information are expected to be more robust when extrapolating distributions to future environmental conditions and can identify physiological processes that set range boundaries. Implementation of mechanistic species distribution models requires knowledge of how environmental change influences physiological performance, and because this information is currently restricted to a comparatively small number of well-studied organisms, use of mechanistic modelling in the context of climate change conservation is limited. In this review, we propose that the need to develop mechanistic models that incorporate physiological data presents an opportunity for physiologists to contribute more directly to climate change conservation and advance the field of conservation physiology. We begin by describing the prevalence of species distribution modelling in climate change conservation, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of both mechanistic and correlative approaches. Next, we emphasize the need to expand mechanistic models and discuss potential metrics of physiological performance suitable for integration into mechanistic models. We conclude by summarizing other factors, such as the need to consider demography, limiting broader application of mechanistic models in climate change conservation. Ideally, modellers, physiologists and conservation practitioners would work collaboratively to build models, interpret results and consider conservation management options, and articulating this need here may help to stimulate collaboration.

AB  - A key challenge in conservation is the efficient allocation of limited resources to maximise benefits for biodiversity. Decision-support tools that account for landscape heterogeneity are needed to identify spatially-explicit actions that will achieve the greatest biodiversity benefits with available resources. We developed a raster-based, landscape-scale, spatial conservation action planning tool (SCAP) that offers significant advances for prioritising local and regional scale conservation actions in heterogenous landscapes. The SCAP tool was developed for the state of Victoria, Australia, to integrate heterogeneity of landscapes, species distributions, threats, and management costs and benefits across the state. We used empirical data to derive current and pre-European settlement distributions for 4400 native terrestrial species, and developed spatially explicit models of 19 threats to biodiversity. We coupled structured expert-elicitation techniques with machine learning to map the expected benefits to species, and the implementation costs, of 17 management actions - alone and in combination. We then ranked location-specific actions by their cost-effective contribution to an overall objective of minimizing the risk of species loss in Victoria over the next 50 years, using a modified implementation of the Zonation conservation planning framework. The SCAP tool provides decision makers with a transparent decision-support tool for identifying the cost-effective management actions at scales relevant to management.

AB  - Many studies have overestimated species' range shifts under climate change because they treat climate as the only determinant while ignoring biotic factors. To assess the response of giant pandas to climate change, we incorporated spatial effects in modeling bamboo distributions, which in turn was incorporated to represent giant panda-bamboo biotic interactions in predicting giant panda distribution. Our study revealed potential tolerance of giant pandas to climate change. We found significant residual spatial correlation in the bamboo models. The biotic interactions with bamboo understories and anthropogenic activities had large effects on panda distribution, which lowered the relative importance of climatic variables. Our results are fundamentally different from previous studies that used climate-only and nonspatial approaches, which may have overestimated the effects of climate change on panda and lead to inappropriate conservation recommendations. We strongly advocate that giant panda conservation planning continues to focus on protecting bamboo forest and reducing anthropogenic interferences.

AB  - The consideration of information on social values in conjunction with biological data is critical for achieving both socially acceptable and scientifically defensible conservation planning outcomes. However, the influence of social values on spatial conservation priorities has received limited attention and is poorly understood. We present an approach that incorporates quantitative data on social values for conservation and social preferences for development into spatial conservation planning. We undertook a public participation GIS survey to spatially represent social values and development preferences and used species distribution models for 7 threatened fauna species to represent biological values. These spatially explicit data were simultaneously included in the conservation planning software Zonation to examine how conservation priorities changed with the inclusion of social data. Integrating spatially explicit information about social values and development preferences with biological data produced prioritizations that differed spatially from the solution based on only biological data. However, the integrated solutions protected a similar proportion of the species' distributions, indicating that Zonation effectively combined the biological and social data to produce socially feasible conservation solutions of approximately equivalent biological value. We were able to identify areas of the landscape where synergies and conflicts between different value sets are likely to occur. Identification of these synergies and conflicts will allow decision makers to target communication strategies to specific areas and ensure effective community engagement and positive conservation outcomes.

AB  - Biodiversity impact assessments under threatened species legislation often focus on individual development proposals at a single location, usually for a single species, leading to inadequate assessments of multiple impacts that accumulate over large spatial scales for multiple species. Regulations requiring ad-hoc assessments can lead to death by a thousand cuts, where biodiversity is degraded by many small impacts that individually do not appear to threaten species' persistence. Spatial prioritization methods can improve the efficiency of decision-making by explicitly considering cumulative impacts of multiple proposed developments on multiple species over large spatial scales. We present an assessment approach and a unique case study in which spatial prioritization tools were used to support strategic assessment of a large development plan in Western Australia. The application of the approach helped identify relatively minor alterations to development plans that resulted in reductions in biodiversity impacts and informed expansion of the protected area network. Using these tools to assess trade-offs between conservation and development will help identify planning footprints that minimize biodiversity losses.

AB  - 1. Large-scale conservation planning requires the identification of priority areas in which species have a high likelihood of long-term persistence. This typically requires high spatial resolution data on species and their habitat. Such data are rarely available at a large geographical scale, so distribution modelling is often required to identify the locations of priority areas. However, distribution modelling may be difficult when a species is either not recorded, or not present, at many of the locations that are actually suitable for it. This is an inherent problem for species that exhibit metapopulation dynamics.
   2. Rather than basing species distribution models on species locations, we investigated the consequences of predicting the distribution of suitable habitat, and thus inferring species presence/absence. We used habitat surveys to define a vegetation category which is suitable for a threatened species that has spatially dynamic populations (the butterfly Euphydryas aurinia), and used this as the response variable in distribution models. Thus, we developed a practical strategy to obtain high resolution (1 ha) large scale conservation solutions for E. aurinia in Wales, UK.
   3. Habitat-based distribution models had high discriminatory power. They could generalize over a large spatial extent and on average predicted 86% of the current distribution of E. aurinia in Wales. Models based on species locations had lower discriminatory power and were poorer at generalizing throughout Wales.
   4. Surfaces depicting the connectivity of each grid cell were calculated for the predicted distribution of E. aurinia habitat. Connectivity surfaces provided a distance-weighted measure of the concentration of habitat in the surrounding landscape, and helped identify areas where the persistence of E. aurinia populations is expected to be highest. These identified successfully known areas of high conservation priority for E. aurinia. These connectivity surfaces allow conservation planning to take into account long-term spatial population dynamics, which would be impossible without being able to predict the species' distribution over a large spatial extent.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Where species location data are unsuitable for building high resolution predictive habitat distribution models, habitat data of sufficient quality can be easier to collect. We show that they can perform as well as or better than species data as a response variable. When coupled with a technique to translate distribution model predictions into landscape priority (such as connectivity calculations), we believe this approach will be a powerful tool for large-scale conservation planning.

AB  - Sea-level rise threatens both human communities and vulnerable species within coastal areas. Joint spatial planning can allow conservation and social resiliency goals to work in synergy. We present a case study integrating distribution information of a threatened saltmarsh bird, the eastern black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis jamaicensis), with social information to facilitate such joint planning. We constructed a distribution model for the species within an urbanizing coastal region (New Jersey, USA) and integrated this with publicly available parcel and protected area data to summarize ownership patterns. We estimated that c. 0.3-2.8% (c. 260-2200 ha) of available saltmarsh is occupied by eastern black rail, most of which is publicly owned (79%). Privately owned saltmarsh was spread across nearly 5000 individual parcels, 10% of which contained areas with the highest likelihood of rail presence according to our model (top quartile of predicted occupancy probabilities). Compared with all privately owned saltmarsh, parcels with probable rail habitat were larger (median: 5 versus 2 ha), contained more marsh (87% versus 59%) and were less economically valuable (US$11 200 versus US$36 100). Our approach of integrating species distributions with landownership data helps clarify trade-offs and synergies in species conservation and coastal resiliency planning.

AB  - Climate-informed spatial planning is urgently needed to guide initiatives aimed at both conserving biodiversity as a whole (e.g. protection of 30% of lands and waters by 2030) and recovering North American avifauna in particular. Various methods for prioritizing conservation areas exist, yet alternative methods may direct managers to different lands for protection, and thus varying recommendations for meeting area-based targets. Here, we used bird species distribution models and landcover projections to systematically evaluate two widely used methods for prioritizing areas most likely to facilitate the persistence of multiple species under climate change: 1) in situ macrorefugia, identified as areas of high predicted species retention; and 2) complementarity-based optimizations, identified using the Zonation conservation planning software. For 17 biogeographical groups in the continental United States, we compared priority areas for bird conservation derived from these two alternatives with respect to their spatial distributions and consensus (i.e. overlap), expected conservation outcomes (e.g. species and functional diversity), predicted climate change exposure, habitat characteristics, landscape configurations and degree of formal protection. Spatial distributions of priority areas differed by biogeographical group and method, with 40.5% consensus on average across groups. Consensus was extensive within mountainous and coastal regions, and limited at high latitudes (e.g. Alaska) and in flat, interior regions (e.g. grasslands). As expected, complementarity-based optimizations more efficiently represented species than retention-based in situ macrorefugia, especially for forest groups, and had greater overall biodiversity value and better habitat condition. Conversely, in situ macrorefugia encompassed higher elevations and larger contiguous patches and were expected to experience less winter-season warming. Formal protection averaged < 50% across biogeographical groups, regardless of prioritization method. Our findings illustrate the value of complementarity-based optimizations for bird conservation under climate change. More broadly, comparing approaches for prioritizing areas for long-term species persistence can reveal critical trade-offs in recommendations for climate-informed protected area planning.

AB  - Climate change has created the need for new strategies in conservation planning that account for the dynamics of factors threatening endangered species.
   Here we assessed climate change threat to the European otter, a flagship species for freshwater ecosystems, considering how current conservation areas will perform in preserving the species in a climatically changed future. We used an ensemble forecasting approach considering six modelling techniques applied to eleven subsets of otter occurrences across Europe. We performed a pseudo-independent and an internal evaluation of predictions. Future projections of species distribution were made considering the A2 and B2 scenarios for 2080 across three climate models: CCCMA-CGCM2, CSIRO-MK2 and HCCPR HAD-CM3. The current and the predicted otter distributions were used to identify priority areas for the conservation of the species, and overlapped to existing network of protected areas.
   Our projections show that climate change may profoundly reshuffle the otter's potential distribution in Europe, with important differences between the two scenarios we considered. Overall, the priority areas for conservation of the otter in Europe appear to be unevenly covered by the existing network of protected areas, with the current conservation efforts being insufficient in most cases. For a better conservation, the existing protected areas should be integrated within a more general conservation and management strategy incorporating climate change projections. Due to the important role that the otter plays for freshwater habitats, our study further highlights the potential sensitivity of freshwater habitats in Europe to climate change.

AB  - Organismal response to climate change may affect long-term conservation plans. However, how climate change affects the distribution and conservation status of some plant species is still being debated. To test this, we selected four economically important legume species (Adenocarpus mannii, Afzelia bella, Afzelia bipindensis and Baphia nitida) from the Nigeria-Cameroon border in West Africa. The link between climate change and the species distribution range was predicted using the ensemble species distribution model (ESDM). Our analyses revealed the precipitation of the coldest period (50%) and precipitation of the driest period (40%) as the most important environmental variables influencing the distribution of the studied species. The projection shows independent habitat shifts (gain/loss) of the species consequent to climate change in the future (2050 and 2070). Despite the restricted coverage of occupancy for the selected species, our estimated species distribution range from the ESDM agrees with the current IUCN conservation status (least concern) for A. mannii. Hence, our results suggest that species distribution modelling at local habitats could yield insights into global species conservation assessments. Our findings highlighted the need for conservation through regulated land use in Dibombari highland, Cameroon Mountain (Cameroon) and the forests around Oban hills in Nigeria due to projected high species loss consequent to climate change. Thus, we recommend ecological niche modelling with extensive field surveys across the entire geographic range of these species for robust inferences that allow comparisons with the IUCN status.

AB  - The prediction of species distribution is emerging as an important tool for conservation and rehabilitation planning of economically important plant species including medicinal and aromatic plants. Paris polyphylla, an economically and high valued medicinal plant of Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) is reported to lose its habitat area due to over-exploitation. In this study, attempts were made to understand vegetation pattern and find the potential distribution of Paris polyphylla, using MaxEnt in Pindar Valley (2000-4000 m ASL), Bageshwar district of Uttarakhand state, India. MaxEnt is a machine learning data mining technique that estimates a species distribution by finding the distribution of maximum entropy, based on existing knowledge. Phytosociological studies revealed the varying density of target species ranging from 0.50 ind/m(2) (P1; 2000 m asl) to 2.00 ind/m(2) (P6; 2500 m asl). Among the different geographical provinces of Uttarakhand, MaxEnt predicted wider potential distribution of P. polyphylla in temperate forest with an overall estimated area of 790.85 km(2) as suitable. It was found that Precipitation, Elevation and Vegetation type were the most important variables for predicting the habitat suitability. Dwali (ca. 2500 m ASL) site was predicted as a potential distribution area of P. polyphylla with ground-based validation and further suggested this area as a potential reintroduction site. The results of this study can be used to plan protection and re-introduction of P. polyphylla in the region. MaxEnt approach is thus a very promising tool in species conservation planning and in predicting the potential distribution of other high valued medicinal plants of IHR.

AB  - The concept of shifting or sliding baselines refers to the way that significant changes to an ecological system are mistakenly measured against a previous baseline, which may be significantly different from the original state of the system. The concept assumes an 'original state' exists and that a return to that state might be possible, if it could be determined and there was sufficient control of human interference. The concept has been important in both marine conservation planning and fisheries management. However, long periods of exploitation, observed and projected climate change, and the disappearance of some environments, suggest that a return to an original state is unlikely to be achievable in many systems. In addition, protection based on static marine protected areas is unlikely to meet common conservation objectives, as species and habitats are moving and species assemblages shuffling with the changing climate. An alternative to modeling single species distribution changes is to examine change in environmental proxies, such as sea surface temperature (SST). Here, projected changes in SST for the period 2063-2065 from a down-scaled ocean model are used to illustrate the similarity to, and movements of, present pelagic environments within conservation planning areas off Eastern Australia. The future environment of small planning areas differs from their present environment and static protected areas might not protect range-changing species. Climate-aware conservation planning should consider the use of mobile protected areas to afford protection to species' changing their distribution, and develop conservation objectives that are not underpinned by a return to historical baselines.

AB  - P>1. Conservation of declining migratory species is a challenging task, as the factors that may have determined their past distribution may not determine their current and future distribution. Saiga antelope Saiga tatarica populations have massively declined due to poaching. The species is now beginning to recover in Kazakhstan and protected areas are being implemented. Using 25 years of aerial monitoring data, we identified changes in the spring distribution and predicted densities of saiga to prioritize areas for protection under scenarios of climate change together with changes in disturbance and population size. Conserving the spring distribution is critical as spring calving aggregations are of particular importance to population viability.
   2. The current distribution is strongly influenced by disturbance, whereas climate had a stronger influence in the past. The area of highly suitable habitat has halved and become fragmented in the last decade. The existing and proposed protected areas are relatively complementary and perform well under most scenarios of future change. However there is a need to widen the geographical scope of protected area planning if potential future high suitability areas are to be effectively protected.
   3. Climate change interacts with other factors to determine the distribution of suitable habitat within and outside protected areas. Scenarios in which conservation has increased saiga population size and density tend to show limited impacts of climate change, while scenarios in which the saiga population fails to recover and disturbance continues show, worsening patchiness and reduced suitable habitat.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We provide evidence for changing distribution and density of a migratory species over a large spatio-temporal scale, and suggest that future distribution may be more constrained and spatially heterogeneous. These results have important implications for designing future conservation measures for migratory species, such that areas that robustly show high suitability under a range of potential scenarios of change can be included in protected area expansion plans. Protected area placement based only on current, rather than projected distribution risks wasting opportunities for proactive conservation, particularly for a highly disturbed, recovering species likely to be affected by climate change.

AB  - Blooming citizen science in China creates opportunities to update distribution maps of threatened birds and contributes to decision making for conservation. 46,073 records submitted by over 7000 bird watchers from 1998 to 2013 in China cover 1195 of 1371 species and all provincial administrative districts in the country. We extracted 13,181 occurrence localities for 95 threatened species defined by the IUCN Red List and 239 national protected species in China. By applying these data in MaxEnt model, we identified new conservation hotspots for threatened birds in China in coastal regions of the Bohai Gulf and the Yellow Sea, the south of the North China Plain, and the lower reach of the Yangtze River. These new conservation hotpots are not included in the global biodiversity hotspots, and not all represented in the priority regions in National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). These newly identified conservation hotspots are seriously under-protected: only less than 2% of them are in national nature reserves. There is a long way to go to meet the Aichi targets, a plan to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2020.

AB  - Improved quantification of species' ranges is needed to provide more accurate estimates of extinction risks for conservation planning. Highland tropical biodiversity may be particularly vulnerable to the anthropogenic changes in land cover and climate and is subject to overestimation of geographic range size in IUCN assessments. Here, we demonstrate a novel and practical approach for quantifying inferred range reductions based upon temporal matching of recent species occurrence localities and vegetation data. As an illustration pertinent to montane forest-associated species with limited distribution data, we use Gymnuromys roberti, an endemic Malagasy rodent with a Least Concern conservation status. We estimated climatic suitability and climate change vulnerability using species distribution modeling (SDM). We then determined deforestation tolerance thresholds for the species by temporally matching recent occurrence localities with percent forest cover values from MODIS forest cover layers. Finally, we applied these thresholds in postprocessing SDM-based range estimates. These estimates demonstrate that the lack of sufficient forest cover substantially reduces the species' current estimated range compared with the IUCN range map. Projections to 2050 suggest that there will be a loss of climatic suitability over three quarters of the currently suitable habitat along with increased fragmentation, highlighting the need to include climate change vulnerability assessments as an integral part of conservation planning. Broader application of SDMs could assist practitioners at various stages of conservation planning, stressing the need for improved accessibility of methodologically complex SDM approaches.

AB  - The notion that conservation areas are static geographical units for biodiversity conservation should be revised when planning for climate-change adaptation. Since species are expected to respond to climate change by shifting their distributions, conservation areas can lose the very same species that justified their designation. Methods exist to take into account the potential effects of climate on spatial priorities for conservation. One of such methods involves the identification of time-ordered linkages between conservation areas (hereafter termed climate-change corridors), thus enabling species tracking their suitable changing climates. We critically review and synthesise existing quantitative approaches for spatial conservation planning under climate change. We extend these approaches focusing on the identification of climate-change corridors, using three alternative models that vary on the objective function (minimum cost or maximum benefit sought) and on the nature of conservation targets (area-based or persistence probabilities). The three models for establishing climate-change corridors are illustrated with a case study involving two species distributed across the Iberian Peninsula. The species were modelled in relation to climate-change scenarios using ensembles of bioclimatic models and theoretical dispersal kernels. The corridors obtained are compared for their location, the temporal sequence of priorities, and the effectiveness with which solutions attain persistence and cost objectives. By clearly framing the climate-change corridors problem as three alternative models and providing the corresponding mathematical descriptions and solving tools, we offer planners a wide spectrum of models that can be easily adapted to a variety of conservation goals and constraints.

AB  - Conservation biogeography involves the application of biogeographical principles, theories, and analyses to problems regarding biodiversity conservation. The field was formally defined in 2005, and considerable research has been conducted in the ensuing 5 years.
   This editorial sets the context for 16 contributions in a special issue of Diversity and Distributions on developments and challenges in conservation biogeography. Papers are grouped into the following main themes: species distribution modelling; data requirements; approaches for assigning conservation priorities; approaches for integrating information from numerous disparate sources; special challenges involving invasive species; and the crucial issue of determining how elements of biodiversity are likely to respond to rapid climate change. One paper provides a synthesis of requirements for a robust conservation biogeography for freshwater ecosystems.
   Conservation biogeography is well poised to make a significant contribution to the process of providing policy makers with objectively formulated scenarios and options for the effective management of biodiversity. The editorial, and the papers in the special issue, deliberate on many of the exciting developments in play in the field, and the many complex challenges that lie ahead.

AB  - The rapid global loss of biodiversity has led to a proliferation of systematic conservation planning methods. In spite of their utility and mathematical sophistication, these methods only provide approximate solutions to real-world problems where there is uncertainty and temporal change. The consequences of errors in these solutions are seldom characterized or addressed. We propose a conceptual structure for exploring the consequences of input uncertainty and oversimplified approximations to real-world processes for any conservation planning tool or strategy. We then present a computational framework based on this structure to quantitatively model species representation and persistence outcomes across a range of uncertainties. These include factors such as land costs, landscape structure, species composition and distribution, and temporal changes in habitat. We demonstrate the utility of the framework using several reserve selection methods including simple rules of thumb and more sophisticated tools such as Marxan and Zonation. We present new results showing how outcomes can be strongly affected by variation in problem characteristics that are seldom compared across multiple studies. These characteristics include number of species prioritized. distribution of species richness and rarity, and uncertainties in the amount and quality of habitat patches. We also demonstrate how the framework allows comparisons between conservation planning strategies and their response to error under a range of conditions. Using the approach presented here will improve conservation outcomes and resource allocation by making it easier to predict and quantify the consequences of many different uncertainties and assumptions simultaneously. Our results show that without more rigorously generalizable results, it is very difficult to predict the amount of error in any conservation plan. These results imply the need for standard practice to include evaluating the effects of multiple real-world complications on the behavior of any conservation planning method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Museum records have great potential to provide valuable insights into the vulnerability, historic distribution, and conservation of species, especially when coupled with species-distribution models used to predict species' ranges. Yet, the increasing dependence on species-distribution models in identifying conservation priorities calls for a more critical evaluation of model robustness. We used 11 bird species of conservation concern in Brazil's highly fragmented Atlantic Forest and data on environmental conditions in the region to predict species distributions. These predictions were repeated for five different model types for each of the 11 bird species. We then combined these species distributions for each model separately and applied a reserve-selection algorithm to identify priority sites. We compared the potential outcomes from the reserve selection among the models. Although similarity in identification of conservation reserve networks occurred among models, models differed markedly in geographic scope and flexibility of reserve networks. It is essential for planners to evaluate the conservation implications of false-positive and false-negative errors for their specific management scenario before beginning the modeling process. Reserve networks selected by models that minimized false-positive errors provided a better match with priority areas identified by specialists. Thus, we urge caution in the use of models that overestimate species' occurrences because they may misdirect conservation action. Our approach further demonstrates the great potential value of museum records to biodiversity studies and the utility of species-distribution models to conservation decision-making. Our results also demonstrate, however, that these models must be applied critically and cautiously.

AB  - Mountaintop rupestrian grasslands or campos rupestres are unique ecosystems with high plant biodiversity. The southern Espinhaco mountains in Brazil are particularly important because they currently harbor 255 threatened plant species at risk of extinction owing to overspread farming, mining and uncontrolled fire in the region. Using the best available data on the distribution of these threatened species, distribution of farming and mining activities, and up-to-date data on fire frequency, here we developed a systematic conservation plan for all these species and pinpointed priority regions for taking different conservation actions. We found that it is possible to protect, on average, more than 25% of the threatened species ranges, avoiding sites with extensive use for farming and mining and favoring areas with intensive fire frequency while constraining the management to a relatively small area of only 17% of the region. The analysis accounts for what is already protected within protected areas in the region and is, therefore, complementary to the work already held by the actors and environmental organizations of the region. We offer maps of priority areas with their respective level of protection and suggest conservation actions at different levels of engagement to be implemented in the priority areas. These priority areas are part of a national species recovery plan for the region in Brazil and will likely support stakeholders and decision makers in its application in the forthcoming years.

AB  - I here evaluate the conservation status of 64 species of diurnal raptors in Venezuela based on extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) derived from geomatic-based geographic distribution modeling and gap analysis. I modeled the geographic distribution of raptor species to quantify distribution areas using the maximum entropy modeling techniques with nine environmental variables that were believed to influence the geographic distribution of raptors. The EOO and AOO were used to reevaluate the conservation status of diurnal raptors in Venezuela, applying Criteria B of the IUCN Red List. Furthermore, a gap analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of strictly protected areas (SPA) in the conservation of birds of prey. EOO ranged from 10,423 km(2) to 907,223 km(2) and AOO values ranged from 6566 km(2) to 903,193 km(2); four species met the B1 criterion and are qualified to be reclassified. The gap analysis revealed that, on average, 20% and 24% of species' EOO and AOO, respectively, were protected within SPA. In theory, SPA are assuming an effective role in the protection of species' geographic distribution. Raptor conservation in Venezuela must be thoroughly planned; an update in land-use planning (territorial ordering) to enhance the connectivity among SPA would improve the protection of raptors.

AB  - In response to the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, habitat network conservation and restoration has become a central objective in conservation planning. Evaluating landscape functional connectivity and mapping habitat networks are key steps for implementing effective actions, but both remain challenging. Habitat suitability models (HSM) and spatial graphs provide conservation managers with useful information for landscape planning. To tackle their respective drawbacks, we proposed to combine HSM and spatial graphs in a four-step methodological framework: (i) collect and prepare input data; (ii) model habitat suitability using MaxEnt to map the species' habitat suitability index (HSI); (iii) transform the HSI map into spatial graph inputs using GIS; and, (iv) perform spatial graph connectivity analysis using Graphab. The outputs of this species-specific and quantitative approach were maps of the species' habitat network. Habitat patches and dispersal linkages were ranked according to their importance for overall habitat availability and landscape connectivity. This prioritization identified locations where conservation biologists and landscape planners should focus conservation and restoration efforts. This framework is illustrated here with a case study on the woodlark (Lullula arborea) - a bird species - in a French Mediterranean area, and the method's limitations and alternatives are discussed. The quantitative-based graphical outputs of the framework can valuably support decision-making for landscape planning, complement local expert opinion, and encourage appropriate stake-holders to cooperate at regional scale.

AB  - General principles of climate change adaptation for biodiversity have been formulated, but do not help prioritize actions. This is inhibiting their integration into conservation planning. We address this need with a decision framework that identifies and prioritizes actions to increase the adaptive capacity of species. The framework classifies species according to their current distribution and projected future climate space, as a basis for selecting appropriate decision trees. Decisions rely primarily on expert opinion, with additional information from quantitative models, where data are available. The framework considers in-situ management, followed by interventions at the landscape scale and finally translocation or ex-situ conservation. Synthesis and applications: From eight case studies, the key interventions identified for integrating climate change adaptation into conservation planning were local management and expansion of sites. We anticipate that, in combination with consideration of socio-economic and local factors, the decision framework will be a useful tool for conservation and natural resource managers to integrate adaptation measures into conservation plans.

AB  - A recent shift in conservation policy from the site scale to the ecosystem or landscape scale requires underpinning by large-scale species distribution data. This poses a significant challenge in conserving small/less charismatic species (SLCS's) whose often cryptic nature can result in spatially restricted sampling, thus preventing landscape scale conservation projects from being realised for these ecologically important groups.
   Species distribution models (SDMs) can provide a powerful tool to bridge this gap. However, in the case of SLCS's (here lichen epiphytes in temperate rainforests of western Scotland are used as a model system), direct predictor variables exist at micro-scales (millimetres to centimetres), which are not extensively available in landscape-scale datasets. Here we identify a group of well-mapped larger-scale 'compound variables' which capture the effect of multiple direct predictors (such as bark pH and topography), and test whether they can be successfully used to predict species distributions at the landscape scale, circumventing the need for direct (micro scale) predictor data.
   By testing the SDMs more widely within western Scotland, accurate predictions of species presence/absence could be made throughout the region for 5 of the 9 lichen epiphytes, making these SDMs extremely valuable as a conservation planning tool.
   Species distribution models utilising compound variables as predictors offer a solution to the paucity of species distributional data for SLCS's, and present a valuable resource in conservation planning for such species. The importance of testing the SDMs outside of a training region to prevent prediction error is highlighted however.

AB  - Models of species' distributions are commonly used to inform landscape and conservation planning. In urban and semiurban landscapes, the distributions of species are determined by a combination of natural habitat and anthropogenic impacts. Understanding the spatial influence of these two processes is crucial for making spatially explicit decisions about conservation actions. We present a logistic regression model for the distribution of koalas ( Phascolarctos cinereus) in a semiurban landscape in eastern Australia that explicitly separates the effect of natural habitat quality and anthropogenic impacts on koala distributions. We achieved this by comparing the predicted distributions from the model with what the predicted distributions would have been if anthropogenic variables were at their mean values. Similar approaches have relied on making predictions assuming anthropogenic variables are zero, which will be unreliable if the training data set does not include anthropogenic variables close to zero. Our approach is novel because it can be applied to landscapes where anthropogenic variables are never close to zero. Our model showed that, averaged across the study area, natural habitat was the main determinant of koala presence. At a local scale, however, anthropogenic impacts could be more important, with consequent implications for conservation planning. We demonstrated that this modeling approach, combined with the visual presentation of predictions as a map, provides important information for making decisions on how different conservation actions should be spatially allocated. This method is particularly useful for areas where wildlife and human populations exist in close proximity.

AB  - Understanding the impact of multiple anthropogenic threats on tree species is urgently needed for estimating population decline and enabling coordinated and efficient conservation actions. We applied a spatially explicit framework to assess the vulnerability of three highly valuable Asian rosewood species (Dalbergia cochinchinensis, D. cultrata, D. oliveri) to five key threats across their native ranges in six countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion. All three species face significant threat levels from at least one of the five threats in more than 75% of their native ranges, including within existing protected areas. Overexploitation is the single most important threat (53-60%), followed by habitat conversion (17-41%) and fire (20-28%). About 21% of the distribution range of D. cultrata is under medium to very high threat from climate change, which is predicted to have less impact on D. oliveri and on D. cochinchinensis. Based on our threat assessment we delineated species-specific priority areas for conservation and restoration that we subdivided by ecoregions as a surrogate for adaptive variation within species. Half of the ecoregions were classified as priority for improving the conservation of adaptive variation in one or more of the species. We propose spatially explicit follow-up actions that include in situ conservation, restoration, and ex situ conservation to improve the effectiveness of current conservation measures to capture adaptive variation within species. Transboundary coordination will be important to effectively address conservation threats. The study can act as a model for regional planning for other valuable tree species.

AB  - We used predictive modeling of species distributions to identify conservation priority areas in the equatorial Pacific region of western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. Museum and herbarium data and predictive models of species distributions are increasingly being used to assess the conservation status of individual species. In this study, we assembled occurrence data for 28 species of vascular plants, birds, and mammals to assess the conservation priorities of the set of natural communities that they represent. Environmental variables were used to predict the species' distributions using correlative modeling as an alternative to point data, which has been the traditional approach to identify critical areas. Specific priority sites for conservation were identified using an area-selection algorithm based on simulated annealing. Four scenarios of prioritization were created using different criteria for the spatial compactness of the selected sites and fragmentation of remnant habitat. The results provide a preliminary assessment of conservation priorities for the dry ecosystems of the Equatorial Pacific region, and will serve as guidelines to focus future fieldwork.

AB  - For over a century the foundation of biological conservation has been the development of open space networks either through outright public land acquisition or appropriate management of private lands. Because both approaches come with significant trade-offs, it is critical to understand which species are found across various land ownership types so that policy tools and management actions can efficiently be targeted to do the most good. In this paper, presence-only biological data were used to create species distribution maps for 18 imperilled forest bird species that breed within the deciduous forests of New Jersey (USA). These maps, combined with publicly available, spatially explicit information on land ownership, document who owns the habitat relied on by each of these 18 species. There were significant variations in both species-and guild-specific reliance on public versus private lands, with the latter preferentially supporting nearly twice as many species as the former. Subcategories of land ownership provided support for the role of both state-owned forests and privately-owned agricultural lands in forest bird conservation; however, each landownership type supports a distinct set of species. While explicitly recognizing the need to employ diverse conservation strategies, the approach provides a solid framework for structuring forest conservation planning and policy at regional scales.

AB  - In this study, we combine species distribution models with a reserve selection approach to assess the degree of representation of xenarthrans in the existing protected area network of Argentina, and to identify conservation priority areas that may help expand the current system. Species distribution models were developed from species' occurrence records using a maximum entropy algorithm. Maps of species distributions were produced for 15 of the 16 species currently present in the country. To assess the performance of the existing protected area network in representing all modeled species, and to identify priority areas to expand the current reserve system, we used the software Zonation. Overall, all species modeled are represented in the existing protected area network. However, the percentage of their ranges covered by protected areas is very low (average = 6.7%; range = 1.7-17.6%). To represent at least 5% of the distribution of each species, 8.8% of the country's area would be needed, and species with restricted ranges have the greatest increase in representation in this scenario. When 10% of the country is set aside for conservation, species representation increases considerably, again favoring range-restricted species. Most of the areas identified as conservation priorities are under strong anthropogenic pressures, including deforestation, agricultural expansion, and hunting. Our analysis provides a preliminary assessment of conservation priorities for the xenarthrans of Argentina, and we hope will serve as guideline to focus future conservation assessments at more refined scales.

AB  - Knowledge of spatiotemporal distribution of biodiversity is still very incomplete in the tropics. This is one of the major problems preventing the assessment and effectiveness of conservation actions. Mega-diverse tropical regions are being exposed to fast and profound environmental changes, and the amount of resources available to describe the distribution of species is generally limited. Thus, the tropics is losing species at unprecedented rates, without a proper assessment of its biodiversity. Species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to fill such biogeographic gaps within a species' range and, when allied with systematic conservation planning (e.g. analyses of representativeness, gap analysis), help transcend such data shortage and support practical conservation actions. Within the Neotropics, eastern Amazon and northern Cerrado present a high variety of environments and are some of the most interesting ecotonal areas within South America, but are also among the most threatened biogeographic provinces in the world. Here, we test the effectiveness of the current system of Protected Areas (PAs), in protecting 24 threatened and endemic bird species using SDMs. We found that taxa with wider distributions are potentially as protected as taxa with smaller ranges, and larger PAs were more efficient than smaller PAs, while protecting these bird species. Nonetheless, Cerrado PAs are mostly misallocated. We suggest six priority areas for conservation of Neotropical birds. Finally, we highlight the importance of indigenous lands in the conservation of Neotropical biodiversity, and recommend the development of community management plans to conserve the biological resources of the region.

AB  - Many conservation management strategies focus on individual species. Emerging landscape-scale processes that affect large numbers of species make spatially explicit strategies essential. Spatial models of species habitat are important elements of planning. There are numerous modelling options to suit a variety of data constraints. No modelling option alone accounts easily for the dynamic nature of habitat change. Coupled with dynamic habitat and population models, they provide a relatively complete framework for testing ideas and exploring conservation options.

AB  - Species ranges are changing in response to human-related disturbances and often management and conservation decisions must be based on incomplete information. In this context, species distribution models (SDMs) represent the most widely used tool, but they often lack any reference to demographic performance of the population under study, spatial structure of the habitat patches, or connectivity at the landscape level.
   Combining a multi-state SDM with a landscape pattern analysis and a mortality model, we developed a spatially-explicit, integrated model to assist and inform conservation planning for the Apennine brown bear in central Italy. We identified 15 critical habitat areas, potentially hosting 76 adult female bears. Many of these areas are, however, characterized by high levels of human-related mortality, making them attractive sink-like areas. Structural connectivity was higher in the northern part of the study area while only limited connectivity characterizes the core area, where most of the bears currently live.
   Our integrated model indicates that the conservation of this relict and isolated bear population is a realistic conservation goal, as we estimated that 192-270 bears could live across the Apennines. Our modelling framework enhances the biological realism of traditional SDMs and provides a conservation planning tool that integrates habitat suitability, mortality risk (as a component of the total demographic performance) and structural connectivity among habitat patches at the landscape scale. It is particularly suited for endangered species living in a human-modified landscapes where establishing a realistic and spatially explicit conservation goal would facilitate pro-active management.

AB  - Maintenance of biodiversity requires spatial planning for the conservation of species habitats. In this study, the distribution of the White-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) in Poland was used to assess the usefulness of a demographic model compared to an area-based model for predicting the occurrence of breeding pairs in local landscapes. The models were applied to the European Forest Map and to CORINE land cover data, two spatial databases derived from remote sensing. We tested the performance of the models by comparing predicted occurrence of the species with actual occurrence in 10 km x 10 km of the Polish Ornithological Atlas Database (POAD). Both models proved useful for identifying areas with high potential for hosting breeding woodpeckers. However, the demographic model performed consistently better at predicting the presence of at least one breeding pair in local landscapes. In north-eastern and south-eastern Poland, expected occurrences coincided with the actual occurrence of the species according to POAD. In north-western Poland, however, occurrence was predicted but not confirmed by the atlas data. The eastern regions are situated at the border to Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia. These countries hold large areas of high conservation value forests and large populations of White-backed Woodpecker. This pattern evokes the need for cross-border governance, and planning with an eco-regional perspective that considers both EU and non-EU countries. Moreover, the results stress the need to incorporate population requirements when assessing the distribution of forests with high conservation value. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Angel sharks are among the most threatened species of sharks globally. Twenty-two species have been identified globally so far, with three species being present in the Mediterranean Sea: Squatina aculeata, Squatina oculata, and Squatina squatina. The Mediterranean populations of all three species have been assessed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to the steep decline of their populations as a result of their historical and current overexploitation by demersal fisheries. Therefore, currently there is an ongoing increasing effort for advancing the conservation of the species in the basin. Recently, in the context of the Regional Action Plan for Mediterranean Angel Sharks, the Aegean Sea and Crete have been identified as critical areas for all three species. This study provides the first predictive distribution map of the three angel shark species in the basin, while critical areas for the conservation of the species were identified through a systematic spatial conservation planning analysis. Our analysis revealed low overlapping between the existing MPA network and critical areas for the distribution of the species primarily in Greece and then Turkey, while 20% of the critical areas for the distribution of the species overlaps with Fisheries Restricted Areas of the region. This highlights the need for creating MPAs focusing on shark conservation within the Mediterranean that are currently completely absent. In addition, we provide policy recommendations that can secure better protection of angel sharks through the enforcement of the current legislations and the engagement of all relevant stakeholders.

AB  - Freshwater fish and mussel diversity is declining at an alarming rate across North America. Human land uses and disturbances within watersheds have been implicated as the primary cause of declines. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of land use/land cover (LULC) variables in species distribution modeling and conservation planning using a straightforward multiscale approach for prioritizing freshwater fish and mussel conservation areas in the upper Green River catchment (Ohio River basin, USA). We developed distribution and species richness models for 10 uncommon fishes and 14 rare mussels using multiscale landscape data and boosted regression tree (BRT) analyses based on LULC composition and pattern, geology composition, and soil composition data. We then used probability of occurrence, endemicity, prevalence, trend and range of individual species to estimate the conservation value of each stream reach. Conservation areas were defined for three spatial scales nested within the catchment management zone (focal areas, riparian management buffer and subcatchment management zone) using a simple optimization technique. Priority conservation areas were located primarily in the eastern (upper Green River) and southern (upper Barren River) portions of the catchment. We found that focal species richness is explained most by soil composition in the subcatchment. However, nested within the subcatchment scale focal species richness responded positively to percent forest and negatively to patch density of developed/exposed land in the reach buffer. For both the reach and riparian buffers, retaining forested tracts of land and limiting the level of development and fragmentation would benefit the focal species.

AB  - Protected areas are crucial for Amazonian nature conservation. Many Amazonian reserves have been selected systematically to achieve biodiversity representativeness. We review the role natural-scientific understanding has played in reserve selection, and evaluate the theoretical potential of the existing reserves to cover a complete sample of the species diversity of the Amazonian rainforest biome. In total, 108 reserves ( 604,832 km(2)) are treated as strictly protected and Amazonian; 87 of these can be seen as systematically selected to sample species diversity ( 75.3% of total area). Because direct knowledge on all species distributions is unavailable, surrogates have been used to select reserves: direct information on some species distributions ( 15 reserves, 14.8% of total area); species distribution patterns predicted on the basis of conceptual models, mainly the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis, ( 5/ 10.3%); environmental units ( 46/ 27.3%); or a combination of distribution patterns and environmental units ( 21/ 22.9%). None of these surrogates are reliable: direct information on species distributions is inadequate; the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis is highly controversial; and environmental classiWcations do not capture all relevant ecological variation, and their relevance for species distribution patterns is undocumented. Hence, Amazonian reserves cannot be safely assumed to capture all Amazonian species. To improve the situation, transparency and an active dialogue with the scientific community should be integral to conservation planning. We suggest that the best currently available approach for sampling Amazonian species diversity in reserve selection is to simultaneously inventory indicator plant species and climatic and geological conditions, and to combine Weld studies with remote sensing.

AB  - Protected area (PA) networks have in the past been constructed to include all major habitats, but have often been developed through consideration of only a few indicator taxa or across restricted areas, and rarely account for global climate change. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) aims to improve the efficiency of biodiversity conservation, particularly when addressing internationally agreed protection targets. We apply SCP in Great Britain (GB) using the widest taxonomic coverage to date (4,447 species), compare spatial prioritisation results across 18 taxa and use projected future (2080) distributions to assess the potential impact of climate change on PA network effectiveness. Priority conservation areas were similar among multiple taxa, despite considerable differences in spatial species richness patterns; thus systematic prioritisations based on indicator taxa for which data are widely available are still useful for conservation planning. We found that increasing the number of protected hectads by 2% (to reach the 2020 17% Aichi target) could have a disproportionate positive effect on species protected, with an increase of up to 17% for some taxa. The PA network in GB currently under-represents priority species but, if the potential future distributions under climate change are realised, the proportion of species distributions protected by the current PA network may increase, because many PAs are in northern and higher altitude areas. Optimal locations for new PAs are particularly concentrated in southern and upland areas of GB. This application of SCP shows how a small addition to an existing PA network could have disproportionate benefits for species conservation.

AB  - 1. Applications of graph-theoretic connectivity are increasing at an exponential rate in ecology and conservation. Here, limitations of these measures are summarized.
   2. Graph-theoretic connectivity measures are fundamentally limited as they require specification of a habitat quality threshold to allow definition of habitat patches (nodes). Frequently, a second threshold (critical dispersal distance) is applied in the identification of graph edges.
   3. Graph-theoretic measures are poorly applicable to large-scale, high-resolution, grid-based data that describe distributions of species in habitats of varying quality.
   4. Graph-theoretic connectivity primarily concerns the emigration-immigration component of spatial population-dynamics. Therefore, it cannot alone answer questions about the regional population size, resilience or persistence of a focal species.
   5. Synthesis and applications: Conservation managers in particular should appreciate these limitations before applying graph-theoretic analysis to spatial conservation planning.

AB  - Knowing the potential distribution of species helps to focus conservation efforts more effectively, mainly when dealing with endangered species. The aim of this study was to generate potential distribution models for four species of small wild felids in Mexico (Leopardus pardalis, Leopardus wiedii, Lynx rufus and Puma yagouaroundi). The models were generated based on felids presence records, and topographic, anthropic and vegetation drivers. We used 473 records (171 for L. pardalis, 140 for L. wiedii, 86 for L. rufus and 76 for P. yagouaroundi) to build eleven models per species to then select the three with the best performance and included them in ensemble models. These were based on the formula of the weighted average, which considers the performance of the algorithms evaluated with a subsample of testing records, from which the area under the curve is calculated. In this way, in the ensemble model the consistent zones between algorithms are included, but the one with the best performance predominates. The species with the largest potential distribution area was L. pardalis with 34.3% of the national territory, while L. rufus had the smallest area (14.3%). In the four species a unique set of variables was identified that influence the probability of presence, however the altitude, the arid vegetation and the population density were important variables for three of the four species. We verified our models with recently published presence records. The results of this study reflect a robust analysis of the current and potential distribution of four species of wild felids in Mexico. In addition to being the first step to develop effective conservation strategies at national and local levels. (C) 2019 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The objective of this work was to determine the potential distribution of 23 pioneer species in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, as well as to identify the environmental variables that influence their distributions. The Maxent algorithm was chosen to associate the occurrence of species with the following bioclimatic variables: diurnal temperature variation, isothermality, temperature seasonality, driest month precipitation, precipitation seasonality (coefficient of variation), and actual evapotranspiration. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), flora conservation status, and the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation types were also evaluated, besides erodibility (susceptibility of soil to erosion), groundwater availability, soil texture, organic matter content, mineral occurrence (existing mineral species by lithological unit), pedological simplified map, slope and altitude. The species Anadenanthera colubrina was the most suitable for the Caatinga biome, followed by Casearia sylvestris and Plathymenia reticulate, indicated for the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado biomes, respectively. The use of Maxent is recommended as a tool to guide conservation plans that require the indication of species, aiming to recover degraded or deforested vegetation areas.

AB  - The potential threats and habitat preferences of noxious plants in tropical countries are poorly known. Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a robust tool that can be used in conservation planning for early detection of invasion risks. However, the use of SDM for the strategic management of increasing risks of such plant invasions in Sri Lanka has not been undertaken due to several underlying reasons including the long-lasting data gap, technical, technological, and financial issues. In addition, the literature relevant to SDM applications in the country is substantially poor, scattered, and unpublished. Therefore, in this article, we explore SDM applications relevant to invasive plants in Sri Lanka with implications similar to other countries in the tropics. We examine the challenges and potentials for utilization of SDM technology in conservation planning in Sri Lanka and discuss data gap as a major obstacle. We also identify the potential SDM interventions relevant to invasive plants control and management in Sri Lanka and recommend conservation planners to prioritize them and apply for the strategic management of invasive plants in Sri Lanka. Finally, we suggest some recommendations to make an enabling environment in relevant institutions for the utilization of SDM technology in ecosystem management planning in Sri Lanka.

AB  - The widespread use of spatial planning tools in conjunction with increases in the availability of geographic information systems and associated data has led to the rapid growth in the exploration and application of species distribution models. Conservation professionals can choose from a considerable number of modelling techniques, but there has been relatively little evaluation of predictive performance, data requirements, or type of inference of these models. Empirical data for woodland caribou Rangifier tarandus caribou was used to examine four species distribution models, namely a qualitative habitat suitability index and quantitative resource selection function, Mahalanobis distance and ecological niche models. Models for three sets of independent variables were developed and then a temporally independent set of caribou locations evaluated predictive performance. The similarity of species distribution maps among the four modelling approaches was also quantified. All of the quantitative species distribution models were good predictors of the validation data set, but the spatial distribution of mapped habitats differed considerably among models. These results suggest that choice of model and variable set could influence the identification of areas for conservation emphasis. Model choice may be limited by the type of species locations or desired inference. Conservation professionals should choose a model and variable set based on the question, the ecology of the species and the availability of requisite data.

AB  - Aim Angolan Miombo woodlands, rich in timber species of the Leguminosae family, go through one of the highest rates of deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa. This study presents, on the basis of updated information of the distribution of Leguminosae timber species native to Angola, an integrated index framing the main threats for trees, which aims to support new conservation measures. Location Sub-Saharan Africa, Republic of Angola. Methods The current distribution areas of six Leguminosae timber species (i.e., Afzelia quanzensis, Brachystegia spiciformis, Guibourtia coleosperma, Isoberlinia angolensis, Julbernardia paniculata, and Pterocarpus angolensis) were predicted through ensemble modeling techniques. The level of threat to each species was analyzed, comparing the species potential distribution with a threat index map and with the protected areas. The threat index of anthropogenic and climatic factors encompasses the effects of population density, agriculture, proximity to roads, loss of tree cover, overexploitation, trends in wildfires, and predicted changes in temperature and precipitation. Results Our results revealed that about 0.5% of Angola's area is classified as of "Very high" threat, 23.9% as "High" threat, and 66.5% as "Moderate" threat. Three of the studied species require special conservation efforts, namely B. spiciformis and I. angolensis, which have a large fraction of predicted distribution in areas of high threat, and G. coleosperma since it has a restricted distribution area and is one of the most valuable species in international markets. The priority areas for the conservation of Leguminosae timber species were found in Benguela and Huila. Main conclusions This study provides updated data that should be applied to inform policymakers, contributing to national conservation planning and protection of native flora in Angola. Moreover, it presents a methodological approach for the predictions of species distribution and for the creation of a threat index map that can be applied in other poorly surveyed tropical regions.

AB  - Knowing the distribution of species and the factors which determine it is a basic requirement for conservation efforts and developing management plans. Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a speedy and cost-effective tool for predicting species distributions, particularly for species in remote and inaccessible areas. This technique can be applied for example for poorly known small carnivore species in Southeast Asia, a biodiversity hot spot for mammals. SDM is used to gain ecological insights about the environmental factors that determine species distribution, and helps to identify the areas where a species can occur and where conflicts may arise. However, recent advances in statistical theory and computer processing have made SDM a somewhat complex, diverse, and confusing area of research. This review presents an overview over the different techniques of species distribution modelling, and databases needed to answer applied questions in carnivore conservation, particularly in the tropics. We guide the ecologist through different methods which have become established approaches in the scientific literature and through freely available resources on abiotic data (environmental layers) for conducting such studies. We summarise the steps involved in predictive species distribution modelling, where the (carnivore) occurrence data come from different resources (such as museum records, voluntary surveys, systematic surveys, etc.). Finally, we explore the applications of such predictions in carnivore conservation.

AB  - The Sierra Madre Oriental region in the mexican state of San Luis Potosi is a relevant place for bird conservation at a country level. Therefore the main goal of this study was to analyze the geographic patterns of distribution and the conservation current state of the birds, to support the needs to expand the conservation areas in the future. Data was collected from various databases of zoological museums and collections, and field sampling methods conducted from January 2009 to May 2011. Potential distributions were modeled for 284 species using GARP software and then a map was developed to determine areas with favorable environmental characteristics for the distribution of species richness. Finally, the importance of conservation areas for the potential distribution of birds in the region was evaluated. A total of 359 species were recorded of which 71.4% are permanent residents, 19% are winter migrants and 4% are summer residents. From this total, 41 species were endemic, 47 were species at risk and 149 were neotropical migrants. The largest species richness correspond to oak forests, cloud forests, and tropical moist forests located at altitudes from 100m to 1500m. Their potential distribution was concentrated towards the center and Southeast of the study area. Only 10% of areas with a high potential conservation was included in areas of priority for bird conservation (AICA) and just 3% of all potential areas were under some governmental category of protection. However, no conservation area has a management plan currently applied and monitored. The information generated is important for the development of management proposals for birds conservation in the region.

AB  - We used ecological niche modeling and place prioritization procedures to identify areas for conservation and restoration for the river otter, Lontra longicaudis annectens Major 1897, in central Mexico. This species is highly sensible to fluvial ecosystem degradation, and large areas of the Apatlaco-Tembembe basin fluvial ecosystems have been highly transformed. We selected ecological indicators (EI) from literature and own field work to determine variables best describing the fluvial ecosystem degradation, relating them to the species' presence or absence. Field data of El, species records, and digital thematic information of hydrology, geomorphology and climate were used in ResNet Place Prioritization algorithm for the selection of potential conservation and restoration areas. We generated a spatial model considering a hierarchy of key areas based on river otter's ecological niche requirements and habitat ad hoc conditions for the species permanence. This allowed identifying areas to be included in landscape management plans for conservation and restoration. The sequential integration of species' potential distribution and place prioritization modeling allows merging biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration strategies at different ecological scales, helping adaptive management in land planning to be more flexible and feasible.

AB  - Maps of potential biodiversity are prominent tools for regional conservation planning because they allow to quantify the diversity of species that potentially inhabit different habitats. These maps are constructed from modeling species ecological niches based on the association between the geographical localities where species were detected and the environmental variables at those localities. Previous researches addressed the development of MPB for administrative regions using regional species distributions data to modeling ecological niches, which may lead to flawed predictions on potential biodiversity. Our aim is to assess the consequences of failing to include all available records on full species distribution to develop MPB. As a study case, we produced two MPBs for an administrative region of Argentina using RSD and FSD data sets of 14 species of insects and performed Environmental Niche Factor Analysis to model their ecological niches. Our results evidenced that both MPB were not spatially congruent in their predictions on potential biodiversity, because the ecological niches represented by RSD and FSD data were different in their position and volume. We found that the MPB based on RSD data may underpredict the potential biodiversity of distinct habitats at the landscape level, and that the use of this map may underestimate areas with different conservation potential within an administrative region. These results suggest that the choice of the extent of geographic records used to construct the MPB strongly conditions the quality and credibility of these maps.

AB  - Prioritizing and making efficient conservation plans for threatened populations requires information at both evolutionary and ecological timescales. Nevertheless, few studies integrate multidisciplinary approaches, mainly because of the difficulty for conservationists to assess simultaneously the evolutionary and ecological status of populations. Here, we sought to demonstrate how combining genetic and demographic analyses allows prioritizing and initiating conservation plans. To do so, we combined snapshot microsatellite data and a 30-year-long demographic survey on a threatened freshwater fish species (Parachondrostoma toxostoma) at the river basin scale. Our results revealed low levels of genetic diversity and weak effective population sizes (<63 individuals) in all populations. We further detected severe bottlenecks dating back to the last centuries (200-800 years ago), which may explain the differentiation of certain populations. The demographic survey revealed a general decrease in the spatial distribution and abundance of P. toxostoma over the last three decades. We conclude that demo-genetic approaches are essential for (1) identifying populations for which both evolutionary and ecological extinction risks are high; and (2) proposing conservation plans targeted toward these at risk populations, and accounting for the evolutionary history of populations. We suggest that demo-genetic approaches should be the norm in conservation practices.

AB  - Context With accelerating global declines in biodiversity, establishment and expansion of conservation areas (CAs) have increasingly been advocated in recent decades. Gap analysis has been useful to evaluate the sufficiency and performance of CAs. Objectives Researchers often identify putative gaps in the protection of biodiversity in CA networks, drawing on evidence from species occurrence patterns (i.e., representation), yet the effect on the gap analyses of the spatial configuration of CAs is poorly understood. Methods Focusing on two large, charismatic carnivores of western Asia, Persian leopard and Asiatic cheetah, we used species distribution models (SDMs) to map potentially suitable habitats throughout the region. We calculated species representation for four categories of CAs within the conservation network in Iran and used a new application of graph theory to include their spatial configuration into our gap analysis. We then regressed species representation against spatial configuration to provide more insights into the performance of different categories of CAs. Results Results showed that the existing CA network conserves only 32% of the suitable habitats for the two species. Leveraging spatial configuration of the conservation areas into the gap analysis, however, revealed that the recently-established less strictly CAs disproportionately provide a higher contribution to the collective effectiveness of the entire conservation network. Conclusions We introduce network bias as a new concept in reserve design and argue that incorporating spatial configuration into CA gap analysis improves the ability to evaluate the effectiveness of reserve network designs, and is an important decision support tool for integrated conservation planning.

AB  - Juniperus phoenicea is a medicinal conifer tree species distributed mainly in the Mediterranean region, and it is IUCN Red Listed species, locally threatened due to arid conditions and seed over-collection for medicinal purposes, particularly in the East-Mediterranean region. Several studies have addressed the potential distribution of J. phoenicea using bioclimatic and topographic variables at a local or global scale, but little is known about the role of soil and human influences as potential drivers. Therefore, our objectives were to determine the most influential predictor factors and their relative importance that might be limiting the regeneration of J. phoenicea, in addition, identifying the most suitable areas which could be assumed as priority conservation areas. We used ensemble models for species distribution modelling. Our findings revealed that aridity, temperature seasonality, and clay content are the most important factors limiting the potential distribution of J. phoenicea. Potentially suitable areas of the output maps, in which J. phoenicea populations degraded, could be assumed as decision-support tool reforestation planning. Other suitable areas, where there was no previous tree cover are a promising tool for afforestation and conservation planning. Finally, conservation actions are needed for natural habitats, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions, which are highly threatened by global warming.

AB  - Statistical modelling of biological survey data in relation to remotely mapped environmental variables is a powerful technique for making more effective use of sparse data in regional conservation planning. Application of such modelling to planning in the northeast New South Wales ( NSW) region of Australia represents one of the most extensive and longest running case studies of this approach anywhere in the world. Since the early 1980s, statistical modelling has been used to extrapolate distributions of over 2300 species of plants and animals, and a wide variety of higher-level communities and assemblages. These modelled distributions have played a pivotal role in a series of major land-use planning processes, culminating in extensive additions to the region's protected area system. This paper provides an overview of the analytical methodology used to model distributions of individual species in northeast NSW, including approaches to: ( 1) developing a basic integrated statistical and geographical information system (GIS) framework to facilitate automated fitting and extrapolation of species models; ( 2) extending this basic approach to incorporate consideration of spatial autocorrelation, land-cover mapping and expert knowledge; and ( 3) evaluating the performance of species modelling, both in terms of predictive accuracy and in terms of the effectiveness with which such models function as general surrogates for biodiversity.

AB  - Climate change is a driving force of changes to biodiversity worldwide and presents considerable management challenges for the resource-constrained environmental management sector. Effective management of biodiversity requires information about what species are present, how species respond to environmental conditions and which species are likely to be able to persist in the presence of ongoing change. Species distribution models are commonly used to predict future suitable habitat for particular species and areas of interest but a consistent nationwide approach is needed to understand how climate change will affect Australia's biodiversity. Here we describe a modelling approach that uses a consistent workflow and expert vetting to create current and future species distributions for 1872 terrestrial and freshwater vertebrate species. We used two emission scenarios, 18 General Circulation Models and seven time points into the future to explore how individual species distributions and taxa richness in Australia are predicted to change due to climate change. The maps are publicly available online and stakeholders can download them for post hoc analyses to assist in both regional and national management and protection of biodiversity assets and conservation planning for the future.

AB  - Models relating species distribution records to environmental variables are increasingly applied to biodiversity conservation. Such techniques could be valuable to predict the distribution, abundance or habitat requirements of species that are rare or otherwise difficult to survey. However, despite widely-documented positive intraspecific relationships between occupancy and abundance, few studies have demonstrated convincing associations between models of habitat suitability based on species occurrence, and observed measures of habitat quality such as abundance. Here we compared models based on field-derived abundance and distribution (presence-absence) data for a rare mountain butterfly in 2006-2008. Both model types selected consistent effects of environmental variables, which corresponded to known ecological associations of the species, suggesting that abundance and distribution may be a function of similar factors. However, the models based on occurrence data identified stronger effects of a smaller number of environmental variables, indicating less uncertainty in the factors controlling distribution. Furthermore, cross-validation of the models using observed abundance data from different years, or averaged across years, suggested a marginally stronger ability of models based on occurrence data to predict observed abundance. The results suggest that, for some species, distribution models could be efficient tools for estimating habitat quality in conservation planning or management, when information on abundance or habitat requirements is costly or impractical to obtain.

AB  - Although reptiles are the most diverse group of terrestrial vertebrates, crucial data on their extinction risks are lacking. The reptile species assessed by IUCN are only a fraction of those at risk of extinction. Thus, conservation planning and management decisions are hindered by the lack of ecological information on the species' distribution patterns and their habitat requirements. Pleske's racerunner (Eremias pleskei) is a rare and critically endangered species known to occur exclusively in the eastern Anatolian Montane Steppe ecoregion. In this study, we used ten species distribution model algorithms and 62 climate change scenarios (from 19 global climate models under four representative concentration pathways) to predict future habitat suitability for Pleske's racerunner in the Anatolian Montane Steppe ecoregion. Our results indicate that this species may in future migrate from its current distribution range towards the central and western areas of the Anatolian Montane Steppe ecoregion. Our results also show that the variation in the temperature-related variables in suitable habitats will increase in future as compared with the current conditions. It seems that due to climate change, in future, deserts will be appropriate for this species. The same mechanisms, however, will make some of its current habitats unsuitable. Dealing with uncertainties in climate change and species distribution modeling is a major challenge when planning strategies for species' conservation. We recommend conservation measures to be implemented to make sure that E. pleskei's current habitats remain suitable for it also in future.

AB  - Identification of biodiversity hot spots is necessary for developing conservation strategies. The south-eastern U.S.A. harbours high aquatic biodiversity; however, this diversity is threatened as a result of anthropogenic activities. We report patterns of fish and mussel biodiversity, locate hotspots of diversity and endemism, and identify gaps in protection of these hotspots. Maxent was used to generate species distribution models for native fish and mussel species in river basins throughout east Texas. Stacked species distribution models were used to assess spatial patterns of biodiversity and examine the concordance between fish and mussel hotspots. A Geographic Approach to Planning analysis was used to identify areas of high conservation concern. Predicted geographical variation in species richness of mussels corresponds to patterns shown in fish; however, there was discordance among endemicity hotspots between the two taxa. Because overall endemicity was low in both groups, species richness is likely to be the more informative measure of biodiversity at these regional scales. While hotspots represent a small percentage of the study area, almost all richness and endemicity hotspots (>95%) in east Texas occur outside of protected areas. The results of this study suggest that protected areas designated based on terrestrial habitat may fail to protect aquatic biodiversity. Studies such as this provide a baseline for development of conservation and management strategies for protection of regional freshwater biodiversity, while also suggesting that designating conservation lands should include consideration of both terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity.

AB  - Anthropogenic development has great potential to affect fragile desert environments. Large-scale development of renewable energy infrastructure is planned for many desert ecosystems. Development plans should account for anthropogenic effects to distributions and abundance of rare or sensitive wildlife; however, baseline data on abundance and distribution of such wildlife are often lacking. We surveyed for predatory birds in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts of southern California, USA, in an area designated for protection under the "Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan", to determine how these birds are distributed across the landscape and how this distribution is affected by existing development. We developed species-specific models of resight probability to adjust estimates of abundance and density of each individual common species. Second, we developed combined-species models of resight probability for common and rare species so that we could make use of sparse data on the latter. We determined that many common species, such as red-tailed hawks, loggerhead shrikes, and especially common ravens, are associated with human development and likely subsidized by human activity. Species-specific and combined-species models of resight probability performed similarly, although the former model type provided higher quality information. Comparing abundance estimates with past surveys in the Mojave Desert suggests numbers of predatory birds associated with human development have increased while other sensitive species not associated with development have decreased. This approach gave us information beyond what we would have collected by focusing either on common or rare species, thus it provides a low-cost framework for others conducting surveys in similar desert environments outside of California.

AB  - Context. Comprehensive evaluation of biodiversity conservation programs is essential for informing their development as well as the design of future programs. Such evaluations should not be limited to whether targets have been met, but should also assess the cost and efficiency of meeting targets, and any factors contributing to success or failure.
   Aims. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of individual-species conservation programs, and the biological and operational factors affecting these. Weused the species action plans (SAPs) within the UK Biodiversity Action Plan as our case study.
   Methods. We used cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis and threat-reduction assessment to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of individual SAPs. Then we used statistical models to investigate the relative importance of biological and operational factors affecting cost, effectiveness and efficiency.
   Key results. Conservation plan success was affected by both biological and operational factors. Invertebrate plans tended to be less effective, whereas vertebrate plans were less efficient. Plans for widely distributed species with longer generation times tended to be less efficient. Of the three different evaluation approaches, cost-effectiveness analysis offered the best combination of ease of data collection and accuracy of data content.
   Conclusions. The most successful SAPs concerned species with short generation times and narrow distributions. Operationally, the most successful SAPs were concise and focussed and showed clear lines of responsibility for implementation.
   Implications. Techniques such as cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis and threat reduction assessment should be used to inform decisions on maximising the rate of return on conservation investments, although broader ecological implications and socio-cultural benefits should also be considered. The success of conservation plans is influenced by both biological and operational factors. Because biological factors cannot be controlled or altered, where species exhibit characteristics that are likely to make their conservation less effective or efficient, it is critical that operational factors are optimised. High-quality data are necessary to underpin prioritisation decisions, and monitoring to deliver reliable data on both the benefits and costs of conservation should form a core component of conservation programs.

AB  - To evaluate the status of biodiversity and to determine how current conservation efforts can be improved, biodiversity monitoring is crucial. An important aspect of data quality lies in its spatial resolution. It is unclear how finer scale land cover and land value information might further benefit biodiversity conservation. This paper aimed to assess the impacts of scale by modelling the conservation of endangered European wetland species and their corresponding habitats. Fine-scale datasets were derived by integrating existing geographical, biophysical and economic data. A habitat allocation model, based on principles from systematic conservation planning and economic theory, was developed to estimate area requirements and opportunity costs of habitat protection in Europe. Coarse-scale and fine-scale simulations were compared by inputting both resolutions into the model. Habitat locations were restricted either only by historical species occurrence data at UTM 50 resolution or additionally by explicit wetland data at 1-km(2) resolution. Coarse country-average land rents were contrasted with spatially detailed land rent estimates at a 5' resolution. Costs of habitat protection and area requirements for reserves may be severely underestimated when conservation planning relies only on coarse-scale data, which may result in notable shortcomings in conservation target achievement. Improvements in conservation benefits far outweigh the additional costs of acquiring fine-scale data.

AB  - Aim Indigenous communities involved in conservation planning require spatial datasets depicting the distribution of culturally important species. However, accessing datasets on the location of these species can be challenging, particularly when the current distribution no longer reflects areas with the full range of suitable growing conditions because of past logging. We test whether using occurrence data from community-based field surveys and archaeological records in species distribution models can help predict the distribution of monumental western redcedar trees (Thuja plicata)-large, high-quality trees suitable for cultural purposes such as carving dug-out canoes, totem poles and traditional houses. This species is critically important to indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest of North America, but trees suitable for traditional carving and building are diminishing in abundance due to logging. Location Our analysis covers the spatial extent of the traditional territory of the Heiltsuk First Nation, which encompasses a portion of the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, Canada. Methods We built and compared species distribution models using the machine learning program, Maxent, based on occurrence data from field surveys and archaeological records of culturally modified trees. Results Our findings highlight similarities and differences between the predictions from these species distribution models. When validating these models against occurrences from an independent dataset, the archaeological record model performs better than the field survey model. These findings may arise because the independent dataset was collected on an unlogged island-an environment that aligns more closely with the historic forest conditions revealed by the archaeological records than the current distribution revealed by the field surveys. Main conclusions We demonstrate and discuss the utility of using archaeological data in species distribution modelling and conservation planning when the target species is associated with shifting environmental baselines, data limitations and an important cultural resource.

AB  - Hangul (Cervus hanglu hanglu), the only red deer subspecies surviving in the Indian subcontinent, is of top conservation priority with global importance. Unfortunately, it has lost much of its historical distribution range, and it is now confined to Dachigam landscape within the Kashmir valley of India. The Government of India initiated a recovery plan in 2008 to augment their numbers through ex-situ conservation programs. However, it was necessary to identify potential hangul habitats in Kashmir valley for adopting landscape-level conservation planning for the species. Based on geometric aspects of reserve design, we modeled hangul habitat using an ensemble approach to identify hangul habitats. The present model indicates that the conifer and broadleaf mixed forests were the most suitable habitats. Only 9% of the total study landscape was found suitable for the species. We identified corridors among the suitable habitat blocks, which may be vital for the species' long-term genetic viability. We suggest reorganizing the existing management of Dachigam National Park (NP) following the landscape level and habitat block-level management planning based on the core principles of geometric reserve design. We recommend that the identified patch (PID-6) in the southern region of the landscape to be converted into a Conservation Reserve or merged with the Overa-Aru Wildlife Sanctuary. This habitat patch PID-6 may be a stepping stone habitat and vital for maintaining the species landscape connectivity and metapopulation dynamics.

AB  - Many countries have conservation plans for threatened species, but such plans have generally been developed without taking into account the potential impacts of climate change. Here, we apply a decision framework, specifically developed to identify and prioritise climate change adaptation actions and demonstrate its use for 30 species threatened in the UK. Our aim is to assess whether government conservation recommendations remain appropriate under a changing climate. The species, associated with three different habitats (lowland heath, broadleaved woodland and calcareous grassland), were selected from a range of taxonomic groups (primarily moths and vascular plants, but also including bees, bryophytes, carabid beetles and spiders). We compare the actions identified for these threatened species by the decision framework with those included in existing conservation plans, as developed by the UK Government's statutory adviser on nature conservation. We find that many existing conservation recommendations are also identified by the decision framework. However, there are large differences in the spatial prioritisation of actions when explicitly considering projected climate change impacts. This includes recommendations for actions to be carried out in areas where species do not currently occur, in order to allow them to track movement of suitable conditions for their survival. Uncertainties in climate change projections are not a reason to ignore them. Our results suggest that existing conservation plans, which do not take into account potential changes in suitable climatic conditions for species, may fail to maximise species persistence. Comparisons across species also suggest a more habitat-focused approach could be adopted to enable climate change adaptation for multiple species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Selection of a modeling approach is an important step in the conservation planning process, but little guidance is available. We compared two statistical and three theoretical habitat modeling approaches representing those currently being used for avian conservation planning at landscape and regional scales: hierarchical spatial count (HSC), classification and regression tree (CRT), habitat suitability index (HSI), forest structure database (FS), and habitat association database (HA). We focused our comparison on models for five priority forest-breeding species in the Central Hardwoods Bird Conservation Region: Acadian Flycatcher, Cerulean Warbler, Prairie Warbler, Red-headed Woodpecker, and Worm-eating Warbler. Lacking complete knowledge on the distribution and abundance of each species with which we could illuminate differences between approaches and provide strong grounds for recommending one approach over another, we used two approaches to compare models: rank correlations among model outputs and comparison of spatial correspondence. In general, rank correlations were significantly positive among models for each species, indicating general agreement among the models. Worm-eating Warblers had the highest pairwise correlations, all of which were significant (P < 0.05). Red-headed Woodpeckers had the lowest agreement among models, suggesting greater uncertainty in the relative conservation value of areas within the region. We assessed model uncertainty by mapping the spatial congruence in priorities (i.e., top ranks) resulting from each model for each species and calculating the coefficient of variation across model ranks for each location. This allowed identification of areas more likely to be good targets of conservation effort for a species, those areas that were least likely, and those in between where uncertainty is higher and thus conservation action incorporates more risk. Based on our results, models developed independently for the same purpose (conservation planning for a particular species in a particular geography) yield different answers and thus different conservation strategies. We assert that using only one habitat model (even if validated) as the foundation of a conservation plan is risky. Using multiple models (i.e., ensemble prediction) can reduce uncertainty and increase efficacy of conservation action when models corroborate one another and increase understanding of the system when they do not.

AB  - If species distribution models (SDMs) can rank habitat suitability at a local scale, they may be a valuable conservation planning tool for rare, patchily distributed species. This study assessed the ability of Maxent, an SDM reported to be appropriate for modeling rare species, to rank habitat suitability at a local scale for four edaphic endemic rare plants of gabbroic soils in El Dorado County, California, and examined the effects of grain size, spatial extent, and fine-grain environmental predictors on local-scale model accuracy. Models were developed using species occurrence data mapped on public lands and were evaluated using an independent data set of presence and absence locations on surrounding lands, mimicking a typical conservation-planning scenario that prioritizes potential habitat on unsurveyed lands surrounding known occurrences. Maxent produced models that were successful at discriminating between suitable and unsuitable habitat at the local scale for all four species, and predicted habitat suitability values were proportional to likelihood of occurrence or population abundance for three of four species. Unfortunately, models with the best discrimination (i.e., AUC) were not always the most useful for ranking habitat suitability. The use of independent test data showed metrics that were valuable for evaluating which variables and model choices (e.g., grain, extent) to use in guiding habitat prioritization for conservation of these species. A goodness-of-fit test was used to determine whether habitat suitability values ranked habitat suitability on a continuous scale. If they did not, a minimum acceptable error predicted area criterion was used to determine the threshold for classifying habitat as suitable or unsuitable. I found a trade-off between model extent and the use of fine-grain environmental variables: goodness of fit was improved at larger extents, and fine-grain environmental variables improved local-scale accuracy, but fine-grain variables were not available at large extents. No single model met all habitat prioritization criteria, and the best models were overlaid to identify consensus areas of high suitability. Although the four species modeled here co-occur and are treated together for conservation planning, model accuracy and predicted suitable areas varied among species.

AB  - Viability analysis of well-selected focal species can complement ecosystem-level conservation planning by revealing thresholds in habitat area and landscape connectivity. Mammalian carnivores are good candidates for focal species because their distributional patterns often strongly reflect regional-scale population processes. We incorporated focal species analysis of four carnivore species, fisher (Martes pennanti), lynx (Lynx canadensis), wolverine (Gulo gulo), and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), into a regional conservation plan for the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada. We developed empirical habitat models for fisher, lynx, and wolverine based on a geographically extensive data set of trapping and sighting records. Predictor variables derived directly from satellite imagery were significantly correlated with carnivore distribution and allowed us to predict distribution in areas lacking detailed vegetation data. Although we lacked similar distributional data for grizzly bear, we predicted bear habitat by adapting and extrapolating previously published, regional-scale habitat models. Predicted habitat for grizzly bear has high overlap with that for wolverine, intermediate overlap with fisher, and low overlap with lynx. High-quality habitats for fisher and lynx, unlike those for wolverine and grizzly bear, are not strongly associated with low levels of human population and roads. Nevertheless, they are naturally fragmented by topography and vegetation gradients and are poorly represented in existing protected areas. Areas with high biological productivity and low human impact are valuable habitat for all four species but are limited in extent. Predicted habitat values for lynx and wolverine are significantly correlated with trapping data from an area outside the extent of the original data set. This supports the use of empirical distribution models as the initial stage in a regional-scale monitoring program. Our results suggest that a comprehensive conservation strategy for carnivores in the region must consider the needs of several species, rather than a single, presumed umbrella species. Coordinated planning across multiple ownerships is necessary to prevent further fragmentation of carnivore habitat, especially in the U.S.-Canada border region.

AB  - Conservation planning decisions are constrained by three important factors: budgets are limited, important areas for biodiversity compete for space with other uses, and climate- and land-use changes are affecting the distribution of life thus compounding existing threats to biodiversity. Decisions about locating and allocating resources for conservation in such complex and dynamic world are far from trivial, with apparently optimal decisions in the present being potential suboptimal in the future. We propose a methodological framework for the dynamic spatial prioritization of conservation areas that optimizes long-term conservation goals under climate change. This approach involves a sequential scheduling of conservation areas designation, followed by the release of some areas when they stop contributing to the specified long-term conservation goals. The usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a case study involving ten species in the Iberian Peninsula under severe scenarios of climate change, but the framework could be applied more broadly. Species persistence under climate change is enhanced by the dynamic spatial prioritization strategy that assumes area release. With such strategy, the long-term persistence of species is consistently higher than expected with no release of redundant areas, particularly when the budgets to acquire and manage conservation areas are small. When budgets are small, long-term persistence of species might only be achieved when the release of previously selected areas is considered alongside the selection of new areas. Synthesis and applications. Given that conservation budgets are typically small, conservation strategies involving the release of some underperforming areas might be required to achieve long-term persistence of species. This should be the case when climate change forces species to move out of current protected areas with other areas becoming important to meet conservation objectives. Implementing such dynamic prioritization approach would require a paradigm shift in conservation planning because conservation areas, once selected, are rarely released. Dynamic selection of areas also involves risks that should be considered in a case-by-case situation.

AB  - For management and conservation strategies in the long term is necessary to know the species distribution and main biophysical aspects that determine the structure and dynamics of the forest. The aim of this work was to determine the potential and current spatial distribution of Gonopterodendron sarmientoi, an emblematic and endangered tree species of the Dry Chaco. A further aim was to superimpose the distribution of G. sarmientoi, with the zonation in the current Territorial Planning of Native Forests (OTBN, its acronym in Spanish) to provide basic information for conservation and management of the species. For this, a Maxent model was developed to quantify the relationship between G. sarmientoi occurrence and key environmental variables (including water, topography, and climate as a variables). G. sarmientoi's habitat was mainly influenced by precipitation variables, and secondarily by temperature variables. Considering the OTBN defined by the local forest authority, of the current area of G. sarmientoi (2,477,009 ha), the majority (57.9%) corresponded to the yellow category (forest areas with medium conservation value) and only 10.6% to the red category (high conservation value). It is important to note that around 600,686 ha (24.3%) of native forest with G. sarmientoi is in the green category (low conservation value) subject to change in land use, and 178,107 ha was uncategorized forest (7.2%). For effective management and conservation strategies, the current habitat distribution map of G. sarmientoi provides decision makers an opportunity to review and adjust the native forests zoning at a provincial scale within the framework of the OTBN, mainly the green category (legal deforestation) with the occurrence of the endangered G. sarmientoi.

AB  - Background - Biodiversity loss is a problem that needs to be urgently addressed, particularly with the uncertainties of climate change. Current conservation policies principally focus on endangered species but they often give little consideration to the evolutionary processes, genetic diversity, or the rarity of non-endangered species. Endemic species occurring in rocky habitats that arc undergoing exceptional habitat loss appear to be one of the most important candidates for conservation. The aim is to establish in situ and ex situ conservation recommendations for the Mediterranean endemic species Arenaria balearica.
   Material and methods -Arenaria balearica is a species endemic to the Mediterranean with a disjunct distribution range throughout Majorca, Corsica, Sardinia, and other small Tyrrhenian islands. A combination of molecular techniques (AFLPs and plastid DNA) was employed to determine genetic diversity and rarity across populations and to calculate the Relevant Genetic Units for Conservation (RGUCs). Moreover, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) were developed to assess the potential current distribution and the expected situation under future climatic scenarios.
   Key results - To preserve the genetic diversity and rarity of the species, in situ conservation is proposed for six populations as RGUCs. Moreover, as the RGUCs can only account for a part of the phylogeographic signal, ex situ conservation is also suggested for some additional populations. According to the results, the habitat suitability in the 2050 scenario is limited and suitable areas for A. balearica could have disappeared by 2070. Therefore, the persistence of the species could be in danger in a short period of time and conservation planning becomes necessary.

AB  - Competition for maritime space generates conflict between human activities and ecosystem conservation; Marine (Spatial) Plans provide conflict resolutions and clarify trade-offs. Spatial plans require appropriate scales, reliable maps of sites important to marine organisms. We present maps of hotspots of Essential Fish Habitats (EFH) at a high spatial resolution for English and Welsh waters. These outputs can be integrated into an improved spatial plan for these waters. We modelled the potential distribution for different life stages of commercially and ecologically important species, as a high-resolution indicator of the distribution of essential fish habitats. Model outputs were combined with observed, low-resolution fish distributions to derive 'hotspot' spawning and nursery areas. The Celtic Sea and coastal areas of the North Sea are highlighted as important spawning and nursery grounds. High pressure from human activities is expected to impact EFHs in the English Channel and the central-east Celtic Sea. Our approach maintains the high resolution of the model-derived maps while filling in information gaps. As fish share essential habitat preferences, protected hotspot areas are expected to sustain a multitude of species. Overlaying human activities, such as fishing, on the hotspot maps allows managers to identify areas of conservation interest and apply appropriate measures. The method is directly applicable to other areas and can be extended to use multiple sources of data for model development. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Alterations of riparian areas of running waters resulted in fragmentation of the riverscape. The possible impact of climate change additionally stresses the importance for conservation planning for riparian habitats, especially for sessile plant species. The survival of species under changing habitat availability can be counteracted by ensuring functional connectivity of riparian plant species. This study applies a coupled modelling framework using species distribution models and dispersal simulations, which allow to analyze the potential future distribution of species in relation to their ecological niche, life history traits including dispersal abilities as well as barriers to dispersal such as dams. Modelled suitable habitats for six riparian plant species characteristic for the olive willow plant community (Salicion elaeagni) showed dramatic changes under the impact of two climate change scenarios. While habitat suitability remained low for species with a narrow ecological niche, it increased under climate change scenarios for species which are also found in secondary habitat outside riparian areas. Simulations of dispersal to the potential future habitat revealed nevertheless high numbers of decolonized cells after 80 years of dispersal for species with high future habitat suitability. This stresses the importance of a joint investigation of the habitat suitability under climate change scenarios, dispersal parameters as well as life history traits for conservation planning of riparian species. The simulated future distribution revealed that barriers along rivers have a significant negative effect on the spread of the studied plant species. Our results suggest that conservation management should focus on providing connected stepping stone habitats for riparian plant species along rivers, as current species occurrences are not persistent over time.

AB  - Conservation actors face the challenge of allocating limited resources despite uncertainty about future climate conditions. In many cases, the potential value and feasibility of proposed projects vary across climate scenarios. A key goal is to identify areas where conservation outcomes can balance both environmental and human needs.
   We developed a conservation prioritization framework that jointly considers the value and feasibility of candidate projects across future climate scenarios. We then applied this framework to the challenge of meeting environmental flow targets across the Red River basin of the south-central United States.
   To estimate the conservation feasibility of meeting environmental flow goals in a river reach in each climate scenario, we used a basin-wide hydrologic planning tool to quantify the reduction in societal water usage needed to meet environmental flow targets. To estimate the biodiversity value of each river reach in each climate scenario, we used climate-driven species distribution models and species' conservation status.
   We found that river reaches in the east-central portion of the basin may be good candidates for conservation investments, because they had high biodiversity value and high sociopolitical feasibility in all future climate scenarios. In contrast, sites in the arid western reaches of the basin had high biodiversity value, but low feasibility of achieving environmental flow goals.
   Our framework should have broad applicability given that the value and feasibility of conservation projects vary across climate scenarios in ecosystems around the world. It may serve as a coarse filter to identify sites for more detailed analyses and could be integrated with complementarity-based approaches to conservation planning to balance species' representation across projects.

AB  - In Uganda, lack of adequate data on species' distributions poses a problem in laying strategies for conservation planning. Some of the data that exist are old and are therefore of uncertain value, given the pace of environmental changes. To overcome these problems, a logical prediction model was built based on species-habitat relationships to help predict the occurrence of bird species in Uganda. This computer model makes use of field observations, from which species-habitat relationships are built; these are based upon biogeographical zones, an 80-category vegetation map, and human population densities. The model is then run to determine 'suitable habitats' for species of interest. The model has been tested for accuracy for the existing national parks, and high degrees of accuracy reaching around 90% have been obtained for those parks with many observations (unpublished data). In future, it is planned to include rainfall as an alternative to biogeographical zones. This paper examines the methods used in this research, gives a description of the model, the results that have been obtained; and assesses the usefulness of the model in conservation planning.

AB  - For conservation decision making, species' geographic distributions are mapped using various approaches. Some such efforts have downscaled versions of coarse-resolution extent-of-occurrence maps to fine resolutions for conservation planning. We examined the quality of the extent-of-occurrence maps as range summaries and the utility of refining those maps into fine-resolution distributional hypotheses. Extent-of-occurrence maps tend to be overly simple, omit many known and well-documented populations, and likely frequently include many areas not holding populations. Refinement steps involve typological assumptions about habitat preferences and elevational ranges of species, which can introduce substantial error in estimates of species' true areas of distribution. However, no model-evaluation steps are taken to assess the predictive ability of these models, so model inaccuracies are not noticed. Whereas range summaries derived by these methods may be useful in coarse-grained, global-extent studies, their continued use in on-the-ground conservation applications at fine spatial resolutions is not advisable in light of reliance on assumptions, lack of real spatial resolution, and lack of testing. In contrast, data-driven techniques that integrate primary data on biodiversity occurrence with remotely sensed data that summarize environmental dimensions (i.e., ecological niche modeling or species distribution modeling) offer data-driven solutions based on a minimum of assumptions that can be evaluated and validated quantitatively to offer a well-founded, widely accepted method for summarizing species' distributional patterns for conservation applications.

AB  - Climate change may shrink and/or shift plant species ranges thereby increasing their vulnerability and requiring targeted conservation to facilitate adaptation. We quantified the vulnerability to climate change of plant species based on exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and assessed the effects of including these components in complementarity-based spatial conservation prioritisation. We modelled the vulnerability of 584 native plant species under three climate change scenarios in an 11.9 million hectare fragmented agricultural region in southern Australia. We represented exposure as species' geographical range under each climate change scenario as quantified using species distribution models. We calculated sensitivity as a function of the impact of climate change on species' geographical ranges. Using a dispersal kernel, we quantified adaptive capacity as species' ability to migrate to new geographical ranges under each climate change scenario. Using Zonation, we assessed the impact of individual components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) on spatial conservation priorities and levels of species representation in priority areas under each climate change scenario. The full vulnerability framework proved an effective basis for identifying spatial conservation priorities under climate change. Including different dimensions of vulnerability had significant implications for spatial conservation priorities. Incorporating adaptive capacity increased the level of representation of most species. However, prioritising sensitive species reduced the representation of other species. We conclude that whilst taking an integrated approach to mitigating species vulnerability to climate change can ensure sensitive species are well-represented in a conservation network, this can come at the cost of reduced representation of other species. Conservation planning decisions aimed at reducing species vulnerability to climate change need to be made in full cognisance of the sensitivity of spatial conservation priorities to individual components of vulnerability, and the trade-offs associated with focussing on sensitive species.

AB  - Natural habitats of Southeastern Iran are threatened by both natural and anthropogenic pressures such as longterm drought, dust storms, and land use change. Surveys on habitat suitability of vulnerable species and integration of protected areas have raised alarm over potential species extinction and geographical isolation of populations. Reducing the threats of human activities on sensitive terrestrial and coastal ecosystems requires integrated planning and management of terrestrial and coastal protected areas, however many of these areas have been selected and managed independently. Selecting coastal protected areas network require a systematic conservation planning approach, to reduce the development impacts on sensitive habitats. Therefore, this study aimed to identify an optimized integrative network of terrestrial and coastal protected areas in southeast Iran. An attempt was made to maximize biodiversity conservation, reduce the isolation of populations, and increase the resilience of the region's natural habitats to new development plans by including coastal habitats meeting the requirements of key species. Firstly, suitable habitats for seven key species were simulated by Species Distribution Models (SDMs) performed via Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), Random Forest (RF), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models fitted with 20 ecological and anthropogenic variables. A habitat suitability map was produced by integrating the SDM-derived habitat suitability maps with the suitable extents identified for egg-laying green sea turtle and potential habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic birds. An attempt was then made for selecting new terrestrial and coastal protected areas using the simulated annealing algorithm under six scenarios. All SDMs exhibited promising performances in predicting the distribution of suitable habitats with AUC values of above 0.8 and the discrimination power of GBM and RF was higher than that of the other SDMs. In total, more than 34 percent of the study area, along the coastline, was categorized as sensitive or extremely sensitive habitat. An east-west habitat corridor presently unprotected playing an important role in connecting habitats needs to be safeguarded to maintain regional biodiversity. Moreover, our study revealed that the majority of suitable habitats with high potential for sensitive species are not currently protected by the existing protected area network.

AB  - Rapid anthropogenic climate change is a major threat to ocean biodiversity, increasing the challenge for marine conservation. Strategic conservation planning, and more recently marine spatial planning (MSP) are among the most promising management tools to operationalize and enforce marine conservation. As yet, climate change is seldom incorporated into these plans, potentially curtailing the effectiveness of designated conservation areas under novel environmental conditions. Reliable assessment of current and future climate change threats requires the ability to map climate-driven eco-evolutionary changes and the identification of vulnerable and resistant populations. Here we explore the heretofore largely unrecognized value of information gained from physiological, ecological and evolutionary studies to MSP under ongoing climate change. For example, we explore how climate threats do not necessarily follow latitudinal gradients, such that both risk hotspots and refugia occur in mosaic distributions along species ranges - patterns that may be undetectable without knowledge of biological vulnerabilities at regional and local scales. Because co-occurring species can exhibit markedly different vulnerabilities to the same environmental changes, making ecological predictions requires, when possible, measuring the fundamental niches of key species (e.g., with the use of thermotolerance experiments). Forecasting also requires development of tools to identify the likelihood of community-level thresholds or tipping points (e.g., with the use of near-real world mesocosms), and assessment of the potential of populations for adaptation (e.g., with common garden experiments). Such research will facilitate better predictive models for the fate of populations, species, ecosystems and their functions. Ultimately, unfolding the complexity of the processes underlying climate change impacts will facilitate quantifying and reducing uncertainty in spatial planning decision processes and will enable the development of practical tools to validate adaptive conservation strategies.

AB  - In an era of rapid climate and land transformation, it is increasingly important to understand how future changes impact natural systems. Scenario studies can offer the structure and perspective needed to understand the impacts of change and help inform management and conservation decisions. We implemented a scenario-based approach to assess how two high impact drivers of landscape change influence the distributions of managed wildlife species (n= 10) in the New England region of the northeastern United States. We used expert derived species distribution models (SDMs) and scenarios developed by the New England Landscape Futures Project (NELFP) to estimate how species distributions change under various trajectories (n= 5) of landscape change. The NELFP scenarios were built around two primary drivers - Socio-Economic Connectedness (SEC) and Natural Resource Planning and Innovation (NRPI) - and provide plausible alternatives for how the New England region may change over 50 years (2010-2060). Our models generally resulted in species occurrence and richness declines by 2060. The majority of species (7 of 10) experienced declines in regional occurrence for all NELFP scenarios, and one species experienced a projected increase in mean regional occurrence for all scenarios. Our results indicate that the NRPI and SEC drivers strongly influenced projected distribution changes compared to baseline projections. NRPI had a greater impact on distribution change for five species (coyote, moose, striped skunk, white-tailed deer, and wild turkey), while SEC had a greater impact on four species (American black bear, bobcat, raccoon, and red fox); one species (gray fox) was equally influenced by both NRPI and SEC. These results emphasize the importance of integrating both natural resource planning and socio-economic factors when addressing issues of distribution change and offer insights that can inform proactive management and conservation planning.

AB  - Aquatic biodiversity is threatened by anthropogenic activities operating across jurisdictional and conservation area boundaries. Strategic conservation planning for broad, multispecies and multijurisdictional landscapes benefits from data-driven approaches emphasizing persistence of priority species while accounting for human uses and stakeholder priorities. This study presents such an assessment for conservation of priority fishes of the U.S. Great Plains. Distribution models for 28 priority fishes were incorporated into a prioritization framework using the open-source software Zonation. A series of assessments were produced, including (1) identification of distinct conservation areas based on connectivity and compositional similarity of priority streams, (2) perspectives for fish habitat condition prioritized towards undisturbed habitat (indicating protection potential) and disturbed habitat (indicating restoration potential), (3) ranking species conservation values at local (state) and global scales, and (4) development of "bang-for-buck" perspectives emphasizing richness of species at state, basin, and study region scales. Assessment highlights include prioritizations primarily among unfragmented main-stem reaches, considerable state-boundary-based edge effects for rankings when using state based conservation values, and identification of eight distinct regions containing natural communities of priority taxa. Further, we integrate an assessment product into a tiered framework for conservation implementation that facilitates coordination among stakeholders across jurisdictions and increases efficiency of conservation efforts. This set of analyses thus provides varying perspectives to

AB  - Aim An important consideration when planning to conserve a species under climate change is to understand how the distribution of its food resources may also contract or shift under those same climatic conditions. Here, we use a case study to demonstrate a spatial conservation planning approach to inform decisions about where, under climate change, to protect and restore critical food and habitat resources for highly specialized species. Location Eastern Australia. Methods We developed fitted models for the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and five of its key eucalypt food trees using the maximum entropy algorithm available in Maxent. We then projected these models using a range of IPCC A1FI climate change scenarios and identified areas with a higher probability of occurrence. We calculated where the koala and its food trees may co-occur under future climate change. Results The koala and its food trees experienced significant range contractions as climate change progressed, sometimes to regions outside their current distributions. The inland species Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus coolabah contracted from the more arid interior, which is outside the koala range, but persisted in the eastern regions of the koalas range, while Eucalyptus viminalis, Eucalyptus populnea and Eucalyptus tereticornis contracted eastwards and southwards, with a fragmented distribution. The highest probabilities of overlap between koalas and their food trees were identified in fragmented coastal and southern regions of the koalas current range. Main conclusions The application of a robust species distribution modelling decision support tool identified important changes, under climate change, in the distribution of a specialist species and its key food trees. These distributions did not change in complete synergy and therefore areas of overlap varied, depending on the food tree species modelled. This is of particular importance in a conservation planning context, when considering targeted protection and restoration of species-specific habitat resources.

AB  - 1. The overarching goal of United States wildlife action plans is to prevent wildlife from becoming endangered or declining to levels where recovery becomes unlikely. Effective plan implementation depends on establishing Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), defined as wildlife species with small or declining populations or other characteristics that make them vulnerable.
   2. Although nearly two-thirds of distinct Odonata species known from the U.S. (441 species as of 2005) were appointed as SGCN, over half the states neglected to assign dragonfly SGCN, damselfly SGCN, or both. Western and southern states listed proportionately fewer odonate SGCN than states of the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and New England regions, apparently reflecting geographic patterns of legal authority, available information, and involvement by Odonata specialists.
   3. Greater consultation of Odonata specialists is encouraged in any revision of state wildlife action plans, along with increased: (i) use of existing conservation lists, (ii) inferences from field guides and major faunal synopses, (iii) recognition of patterns of endemism, and (iv) application of empirical species distribution modelling.
   4. Legal and management restrictions aside, insects and other invertebrates are often neglected in mainstream conservation efforts because they are perceived as understudied. It is erroneous to assume 'not enough information' exists for well-studied microfauna such as Odonata and doing so further undermines the conservation of less conspicuous and charismatic taxa.

AB  - We described potential changes in the geographic distribution and occurrence probability of Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc. and Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. et Maxim.) Maxim. in the counties of northeast China. This information was used to identify priority areas for protection and provide protection and management recommendations within each studied county. The two species were mapped in 2884 study plots throughout this region over a 4-year period (38A degrees 40'N-53A degrees 30'N, 115A degrees 05'E-135A degrees 02'E). We used the species distribution models (Maxent), systematic conservation planning models (Marxan), and Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS 10.0). The distributions of two species were correlated in the study area, enabling unique and economically viable joint conservation measures to be implemented. Three models were combined to identify feasible priority conservation sites. We used local spatial statistics to assess all identified conservation areas in relation to potential climate change based shifts in the geographic distribution of the two species. Model-based conservation strategies were used to identify effective measures to protect and utilize these two tree species in the study region. This study presents a novel technique for assessing wild plant distributions, in addition to serving as a model for the conservation of other species within the framework of general forest management, ecological construction, and geographical surveying.

AB  - Aim Biodiversity hotspots are widely used as conservation priorities to preserve the tree of life. However, many conservation practices identify biodiversity hotspots without considering phylogenetic diversity (PD), which reflects total evolutionary history and feature diversity of a region. Moreover, conservation planning rarely distinguishes between neo- and palaeo-biodiversity hotspots despite their differences. Here, we (a) estimated large-scale patterns in PD of woody plants, (b) identified neo- and palaeo-biodiversity hotspots and (c) demonstrated their implication in conservation planning, with special focus on Hengduan Mountains and southern China.
   Location China.
   Methods Distributions of 11,405 woody species from the Atlas of Woody Plants in China were updated and were transformed into a grid of 50 x 50 km(2). By integrating distribution maps with a genus-level phylogeny of angiosperms, we estimated Faith's PD of each grid cell and evaluated the contribution of species relatedness to PD at given levels of species diversity (i.e. standardized PD, sPD) using regressions and three null models. Then, we identified areas with significantly lower or higher sPD than expected as neo- and palaeo-hotspots and estimated the coverage of protected areas in these regions.
   Results Species diversity and PD decreased towards the north. Southern China had high species diversity, PD and sPD, while Hengduan Mountains had high species diversity and PD but low sPD. The coverage of protected areas in southern China was less than half of that in Hengduan Mountains and entire China.
   Main conclusions Our results identified Hengduan Mountains as a neo-hotspot and southern China as a palaeo-hotspot, highlighting their importance for biodiversity conservation. Compared to Hengduan Mountains, southern China has low coverage of protected areas, which calls for more conservation attention. Our study demonstrates a way of incorporating the phylogenetic component in the identification of neo- and palaeo-hotspots, and hence of achieving a more complete perception of biodiversity patterns for conserving the tree of life.

AB  - The Landscape Species Approach is a framework developed by the Wildlife Conservation Society for planning landscape-scale conservation based on a suite of focal species. The approach has so far been implemented at 12 terrestrial and two marine sites. We demonstrate the approach using two sites, the Adirondack Park, USA, and San Guillermo-Laguna Brava Landscape, Argentina. We describe the spatially explicit components, including steps to map the attainable (Biological Landscape), current, and future distribution of Landscape Species, human activities (Human Landscapes) and their impacts on Landscape Species, the possible impacts of conservation actions (Conservation Landscapes), and a procedure to set spatial conservation priorities. We discuss advantages and innovations of the approach, including how it incorporates both vulnerability of biodiversity and possible recovery. Finally, we discuss improvements that can be made to the approach, costs, and implications for conservation at the two sites.

AB  - In this paper we aim to investigate the problems and potentialities of species distribution modeling (SDM) as a tool for conservation planning and policy development and implementation in tropical regions. We reviewed 123 studies published between 1995 and 2007 in five of the leading journals in ecology and conservation, and examined two tropical case studies in which distribution modeling is currently being applied to support conservation planning. We also analyzed the characteristics of data typically used for fitting models within the specific context of modeling tree species distribution in Central America. The results showed that methodological papers outnumbered reports of SDMs being used in an applied context for setting conservation priorities, particularly in the tropics. Most applications of SDMs were in temperate regions and biased towards certain organisms such as mammals and birds. Studies from tropical regions were less likely to be validated than those from temperate regions. Unpublished data from two major tropical case studies showed that those species that are most in need of conservation actions, namely those that are the rarest or most threatened, are those for which SDM is least likely to be useful. We found that only 15% of the tree species of conservation concern in Central America could be reliably modelled using data from a substantial source (Missouri Botanical Garden VAST database). Lack of data limits model validation in tropical areas, further restricting the value of SDMs. We concluded that SDMs have a great potential to support biodiversity conservation in the tropics, by supporting the development of conservation strategies and plans, identifying knowledge gaps, and providing a tool to examine the potential impacts of environmental change. However, for this potential to be fully realized, problems of data quality and availability need to be overcome. Weaknesses in current biological datasets need to be systematically addressed, by increasing collection of field survey data, improving data sharing and increasing structural integration of data sources. This should include use of distributed databases with common standards, referential integrity, and rigorous quality control. Integration of data management with SDMs could significantly add value to existing data resources by improving data quality control and enabling knowledge gaps to be identified.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used during the planning stage of reintroduction programmes to model species' occurrence with the aim of selecting potential release sites. However, for many endangered species, only a low number of records are available, leading to models with low accuracy. When planning reintroductions for rare species, an alternative approach may be to model surrogate species that are more abundant or easier to locate. Here, we modelled the distribution of white gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), the preferred food tree of the forty-spotted pardalote (Pardalotus quadragintus), a rare songbird for which reintroduction has been proposed. Using boosted regression trees, we modelled white gum distribution under current and future climate conditions with the aim of identifying areas of high probability of occurrence that later can be used to plan on ground habitat assessments for reintroductions. Our model show areas with high probability of white gum occurrence outside its currently mapped distribution, indicating that there may be opportunities for reintroduction of pardalotes beyond their current range. Predictions of future climate scenarios showed climate space shifts, not only with some decrease but also with substantial increase in the probability of suitability for occurrence under some scenarios. Our spatial predictions for white gum may be used to design a survey to ground-truth our model and undertake a comprehensive habitat assessment for other habitat features forty-spotted pardalotes need to persist. The approach used in our study may be used for other highly specialized species, not only in the context of reintroduction planning but also in the general management of data-poor specialist species that depend on a more common resource.

AB  - Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) play a central role in studying species response to environmental change. Effective management and conservation plans for freshwater ecosystems require SDMs that accommodate hierarchical catchment ordering and provide clarity on the performance of such models across multiple scales. The scale-dependence components considered here are: (a) environment spatial structure, represented by hierarchical catchment ordering following the Strahler system; (b) analysis grain, that included 1st to 5th order catchments; and (c) response grain, the grain at which species respond most, represented by local and upstream catchment area effects. We used fish occurrence data from the Danube River Basin and various factors representing climate, land cover and anthropogenic pressures. Our results indicate that the choice of response grain local vs. upstream area effects and the choice of analysis grain, only marginally influence the performance of SDMs. Upstream effects tend to better predict fish distributions than corresponding local effects for anthropogenic and land cover factors, in particular for species sensitive to pollution. Key predictors and their relative importance are scale and species dependent. Consequently, choosing proper species dependent spatial scales and factors is imperative for effective river rehabilitation measures.

AB  - Species Distribution Models (SDM) are currently common currency as proxies of species distribution range, and using consensus among different algorithms is becoming the latest tendency. This information is frequently used to estimate conservation status or for conservation planning. Nonetheless, different algorithms have huge variation in the outcomes. Usually experts determine whether or not a model is accurate, often followed by a trimming process. However, this accuracy estimation cannot be reproduced. Using Mexican endemic amphibians we evaluate the performance of nine modelling algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks, Classification Tree Analysis, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Generalised Boosting Model, Generalised Linear Models, Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines, MaxEnt, RandomForest, Surface Range Envelope), their strict geographic consensus, locality records and simple convex-hull areas through comparison of: (1) their presence/absence within Mexico's governmental protected areas, (2) range sizes projected, and (3) differences in estimated richness by all methods. We conducted all good practices prior modelling but removed the trimming factor after modelling to make the process repeatable. Presence-absence threshold was determined through the use of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC). Presence within conservation network of strict consensus and locality records was similar which indicates an over-fitting of the former, the rest of the algorithms performed similarly, with exception of Surface Range Envelope. Richness patterns varied greatly among algorithms. Distribution borders were the areas with higher sensitivity. MaxEnt obtained the highest performance in omission but consensus performed best in correctly predicting species ranges. Closer interaction between curators and modelers would increase SDMs accuracy, which would improve conservation planning effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat models are now broadly used in conservation planning on public lands. If implemented correctly, habitat modelling is a transparent and repeatable technique for describing and mapping biodiversity values, and its application in peri-urban and agricultural landscape planning is likely to expand rapidly. Conservation planning in such landscapes must be robust to the scrutiny that arises when biodiversity constraints are placed on developers and private landholders. A standardized modelling and model evaluation method based on widely accepted techniques will improve the robustness of conservation plans. We review current habitat modelling and model evaluation methods and provide a habitat modelling case study in the New South Wales central coast region that we hope will serve as a methodological template for conservation planners. We make recommendations on modelling methods that are appropriate when presence-absence and presence-only survey data are available and provide methodological details and a website with data and training material for modellers. Our aim is to provide practical guidelines that preserve methodological rigour and result in defendable habitat models and maps. The case study was undertaken in a rapidly developing area with substantial biodiversity values under urbanization pressure. Habitat maps for seven priority fauna species were developed using logistic regression models of species-habitat relationships and a bootstrapping methodology was used to evaluate model predictions. The modelled species were the koala, tiger quoll, squirrel glider, yellow-bellied glider, masked owl, powerful owl and sooty owl. Models ranked sites adequately in terms of habitat suitability and provided predictions of sufficient reliability for the purpose of identifying preliminary conservation priority areas. However, they are subject to multiple uncertainties and should not be viewed as a completely accurate representation of the distribution of species habitat. We recommend the use of model prediction in an adaptive framework whereby models are iteratively updated and refined as new data become available.

AB  - Terrestrial tortoises are the most endangered group of vertebrates but they are still largely ignored for defining global conservation priorities. In this paper, we explored within a hierarchical framework the potential contribution of prioritization studies at the continental scale to the planning of local initiatives for the conservation of African tortoises at the regional level. First, we modeled the distribution of all the African tortoise species, we calculated three indicators of conservation priority (i.e. species richness, conservation value, and complementarity), and we carried out a gap analysis at continental scale. Second, we focused on the most important region for tortoise conservation and performed the same analyses at higher resolution. Finally, we compared the results from the two scales for understanding the degree to which they are complementary. Southern Africa emerged from the continental analysis as the most important region for tortoises. Within this area, the high-resolution analysis pointed out specific core sites for conservation. The relative degree of species protection was assessed similarly at the two different resolutions. Two species appeared particularly vulnerable at both scales. Priority indices calculated at high resolution were correlated to the values calculated for the corresponding cells at low resolution but the congruence was stronger for species richness. Our results suggest to integrate the calculation of conservation value and complementarity into a hierarchical framework driven by species richness. The advantages of large scale planning include its broad perspective on complementarity and the capability to identify regions with greatest conservation potential. In this light, continental analyses allow targeting fine scale studies toward regions with maximum priority. The regional analyses at fine scale allow planning conservation measure at a resolution similar to that required for the practical implementation, reducing the uncertainty associated with low resolution studies.

TI  - Incorporating natural and human factors in habitat modelling and spatial prioritisation for the Lynx lynx martinoi
T2  - WEB ECOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Countries in south-eastern Europe are cooperating to conserve a sub-endemic lynx species, Lynx lynx martinoi. Yet, the planning of species conservation should go hand-in-hand with the planning and management of (new) protected areas. Lynx lynx martinoi has a small, fragmented distribution with a small total population size and an endangered population. This study combines species distribution modelling with spatial prioritisation techniques to identify conservation areas for Lynx lynx martinoi. The aim was to determine locations of high probability of occurrence for the lynx, to potentially increase current protected areas by 20% in Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. The species distribution modelling used generalised linear models with lynx occurrence and pseudo-absence data. Two models were developed and fitted using the lynx data: one based on natural factors, and the second based on factors associated with human disturbance. The Zonation conservation planning software was then used to undertake spatial prioritisations of the landscape using the first model composed of natural factors as a biological feature, and (inverted) a second model composed of anthropological factors such as a cost layer. The first model included environmental factors as elevation, terrain ruggedness index, woodland and shrub land, and food factor as chamois prey (occurrences) and had a prediction accuracy of 82 %. Second model included anthropological factors as agricultural land and had a prediction accuracy of 65 %. Prioritised areas for extending protected areas for lynx conservation were found primarily in the Albania-Macedonia-Kosovo and Montenegro-Albania-Kosovo cross-border areas. We show how natural and human factors can be incorporated into spatially prioritising conservation areas on a landscape level. Our results show the importance of expanding the existing protected areas in cross-border areas of core lynx habitat. The priority of these cross-border areas highlight the importance international cooperation can play in designing and implementing a coherent and long-term conservation plan including a species conservation plan to securing the future of the lynx.

AB  - Aim: Human-induced climate change requires conservation strategies incorporating its potential effects on species and communities. Key components of population persistence can be attributed to resistance (the capacity to remain unaffected) or resilience (capacity to absorb and recover) to climate change. In situ climatic refugia can act as resistant distribution units, and ex situ climatic refugia and the corridors to reach them may enhance resilience. We develop a novel approach selecting conservation priorities, resistant units and resilient areas according to structural connectivity and future distribution, to identify strategies that maximize the chances of species persistence in a changing climate.
   Location: Italian Alps.
   Methods: Conservation priorities were defined across species according to the regional conservation status and the level of threat from climate change, and across sites according to their suitability for target species and their related potential for population persistence (in situ climatic refugia, i.e., resistant units) or redistribution (ex situ climatic refugia and main corridors according to current and future connectivity, i.e., resilient units).
   Results: Models suggested a marked loss of suitable area for all species by 2050 (ranging from similar to 50% for pygmy owl and water pipit, to 84% for snowfinch in the worst scenario), and a general loss of connectivity, which was particularly marked for pygmy owl and snowfinch. The approach applied to Alpine birds of different habitats led to a spatially explicit definition of conservation priorities.
   Main conclusions: The spatial definition of conservation priorities according to species (regional importance and level of threat), resistance and resilience refines the definition of management/conservation priorities (including protected area definition), complementing the existing approaches to address climate change-induced threats in planning conservation and ecological networks.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning (SCP) identifies priority areas for biodiversity conservation using surrogates for adequate representation of biodiversity content. The use of multiple well-known taxonomic groups rather than single ones as a surrogate set is expected to enable a better representation of most important biodiversity constituents in prioritizing conservation areas. We quantitatively analyzed if single- or multitaxa groups of terrestrial vertebrates serve best as surrogates for representing biodiversity constituents in the state of Oaxaca, a biodiversity hotspot in southern Mexico. We produced species distribution models for 1,063 terrestrial vertebrate species using a maximum entropy algorithm. To determine which fraction of each terrestrial vertebrate group best represented the remaining groups, we produced solutions requiring different proportions of species to be represented with a 10% target of the species' potential distribution in conservation area networks. Precedence to geographical rarity, minimizing area, and enhancing compactness in shape of the selected priority areas was established using ConsNet. We further evaluated performance with surrogacy graphs for determining the representation of each group of terrestrial vertebrates treated as biodiversity constituents. Inclusion of multiple terrestrial vertebrate groups as surrogates performed best for the representation of biodiversity constituents compared to a single terrestrial vertebrate group, in all solutions with different proportions of species in these conservation areas. Terrestrial vertebrate species were poorly represented in the few protected areas (<2% of species), but representation increased significantly (99% of species) when complemented with other established conservation initiatives. SCP should include multitaxa surrogate sets and all established conservation initiatives to ensure priority areas for conservation with an adequate biodiversity representation.

AB  - Species distribution models have recently become important tools in ecological research. Prediction of suitable habitats for threatened and endangered species is essential for the conservation and management of their native habitats. A landscape scale approach is relevant for biodiversity conservation since landscape planning and management are generally conducted at wide spatial scales, focusing on areas with complex landscape configuration as a consequence of human activities. The aims of this study were to test a maximum entropy approach (Maxent) to the development of a niche-based model for species of conservation interest and to relate this model to landscape structure metrics. The results obtained here showed a good predictive power of Maxent for the three target species and highlighted the importance of landscape structure analysis for the detection of patterns of habitat suitability. Moreover, this work stressed that combining classical environmental information with landscape structure in analysing habitat suitability for species of conservation interest may be used to guide conservation efforts and landscape management practices.

AB  - P>1. We review recent advances in systematic conservation planning in fresh waters. Most modern systematic planning approaches are based on the CARE principles: comprehensiveness, adequacy, representativeness and efficiency. Efficiency is usually provided by a complementarity-based strategy, aiming to select new conservation areas in the light of previously protected features. These strategies have to be modified to account for the connected nature of rivers.
   2. Choice of surrogates for conservation features depends on the scale of the assessment, as well as the available expertise and resources. Ideally, real information about taxa or processes - extrapolated by models - ensures that target features are protected. Where this is not feasible, it is critical that the choice of environmental surrogates is informed by target biota or processes.
   3. Setting adequacy targets - the most challenging aspect in planning - needs to be evaluated in a freshwater-specific context, as species-area relationships and the distribution of diversity differ in dendritic networks. Adequately designed conservation plans also need to consider upstream land use and catchment disturbances. Recent studies have largely addressed longitudinal connectivity either by setting rules to protect adjacent subcatchments (or even the entire catchment upstream), or by considering the magnitude of disturbance upstream of selected planning units. Very few studies have addressed lateral and vertical connectivity in a systematic way.
   4. To implement freshwater conservation plans, we recommend adopting a recently proposed hierarchical protection strategy, from 'freshwater focal areas' that contain the actual features to be protected to mixed-use 'catchment management zones'. Stakeholder involvement is crucial, especially in the large multi-use areas upstream and in the surrounding catchment.
   5. We conclude that conservation planning using CARE principles is the only efficient way forward. This special issue shows significant efforts are under way to adapt freshwater-specific adequacy, connectivity and implementation issues in conservation planning. However, a more holistic research investment is required to link freshwater, terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

AB  - The Yangtze River Basin (YRB), a key biodiversity area and a major economic zone in China, the biodiversity of the area is confronted with severe challenges. In this paper, we analyzed species distribution patterns based on a dataset with 18,538 seed plant species to identify hotspots and evaluate conservation effectiveness and gaps of the YRB. We calculated distribution patterns of species richness with the top 5% richness algorithm and complementarity algorithm, and reconstructed a phylogenetic tree and elucidated spatial phylogenetics. There were 214 hotspot grid cells covering only 6.8% of the study region, but containing 88% seed plant species. Then, we conducted correlation analysis on distribution patterns of different algorithms and species categories, which showed moderate or weak correlations between the top 5% richness algorithm and complementary algorithm. Conservation effectiveness analysis indicated there were 116 hotspot grid cells (accounting for 73.6% of the total species) protected by current conservation networks and there are many conservation gaps remaining. Finally, we used the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to predict suitable habitat areas of threatened species under current and future climate scenarios. Prediction analysis results indicated future expansion of suitable habitat to the southeast, and reduction in the central and western portions of the study area. When we considered anthropogenic areas, the suitable habitat was severely decreased, indicating the importance of optimizing the layout of conservation networks and comprehensive biodiversity conservation planning in the YRB.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and loss is the main cause of species extinction; thus, the appropriate placement of protected areas is critical for saving vulnerable and threatened species. However, how to expand the existing protected areas network for improving conservation efficiency is a vital concern. We examined the Qinling Mountains a widely recognized biogeographic treasure in China and East Asia, to identify key biodiversity areas (KBAs) and compare them with existing protected areas. We focused on 259 key protected wild plant and animal species and modeled species distributions with elevation and habitat preference. We then adapted two established algorithms (biodiversity hotspots of species richness [BHSR] and systematic conservation planning [SCP]) to identify priority areas, respectively. Results from these two algorithms addressed two conservation criteria: "represented" single species and "well-represented" species assemblages. SCP showed better performance (similar to 90%) than BHSR (similar to 78%) using the "represented" criterion covering a small portion (similar to 8%) of the total region; conversely, BHSR showed better performance (similar to 61%) than SCP (similar to 55%) using the "well-represented" criterion. The overlapping priority areas of both methods could achieve an optimal conservation that met dual criteria, which is considered as the candidate KBAs in this study. Surprisingly, we found that 63% of KBAs are not co-occurring with existing national nature reserves (NNRs). We highlight the unoccupied KBAs as deserving additional protection, with a result that the expansion of NNRs to KBAs will increase overall conservation coverage and efficiency. The integrated method developed here can be used generally as a repeatable and quantitative assessment framework to be implemented in protected areas network expansion and planning, in China and beyond.

AB  - Restoration and conservation may be enhanced by using ecologically-based methods for prioritizing actions. Efforts are currently underway to restore river flows to the San Joaquin River in California's Central Valley. Although fish are the primary restoration target for restored flows, complementary efforts are being designed to protect, enhance, and restore riparian and floodplain habitats to benefit the larger ecological community. We describe our efforts to use bird habitat distribution models to inform and prioritize conservation activities along the San Joaquin River. We demonstrate the integration of habitat distribution models into an established conservation planning process that illustrates the synergies and tradeoffs of protecting high quality habitat for multiple species-groups and other restoration opportunities on the San Joaquin River. We used quantitative models to develop habitat quality indices for marsh birds, early-successional riparian birds, and mid/late-successional riparian birds, and used these indices to rank 18 sites under consideration along the San Joaquin River. We found little evidence that the rankings of the 18 sites for the three habitats were correlated, suggesting that any prioritization decisions will need to consider the quality of all three habitats, rather than one habitat acting as a surrogate for the others. Considering the habitat model rankings together with expert opinion rankings based on existing habitat quality, restoration potential, and flood management opportunities allowed us to identify sites that ranked high across multiple criteria. These results illustrate a simple process by which quantitative information from habitat models can be combined with expert opinion to inform priorities for protection and restoration.

AB  - Large identifiable landscape units, such as ecoregions, are used to prioritize global and continental conservation efforts, particularly where biodiversity knowledge is inadequate. Setting biodiversity representation targets using coarse large-scale biogeographic boundaries, can be inefficient and under-representative. Even when using fine-scale biodiversity data, representation deficiencies can occur through misalignment of target distributions with such prioritization frameworks. While this pattern has been recognized, quantitative approaches highlighting misalignments have been lacking, particularly for assemblages of mammal species. We tested the efficacy of Australia's bioregions as a spatial prioritization framework for representing mammal species, within protected areas, in New South Wales. We produced an approach based on mammal assemblages and assessed its performance in representing mammal distributions. Substantial spatial misalignment between New South Wales's bioregions and mammal assemblages was revealed, reflecting deficiencies in the representation of more than half of identified mammal assemblages. Using a systematic approach driven by fine-scale mammalian data, we compared the efficacy of these two frameworks in securing mammalian representation within protected areas. Of the 61 species, 38 were better represented by the mammalian framework, with remaining species only marginally better represented when guided by bioregions. Overall, the rate at which mammal species were incorporated into the protected area network was higher (5.1%+/- 0.6sd) when guided by mammal assemblages. Guided by bioregions, systematic conservation planning of protected areas may be constrained in realizing its full potential in securing representation for all of Australia's biodiversity. Adapting the boundaries of prioritization frameworks by incorporating amassed information from a broad range of taxa should be of conservation significance.

AB  - Aim Megafires are increasing in intensity and frequency globally. The impacts of megafires on biodiversity can be severe, so conservation managers must be able to respond rapidly to quantify their impacts, initiate recovery efforts and consider conservation options within and beyond the burned extent. We outline a framework that can be used to guide conservation responses to megafires, using the 1.5 million hectare 2019/2020 megafires in Victoria, Australia, as a case study.
   Location Victoria, Australia.
   Methods Our framework uses a suite of decision support tools, including species attribute databases, similar to 4,200 species distribution models and a spatially explicit conservation action planning tool to quantify the potential effects of megafires on biodiversity, and identify species-specific and landscape-scale conservation actions that can assist recovery.
   Results Our approach identified 346 species in Victoria that had >40% of their modelled habitat affected by the megafire, including 45 threatened species, and 102 species with >40% of their modelled habitat affected by high severity fire. We then identified 21 candidate recovery actions that are expected to assist the recovery of biodiversity. For relevant landscape-scale actions, we identified locations within and adjacent to the megafire extent that are expected to deliver cost-effective conservation gains.
   Main conclusion The 2019/2020 megafires in south-eastern Australia affected the habitat of many species and plant communities. Our framework identified a range of single-species (e.g., supplementary feeding, translocation) and landscape-scale actions (e.g., protection of refuges, invasive species management) that can help biodiversity recover from megafires. Conservation managers will be increasingly required to rapidly identify conservation actions that can help species recover from megafires, especially under a changing climate. Our approach brings together commonly used datasets (e.g., species distribution maps, trait databases, fire severity mapping) to help guide conservation responses and can be used to help biodiversity recover from future megafires across the world.

AB  - Biodiversity maps are an important component of ecosystem-based management and conservation. In the past, biodiversity maps were largely generated using patchy occurrence data from a range of data sources. Currently, substantial species occurrence data are readily available for large parts of the world and are accessible programmatically. Considering both the observed and expected changes in species distributions, and hence biodiversity, in response to present and future climate change, it is important to utilise readily available species occurrence databases to generate temporal and spatial biodiversity maps. In this study biodiversity maps were generated for three generic functional groups within the exclusive economic zone of South Africa: zooplankton, fishes and benthos. This was achieved by stacking individual species-distribution maps. Freely available occurrence data from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) were accessed for this purpose. Ensemble species-distribution modelling, employing five widely used statistical methods, was used to generate species-distribution maps for each functional group. The resulting spatial patterns of biodiversity for the three functional groups were largely in agreement with known patterns. The results of this study highlight the value of open-source occurrence and environmental data to generate biodiversity maps that can potentially be used in future spatial prioritisation or planning for management of marine areas and in environmental-change studies.

AB  - We propose an improved planning method for priority protected areas (PPAs) to conserve endangered plant species that are threatened by climate change and human disturbance. Recent researches have shown that the actual approaches used in planning PPAs are useful for the conservation of endangered plants. The next required step is to determine how to protect endangered plants effectively in PPAs. Here, we used the case of 84 endangered plants in China to integrate conservation management into the planning of PPAs. First, we identified locations for proposed PPAs based on current and future suitable habitats of species, based on shifts due to climate change, as modelled by Maxent; secondly, we classified the species into different clusters based on the value of protecting them and the factors that threaten them; finally, we determined the best regions for conservation management. We found that species with high material, medicinal, and scientific research values of protection were threatened by over-exploitation and excess reclamation in PPAs. The best candidate PPAs were distributed mainly in southern China-the provinces of Fujiang, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Zhejiang and Guizhou held large potential for the protection of endangered plant species. Given the attention that we paid to conservation management for the planning of PPAs, and the practical value of study, our method will provide an important point of reference for the implementation of policy to protect endangered plants from the effects of climate change, along with information about the values of protecting species and the factors that threaten them.

AB  - Background: Detailed knowledge of a species' autecology as well as information on the availability of suitable habitats and the impacts of climate change on the species and its habitat are requirements for adequate conservation planning. For this purpose, species distribution modelling has been suggested as an effective tool to assess the potential geographic distributions of species under different climate scenarios.
   Aims: The aim of this study was to generate suitability maps and predictive maps based on scenarios of climate change to identify areas with the most value for conservation for the western Iberian endemics Silene acutifolia, S. foetida subsp. foetida and S. foetida subsp. gayana.
   Methods: Maxent software was used to model and predict the distribution of the species based on environmental variables under climate change scenarios.
   Results: Our analysis indicated that the models performed well, predicting with high accuracy the current distributions of the species. Under two scenarios of increasing CO2, the species were predicted to be susceptible to a major reduction of suitable habitat; both S. foetida subspecies were shown to be at risk of extinction.

AB  - The California and U.S. Endangered Species Acts prohibit take of protected species, but allow for authorization of take incidental to otherwise lawful activities provided the take is minimized and mitigated. Incomplete and inconsistent ecological information can limit the contribution of mitigation plans for incidental take, especially those for multiple species, to species persistence. Many such plans focus on acquisition and management of coarse-resolution land-cover or land-use types. These classifications may not coincide with a species' resource requirements (its habitat) or the greatest constraints to its viability. Complementing acquisition with rigorous research on population biology, stressors, and habitat use and quality may be much more effective than preservation of putative but unproven habitat. Such adaptive conservation can be applied to species with restricted or extensive distributions. When the distribution and ecology of geographically restricted species are well-known, then connectivity analyses, sometimes complemented by spatially explicit, mechanistic population models, may inform habitat acquisition and management. When little information exists on the ecology or vital rates of a restricted species, we suggest assessment of occupancy, habitat use, or demography; tracking individuals' movements; and evaluation of habitat quality. Acquisition and management of local lands that may not serve as habitat is unlikely to contribute to conservation of extensively distributed species with range-wide declines. Instead, we suggest that conservation efforts for these species emphasize strategic acquisition of open space (large, undeveloped areas that are more likely to serve as high-quality habitat), potentially in locations distant from the permit area. The above areas of research can inform optimization of conservation locations. Many mitigation decisions are based on assumptions drawn from limited data. Inclusion of scientific research in development and implementation of mitigation plans for incidental take can strengthen the plans' information content, improve the ecological success acquisition and management, and advance conservation of protected species.

AB  - To use models of species distributions effectively in conservation planning, it is important to determine the predictive accuracy of such models. Extensive modelling of the distribution of vascular plant and vertebrate fauna species within north-east New South Wales has been undertaken by linking field survey data to environmental and geographical predictors using logistic regression. These models have been used in the development of a comprehensive and adequate reserve system within the region. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of models for 153 small reptile, arboreal marsupial, diurnal bird and vascular plant species for which independent evaluation data were available.
   The predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the relative operating characteristic curve to measure discrimination capacity. Good discrimination ability implies that a model's predictions provide an acceptable index of species occurrence.
   The discrimination capacity of 89% of the models was significantly better than random, with 70% of the models providing high levels of discrimination. Predictions generated by this type of modelling therefore provide a reasonably sound basis for regional conservation planning.
   The discrimination ability of models was highest for the less mobile biological groups, particularly the vascular plants and small reptiles. In the case of diurnal birds, poor performing models tended to be for species which occur mainly within specific habitats not well sampled by either the model development or evaluation data, highly mobile species, species that are locally nomadic or those that display very broad habitat requirements. Particular care needs to be exercised when employing models for these types of species in conservation planning. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - Ongoing loss of biodiversity requires identifying large-scale conservation priorities, but the detailed information on the distribution of species required for this purpose is often missing. We present a systematic reserve selection for 1223 African mammals and amphibians in which habitat suitability models are used as estimates of the area occupied by species. In the framework of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Amphibian Assessment and IUCN Global Mammal Assessment, we collected the geographic range (extent of occurrence) and habitat preferences for each species. We used the latter to build species-specific habitat suitability models inside geographic ranges, and for 181 species we verified the models by comparing suitability levels to presence-absence data collected in the field. We then used the suitable areas as estimators of the area of occupancy and compared the results of systematic reserve selection based on geographic ranges to those based on estimated areas of occupancy. Our results showed that the reserve system would need a 30-100% expansion to achieve minimal conservation targets, concentrated in the tropics, where species richness reaches a maximum. Comparative analyses revealed that using geographic ranges, which overestimate the area occupied by species, underestimates the total amount of area that needs to be conserved. The area selected for conservation doubled when we used the estimated area of occupancy in place of the geographic ranges. This happened because the suitable areas potentially occupied by each species overlapped less than their geographic ranges. As a result, any given protected area contained fewer species than predicted by the analysis of ranges. Because species are more specialized than our estimates of distribution based on extent of occurrence suggest, we propose that this is a general effect in systematic conservation planning.

AB  - Accurate data describing the geographic distribution of specific species form the basis for effective conservation management policies. However, for most species the freely available distributional information is usually confined to either expert maps or purely theoretical maps constructed by using a variety of modeling frameworks. These maps usually do not provide enough resolution for conservation applications or do not accurately describe the current distribution status. In this study, we constructed a novel workflow designed to integrate data from various species distribution models and expert knowledge into a single unified modeling process. Under this workflow, we systematically constructed current distribution maps for a selection of terrestrial vertebrates found across Taiwan.
   We used species distribution modeling as the base and then aggregated multiple open datasets describing species occurrence and environmental factors as data sources. Thereafter, we estimated the primary broad-scale and high spatial resolution species range maps using the MaxEnt modeling algorithm, and then consulted experts on each taxa to refine these maps.
   This dataset provides up-to-date species distribution maps for 379 terrestrial vertebrates in Taiwan, with members from across four taxa (27 amphibians, 52 reptiles, 264 birds, and 36 mammals). This dataset helps to fill the spatial knowledge gaps for conservation concerns and improves our understanding of the geographic distribution of more than half (61%) of the vertebrate species of Taiwan. Furthermore, by stacking the range maps of multiple species, we can identify vertebrate diversity hotspots and identify priority areas for conservation. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Systematic conservation planning is a framework for optimally locating and prioritizing areas for conservation. An often-noted shortcoming of most conservation planning studies is that they do not address future uncertainty. The selection of protected areas that are intended to ensure the long-term persistence of biodiversity is often based on a snapshot of the current situation, ignoring processes such as climate change. Scenarios, in the sense of being accounts of plausible futures, can be utilized to identify conservation area portfolios that are robust to future uncertainty. We compared three approaches for utilizing scenarios in conservation area selection: considering a full set of scenarios (all-scenarios portfolio), assuming the realization of specific scenarios, and a reference strategy based on the current situation (current distributions portfolio). Our objective was to compare the robustness of these approaches in terms of their relative performance across future scenarios. We focused on breeding bird species in Israel's Mediterranean region. We simulated urban development and vegetation dynamics scenarios 60 years into the future using DINAMICA-EGO, a cellular-automata simulation model. For each scenario, we mapped the target species' available habitat distribution, identified conservation priority areas using the site-selection software MARXAN, and constructed conservation area portfolios using the three aforementioned strategies. We then assessed portfolio performance based on the number of species for which representation targets were met in each scenario. The all-scenarios portfolio consistently outperformed the other portfolios, and was more robust to 'errors' (e.g., when an assumed specific scenario did not occur). On average, the all-scenarios portfolio achieved representation targets for five additional species compared with the current distributions portfolio (approximately 33 versus 28 species). Our findings highlight the importance of considering a broad and meaningful set of scenarios, rather than relying on the current situation, the expected occurrence of specific scenarios, or the worst-case scenario.

AB  - Climate change is likely to threaten forests in future. Because dominant tree species (DTS) play central roles in stabilizing forest ecosystems, to effectively protect forests, we need to pay more attention to the protection of DTS. Furthermore, we need to integrate potential impacts of climate change into conservation efforts of DTS for improving forest protection. We utilized species distribution modeling, coupled with conservation planning, to establish climate-informed conservation prioritization for 136 taxa of DTS in three forest types (broad-leaved forests, mixed broadleaf-conifer forests, and coniferous forests) in China. We considered both current and future distributions and assessed the ability of existing nature reserves in China to protect forests based on these DTS. Regions with the highest climate-informed conservation prioritization were distributed in the southern, southwestern, and northeastern regions of China. There was a small gap between existing nature reserves and predicted conservation prioritization areas for conserving forests: the proportions of overlap between existing reserves and areas prioritized under climate change scenarios were 87.8, 95.7, and 80.4% for broad-leaved forests, mixed broadleaf-conifer forests, and coniferous forests, respectively. Even so, we need to increase the number and/or area of nature reserves to protect coniferous forests in Tibet, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and broad-leaved forests in Guizhou, Guangxi, Hu'nan, Yunnan, and Sichuan. Our results demonstrate the importance of conservation planning under climate change, taking both current and future distributions of plant species into consideration. Nature reserves should develop different management strategies for different forest types.

AB  - Applicability of modeling tools to tackle conservation problems is key for conservation planning. However, modeling papers regarding real-world conservation issues are scarce. Here, we combined two modeling tools to identify priority areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, focusing on the last large-bodied frugivorous bird in the region, the red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii). We used population viability analysis (PVA) to determine (1) the minimum viable population size under different hunting scenarios; and (2) the minimum critical forest patch size required to maintain viable populations. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to identify remnants that retain suitable environmental conditions to ensure the long-term persistence of this species. We overlapped the outputs from PVA and ENM models to identify priority areas for curassows. Under our best-case scenario, 56 individuals would suffice to maintain a viable population and 71 forest patches located within the species' known range are above the critical size of 3141 ha. In the worst-case scenario, at least 138 individuals would be required to maintain a viable population in forest patches larger than 9500 ha, corresponding to only 20 Atlantic Forest fragments within the species range. Among these, 17 presented median habitat suitability values higher than 0.70, eight of which were selected as priority areas for law enforcement and nine as priority areas for reintroduction. We encourage conservation biologists and land managers to combine modeling tools which can be guided by our conservation planning framework. This approach is promising to inform long-term conservation planning of a flagship species and its entire ecosystem. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Considering genetic relatedness among species has long been argued as an important step toward measuring biological diversity more accurately, rather than relying solely on species richness. Some researchers have correlated measures of phylogenetic diversity and species richness across a series of sites and suggest that values of phylogenetic diversity do not differ enough from those of species richness to justify their inclusion in conservation planning. We compared predictions of species richness and 10 measures of phylogenetic diversity by creating distribution models for 168 individual species of a species-rich plant family, the Cape Proteaceae. When we used average amounts of land set aside for conservation to compare areas selected on the basis of species richness with areas selected on the basis of phylogenetic diversity, correlations between species richness and different measures of phylogenetic diversity varied considerably. Correlations between species richness and measures that were based on the length of phylogenetic tree branches and tree shape were weaker than those that were based on tree shape alone. Elevation explained up to 31% of the segregation of species rich versus phylogenetically rich areas. Given these results, the increased availability of molecular data, and the known ecological effect of phylogenetically rich communities, consideration of phylogenetic diversity in conservation decision making may be feasible and informative.

AB  - Aim To analyse spatial trade-offs in conservation of mammals, considering benefits of biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic costs.
   Location Cerrado Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil.
   Methods We built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 154 mammals inhabiting the cerrado. We combined model projections to produce consensus maps of species' distributions for three types of models (envelope, statistical and machine-learning models). We used these range summaries as input data in spatial prioritization analyses. We compared six conservation scenarios, considering human population density, land cost, anthropogenic land use, political willingness to act and the distribution of species using trade-off analyses. We complemented the current network of protected areas, aiming to achieve a target of 17% of land protection in the cerrado.
   Results Species-rich sites coincide with regions with high human population, high land cost, high anthropogenic land use and diverse levels of political willingness to act. We found a significant change in spatial priorities when we included socioeconomic and political dimensions in analyses: top-priority sites moved north, reduced by 68% potential conservation conflicts with human population, reduced by 72% the total monetary cost of actions and reduced by 68% conflict with other anthropogenic land uses. It also increased by 80% the beneficial effect of political willingness to act.
   Main conclusions Our results reinforce the idea that using only biological criteria for proposing spatial conservation priorities can undermine conservation plans given increases in socioeconomic and political conflicts.

AB  - Although many studies have addressed island biogeography, the biodiversity of very small islets has mostly been ignored due to the lack of high-resolution data. We analysed the vascular plant taxa distribution pattern of 81 satellite islets scattered around Sardinia, the second largest island in the Mediterranean Basin. Power models were used to determine the influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors on both endemic and non-endemic species richness. Analyses of the distribution pattern highlighted the high endemism rate in these islets. In addition, reliable results for conservation, such as correlations with land use diversity, climate and human presence, were found only when categorising the islets by their environmental characteristics instead of their geographical position. This study of a representative set of Mediterranean islets contributes to the knowledge base about the controversial role of very small islets in biological conservation. Large-scale analyses have often underrated their importance and we therefore suggest that local studies about their conservation planning are needed worldwide.

AB  - Global changes require conservation planners to integrate environmental dynamics into their strategies. Forward-looking species-based conservation plans typically use data for a few time periods (ten to thirty years apart) to pinpoint the adaptive areas providing the conditions for species to follow their suitable climates and persist. With such gaps in time, species' responses to environmental conditions between the evaluated periods are not addressed. Here we test whether choices on the temporal resolution in analysis (length of time in between time slices) impact the location and perceived effectiveness of the resulting climate-adaptive areas and the value of established protected areas in providing ground for the spatial responses of species. We address these issues using a conservation exercise set up in Western France, where ten vertebrate species are targeted for persistence in the long term (i.e., 2050). For each species, the area prioritization solutions obtained by using three settings of temporal resolution (annual, decadal and tri-decadal) were largely dissimilar. The climate adaptive areas obtained with annual data defined convoluted adaptive trajectories, largely distinct from the trajectories achieved with decadal and tri-decadal data. This has reflections on the perceived effectiveness of established protected areas in encompassing those adaptive trajectories. In the final stages of planning, conservation planers need to provide rigorous proposals for the establishment of effective conservation actions. This study pinpoints the need for fine-resolute temporal data to reach such effectiveness in the design of climate-proof protected area networks.

AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns of species distribution and predicting suitable habitats for threatened species are central themes in land use management and planning. In this study, we examined the geographic distribution of threatened mire plant species and identified their national hotspots, i.e. areas with high amounts of suitable habitats for threatened mire plant species. We also determined the main environmental correlates related to the distribution patterns of these species. The specific aims were to: (1) identify the environmental variables that control the distribution of threatened peatland species in a boreal aapa mire zone, Finland; and (2) to identify the richness patterns and hotspots of threatened species. Our results showed that the combination of individual species models offers a useful tool for identifying landscape-scale richness patterns for threatened plant species. The modeling performance was high across the modelled species, and the richness patterns generated by single models coincide with the expected richness pattern based on expert knowledge. The method is therefore a powerful tool for basic biodiversity applications. In cases where reliable models for species occurrences and hotspots can be produced, these models can play a significant role in land-use planning and help managers to meet different conservation challenges.

AB  - Climate change has greatly affected the natural habitats of wild plants, especially vulnerable species. However, methods to properly assess priority protected areas (PPAs) that consider climate change have not been established. The distribution of Fraxinus mandshurica in northeast China was assessed, and our goal was to develop model-based strategies for the assessment of PPAs in consideration of climate change. To achieve this goal, we mapped the current and future suitable habitat distributions of F. mandshurica and planned PPAs based on 4 field surveys in northeast China. The models used in this study included a species distribution model (Maxent), systematic conservation planning model (Zonation), and geographic information system (ArcGIS 10.0). To promote sustainable development, the current and future suitable habitats of F mandshurica must be integrated into the assessment of PPAs; however, the conservation areas of F mandshurica in existing nature reserves cannot realize the conservation criterion of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC). In the eastern and northeastern regions of northeast China, the suitable habitats are predicted to migrate slightly northwards in the future. The methods used in this study are adequate for the assessment of PPAs and may provide a reference for the conservation and management of vulnerable plants.

AB  - Male and female animals often segregate spatially among habitats and landscapes outside of breeding seasons, but it is unclear to what extent conservation efforts account for sexual segregation. Overlooking this phenomenon may result in conservation plans that don't meet the needs of both sexes, especially when resources or threats vary spatially. We assessed the prevalence of sexual segregation and degree to which current conservation efforts account for it with a review of nonbreeding ecology and conservation planning literature for 66 North American migratory landbirds of conservation concern. Sexual segregation was common in the group-reported for one-third of all species and two-thirds of those with published nonbreeding sex ratios-and did not differ with dimorphism or conservation status. Despite this, only 3% of species distribution models and 8% of conservation recommendations considered sexual segregation, indicating the pattern is widely overlooked. Next, we used the declining Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) as a case study to test for sex-bias in habitats prioritized by current conservation efforts. By modeling nonbreeding occupancy and forest cover loss for males and females, we show that females lost twice as much nonbreeding habitat as males from 2000 to 2016, yet existing conservation focal areas remain heavily biased towards male-dominated landscapes. Furthermore, female-dominated habitats face higher rates of conversion than male habitats for multiple species of Neotropical migrants, suggesting the failure to address sexual segregation may compromise the effectiveness of migratory landbird conservation. We recommend greater effort to report sex ratios and create sex-specific habitat assessments and distribution models.

AB  - Resources for addressing stream fish conservation issues are often limited and the stressors impacting fish continue to increase, so decision makers often rely on tools to prioritize locations for conservation actions. Because conservation networks already exist in many areas, incorporating these into the planning process can increase the ability of decision makers to carry out management actions. In this study we aim to identify priority areas within established networks to provide an approach which allows managers to focus efforts on the most valuable areas they control, while identifying areas outside of the network, which support species with minimal representation within the network, for acquisition or conservation partnerships. The goal of this approach is to prioritize sites to achieve high levels of species representation while also developing workable solutions. We applied a methodology incorporating established networks into a systematic conservation planning process for fish in temperate wadeable streams located in Missouri, USA. We compared how well species were represented in our approach with two commonly used alternatives: A blank slate approach which used the same systematic conservation planning technique but did not incorporate established networks, and a habitat integrity approach based solely on anthropogenic threat data. Relative to the blank slate approach, our approach required 210% more segments for representation of all species, and contained an average of 0.5 additional occurrences for the least well-represented species. Although the blank slate solution was more efficient in achieving species representation, 77% of segments in this solution were not already protected. This would likely pose a challenge for implementing conservation actions. Relative to habitat integrity-based priorities, our approach required only 38% of the number of stream segments to achieve representation of all species and contained an average of 5 additional occurrences of the least represented species, representing a substantial gain in representation. Incorporating established networks may allow managers to focus resources on areas with the greatest conservation value within established networks and to identify the most valuable areas complementary to the established networks, resulting in priorities which may be more actionable and effective than those developed by alternative approaches.

AB  - Species distribution data provide critical baseline information for conservation planning and decision making. However, in many of the Earth's most biodiverse regions, such data are lacking for many species. Here, we used ecological niche modeling and connectivity analyses to model distributions of endangered species and protected area connectivity across the Upper Guinea Forest (UGF) Global Conservation Hotspot of West Africa. We estimated the current distributions of African forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis (Vulnerable), western chimpanzee Pan troglodytes verus (Critically Endangered), and pygmy hippopotamus Choeropsis liberiensis (Endangered) across the region and optimized connectivity in two main forest complexes in the region. We used occurrence data for the period 2010-2016 for the three species from two well-sampled national parks in Liberia (Sapo National Park and Gola National Park), and remotely sensed MODIS enhanced vegetation index data for the period 2010-2015. Our models predicted a total of 75,157km(2) of suitable habitat for chimpanzees in the region, 79,400km(2) for elephants, and 290,696km(2) for hippos. Of these areas, for chimpanzees, 30% of the area predicted falls within the boundaries of proposed or designated protected areas, and likewise 30% for elephants, and 19% for hippos. Liberia had the largest blocks of contiguous forest suitable for these species compared to other countries in the region but this forest was largely unprotected. This study identifies priority areas for biodiversity conservation and forest connectivity in the region, and reemphasizes the practicality of these tools to optimize conservation planning and implementation.

Accurate EOO estimates are of great importance because they are used to assess conservation status. Topological methods, such as those proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are not able to estimate the geographical distribution of these species accurately because they do not consider the abiotic characteristics suitable to maintain viable populations. In this study, we propose the use of ecological niche models (ENMs) to estimate the EOO. We use the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm and the topological method suggested by IUCN (alpha-hull method) to estimate the EOO for a species with disjunct distribution and limited available data. The estimate obtained using the ENM was considered the most accurate because only areas with suitable abiotic conditions were taken into account Thus, analyses related to the conservation status of species become more accurate, especially when evaluating the effects of potential threats in the potential areas occupied by the taxon. The estimate obtained from ENM can also assist the design of conservation strategies for the species, by indicating areas for specific surveys and assessing changes in the EOO over time.

AB  - Conservation in Europe (including the establishment of protected areas) is undertaken mainly through legislation and on densely populated private land. Consequently, conflicts of interest arise between human economic activities and biodiversity conservation. We used a systematic approach to conservation planning to explore different conservation scenarios for the Apennine populations of wolves (Canis lupus) and bears (Ursus arctos marsicanus) in Italy. The conservation measures we considered were electrified fences and guard dogs to prevent wolves and bears from preying on sheep. We used habitat suitability models of the two species as an estimate of their distributions. Across the study area, we estimated the potential intensity of conflict caused by predation on sheep and the cost of the antipredator measures. We examined scenarios for the conservation of wolves and bears that identified systems of sites where antipredator measures should be applied to either minimize the economic cost of the plan or tackle a predetermined amount of conflict. The overall cost of the conservation plans ranged between (sic)1,486,000 and (sic)16,876,000, depending on the scenario and on the size of the conservation target. Because potential conflict intensity (i.e., potential predation) and cost of conflict resolution were correlated, the scenarios that minimized cost also minimized the amount of conflict that was addressed. Conserving these two species by addressing their predation on sheep was up to 4.36 times more expensive than conserving them by providing suitable habitat in areas of low conflict. Yet avoiding conflicts is not always desirable because it can drastically reduce the options for conservation. Choosing a conservation plan requires consideration of the level of threat to the target species and their sensitivity to conflicts.

AB  - Using IUCN Red List species as biodiversity surrogates, supplemented with additional analyses based on ecoregional diversity, priority areas for conservation in Mesoamerica, Choco, and the Tropical Andes were identified using the methods of systematic conservation planning. Species' ecological niches were modeled from occurrence records using a maximum entropy algorithm. Niche models for 78 species were refined to produce geographical distributions. Areas were prioritized for conservation attention using a complementarity-based algorithm implemented in the ResNet software package. Targets of representation for Red List species were explored from 10 to 90% of the modeled distributions at 10% increments; for the 53 ecoregions, the target was 10% for each ecoregion. Selected areas were widely dispersed across the region, reflecting the widespread distribution of Red List species in Mesoamerica, Choco, and the Tropical Andes, which underscores the region's importance for biodiversity. In general, existing protected areas were no more representative of biodiversity than areas outside them. Among the countries in the region, the protected areas of Belize performed best and those of Colombia and Ecuador worst. A high representation target led to the selection of a very large proportion of each country except Colombia and Ecuador (for a 90% target, 83-95% of each country was selected). Since such large proportions of land cannot realistically be set aside as parks or reserves, biodiversity conservation in Mesoamerica, Choco, and the Tropical Andes will require integrative landscape management which combines human use of the land with securing the persistence of biota.

AB  - Southeast Asian biodiversity is a global priority for conservation, due to the high levels of diversity and endemistn, combined with some of the greatest levels of threat. Conservation planning is essential to ensure that hotspots of biodiversity and endemism have the protection needed to prevent deforestation, hunting and other forms of exploitation in some of the Southeast Asia's most diverse areas, yet this requires data which in many cases does not exist.
   Growing volumes of online available data provides the ability to develop accurate models of species distributions, and gain new perspectives on regional diversity patterns and provide essential baseline data for planning and conservation.
   Here, using the best available information I develop maps of the ranges of 2471 vertebrate (birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians) and 1198 plant species, and explore patterns of biodiversity and the adequacy of protection. Each taxon shows different patterns of diversity, and no taxa provided an effective surrogate for diversity patterns in different groups. I show that for the majority of biodiversity hotspots fall outside protected areas, with between 10 and 55% of areas with at least >75% of the maximum number of species unprotected. The percentage of species ranges protected areas also varies by taxa, from a maximum of 40% to reptiles with a mean of only 13.5% of species ranges protected. Furthermore comparison between my predictions and IUCN maps of diversity differed greatly for all taxa examined, with IUCN hotspots covering a much larger portion of the region and potentially overestimating the ranges of many species. Further efforts are needed to better protect centres of diversity, and the inclusion of these methods into regional conservation planning may greatly assist in increasing the effectiveness of conservation.

AB  - Although well-studied vertebrates such as the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) are often used as focal species in regional conservation plans, range shifts associated with climate change may compromise this role. I used the Maxent (maximum entropy) method to develop NSO distribution models from data on NSO locations, forest age, and an ensemble of climate projections. NSO presence was positively associated with the proportion of old and mature forest at two spatial scales. Winter precipitation was the most important climate variable, consistent with previous studies suggesting negative effects on survival and recruitment. Model results suggest that initial niche expansion may be followed by a contraction as climate change intensifies, but this prediction is uncertain due to variability in predicted changes in precipitation between climate projections. Although new reserves created by the US Northwest Forest Plan prioritized areas with greater biological importance for the NSO than did pre-existing reserves, the latter areas, which lie predominantly at higher elevations, increase in importance under climate change. In contrast with previous analyses of the region's localized old-forest-associated species, vegetation rather than climate dominated NSO distribution models. Rigorous assessment of the implications of climate change for focal species requires development of dynamic vegetation models that incorporate effects of competitor species and altered disturbance regimes. The results suggest that, lacking such data, models that combine climate data with current data on habitat factors such as vegetation can inform conservation planning by providing less-biased estimates of potential range shifts than do niche models based on climate variables alone.

AB  - Phoneutria bahiensis Simo & Brescovit, 2001 is a large ctenid spider inhabiting the states of Bahia and Espirito Santo, Brazil. Considering that it is probably endemic, this species was included in the Brazilian red book of threatened species. Here, we predict the distribution range of P. bahiensis using 19 bioclimatic variables in the model design. The most septentrional record for this spider was indicated for northern Bahia. The model predicts that the distribution range covers the Atlantic Forest from the state of Paraiba to Rio de Janeiro, with the best suitable area in the Atlantic Forest of the state of Bahia. The bioclimatic variable with the best contribution to the model was precipitation in the driest quarter. Based on collected data, the species inhabits Ombrophilous Forests and Restinga vegetation, two ecosystems of the Atlantic Forest biome. In the best-predicted area of distribution, eleven Conservation Units were included. This information could be considered for future conservation plans of this species.

AB  - The world's ecosystems are altered to different extents by anthropogenic activities. Marine habitats, especially coastal areas, are subjected to an increasing pressure derived from human activities on both land and ocean. Information about species distribution is fundamental to develop effective conservation and management measures and counteract negative anthropogenic impacts. The present work explores the use of species distribution models by using the Environmental Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) to assess the habitat suitability of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in Northwest Spain, and its application to the development of effective conservation and management measures. The relationship between presence-only data and ecogeographical variables (EGV) was used to assess the potential distribution of the species. Data was collected during 273 days at sea, covering a total distance of 9 417 km between March 2014 and October 2017 with a total of 91 common dolphin encounters. This study shows that tide level and sea surface salinity are the main EGVs driving the distribution of the species in coastal areas especially in waters above the continental shelf. Additionally, this study reveals the most suitable habitats for common dolphin and outlines the need to develop conservation measures and management plans to promote the protection of this species. Findings of the study contribute to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the common dolphin distribution and emphasize the importance of species distribution models in the development of effective conservation and management strategies.

AB  - In a review of recent challenges in conservation planning, Ferrier (2002) proposed the incorporation of models of similarity in species composition as a means for prioritizing areas for biodiversity conservation. A key assumption of this approach is that estimates of compositional similarity derived from models of similarity in species composition can be used as effective surrogates for real similarity data. We used data on snail distribution in Israel to test this assumption. We used two types of models to analyze patterns of similarity in species composition. one based on presence/absence data and the second based on abundance data. Both models accounted for large amounts of The observed variation in compositional similarity. Variation-partitioning analysis indicated that a considerable amount of the variation in compositional similarity could be separated into "pure" geographical versus "pure" environmental components, indicating that reserve selection procedures should take into account spatial considerations in determining priorities for conservation. The relative effects of geographical versus environmental factors varied between the two types of models, indicating that different indices of similarity should. be used if one wishes to represent species composition per se or ecological communities including their relative species abundances. A comparison of distribution patterns of land snails and land birds in a subset of the study sites revealed a high degree of congruence in compositional similarity between the two groups. Moreover, compositional similarity in snails was a better predictor of compositional similarity in birds compared with all environmental and geographical distances taken together Models calibrated based on delta collected in small plots explained a considerable amount of the variation observed at larger scales, suggesting that sampling efforts required for conservation planning might be lower (and thus, more feasible) than assumed previously Models of similarity in species composition may serve as all important tool for conservation planning.

AB  - When identifying conservation priorities, the accuracy of conservation assessments is constrained by the quality of data available. Despite previous efforts exploring how to deal with imperfect datasets, little is known about how data uncertainty translates into errors in conservation planning outcomes. Here, we evaluate the magnitude of commission and omission error, effectiveness and efficiency of conservation planning outcomes derived from three datasets with increasing data quality. We demonstrate that investing in data acquisition might not always be the best strategy as the magnitude of errors introduced by new sites/species can exceed the benefits gained. There was a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency due to poorly sampled rare species. Given that data acquisition is limited by the high cost and time required, we recommend focusing on improving the quality of data for those species with the highest level of uncertainty (rare species) when acquiring new data.

AB  - Endemic marine species are useful in determining and evaluating areas for conservation. Particularly Warm Temperate Province of the Northeast Pacific (WTPNP) includes priority conservation areas, but records of endemic marine species are limited, their distributions remains generally unknown, and often excluded in extant conservation plans. Within the WTPNP, the Balandra Protected Natural Area (BPNA) is located within La Paz Bay, and it is the only management area with a developed plan. However, marine endemic fish species have not been fully considering, and their protection status requires a re-evaluation, particularly the distribution of species with adequate spatial resolution. Despite the scarce information on marine endemic fishes, ecological niche modelling allows predicting distribution areas through occurrences of the species and their relationship with a set of scenopoetic environmental variables. The abiotically suitable areas based of the endemic marine fish species within the WTPNP documented within the Bay of La Paz were modeled and the high-value areas for conservation were established through a multi-species models; these spatial patterns of suitable areas were contrasted with the current state of fish protection. Modelling was performed with the Maxent software supplied with presence-only data of 18 species and four sets of environmental layers related to the geomorphology and bottom sedimentology, as well as the Euclidean distance measures from mangrove and rocky shore habitats. We generated sixteen distribution models that revealed that only 8.4 % of the predicted area, on average, was located within a maximum state of protection within the BPNA core zone. Moreover, the generated multi-species model reveals that only 17 % of the high-value areas (? 9 species/hectare) were located in the core zone. These high-value areas indicate updating the current management program is required. Finally, the study illustrates how the predicted-areas can be linked to conservation strategies in the marine habitat space within and outside the BPNA.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed to support conservation decision making. However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on-ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision-making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision-making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers need to provide feedback to modellers regarding the actual use of SDMs to support conservation decisions. This could be facilitated by individuals or institutions playing the role of translators' between modellers and decision makers. We encourage species distribution modellers to get involved in real decision-making processes that will benefit from their technical input; this strategy has the potential to better bridge theory and practice, and contribute to improve both scientific knowledge and conservation outcomes.

AB  - In this study, we describe the distribution pattern of bat species and select priority areas for the conservation of the Cerrado based on a systematic planning approach. We estimated species richness and calculated the total beta diversity based on Sorensen's dissimilarity index (beta sor). We estimated the species turnover using Simpson's dissimilarity index (beta sim). We then evaluated the nesting (beta sne) by the difference between the dissimilarity indices (beta sor and beta sim). Based on this analysis, we identified the priority areas for the conservation of bats in the Cerrado based on the zonation approach. We found that the species richness and beta diversity of bats in the Cerrado are concentrated primarily in the central and northern portions of the biome. We also discovered that the conservation units of the Cerrado are ineffective for the protection of species with a restricted distribution (<= 150 grid cells), such as Vampyrum spectrum, for which we propose the creation of new conservation units that better cover the diversity patterns observed in the present study. By conserving this diversity, we will also be protecting local habitats, which will in turn enable the survival of a wide range of species, and provide the ecosystems with the capacity to respond adequately to future changes in the environment.

AB  - ContextAccurate spatiotemporal modeling of roadkill hotspots is essential for the assessment of high risk roadkill locations. Increasing the spatiotemporal resolution of models may facilitate greater cost-effective solutions for roadkill mitigation strategies.ObjectiveThis study develops a novel spatiotemporal roadkill distribution model to simulate roadkill probability. Moreover, we systematically identify top prioritized road segments by the most frequent roadkill occurrence for multiple focal species.MethodsBased on the theory of the Poisson process, the proposed spatiotemporal roadkill distribution model with seasonal effects is validated with four focal reptilian species. The model simulates spatiotemporal roadkill patterns and addresses uncertainty by referencing ensemble species distribution models. Finally, we systematically prioritize road segments by the most frequent roadkill occurrence for multiple focal species.ResultsThe efficacy of the proposed spatiotemporal roadkill distribution model which is validated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accurate proportions. The AUC values based independent roadkill data tests ranged from 0.73 to 0.84. Both the efficacy of the proposed model, and the increases in uncertainty are attributable to decreasing seasonal sampling size and variation. Based on the independent roadkill data, more than 70% of roadkill events occurred within the top 30% priority segments by our approaches.ConclusionsThe proposed model is successfully applied in simulation of spatiotemporal roadkill probability. The seasonal effects benefit identification of high roadkill probability. Through the systematic identification and the proposed model, our approach provides useful information for the design of cost-effective surveys and appropriate conservation planning and mitigation strategies.

AB  - Global biodiversity is declining rapidly, posing a severe threat to ecosystem functions and services. Protected Areas (PAs) can be extremely effective in protecting biodiversity, but conservation gaps arise as a result of poor consideration of land-use change and its impacts, and of integrated planning based on representative ecological indicators. New approaches are available to identify conservation priorities for new comprehensive PAs and ensure that endangered species are effectively protected, we used the Habitat Quality module in the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, and the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model to assess a protected area in Xishuangbanna tropical area, China. The results revealed unprotected biodiversity hotspots occupying a total area of 4669.60 km(2), or 24.37% of the total area of Xishuangbanna, including a key conservation gap of 1228.85 km(2) (6.08% of total area). The conservation priorities outside PAs were mainly distributed in north-east Xishuangbanna, followed by the south-east (scattered distribution). This indicates that existing PAs do not offer adequate protection for local biodiversity. Our combined modeling (MaxEnt-InVEST) framework proved successful in creating maps of conservation gaps of biodiversity hotspots based on actual species distribution data and can consider current land uses. For well-targeted organized planning in local PAs, obligations and objectives of international agreements need to be met and scientific interventions for protecting key habitats of the endangered species need to be delineated. We also identified a need for incorporating reliable monitoring and management networks into global biodiversity assessment and conservation.

AB  - Climate change is affecting biodiversity worldwide, but conservation responses are constrained by considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude, rate and ecological consequences of expected climate change. Here we propose a framework to account for several sources of uncertainty in conservation prioritization. Within this framework we account for uncertainties arising from (i) species distributions that shift following climate change, (ii) basic connectivity requirements of species, (iii) alternative climate change scenarios and their impacts, (iv) in the modelling of species distributions, and (v) different levels of confidence about present and future. When future impacts of climate change are uncertain, robustness of decision-making can be improved by quantifying the risks and trade-offs associated with climate scenarios. Sensible prioritization that accounts simultaneously for the present and potential future distributions of species is achievable without overly jeopardising present-day conservation values. Doing so requires systematic treatment of uncertainties and testing of the sensitivity of results to assumptions about climate. We illustrate the proposed framework by identifying priority areas for amphibians and reptiles in Europe.

AB  - Potential geographical distribution of American species of "fiddler crab" (Uca spp.) (Crustacea, Decapoda) based on ecological niche model. The genus Uca Leach, 1814 (fiddler-crabs) is a well-know group characterized by a marked sexual dimorphism. Worldwide, there are 97 species of fiddler crabs described. Here, we predicted the potential geographical distribution of four species of this genus (Uca maracoani Latreille, 1802-1803, U. uruguayensis Nobili, 1901, U. panacea Novak & Salmon, 1974 e U. monilifera Rathbun, 1914), which occur in the American continent coast. Data used in the modeling were compiled from occurrence records available in the literature. We used Maxent and GARP programs for modelling, 10 climatic variables and three topographical variables. All variables were converted to a grid resolution of 0.0417 degrees. In both Maxent and GARP models the predicted geographical distribution of the species was larger than suggested by other observed data works, except for U. monilifera. According to the AUC criterion, the models generated by GARP were better than those obtained from Maxent. Evaluating the two models together, it is recommended conservation plans for species with restricted habitat (U. panaceae and U. monilifera) besides suggesting sampling of U. maracoani in the Brazilian northeast and U. uruguyaensis in the Brazilian southeast.

AB  - Mapping suitable habitat is an important process in wildlife conservation planning. Species distribution reflects habitat selection processes occurring across multiple spatio-temporal scales. Because habitat selection may be driven by different factors at different scales, conservation planners require information at the scale of the intervention to plan effective management actions. Previous research has described habitat selection processes shaping the distribution of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) at the range-wide scale. Finer-scale information for applications within jurisdictional units inside the species range is lacking, yet necessary, because state wildlife agencies are the management authority for sage-grouse in the United States. We quantified seasonal second-order habitat selection for sage-grouse across the state of Utah to produce spatio-temporal predictions of their distribution at the southern periphery of the species range. We used location data obtained from sage-grouse marked with very-high-frequency radio-transmitters and lek location data collected between 1998 and 2013 to quantify species habitat selection in relation to a suite of topographic, edaphic, climatic, and anthropogenic variables using random forest algorithms. Sage-grouse selected for greater sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) cover, higher elevations, and gentler slopes and avoided lower precipitations and higher temperatures. The strength of responses to habitat variables varied across seasons. Anthropogenic variables previously reported as affecting their range-wide distribution (i.e., roads, powerlines, communication towers, and agricultural development) were not ranked as top predictors at our focal scale. Other than strong selection for sagebrush cover, the responses we observed differed from what has been reported at the range-wide scale. These differences likely reflect the unique climatic, geographic, and topographic context found in the southern peripheral area of the species distribution compared to range-wide environmental gradients. Our results highlight the importance of considering appropriateness of scale when planning conservation actions for wide-ranging species.

AB  - Abiotic and biologically informed classifications are often used in conservation planning as coarse-filter surrogates for species. The relationship between these surrogates and the distribution of species is commonly assumed, but rarely assessed by planners. We derived four abiotic and eight biologically informed classifications of stream reaches to serve as surrogates for biodiversity patterns in the Wet Tropics bioregion, Queensland, Australia. We used stream reaches as planning units and, as conservation targets for each surrogate, we used two percentages - 10% and 30% - of the total stream reach length occupied by each class. We then derived minimum sets of planning units to meet targets for each surrogate and tested the effectiveness of the surrogates by calculating the average achievement of the same targets for predicted distributions of 28 fish species. Our results showed that neither abiotic nor biologically informed classifications were good at representing freshwater fish species; in fact none of the surrogates led to average representation of species better than randomly selected planning units. There were two main reasons for this poor performance. First, none of the surrogates had high classification strength or informativeness about compositional change in fish species within the study region. Second, frequency distributions of probabilities of occurrence for most fish species were strongly right-skewed, with few stream reaches having high probabilities. Combined, these results meant that selection of stream reaches to achieve surrogate targets was effectively random with respect to probabilities of fish species occurrence, leading to poor representation of fish species. We conclude there is a limited basis for using coarse-filter surrogates to represent freshwater fish diversity in this region, and that there is a clear need for research in this as well as other regions if planners are to understand the limitations associated with coarse-filter surrogates for representing freshwater biodiversity more broadly.

AB  - Ecuador will experience a significant expansion of the oil industry in its Amazonian region, one of the most biodiverse areas of the world. In view of the changes that are about to come, we explore the conflicts between oil extraction interests and biodiversity protection and apply systematic conservation planning to identify priority areas that should be protected in different oil exploitation scenarios. First, we quantified the current extent of oil blocks and protected zones and their overlap with two biodiversity indicators: 25 ecosystems and 745 species (whose distributions were estimated via species distribution models). With the new scheme of oil exploitation, oil blocks cover 68% (68,196 km(2)) of the Ecuadorian Amazon; half of it occupied by new blocks open for bids in the southern Amazon. This region is especially vulnerable to biodiversity losses, because peaks of species diversity, 19 ecosystems, and a third of its protected zones coincide spatially with oil blocks. Under these circumstances, we used Marxan software to identify priority areas for conservation outside oil blocks, but their coverage was insufficient to completely represent biodiversity. Instead, priority areas that include southern oil blocks provide a higher representation of biodiversity indicators. Therefore, preserving the southern Amazon becomes essential to improve the protection of Amazonian biodiversity in Ecuador, and avoiding oil exploitation in these areas (33% of the extent of southern oil blocks) should be considered a conservation alternative. Also, it is highly recommended to improve current oil exploitation technology to reduce environmental impacts in the region, especially within five oil blocks that we identified as most valuable for the conservation of biodiversity. The application of these and other recommendations depends heavily on the Ecuadorian government, which needs to find a better balance between the use of the Amazon resources and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - 1. The combined effects of climate change and other factors, such as land-use change or fire disturbance, pose daunting challenges for biodiversity conservation world-wide.
   2. We predicted the future effectiveness of the Natura 2000 (N2000), the current network of protected areas (PA) in Europe, at maintaining and representing suitable environmental conditions for a set of 79 bird species between 2000 and 2050 in a fire-prone area, strongly affected by land abandonment processes in North East Spain. We then compared PA performance with a set of alternative priority areas for conservation, which consider fire-vegetation dynamics, selected by using a conservation planning tool (MARXAN). Fire-vegetation dynamics were modelled using a process-based model (MEDFIRE MODEL) under alternative fire management and climate change scenarios. Bird communities were predicted using the spatially explicit species assemblage modelling framework (SESAM) and species distribution models that hierarchically integrate climate change and wildfire-vegetation dynamics.
   3. The amount of suitable environmental conditions within the N2000 network was predicted to fall by around 15%, on average, over the next decades in relation to the initial conditions but could be partially modulated by fire management policies in future. The efficiency of the current PA system was predicted to decrease from 17.4% to 15% between 2000 and 2050. However, a more efficient PA system could be achieved with a conservation planning approach that explicitly considers fire-vegetation dynamics and their management.

AB  - The common pheasant is listed as a nationally protected species in Iran because it faces many threats such as habitat destruction, pollution from pesticides and overhunting. The species' habitat selection remains unknown in Iran; consequently, conservation planning for the species is hampered by this lack of information. In this study we used predictor variables including topographic, anthropogenic, land cover and climate and 122 occurrence points to model the distribution of common pheasant (subspecies P. c. talischensis), in Gilan province, Iran. The results showed that distance to agriculture and orchards as well as distance to plantation forests were the most important variables in predicting species distribution. Furthermore, we found that the total potential suitable habitat for the species in Gilan province is 315,990 hectares. We observed a shift of the species to higher altitudes in the province. We recommend raising awareness about the presence of the species especially among private landowners, creating a network of protected areas on private land, and changing land-use policies at the provincial level as essential measures for the conservation of the species in Gilan province. Our results can be applied to management and conservation of the species in other modified or rapidly changing landscapes.

AB  - Changes in future climate will alter the geographic distributions of many species. Species distribution models have evolved as a powerful tool for predicting potential species distributions and assessing habitat suitability. The Asian Great Bustard (Otis tarda dybowskii), a long-distance migratory bird, is listed as a globally threatened species and is highly dependent on farmlands during the wintering period. In this study, 78 occurrence points and 15 environmental variables were used to estimate the potential distribution under current conditions and four future climate scenarios by using the maximum entropy model. With current climatic conditions, the highly suitable areas of wintering Asian Great Bustard in China were mainly concentrated on the Northeast Plain, Guanzhong Plain, and North China Plain (33-48 degrees N, 109-127 degrees E). Under future climatic scenarios, the geographic distribution of wintering Asian Great Bustard would remain stable, and the total area of suitable habitats would increase to varying degrees until the end of this century. Our results can be used to define highly suitable areas for conservation management plans for this threatened species.

AB  - The objective of this work was to determine the potential distribution of Lychnophora pohlli in Minas Gerais during climatic fluctuations in the Quaternary, in addition to identifying the area of coverage of the species in Conservation Units. The Maxent algorithm was selected to relate the occurrence of the species with bioclimatic variables that reflect different temperature, precipitation and seasonality conditions. The models were validated by AUC index and the influence of the variables on the distribution of the species were evaluated by the Jackknife test. The resulting maps provide areas of restricted occurrence for the species, occurring in a portion of the Serra do Espinhaco. The models showed environmentally adequate reduction of the Holocene species for the current period and a considerable increase from the present to the future. The models showed excellent performance, since the AUC values ranged from 0,971 - 0,997. The modeling of species distribution has proved to be useful in providing contributions to the study of ecological issues on the species distribution, besides being an important tool for biodiversity conservation plans. It is recommended to use other microclimatic variables that may contribute to the prediction and interpretation of the geographic distribution of endemic species.

AB  - Quantifying habitat use is important for understanding how animals meet their requirements for survival and provides information for conservation planning. Currently, assessments of range-wide habitat use that delimit species distributions are incomplete for many taxa. The Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja) is a raptor of conservation concern, widely distributed across Neotropical lowland forests, that currently faces threats from habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we use penalized logistic regression to identify species-habitat associations and predict habitat suitability based on a new International Union for the Conservation of Nature range metric, termed Area of Habitat. From the species-habitat model, we performed a gap analysis to identify areas of high habitat suitability in regions with limited coverage in the key biodiversity area (KBA) network. Range-wide habitat use indicated that Harpy Eagles prefer areas of 70%-75% evergreen forest cover, low elevation, and high vegetation species richness. Conversely, Harpy Eagles avoid areas of >10% cultivated landcover and mosaic forest, and topographically complex areas. Our species-habitat model identified a large continuous area of potential habitat across the pan-Amazonia region, and a habitat corridor from the Choco-Darien ecoregion of Colombia running north along the Caribbean coast of Central America. Little habitat was predicted across the Atlantic Forest biome, which is now severely degraded. The current KBA network covered 18% of medium to high Harpy Eagle habitat exceeding a target biodiversity area representation of 10%, based on species range size. Four major areas of high suitability habitat lacking coverage in the KBA network were identified in north and west Colombia, western Guyana, and north-west Brazil. We recommend these multiple gaps of habitat as new KBAs for strengthening the current KBA network. Modeled area of habitat estimates as described here is a useful tool for large-scale conservation planning and can be readily applied to many taxa.

AB  - Tropical timber production forests have the potential to harbour many species, but landscape-level management strategies for minimizing extinctions are lacking. To develop relevant conservation guidelines, we investigated how harvest plans with different spatiotemporal patterns affected the persistence of sessile species with different traits and preharvest characteristics. We confronted this problem via an individual-based simulation model. We explored several harvest plans with different levels of spatiotemporal aggregation, but equivalent total harvest area, and found that extinction probabilities for each plan varied with species traits and predisturbance characteristics. Most notably, plans with large contiguous harvest units yielded particularly high extinction probabilities for dispersal-limited habitat specialists with clustered preharvest distributions. Differences between plans were small for some types of species, but highly aggregated plans yielded the highest extinction rates for all extinction-prone groups.Synthesis and applications. Our simulations suggest that reducing the size of contiguous harvest units, even while total harvest area remains constant, may reduce extinction rates in tropical production forests (assuming that road-related threats can be effectively managed). Our findings have important implications for tropical conservation efforts and also provide general insight into the compositional effects of disturbances with different spatiotemporal characteristics.

AB  - Hotspots are priority marine or terrestrial areas with high biodiversity where delineation is essential for conservation, but equally important is their linkage to the environmental policies of the overall region. In this study, fish diversity presences were linked to abiotic conditions and different habitat types to reveal multi-species and hotspots models predicted by ecological niche modelling methods within the Bay of La Paz, Mexico (south of Gulf of California). The abiotically suitable areas for 217 fish species were identified based on historical (1975-2020) presence data sets and a set of environmental layers related to distances from mangroves and rocky shores habitats, marine substrate, and bottom geomorphology conditions. Hotspot model distribution was delineated from a multi-species model identifying areas with >= 60 species per hectare and was compared to the marine conservation areas such Balandra Protected Natural Area (BPNA), illustrating how these models can be applied to improve the local regulatory framework. The results indicate that (1) there is a need for the BPNA to be enlarged to capture more of the delineated hotspot areas, and thus an update to the management plan will be required, (2) new conservation areas either adjacent or outside of the established BPNA should be established, or (3) Ramsar sites or other priority areas should be subject to legal recognition and a management plan decreed so that these vital habitats and fish diversity can be better protected.

AB  - The wolf is naturally recolonizing the Alpine range. Potentially, eight different countries are affected, clearly calling for transboundary management planning. In this framework, using the partitioned Mahalanobis distance, and considering environmental, anthropogenic, and biotic variables, we produced a model of the potential distribution of the wolf over the Alpine range, accounting for the ecological characteristics of the species and for the lack of equilibrium in the current distribution. Low human population density, increasing distance from infrastructures, intermediate elevations and high prey-species richness were the most important factors in predicting wolf presence, followed by the presence of natural land-covers. Based on the projections of our model, we predicted a large availability of high suitability areas across the entire alpine range, which promises great potential for wolf range expansion in the near future. Moreover, protected areas cover 47% of the high suitability areas, and many may act in the future as source habitat patches across the entire alpine region. Our model provides a useful planning tool to develop, evaluate and implement transboundary conservation and management interventions at a broad, biologically meaningful scale across the entire Alpine range. By depicting the potential species distribution in the Alps, our model will aid regional and local managers to design proactive approaches to wolf conservation, especially in areas that have not yet been colonized by the species.

AB  - Biodiversity, regulating ecosystem services (RES), and vegetation productivity are key indicators to instruct natural conservation planning. Decision makers often hope that ecosystems can be protected by focusing on certain key indicators, which requires an understanding of the relationships between the indicators. Using individual case studies, many have argued that these indicators commonly have significant relationships. However, these relationships at different spatial scales are unclear. Therefore, in this study, biodiversity and ecosystem services are modelled by the ecological niche model, the universal soil loss equation, and the equation of water balance in two study areas at different scales. The influence of vegetation productivity on the spatial pattern of other ecological indicators in the two areas is examined by a spatial lag model. The contributions of the driving factors on biodiversity distribution at both scales are identified by a boosted regression tree (BRT) model. The results showed that at the fine scale, the spatial correlations were strongest for species richness, especially mammalian species richness, and water retention. However, biodiversity had no significant relationship with vegetation productivity. In contrast, at a coarser scale, the correlation was stronger between plant diversity and regulating ecosystem services. In addition, plant diversity was significantly correlated with vegetation productivity. These differences between scales were controlled by various explanatory variables. At the fine scale, biophysical and climatic factors had the strongest effects on biodiversity distribution, while Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and ecoregion also had relatively high influences on biodiversity at the coarse scale. This demonstrates the critical importance of spatial scale in selecting conservation indicators. We suggest that rare mammalian species richness or flagship mammal species are suitable as conservation surrogates in fine-scale conservation planning. However, at a coarser scale, selecting vegetation patches with more rare plant species and high productivity for each ecoregion is a workable alternative method for conservation planning.

AB  - ContextOrganisations acting to conserve and protect species across large spatial scales prioritise to optimise use of resources. Spatial conservation prioritization tools typically focus on identifying areas containing species groups of interest, with few tools used to identify the best areas for single-species conservation, in particular, to conserve currently widespread but declining species.ObjectiveA single-species prioritization framework, based on temporal and spatial patterns of occupancy and abundance, was developed to spatially prioritize conservation action for widespread species by identifying smaller areas to work within to achieve predefined conservation objectives.MethodsWe demonstrate our approach for 29 widespread bird species in the UK, using breeding bird atlas data from two periods to define distribution, relative abundance and change in relative abundance. We selected occupied 10-km squares with abundance trends that matched species conservation objectives relating to maintaining or increasing population size or range, and then identified spatial clusters of squares for each objective using a Getis-Ord-Gi* or near neighbour analysis.ResultsFor each species, the framework identified clusters of 20-km squares that enabled us to identify small areas in which species recovery action could be prioritized.ConclusionsOur approach identified a proportion of species' ranges to prioritize for species recovery. This approach is a relatively quick process that can be used to inform single-species conservation for any taxa if sufficiently fine-scale occupancy and abundance information is available for two or more time periods. This is a relatively simple first step for planning single-species focussed conservation to help optimise resource use.

AB  - Objectives
   Detailed and reliable information about the spatial distribution of species provides important information for species conservation management, especially in the case of rare species of conservation interest. We aimed to study the consequences of climate change on geographical distributions of the tertiary rare tree species Thuja sutchuenensis Franch. (Cupressaceae) to provide reference for conservation management of this species, including priority area selection for introduction and cultivation of the species. We expect that this approach could be promising in predicting the potential distribution of other rare tree species, and as such can be an effective tool in rare tree species restoration and conservation planning, especially species with narrow distribution or raw presence-only occurrence data.
   Methods
   107 records covering the whole distribution range of T. sutchuenensis in the Daba Mountains were obtained during a 3-year field survey. The principle of maximum entropy (Maxent) was used to model the species' potential distribution area under paleoclimate, current and future climate background.
   Results
   The Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 0.998, which is higher than 0.5 of a null model; The location of the potential distribution for the last interglacial period is in southeastern China, with the largest optimal habitat area being only 1666 km(2). In other periods, the central location of the potential distribution is accordant with the real present distribution, but the model's predicted optimal habitat area is outside the current distribution.
   Conclusions
   Our findings can be applied in various ways such as the identification of additional localities where T. sutchuenensis may already exist, but has not yet been detected; the recognition of localities where it is likely to spread to; the priority selection area for introduction and cultivation and the conservation management of such rare tree species.

AB  - Data on geographical ranges are essential when defining the conservation status of a species, and in evaluating levels of human disturbance. Where locality data are deficient, presence-only ecological niche modelling (ENM) can provide insights into a species' potential distribution, and can aid in conservation planning. Presence-only ENM is especially important for rare, cryptic and nocturnal species, where absence is difficult to define. Here we applied ENM to carry out an anthropogenic risk assessment and set conservation priorities for three threatened species of Asian slow loris (Primates: Nycticebus).
   Borneo, Java and Sumatra, Southeast Asia.
   Distribution models were built using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) ENM. We input 20 environmental variables comprising temperature, precipitation and altitude, along with species locality data. We clipped predicted distributions to forest cover and altitudinal data to generate remnant distributions. These were then applied to protected area (PA) and human land-use data, using specific criteria to define low-, medium- or high-risk areas. These data were analysed to pinpoint priority study sites, suitable reintroduction zones and protected area extensions.
   A jackknife validation method indicated highly significant models for all three species with small sample sizes (n = 10 to 23 occurrences). The distribution models represented high habitat suitability within each species' geographical range. High-risk areas were most prevalent for the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus) on Java, with the highest proportion of low-risk areas for the Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis) on Borneo. Eighteen PA extensions and 23 priority survey sites were identified across the study region.
   Discriminating areas of high habitat suitability lays the foundations for planning field studies and conservation initiatives. This study highlights potential reintroduction zones that will minimize anthropogenic threats to animals that are released. These data reiterate the conclusion of previous research, showing MaxEnt is a viable technique for modelling species distributions with small sample sizes.

AB  - Neotropical dry forests (NDF) are widely distributed and possess important levels of species richness and endemism; however, they are considered a highly endangered ecosystem. Today, the protected areas network (PM) located within NDF covers < 10% of the total forests' extent; and it's still unknown if PM adequately represent its biodiversity. Thus, we selected 695 bird species associated to NDF and used ZONATION software to assess the species distribution's representativeness within the PM network. Additionally, we defined priority conservation areas to strategically expand the current PM considering the most important human pressures. Current PM cover only 8.4% of NDF and represent on average similar to 10% of the total distribution of avifauna inhabiting these forests. Approximately 19% of NDF's birds possess < 5% of their distribution represented in PM, from which similar to 13% have < 1% of their ranges protected. Further, similar to 77% of the most-priority species (i.e. with restricted range and categorized as threatened) possess < 10% of their distribution protected. However, our results pointed out great possibilities to improve the picture. By considering our prioritization, the protection coverage would increase to 17% to match the Aichi targets and would substantially increase the representativeness values, covering on average > 36% the ranges of all species and, particularly, 62% for the most-priority species. Priority conservation areas identified are mainly distributed in Peru (23.1%), Brazil (21.3%), Ecuador (18.8%), and Bolivia (11.4%). Our novel results represent an important step to guide future establishment of new and efficient conservation areas across the NDF.

AB  - Assumptions about factors such as climate in shaping species' realized and potential distributions underlie much of conservation planning and wildlife management. Climate and climatic change lead to shifts in species distributions through both direct and indirect ecological pressures. Distributional shifts may be particularly important if range overlap is altered between interacting species, or between species and protected areas. The cattle family (Bovidae) represents a culturally, economically, and ecologically important taxon that occupies many of the world's rangelands. In contemporary North America, five wild bovid species inhabit deserts, prairies, mountains, and tundra from Mexico to Greenland. Here, we aim to understand how future climate change will modify environmental characteristics associated with North American bovid species relative to the distribution of extant protected areas. We fit species distribution models for each species to climate, topography, and land cover data using observations from a citizen science dataset. We then projected modeled distributions to the end of the 21st century for each bovid species under two scenarios of anticipated climate change. Modeling results suggest that suitable habitat will shift inconsistently across species and that such shifts will lead to species-specific variation in overlap between potential habitat and existing protected areas. Furthermore, projected overlap with protected areas was sensitive to the warming scenario under consideration, with diminished realized protected area under greater warming. Conservation priorities and designation of new protected areas should account for ecological consequences of climate change.

AB  - Mexico is considered a country of biological megadiversity because of its exceptional species richness and endemism. However, much of Mexico's biodiversity is under threat due to a variety of factors, in particular, habitat loss. The Mexican legal standard (Norma Oficial Mexicana; NOM-ECOL-059-2010) uses four criteria to analyze species extinction risk at a national scale. However, when prioritizing areas for biodiversity conservation it is also important to incorporate knowledge of the conservation status of species at a more localized scale (regional, state, or municipal levels) for identifying possible risks associated with population declines. This paper focuses on Guerrero, which is the fourth most biologically diverse state in Mexico. The total extent of the conservation areas in Guerrero is low, amounting to 0.09% of its total area. We analyzed data for 582 terrestrial vertebrate species in Guerrero (53 amphibians, 115 reptiles, 334 birds and 80 mammals), modeling their potential distribution using a maximum entropy algorithm, and 114,555 occurrence records, and 23 predictive environmental (19 climatic and four topographical) variables. The portion of the potential distribution for each species including only remnant natural habitat was designated as its predicted distribution. The area of the predicted distribution was used to compute the fraction of natural habitat remaining for each species overlapping within decreed protected areas at the state and national levels, that is, for Guerrero and all of Mexico. Results show significant differences in the fraction of species' predicted distribution and species' potential distribution at different scales (state and national) and differences between the vertebrate groups analyzed. Because quantitative conservation targets are typically set for individual species, this exercise enables an analysis of the impact of the habitat lost on each species' distribution by assessing the fraction of its predicted distribution that coincides with protected areas. We conclude that this must be part of systematic conservation planning to prioritize areas for potential conservation in Guerrero. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Identifying conservation strategy is essential regarding prioritization, planning, and managing biodiversity. The Eastern Himalayan freshwater reaches contain diverse taxa of fish species. Despite having several coarse scales of assessment, the information regarding the fine-scale conservation priorities is scanty. The development of indices from multimeric attributes has been proved efficient, aiding conservation planning, in-depth research, exploitation, policy-making, and public awareness. Therefore, this study aims to provide detailed indexing of conservation values for the freshwater fish species inhabiting the sub-Himalayan Terai-Dooars ecoregion of the Eastern Himalayas. Based on three years of extended sampling in six freshwater reaches, 170 indigenous fish species were identified. Each fish species was assigned a discrete conservation value following their rarity, taxonomic singularity, contribution to beta diversity, global threat status, regional importance, and maximal achievable body lengths. Neolissochilus hexagonolepis has the highest conservation value. In contrast, the lowest values were observed for Pethia gelius, Pethia guganio, and Pethia phutunio. The freshwater habitats of upper and lower elevation harbor essential fish species for conservation, driven by precipitation, topographic, and land cover variability. Such results were accomplished through spatial interpolation and prioritization regarding fish conservation, protection, and vulnerability toward the human footprint for this region of the Eastern Himalayas.

AB  - To protect the unique and rich biodiversity of the Southern Ocean, conservation measures such as marine protected areas (MPAs) have been implemented. Currently, the establishment of several additional protection zones is being considered based on the known habitat distributions of key species of the ecosystems including emperor penguins and other marine top predators. However, the distribution of such species at sea is often insufficiently sampled. Specifically, current distribution models focus on the habitat range of adult animals and neglect that immatures and juveniles can inhabit different areas. By tracking eight juvenile emperor penguins in the Weddell Sea over 1 year and performing a meta-analysis including previously known data from other colonies, we show that conservation efforts in the Southern Ocean are insufficient for protecting this highly mobile species, and particularly its juveniles. We find that juveniles spend approximately 90% of their time outside the boundaries of proposed and existing MPAs, and that their distribution extends beyond (greater than 1500 km) the species' extent of occurrence as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Our data exemplify that strategic conservation plans for the emperor penguin and other long-lived ecologically important species should consider the dynamic habitat range of all age classes.

AB  - In the context of the global climate and biodiversity crises, forecasting the effectiveness of Protected Areas (PAs) and forest management to conserve biodiversity in the long-term is a high priority, especially in threatened environments. By combining distribution models and conservation planning protocols, we analyzed the effect of global climate and agriculture-linked activities in the long-term conservation opportunities of one most threatened deforestation hotspots: the South American Gran Chaco. We showed that assessing the effects of each driver of global change individually, promotes inaccurate long-term policies in deforestation hotspots. Our future scenarios indicated a low impact of climate change on the species distributions when it was analyzed individually. However, its effects were strongly exacerbated when both drivers of threat were combined in the same analyses, strongly diminishing conservation opportunities in the region: more than 50% of the remaining species' distribution and hotspot areas could be lost in the near future. In this dramatic context, we identified important opportunities to improve the level of long-term protection by increasing at least 5.6% the protection coverage and placing PAs strategically. It is imperative policymakers promote policies to generate a long-term improvement of conservation areas that are resilient to both threats as soon as possible for these threatened environments.

AB  - Baseline data on the distribution and extent of biogenic habitat-forming species at a high spatial resolution are essential to inform habitat management strategies, preserve ecosystem integrity, and achieve effective conservation objectives in the nearshore. Model-based approaches to map suitable habitat for these species are a key tool to address this need, filling in gaps where observations are otherwise unavailable and remote sensing methods are limited by turbid waters or cannot be applied at scale. We developed a high resolution (35 m) ensemble species distribution model to predict the distribution of eelgrass (Zostera marina) along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, Canada where the observational coverage of eelgrass occurrence is sparse and nearshore waters are optically complex. Our ensemble model was derived as a performance-weighted average prediction of 7 different modeling methods fit to 6 physical predictors (substrate type, depth, wave exposure, slope, and two bathymetric position indices) and evaluated with a 5-fold spatially-blocked cross-validation procedure. The ensemble model showed moderate predictive performance (Area Under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) = 0.803 +/- 0.061, True Skill Statistic (TSS) = 0.531 +/- 0.100; mean +/- SD), high sensitivity (92.0 +/- 4.5), and offered some improvement over individual models. Substrate type, depth, and relative wave exposure were the most influential predictors associated with eelgrass occurrence, where the highest probabilities were associated with sandy and sandy-mud sediments, depths ranging 0 m - 4 m, and low to intermediate wave exposure. Within our study region, we predicted a total extent of suitable eelgrass habitat of 38,130 ha. We found suitable habitat was particularly extensive within the long narrow inlets and extensive shallow flats of the South Shore, Eastern Shore, and Bras d'Or Lakes. We also identified substantial overlap of eelgrass habitat with previously identified Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas that guide regional conservation planning while also highlighting areas of greater prediction uncertainty arising from disagreement among modeling methods. By offering improved sensitivity and insights into the fine-scale regional distribution of a habitat-forming species with associated uncertainties, our ensemble-based modeling approach provides improved support to numerous nearshore applications including conservation planning and restoration, marine spatial and emergency response planning, environmental impact assessments, and fish habitat protection.

AB  - Aim Crop wild relatives (CWR) are an essential source of genetic material for the improvement of certain traits in related crop species. Despite their importance, increasing public, scientific and political support, large gaps exist in the amount of genetic material collected and conserved of many CWR. Here, we construct a dataset on the distribution of wild banana species (Musa spp.) and assess their risk and conservation status. We deal with the following questions: (a) What areas are potentially suitable for wild banana species? (b) How much of the wild banana diversity is currently at risk or insufficiently conserved ex and in situ?
   Location Native distribution area of wild banana species, ranging from the north-eastern states of India to north-eastern Australia.
   Methods We assessed the potential environmental range of wild species using a species distribution modelling approach with MaxEnt. Extinction risk was evaluated following IUCN criterion B, and the ex and in situ conservation status was assessed using an indicator for biodiversity and sustainable development targets.
   Results We found that 11 out of 59 assessed species can be considered as vulnerable and nine as endangered. Highest species richness was found along the border of south China and northern Vietnam, in the north-eastern states of India and on the Malayan peninsula. Our distribution modelling approach indicates that the northern Indo-Burmese region has the highest environmental suitability for most wild banana species and that lowland rain forests in general are highly suitable for bananas. Assessment of in and ex situ conservation status indicates that 56 out of 59 assessed species are currently insufficiently conserved ex situ and that 49 are of high priority for further conservation. Additional in situ conservation is of high priority for six species and of medium priority for 40 species.
   Main conclusions To date, little of the banana CWR are sufficiently conserved both in and ex situ.

AB  - AimEcological niche modelling is one of the main tools that allows for the incorporation of climate change effects into conservation planning. For example, ecological niche model predictions can be used to rank species by degree of predicted future habitat loss. While many studies have considered how different modelling decisions contribute to uncertainty in niche model outputs, here we evaluate how metrics used to rank species by conservation risk respond to the choice of global climate models, greenhouse gas emission scenarios, suitable versus unsuitable threshold values, and the degree of model complexity.
   LocationCalifornia, USA.
   MethodsWe built ecological niche models for 153 species of reptiles and amphibians. Reduced complexity models were compared to default complexity models using AICc to select climate variables and tune Maxent' s built-in regularization parameter. We predicted the distribution of climatically suitable habitat under future (2041-2060) climate conditions according to 11 global climate models, four representative concentration pathways, and three threshold values. Two metrics to rank species by predicted future loss of climatically suitable habitat were calculated for each set of modelling decisions. To determine the effects of modelling decisions on rankings, we used mixed models.
   ResultsOur results indicate that while individual modelling decisions had relatively small effects on species ranks alone, in combination, they lead to very different conservation assessments.
   Main conclusionsWe recommend that a wide range of modelling decisions be explored and that variation in ranks across runs be reported as a first step in identifying the uncertainty in rank metrics used for assessing conservation risk under changing, but uncertain climate predictions.

AB  - Climate change affects the distribution areas of terrestrial and aquatic organisms. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of climate change on the current and future distribution of Anatolian sea trout, Salmo coruhensis. Nineteen Bioclimatic (Bio 1-19) and eight environmental data have been used in the study. Future distribution model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC-ESM) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model (GFDL CM3) 2050 and 2070 emission scenarios (RCP 2.6 and 8.5), current distribution Global River Classification (GloRiC) data and bioclimatic data were used. Global River Classification (GloRiC) data evaluation has determined that S. coruhensis is currently distributed in streams with minimum air temperature (long-term average of the minimum air temperature of the coldest month) range of -5.6 and 3.9 degrees C. The suitable distribution areas of the species expand according to 2050 and 2070 RCP 2.6 emission scenarios but decrease to 8.5 scenario. According to the 2050 and 2070 8.5 emission scenario, the species lose the distribution areas below 1300 altitude. Mountain streams will be an important shelter for Salmo coruhensis in the future. Considering the future habitat losses of S. coruhensis (IUCN - category NT) species, conservation plans are essential; therefore, the results of the study may contribute to future species conservation plans.

AB  - Monitoring populations and designing effective conservation actions for endangered species present significant challenges. An accurate understanding of current distribution, ecological traits and habitat requirements is imperative in formulating conservation strategies. Recent surveys on the southernmost Cuvier's Gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) population, an ungulate endemic to North Africa, showcase its importance in terms of numbers and genetic diversity. This population inhabits a remote region in the extreme north-western portion of the Sahara Desert and has not been well studied. Here, we examine the potential distribution of Cuvier's Gazelle and the environmental factors limiting the species in a Saharan environment, by combining broad-scale field survey data and species distribution models. Our objective was to identify high priority conservation areas in the southernmost known portion of the species' distribution by modelling habitat selection at the landscape scale using a predictive distribution map. Our results show that the distribution of Cuvier's Gazelle is strongly related to mountainous areas with heterogeneous terrain and remoteness from large human settlements over other ecological factors that had less impact on the species' presence and distribution. We also provide a quantitative estimate of the potential distribution range of Cuvier's Gazelle in southern Morocco, identifying two well-demarcated key areas. The two core areas currently contain enough rugged terrain isolated from human encroachment to support the endangered species in this harsh desert environment. We encourage the implementation of conservation planning for Cuvier's Gazelle as an "umbrella species", which will confer effective protection to higher-quality habitat zones and co-occurring species, leading to sustainable and ecologically responsible development in the region.

AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding geographic distributions of species is a crucial step in spatial planning for biodiversity conservation, particularly as regards changes in response to global climate change. This information is especially important for species of global conservation concern that are susceptible to the effects of habitat loss and climate change. In this study, we used ecological niche modeling to assess the current and future geographic distributional potential of White-breasted Guineafowl (Agelastes meleagrides) (Vulnerable) across West Africa. MethodsWe used primary occurrence data obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and national parks in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and two independent environmental datasets (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index at 250m spatial resolution, and Worldclim climate data at 2.5 spatial resolution for two representative concentration pathway emissions scenarios and 27 general circulation models for 2050) to build ecological niche models in Maxent.ResultsFrom the projections, White-breasted Guineafowl showed a broader potential distribution across the region compared to the current IUCN range estimate for the species. Suitable areas were concentrated in the Gola rainforests in northwestern Liberia and southeastern Sierra Leone, the Tai-Sapo corridor in southeastern Liberia and southwestern Cote d'Ivoire, and the Nimba Mountains in northern Liberia, southeastern Guinea, and northwestern Cote d'Ivoire. Future climate-driven projections anticipated minimal range shifts in response to climate change.ConclusionsBy combining remotely sensed data and climatic data, our results suggest that forest cover, rather than climate is the major driver of the species' current distribution. Thus, conservation efforts should prioritize forest protection and mitigation of other anthropogenic threats (e.g. hunting pressure) affecting the species.

AB  - Sardinia hosts 186 endemic plant species and represents an important centre for Mediterranean biodiversity. In view of the threats facing its flora, 27 terrestrial vascular plants have been listed in international regulations and 124 sites designated for species and habitat conservation. This study analyses gaps in the Natura 2000 network and the current and future distribution of four representative plants. Each plant population was georeferenced and the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 network was compared according to conservation status and distribution. Future species distributions were modelled by considering current climatic conditions and future scenarios. In apparent discordance with other results, we found that the Natura 2000 network represents most plant species well. This research shows a forward-looking survey on the regional effectiveness of protection measures which led us to confirm the need to enhance the current state of the Natura 2000 network by implementing local legislation and regulations.

AB  - Conservation decisions must be made with limited funding and incomplete information. Ecological surveys can help reduce uncertainty and, in turn, potentially lead to better management decisions. However, conducting surveys can reduce funds available for implementing management actions and, in turn, can potentially lead to worse conservation outcomes. Here we develop a value of information framework to evaluate and optimize survey plans. Our framework evaluates survey plans based on their ability to improve how likely resulting protected area systems are to secure species of interest, and accounts for survey and land acquisition costs. Using an example of eight imperilled plant species in Middlesex County (Ontario, Canada), we assessed our framework against conventional approaches for designing survey plans that involve selecting places with (i) maximal geographic coverage, (ii) diverse environmental conditions, (iii) highly uncertain information, (iv) high imperilled species richness and (v) low protected area establishment costs. We found that optimized survey plans could improve the protected area system by, on average, 57.52% (0.21 SD) (up to 105.25%) over conventional survey approaches. These optimized plans could also improve the protected area system by, on average, 19.91% (up to 32.37%) over simply prioritizing based on existing information. Survey plans designed using conventional approaches, in many cases, led to a worse protected area system than simply using existing information. Such conventional approaches performed the worst when they allocated a large percentage of the available budget to data collection. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that conventional approaches for designing ecological surveys can impede conservation efforts by squandering funds on data that have little chance of improving decision making. Indeed, conventional approaches for designing surveys had the poorest performance under limited budgets, which are typical in real world planning exercises. We recommend that conservation practitioners carefully consider how data collection efforts can potentially improve conservation decisions, and also the costs associated with data collection. By applying the principles of value of information, our framework enables conservation practitioners to cost-effectively collect data in places that will maximize conservation outcomes.

AB  - We explored the usefulness of three satellite land cover data sets available to land managers in south-central Sweden for conservation planning using four deciduous forest focal resident bird species with different habitat requirements. Habitat suitability models using empirical species-specific habitat parameters and a Geographic Information System were applied to evaluate and compare the degree of consistency among three different land cover data sets. The study area encompassed 10,000 km(2) in a landscape mosaic of managed boreal forests and is within the distribution range of all four focal species. Although the three land cover data sets indicated similar total amounts of deciduous forest, the habitat suitability models showed that different land cover data yielded inconsistent results regarding the amount and distribution of suitable habitat within 5x5 km grid cells. Given this sensitivity to the choice of land cover data sets, the habitat suitability models showed positive relationships among the selected focal species for each land cover data set separately. As expected, decreasing amounts of suitable habitat were identified for species with higher specialisation. Thus, because habitat suitability models are an appropriate way to gain insight into the functionality and connectivity of habitat networks, land cover data must be carefully evaluated and if necessary combined with other landscape information for effective conservation planning.

AB  - Conserving habitat is increasingly challenging as human populations grow. Remote-sensing technology has provided a means to delineate species' habitat on large spatial scales. However, by combining habitat delineations with predictions of species' occurrence, habitat models can provide additional utility applications for conservation by allowing us to forecast how changing environmental and landscape conditions affect species' occurrence and distribution. We demonstrate how a spatially explicit habitat occupancy model for the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) can be used as an impact assessment and conservation planning tool. We used predictions of patch-level occupancy rates and created several scenarios that simulated the removal or protection of warbler habitats. Resulting changes to habitat structure and availability were used to assess the resulting impacts of removal or protection on the occurrence probability for remaining habitat patches. By recalculating occupancy based on changes to habitat, our approach provides the ability to assess and compare impacts of location and orientation of development so that the least harmful option relative to predicted occurrence can be chosen. Potential applications of our modeling approach are many because our methods provide a useful tool for identifying potential impacts and assisting with mitigation efforts focused on the conservation and management of a species.

AB  - Historic rates of habitat change and growing exploitation of natural resources threaten avian biodiversity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot. We implemented a twostage framework for conservation planning in the Atlantic Forest. First, we used ecological niche modeling to predict the distributions of 23 endemic bird species using 19 climatic metrics and 12 spectral and radar remote sensing metrics. Second, we utilized the principle of complementarity to prioritize new sites to augment the Atlantic Forest's existing reserves. The best predictors of bird distributions were precipitation metrics (the seasonality of rainfall) and radar remote sensing metrics (QSCAT). The existing protected areas do not include 10% of the habitat of each of the 23 endemic species. We propose a more economical set of protected areas by reducing the extent to which new sites duplicate the biodiversity content of existing protected areas. There is a high concordance between the proposed conservation areas that we designed using computerized algorithms and Important Bird Areas prioritized by BirdLife International. Insofar as deforestation in the Atlantic Forest is similar to land conversion in other biodiversity hotspots, our methodology is applicable to conservation efforts elsewhere in the world.

AB  - Species distribution and endangerment can be assessed by habitat-suitability modelling. This study addresses methodical aspects of habitat suitability modelling and includes an application example in actual species conservation and landscape planning. Models using species presence-absence data are preferable to presence-only models. In contrast to species presence data, absences are rarely recorded. Therefore, many studies generate pseudo- absence data for modelling. However, in this study model quality was higher with null samples collected in the field. Next to species data the choice of landscape data is crucial for suitability modelling. Landscape data with high resolution and ecological relevance for the study species improve model reliability and quality for small elusive mammals like Muscardinus avellanarius. For large scale assessment of species distribution, models with lowdetailed data are sufficient. For regional site-specific conservation issues like a conflict-free site for new wind turbines, high-detailed regional models are needed. Even though the overlap with optimally suitable habitat for M. avellanarius was low, the installation of wind plants can pose a threat due to habitat loss and fragmentation. To conclude, modellers should clearly state the purpose of their models and choose the according level of detail for species and environmental data.

AB  - Establishing protected areas has long been an effective conservation strategy and is often based on readily surveyed species. The potential of any freshwater taxa to be a surrogate for other aquatic groups has not been explored fully. We compiled occurrence data on 72 species of freshwater fishes, amphibians, mussels, and aquatic reptiles for the Great Plains, Wyoming (U.S.A.). We used hierarchical Bayesian multispecies mixture models and MaxEnt models to describe species' distributions and the program Zonation to identify areas of conservation priority for each aquatic group. The landscape-scale factors that best characterized aquatic species' distributions differed among groups. There was low agreement and congruence among taxaspecific conservation priorities (<20%), meaning no surrogate priority areas would include or protect the best habitats of other aquatic taxa. Common, wideranging aquatic species were included in taxa-specific priority areas, but rare freshwater species were not included. Thus, the development of conservation priorities based on a single freshwater aquatic group would not protect all species in the other aquatic groups.

AB  - Statistical modelling of species presence/absence data in relation to mapped environmental predictors has been widely used to predict distributions of species for use in regional conservation planning. This paper evaluates the extent to which predictive mapping of habitat suitability might be refined by modelling relative abundance or density of a species instead of presence/absence. We use data collected at field survey sites in north-east New South Wales to develop models predicting the abundance of vascular plant and vertebrate fauna species as a function of regional-scale environmental variables. The predictive accuracy of these models is then evaluated using survey data collected at independent evaluation sites. A number of 'direct' abundance modelling techniques were evaluated including generalised linear and generalised additive Poisson regression, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. We also evaluated the performance of predicted probability of occurrence generated by logistic regression modelling as an 'indirect' index of abundance. Both the direct and indirect modelling techniques generally failed to provide consistently reliable predictions of abundance. Reasonably accurate models were produced for only 12 of the 44 species evaluated. A further key finding was that, for all 12 of these species, predictions from direct abundance models performed no better as a relative index of abundance than predicted probabilities of occurrence generated by logistic regression modelling. Implications of these results for the use of predictive modelling in regional conservation planning are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As a megadiverse country with a rapidly growing population, South Africa is experiencing a biodiversity crisis: natural habitats are being degraded and species are becoming threatened with extinction. In an era of big biodiversity data and limited conservation resources, conservation biologists are challenged to use such data for cost-effective conservation planning. However, while extensive, key genomic and distributional databases remain incomplete and contain biases. Here, we compiled data on the distribution of South Africa's > 10,000 endemic plant species, and used species distribution modelling to identify regions with climate suitable for supporting high diversity, but which have been poorly sampled. By comparing the match between projected species richness from climate to observed sampling effort, we identify priority areas and taxa for future biodiversity sampling. We reveal evidence for strong geographical and taxonomic sampling biases, indicating that we have still not fully captured the extraordinary diversity of South Africa's endemic flora. We suggest that these knowledge gaps contribute to the insufficient protection of plant biodiversity within the country-which reflect part of a broaderLeopoldean shortfallin conservation data.

AB  - Conservation and management of environmentally suitable areas, that support survival and persistence of species, are keys to protect wildlife in their natural habitat. Populations of Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster, an endemic species in Asia, are listed as endangered in the IUCN red list, requiring immediate conservation actions before their extinction in the wild. In order to model and map the current and future (under projected climate change settings) climatically-suitable area for the species, Maxent modeling technique, that requires presence-only records, was employed. As predictors, we extracted 19 bioclimatic variables from 'WorldClim' database with a similar to 1 km spatial resolution and used 10 uncorrelated bioclimatic variables as inputs. As indicated by a high area under ROC curve (AUC) value (>0.9), Maxent well performed and predicted climatically-suitable habitat for the species along the Hindukush Himalaya, where the species is known to occur. Annual mean temperature appeared to most influence the distribution of potential habitat for the species. An expansion of species' habitat was noticed in the Indian and Tibetan part of species range, suggesting a potential future effect of climate change on the species distribution. The findings of this study could assist wildlife managers in devising conservation plans for the current and future conservation of the species in the context of climate change. This is the first study to model and map the current and future distribution of the species in its range. (C) 2017 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Species are expected to shift their distributions in response to global environmental changes and additional protected areas are needed to encompass the corresponding changes in the distributions of their habitats. Conservation policies are likely to become obsolete unless they integrate the potential impacts of climate and land-use change on biodiversity.
   We identify conservation priority areas for current and future projected distributions of Iberian bird species. We then investigate the extent to which global change informed priority areas are: (i) covered by existing protected area networks (national protected areas and Natura 2000); (ii) threatened by agricultural or urban land-use changes.
   We use outputs of species distributions models fitted with climatic data as inputs in spatial prioritization tools to identify conservation priority areas for 168 bird species. We use projections of land-use change to then discriminate between threatened and non-threatened priority areas.
   19% of the priority areas for birds are covered by national protected areas and 23% are covered by Natura 2000 sites. The spatial mismatch between protected area networks and priority areas for birds is projected to increase with climate change. But there are opportunities to improve the protection of birds under climate change, as half of the priority areas are currently neither protected nor in conflict with urban or agricultural land-uses.
   We identify critical areas for bird conservation both under current and climate change conditions, and propose that they could guide the establishment of new conservation areas across the Iberian Peninsula complementing existing protected areas.

AB  - Aim Given that riverine systems exhibit longitudinal environmental gradients from headwater to the mouth of a river, habitat heterogeneity appears to be a major driver of spatial variation in community composition among riverine localities. As freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most endangered ecosystems in the world, community-based conservation and multiple-species management are necessary to maintain ecosystem integrity. We used joint species distribution models (JSDMs) to investigate the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors that are responsible for the distribution and co-occurrence of species in riverine ecosystems.
   Location Central and northern Europe.
   Methods We examined the general patterns of species assemblage of two endangered freshwater mussel species (Margaritifera margaritifera and Unio crassus) and their associated fish communities. We examined the patterns of positive or negative co-occurrence in mussel and fish species and identified shared abiotic responses between mussel-host pairs.
   Results We found that the relative importance of abiotic and residual factors and patterns of significant species correlations varied among taxa: significant residual correlations were prevalent among fish species, whereas mussel occurrences were exclusively explained by abiotic factors. Mussels and their fish hosts generally had shared abiotic responses with some mismatched responses between mussel-host pairs.
   Main conclusions Given that the composition of communities were tightly linked with abiotic factors and residual correlations, the results have significant implications for the conservation and restoration of aquatic communities. This study highlights the necessity to simultaneously consider environmental factors and species co-occurrences in the modelling of species distributions and assemblages of riverine communities. Such a holistic community conservation approach can reveal ecological similarities and differences among species, which can help us avoid conflicts among target-species conservation plans.

AB  - For planning practical measures aimed at biodiversity protection, conservation priorities must be identified at a local scale. Unfortunately, identifying local conservation priorities requires high-resolution data on species distribution, and these are often unavailable. Atlases of species distribution provide data for several groups of organisms in many different areas but are often too coarse in resolution to provide valuable information. We explored the possibility of cross-scale modelling species distributions and we clarified, for the first time, its effect on prioritization exercises. We used different modelling techniques for scaling down atlas data for Sardinian reptiles, validated the outcomes with detailed, field-sampled data, and compared conservation priorities deriving from atlas maps and downscaled models. Doing this, we obtained as a further result the identification of priority species and areas for future conservation strategies. Our results encourage us to experiment further with this approach. Through the downscaling procedure, we obtain high-resolution models with strong variations in predictive performances, although most of the models show satisfactory/excellent scores. This testifies that low-resolution data can be downscaled maintaining low rates of omission and commission errors. Increasing the resolution of distribution maps used for prioritization influences the spatial patterns of priority but does not modify the evaluation of species representation. Overall, we show that atlases can meet the large demand for distribution data by decision makers if appropriate downscaling procedures are adopted. In addition, we provide practical instruments for the conservation of reptiles in Sardinia by identifying priority species and areas that require strict management.

AB  - AimIn the face of global environmental change, identifying the factors that shape the ecological niches of species and understanding the mechanisms behind them can help to draft effective conservation plans. The differences in the ecological factors that shape species distributions may then help to highlight differences between closely related taxa. We investigate the applicability of ecological niche modelling and the comparison of species distributions in ecological niche space to detect areas with priority for biodiversity conservation and to analyse differences in the ecological niche spaces used by closely related taxa.
   LocationUnited States of America, Mexico and Central America.
   MethodsWe apply ordination and ecological niche modelling techniques to assess the main environmental drivers of the distribution of Mexican white pines (Pinus: Pinaceae). Furthermore, we assess the similarities and differences of the ecological niches occupied by closely related taxa. We analyse whether Mexican white pines occupy similar or equivalent ecological niches.
   ResultsAll the studied taxa presented different responses to the environmental factors, resulting in a unique combination of niche conditions. Our stacked habitat suitability maps highlighted regions in southern Mexico and northern Central America as highly suitable for most species and thus with high conservation value. By quantitatively assessing the niche overlap, similarity and equivalency of Mexican white pines, our results prove that the distribution of one species cannot be implied by the distribution of another, even if these taxa are considered closely related.
   Main conclusionsThe fact that each Mexican white pine is constrained by a unique set of environmental conditions, and thus, their non-equivalence of ecological niches has direct implications for conservation as this highlights the inadequacy of one-fits all type of conservation measure.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to be a major threat for biodiversity and, from a conservation prospective, it is important to understand how ecosystems may respond to that change. Predicted climate change effects on the distribution of meadows in the arid and semi-arid Argentinean Patagonia by 2050 were assessed for change trends and areas of desertification vulnerability using species distribution models (SDM) and climate-change models. Four modelling techniques composed an ensemble-forecasting approach. Suitable areas for meadows will decrease by 7.85% by 2050 given predicted changes in climate. However, there were two contrasting trends: severe reduction of suitable areas for meadows in north-west Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego Island, and an expansion of suitable areas for meadows in the south and a small section in the north-west. Meadows in Patagonia will likely be impacted by climate change, probably due to changes in precipitation regimes, and consequently many species that rely on meadows in an arid environment will also be impacted. Given the low level of protection of meadows in Patagonia, such information on meadow distribution and vulnerability to climate change will be important for increasing and improving the network of conservation areas through conservation planning.

AB  - Temperature profoundly affects ecology, a fact ever more evident as the ability to measure thermal environments increases and global changes alter these environments. The spatial structure of thermalscapes is especially relevant to the distribution and abundance of ectothermic organisms, but the ability to describe biothermal relationships at extents and grains relevant to conservation planning has been limited by small or sparse data sets. Here, we combine a large occurrence database of >23000 aquatic species surveys with stream microclimate scenarios supported by an equally large temperature database for a 149000-km mountain stream network to describe thermal relationships for 14 fish and amphibian species. Species occurrence probabilities peaked across a wide range of temperatures (7.0-18.8 degrees C) but distinct warm- or cold-edge distribution boundaries were apparent for all species and represented environments where populations may be most sensitive to thermal changes. Warm-edge boundary temperatures for a native species of conservation concern were used with geospatial data sets and a habitat occupancy model to highlight subsets of the network where conservation measures could benefit local populations by maintaining cool temperatures. Linking that strategic approach to local estimates of habitat impairment remains a key challenge but is also an opportunity to build relationships and develop synergies between the research, management, and regulatory communities. As with any data mining or species distribution modeling exercise, care is required in analysis and interpretation of results, but the use of large biological data sets with accurate microclimate scenarios can provide valuable information about the thermal ecology of many ectotherms and a spatially explicit way of guiding conservation investments.

AB  - The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is one of the most important of all conservation indicators, but most developing countries do not have enough information with which to make assessments. The use of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict habitat suitability, both currently and in the future under the effects of climate change, offers a potential solution for estimating extinction risk. With a set of validated observations, we used SDMs to make preliminary evaluations of the risk of extinction for 114 Egyptian medicinal plants based on IUCN Red-List Criteria and Categories. Using MaxEnt and eleven environmental variables, distributions were projected for 2020, 2050, and 2080 under two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no dispersal. The IUCN assessments used the predicted distributions as well as the actual records to measure both extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). There was a positive correlation between EOO estimates based on actual records and those based on SDMs, demonstrating the ability of SDMs to compensate for a lack of data. Most species could be classified as Least Concern (LC) at the current time, whilst in the future under climate change, many species face some risk of extinction, depending on assumptions. We conclude that it is possible to make regional risk assessments even in data-sparse countries, in order to plan conservation management in the future. Using species distribution modelling together with IUCN Red-List assessment is a good method for countries where data are sparse in order to conserve and protect threatened species.

AB  - In this study we developed a simple quantitative method to assist in the decision making process of the landscape planning by integrating information of species occurrence and their individual IUCN extinction risks. We applied this method in Catalonia (north-east Iberian Peninsula) using bird atlas data to create an Index of Cumulative Threat Status (ICUTS). We employed a heuristic approach derived from qualitative scores provided by 10 experts on the avifauna of the region to choose the final index among a group of candidates. This index was used to generate two maps of conservation value at 10 x 10 km resolution, one comprising all breeding bird species in the study region (219 species), and a second one with only those bird species for which fine-grained maps (500 x 500 m) were also available (182 species). In spite of the difference in the number of species included in the two 10 x 10 km maps, we found similar geographical patterns and therefore we considered that the pattern shown by the second group of species (at 500 x 500 m resolution) represented a good proxy of the whole breeding avifauna for landscape planning purposes. The approach developed in this study may be particularly helpful in landscape planning outside protected areas because of its spatial continuity, fine-grained resolution and easy interpretation.

AB  - Spatial data on species distributions are available in two main forms, point locations and distribution maps (polygon ranges and grids). The first are often temporally and spatially biased, and too discontinuous, to be useful (untransformed) in spatial analyses. A variety of modelling approaches are used to transform point locations into maps. We discuss the attributes that point location data and distribution maps must satisfy in order to be useful in conservation planning. We recommend that before point location data are used to produce and/or evaluate distribution models, the dataset should be assessed under a set of criteria, including sample size, age of data, environmental/geographical coverage, independence, accuracy, time relevance and (often forgotten) representation of areas of permanent and natural presence of the species. Distribution maps must satisfy additional attributes if used for conservation analyses and strategies, including minimizing commission and omission errors, credibility of the source/assessors and availability for public screening. We review currently available databases for mammals globally and show that they are highly variable in complying with these attributes. The heterogeneity and weakness of spatial data seriously constrain their utility to global and also sub-global scale conservation analyses.

TI  - Modeling Rare Species Distribution at the Edge: The Case for the Vulnerable Endemic Pyrenean Desman in France
T2  - SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - SPACE
AB  - The endemic Pyrenean Desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) is an elusive, rare, and vulnerable species declining over its entire and narrow range (Spain, Portugal, France, and Andorra). The principal set of conservation measures in France is a 5-years National Action Plan based on 25 conservation actions. Priority is given to update its present distribution and develop tools for predictive distribution models. We aim at building the first species distribution model and map for the northern edge of the range of the Desman and confronting the outputs of the model to target conservation efforts in the context of environmental change. Contrasting to former comparable studies, we derive a simpler model emphasizing the importance of factors linked to precipitation and not to the temperature. If temperature is one of the climate change key factors, depicted shrinkage in Desman distribution could be lower or null at the northern (French) edge suggesting thus a major role for this northern population in terms of conservation of the species. Finally, we question the applied issue of temporal and spatial transferability for such environmental favourability models when it is made at the edge of the distribution range.

AB  - Aim Increasing sea-surface temperatures (SST) have resulted in poleward range expansions of scleractinian corals and declines in their core ranges. These changes may provide management opportunities for the long-term persistence of corals, but spatial prioritization rarely considers and anticipates these changes. We developed a spatio-temporal conservation plan that accommodates future coral range expansions based on projections of future SST. Our spatial planning approach is particularly useful in places with limited information about species distributions. Our aims were to (1) identify areas that consistently remain important for conservation through time and (2) determine the differences between priorities for conservation that account for potential coral range expansions and those that ignore them.
   Location Japan.
   Methods We developed spatial planning approaches using predicted coral habitat distributions for current conditions, the near future and the distant future. Using the Marxan conservation planning software, we designed conservation plans for scenarios that incorporated different types of spatial and temporal connections. Spatial connections are physical connections between adjacent and nearby areas, whereas temporal connections connect planning areas throughout time.
   Results We found that protecting areas important for current and future coral habitat distributions is possible by prioritizing places that are consistently important through time. A spatially and temporally cohesive plan was accomplished with only a 14% increase in the overall reserve system costs, compared with reserve systems ignoring future coral habitat distributions. The attributes of priority areas (e. g. locations, outside boundary length and size) were substantially different when we varied the types of connections.
   Main conclusions This study demonstrated that areas with highest conservation priority now will not necessarily be optimal when planning for future change, such as coral range expansions. Furthermore, we showed that incorporating spatio-temporal connections into spatial prioritization achieves objectives of simultaneously conserving corals in the current climate and facilitating their expansions as SST rises.

AB  - Habitat loss causes great threats to biological diversity, and one of the alternatives to protect biodiversity is reserve planning using optimization tools to establish conservation priority areas. In this study, a simulated annealing algorithm was used to analyze the influence of species distribution margins on selection of areas in Cerrado, for 131 anurans species. For this purpose, we used two databases: one containing the original species distribution, and another with the periphery of distributions excluded. Networks selected using the original distributions contained 17 cells, whereas networks found with the reduced distributions were larger, with 22 cells. The irreplaceable cells were the same in all networks. and new regions of replaceable cells in the margins of the biome arise when distributions without peripheral areas were considered.

AB  - Oaxaca, located in south-west Mexico within the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, holds exceptionally high biodiversity for several taxa, including mammals. It has four decreed natural protected areas (NPAs) covering 5% of its total area, but only three of these, covering only 0.2% of the area, are strictly protected as National Parks. The current study develops ecological niche models for 183 terrestrial mammals for use as biodiversity surrogates in a systematic conservation planning exercise. Forty-five of these species were selected on the basis of their being either endangered or threatened or otherwise listed under the Mexican Red List or because they were endemic to either Oaxaca or to Mexico. The niche models were constructed with a machine-learning algorithm (GARP, Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction) and refined by restricting each model to sites with suitable vegetation and habitat patches contiguous with known occurrences of the species. If the entire predicted geographical distribution of each of the 45 species listed above is put under protection, the entire state of Oaxaca gets included. Therefore, we imposed different constraints on the maximum area that can be put under protection (5-30% of the area of Oaxaca) and selected nominal conservation area networks based on different percentage representation targets for the species' modelled distributions based on their conservation status (10-100%). The area selection utilized a rarity- and complementarity-based algorithm (in the ResNet software package). The goal was to have as many as possible of the 45 species at risk meet their specified representation targets in the budgeted area. The methods developed here combine ecological niche modelling and area prioritization algorithms for integrated conservation planning in a protocol that is suitable for other highly biodiverse regions.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. Argentinian-protected areas have been established mainly to protect vertebrates and plants in terrestrial ecosystems. In order to create a comprehensive biodiverse conservation plan, it is crucial to integrate both aquatic and terrestrial systems and to include macroinvertebrates. Here, we address this topic by proposing priority areas of conservation including invertebrates, aquatic ecosystems, and their connectivity and land uses. Location: Northwest of Argentina. We modeled the ecological niches of different taxa of macroinvertebrates such as Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Megaloptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Acari, and Mollusca. Based on these models, we analyzed the contribution of currently established protected areas in the conservation of the aquatic biodiversity and we propose a spatial prioritization taking into account possible conflict regarding different land uses. Our analysis units were the real watersheds, to which were added longitudinal connectivity up and down the rivers. A total of 132 species were modeled in the priority area analyses. The analysis 1 showed that only an insignificant percentage of the macroinvertebrates distribution is within the protected areas in the North West of Argentina. The analyses 2 and 3 recovered similar values of protection for the macroinvertebrate species. The upper part of Bermejo, Sali-Dulce, San Francisco, and the Upper part of Juramento basins were identified as priority areas of conservation. The aquatic ecosystems need special protection and 10% or even as much as 17% of land conservation is insufficient for species of macroinvertebrates. In turn the protected areas need to combine the aquatic and terrestrial systems and need to include macroinvertebrates as a key group to sustain the biodiversity. In many cases, the land uses are in conflict with the conservation of biodiversity; however, it is possible to apply the connectivity of the watersheds and create multiple-use modules.

AB  - A common focus for conservation planning is to identify locations for siting potential protected areas, something that requires estimates for the costs of setting up these areas and benefits for biodiversity of doing so. When cost data are not available over relevant scales, conservation planners commonly rely on proxy data that they hope will estimate conservation costs. Here, we assessed how accurately agricultural land values, a commonly used proxy for cost data in conservation planning, estimate the actual acquisition costs of protected areas, focusing on a case study from the central and southern Appalachians. We compared plans based on cost estimates derived from different sources and that involved different levels of spatial aggregation to understand how a reliance on these estimates would impact conservation planning. We found that the average agricultural land value in a county did not accurately predict the acquisition costs of protected areas in that county. This lack of accuracy was a result of choosing agricultural land values as a proxy for acquisition costs, and not spatial averaging. A reliance on agricultural land values risks diverting limited funds for establishing protected areas away from parcels that offer the greatest return-on-investment. It would also lead a conservation organization to overestimate the budget needed to protect a given number of species. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating data on how much protected areas actually cost in future conservation planning studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For effective conservation planning, resource managers around the world require information on species distributions. Available data, however, are often too coarse in spatial resolution to be of practical use. We describe four modelling techniques that harness the information contained in coarse-scale occurrence records to predict species' distributions at the finer resolutions relevant to conservation officers in the field. The techniques are primarily statistical in nature, but can incorporate expert knowledge on species' habitat preferences. We highlight the conceptual strengths and weaknesses of each, and perform a preliminary test of their comparative performance, using empirical data on the distribution of nine bird species in Uganda and satellite-derived environmental indices. Two techniques, the point sampling approach and iterative approach, yield encouraging results. Because the dominance of environmental factors controlling species' distributions shifts with spatial scale, however, cross-scale predictions remain a formidable challenge. Further testing and refinement of the techniques we present here are undoubtedly necessary before they can be applied with any confidence. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Identifying the spatio-temporal distribution hotspots of fishes and allocating priority conservation areas could facilitate the spatial planning and efficient management. As a flagship commercial fishery species, Largehead hairtail (Trichiurus japonicus) has been over-exploited since the early 2000s. Therefore, the spatio-temporal management of largehead hairtail nursery grounds could effective help its recovery. This study aims to predict juvenile largehead hairtail distribution patterns and identify priority conservation areas for nursery grounds. A two-stage hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal model was applied on independent scientific survey data (Catch per unit effort, CPUE) and geographic/physical variables (Depth, Distance to the coast, Sea bottom temperature, Dissolved oxygen concentration and Net primary production) to analyze the probability of occurrence and abundance distribution of juvenile largehead hairtail. We assessed the importance of each variable for explaining the occurrence and abundance. Using persistence index, we measured the robustness of hotspots and identified persistent hotspots for priority conservation areas. Selected models showed good predictive capacity on occurrence probability (AUC = 0.81) and abundance distribution (r = 0.89) of juvenile largehead hairtail. Dissolved oxygen, net primary production, and sea bottom temperature significantly affected the probability of occurrence, while distance to the coast also affected the abundance distribution. Three stable nursery grounds were identified in Zhejiang inshore waters, the largest one was located on the east margin of the East China Sea hairtail national aquatic germplasm resources conservation zones (TCZ), suggesting that the core area of nursery grounds occurs outside the protected areas. Therefore, recognition of these sites and their associated geographic/oceanic attributes provides clear targets for optimizing largehead hairtail conservation efforts in the East China Sea. We suggested that the eastern and southern areas of TCZ should be included in conservation planning for an effective management within a network of marine protected areas.

AB  - There has been a dramatic increase in the number of conservation organizations worldwide. It is now common for multiple organizations to operate in the same landscape in pursuit of different conservation goals. New objectives, such as maintenance of ecosystem services, will attract additional funding and new organizations to conservation. Systematic conservation planning helps in the design of spatially explicit management actions that optimally conserve multiple landscape features (e.g., species, ecosystems, or ecosystem services). But the methods used in its application implicitly assume that a single actor implements the optimal plan. We investigated how organizational behavior and conservation outcomes are affected by the presence of autonomous implementing organizations with different objectives. We used simulation models and game theory to explore how alternative behaviors (e.g., organizations acting independently or explicitly cooperating) affected an organization's ability to protect their feature of interest, and investigated how the distribution of features in the landscape influenced organizations' attitudes toward cooperation. Features with highly correlated spatial distributions, although typically considered an opportunity for mutually beneficial conservation planning, can lead to organizational interactions that result in lower levels of protection. These detrimental outcomes can be avoided by organizations that cooperate when acquiring land. Nevertheless, for cooperative purchases to benefit both organizations' objectives, each must forgo the protection of land parcels that they would consider to be of high conservation value. Transaction costs incurred during cooperation and the sources of conservation funding could facilitate or hinder cooperative behavior.

AB  - Context. The impacts of climate change on the climate envelopes, and hence, distributions of species, are of ongoing concern for biodiversity worldwide. Knowing where climate refuge habitats will occur in the future is essential to conservation planning. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a species highly vulnerable to climate change. However, the impact of climate change on its distribution is poorly understood.
   Aims. We aimed to predict the likely shifts in the climate envelope of the koala throughout its natural distribution under various climate change scenarios and identify potential future climate refugia.
   Methods. To predict possible future koala climate envelopes we developed bioclimatic models using Maxent, based on a substantial database of locality records and several climate change scenarios.
   Key results. The predicted current koala climate envelope was concentrated in south-east Queensland, eastern New South Wales and eastern Victoria, which generally showed congruency with their current known distribution. Under realistic projected future climate change, with the climate becoming increasingly drier and warmer, the models showed a significant progressive eastward and southward contraction in the koala's climate envelope limit in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The models also indicated novel potentially suitable climate habitat in Tasmania and south-western Australia.
   Conclusions. Under a future hotter and drier climate, current koala distributions, based on their climate envelope, will likely contract eastwards and southwards to many regions where koala populations are declining due to additional threats of high human population densities and ongoing pressures from habitat loss, dog attacks and vehicle collisions. In arid and semi-arid regions such as the Mulgalands of south-western Queensland, climate change is likely to compound the impacts of habitat loss, resulting in significant contractions in the distribution of this species.
   Implications. Climate change pressures will likely change priorities for allocating conservation efforts for many species. Conservation planning needs to identify areas that will provide climatically suitable habitat for a species in a changing climate. In the case of the koala, inland habitats are likely to become climatically unsuitable, increasing the need to protect and restore the more mesic habitats, which are under threat from urbanisation. National and regional koala conservation policies need to anticipate these changes and synergistic threats. Therefore, a proactive approach to conservation planning is necessary to protect the koala and other species that depend on eucalypt forests.

AB  - Conservation actions that effectively and efficiently target single, highly threatened species require current data on the species' geographic distribution and environmental associations. The Ecuadorian capuchin (Cebus albifrons aequatorialis) is a critically endangered primate found only in the fragmented forests of western Ecuador and northern Peru, which are among the world's most severely threatened ecosystems. We use the MAXENT species distribution modeling method to model the potential distribution and environmental associations of Cebus albifrons aequatorialis, using all known presence localities recorded within the last 2 decades as well as 13 climate, topography, vegetation, and land-use data sets covering the entire geographic range of the subspecies. The environmental conditions that our model predicted to be ideal for supporting Cebus albifrons aequatorialis included a parts per thousand yen20% tree cover, mild temperature seasonality, annual precipitation < 2000 mm, and low human population density. Our model identified 5028 km(2) of suitable habitat remaining, although many of these forest fragments are unprotected and are unlikely to support extant populations. Using the median population density across all sites for which data are available, we estimate the total carrying capacity of the remaining habitat to be 12,500 total individuals. The true number of remaining individuals is likely to be considerably lower due to anthropogenic factors. We highlight four critical regions of high predicted suitability in western Ecuador and northern Peru on which immediate conservation actions should focus, and we lay out clear priorities to guide conservation actions for ensuring the long-term survival of this gravely threatened and little known primate.

AB  - Background and aims - Climate change imposes new challenges on biodiversity conservation, especially in tropical areas where anthropogenic pressures have already increased the vulnerability of many species. New conservation strategies are needed to anticipate the impacts of future climate change and species distribution modeling remains the most useful approach in predicting these impacts and in assisting conservation planning. The objectives of this study were to develop species distribution models for threatened endemic plant species of Madagascar and to assess the impacts of climate change on the species distributions.
   Methods - Ten species belonging to the genera Mediusella and Xerochlamys of Madagascar's endemic plant family Sarcolaenaceae were included in this study. Potential distribution models using 19 climatic variables were developed for the ten species and projected onto the present and future to evaluate the potential distribution of each species. Future distributions of these species were predicted for 2050 using three general circulation models and two climate scenarios. We also assessed the patterns of range shifts by comparing present and future distributions under the different models and scenarios.
   Key results - Most species were predicted to undergo major range contraction as a result of climate change. Species in the Central High Plateau of Madagascar were predicted to experience the highest habitat loss, with narrow-range species being the most sensitive. Southward migration was predicted for species distributed in the northwest, whereas upland migration was predicted for some central species.
   Conclusions - Future climate change will drastically affect the distribution of our target species, seven of which will experience major range contraction by 2050. Among these, threatened endemic species will face higher risk of extinction due to habitat loss. Range expansion was also predicted for two species. In any case, species' adaptation to a changing climate may not happen soon enough, emphasizing the need to strengthen current conservation efforts, especially in areas where species are most likely to persist.

AB  - The modeling of potential and current distribution of species has become a very active research area. Generally, modeling is based on the concept of ecological niche, and is supported by the use of computer programs. The main objective of this project was to develop a potential distribution model of Pinus martinezii in the Cuitzeo Lake basin using data of environmental variables, and presence of the target species. To this purpose, the environmental factors that determine the distribution of P. martinezii were identified, and a bioclimatic profile of the species was made. The modeling was based on a spatial multicriteria analyisis. The attributes were grouped into 3 criteria: geopedologic, morphometric and climatic conditions. The resulting potential distribution map showed that there are 2 main areas of potential distribution of P. martinezii, and some isolated areas where populations have not been found. The spatial model is an important tool for planning conservation and reforestation efforts, as well as to plan additional field surveys and identifying sites where the specie can be reintroduced.

AB  - Aim Existing climate envelope models give an indication of broad scale shifts in distribution, but do not specifically provide information on likely future population changes useful for conservation prioritization and planning. We demonstrate how these techniques can be developed to model likely future changes in absolute density and population size as a result of climate change.
   Location Great Britain.
   Methods Generalized linear models were used to model breeding densities of two northerly- and two southerly-distributed bird species as a function of climate and land use. Models were built using count data from extensive national bird monitoring data and incorporated detectability to estimate absolute abundance. Projections of likely future changes in the distribution and abundance of these species were made by applying these models to projections of future climate change under two emissions scenarios.
   Results Models described current spatial variation in abundance for three of the four species and produced modelled current estimates of national populations that were similar to previously published estimates for all species. Climate change was projected to result in national population declines in the two northerly-distributed species, with declines for Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata projected to be particularly severe. Conversely, the abundances of the two southerly distributed species were projected to increase nationally. Projected maps of future abundance may be used to identify priority areas for the future conservation of each species.
   Main conclusions The analytical methods provide a framework to make projections of impacts of climate change on species abundance, rather than simply projected range changes. Outputs may be summarized at any spatial scale, providing information to inform future conservation planning at national, regional and local scales. Results suggest that as a consequence of climate change, northerly distributed bird species in Great Britain are likely to become an increasingly high conservation priority within the UK.

AB  - This study evaluates how a modelling approach to determine areas of suitable habitat for the Critically Endangered Albany cycad Encephalartos latifrons can assist in systematic conservation planning for this and other rare and threatened cycads. A map distinguishing suitable from unsuitable habitat for E. latifrons was produced and important environmental predictors (climate, geology, topography and vegetation) influencing the suitable habitat were estimated. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling technique was chosen for this study as it has consistently performed well compared with alternative modelling methods and is also an appropriate model choice when the sample size is small and locality records are relatively few. Predicted habitat suitability showed that some locations chosen for translocation and restoration of E. latifrons specimens are not suitable. This revealed that modelling suitable habitat can guide relocation and regeneration of E. latifrons and perhaps other threatened cycads with restricted distributions and few locality records. The species distribution model constructed for E. latifrons is the first reported habitat model for a Critically Endangered cycad in South Africa. The results may be incorporated into conservation planning and structured decision-making about translocations and restoration programmes involving vulnerable cycads, which are among the most threatened organisms globally.

AB  - The Andean-Amazonian landscape has been universally recognized for its wide biodiversity, and is considered as global repository of ecosystem services. However, the severe loss of forest cover and rapid reduction of the timber species seriously threaten this ecosystem and biodiversity. In this study, we have modeled the distribution of the ten most exploited timber forest species in Amazonas (Peru) to identify priority areas for forest conservation and restoration. Statistical and cartographic protocols were applied with 4454 species records and 26 environmental variables using a Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt). The result showed that the altitudinal variable was the main regulatory factor that significantly controls the distribution of the species. We found that nine species are distributed below 1000 m above sea level (a.s.l.), except Cedrela montana, which was distributed above 1500 m a.s.l., covering 40.68%. Eight of 10 species can coexist, and the species with the highest percentage of potential restoration area is Cedrela montana (14.57% from Amazonas). However, less than 1.33% of the Amazon has a potential distribution of some species and is protected under some category of conservation. Our study will contribute as a tool for the sustainable management of forests and will provide geographic information to complement forest restoration and conservation plans.

AB  - Historically, protected areas were often designated using criteria other than biodiversity conservation as the primary objective. With the emergence of the science of systematic conservation planning, the designation of new protected areas is increasingly made with explicit conservation objectives in mind. However, assessments of the performance of protected area systems typically include all protected areas, regardless of when they were designated, potentially obscuring recent improvements in conservation planning decisions. Thus, it is often unclear to what extent systematic conservation planning principles have influenced the placement of new protected areas. Here, we compare recently designated protected areas in Australia with the protected area system that existed prior to the introduction of systematic conservation planning guidelines in 2000. We ask whether there is a difference between past andrecent protection in terms of (i) the size and spatial distribution of protected areas, (ii) the characteristics of broad regions in which protection is concentrated, and (iii) the extent to which protected areas represent ecosystems and threatened species in comparison with selecting protected areas at random. We find that the protected area system was historically biased toward areas with steep slopes and low human populations. In contrast, recent protection is more likely to be allocated to regions with high human population and high numbers of threatened species; we show that this effect is not simply a result of biases in the places now available for conservation. Despite this successful realignment of practice, we find that the increase in protected area coverage in poorly protected regions has occurred more slowly than expected if protected area selections were fully guided by systematic conservation planning principles. Our results demonstrate rapid progress in improving Australia's protected area system in the last decade, and highlight the importance of separating recent from historical additions to the protected area system when measuring the performance of conservation decision-making.

AB  - Planning land-use for biodiversity conservation frequently involves computer-assisted reserve selection algorithms. Typically such algorithms operate on matrices of species presence-absence in sites, or on species-specific distributions of model predicted probabilities of occurrence in grid cells. There are practically always errors in input data-erroneous species presence-absence data, structural and parametric uncertainty in predictive habitat models, and lack of correspondence between temporal presence and long-run persistence. Despite these uncertainties, typical reserve selection methods proceed as if there is no uncertainty in the data or models. Having two conservation options of apparently equal biological value, one would prefer the option whose value is relatively insensitive to errors in planning inputs. In this work we show how uncertainty analysis for reserve planning can be implemented within a framework of information-gap decision theory, generating reserve designs that are robust to uncertainty. Consideration of uncertainty involves modifications to the typical objective functions used in reserve selection. Search for robust-optimal reserve structures can still be implemented via typical reserve selection optimization techniques, including stepwise heuristics, integer-programming and stochastic global search.

AB  - The use of statistical models to predict the distribution of marine species is becoming an increasingly important tool in conservation planning and fisheries management. In this study, we first aim at testing the relevance of a hybrid methodological approach that combines Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and Regression Kriging (RK) to predict distribution of marine species.
   We exemplify this approach by modelling the spatial distribution of 27 commercial marine species based on bottom trawls survey data carried out in the Gulf of Gabes. Then, the model outputs were used for the identification of areas required to meet the conservation targets of Artificial Anti-trawling Reefs. To do so, we proposed a fuzzy logic framework that allows accounting for the uncertainly arising from different model predictions. For each species, the model predictive accuracy was classified as 'high' with a mean AUC and Kappa criterion of 0.90 and 0.72, respectively. A better result was observed when a large number of occurrences are used to develop the model. When confirmed absences data are not available, we recommend the use of this method combining ENFA and RK predictions to deal with the imperfect ability to detect a species and to incorporate spatial dependence in predictions. The map resulting from the fuzzy overlay shows three main areas with a high conservation criterion, which is in agreement with ecological expert knowledge, and hence confirms the relevance of the proposed methodology.

AB  - The vulture, an immensely invaluable service provider, has been reported to have plummeted to its lowest numbers in the recent past, causing serious concerns. Hence, a habitat study has become imperative for planning the conservation and recovery of this endangered species. Central India (Madhya Pradesh), one of the strongholds of the vulture and the study site, supports numerous vulture locations and individuals belonging to seven vulture species. MaxEnt based species distribution modeling was chosen for the prediction of habitat suitability, to identify the prediction-impacting environmental variables, and to compare the area expanse of different species. Predicted potential habitat distribution maps of all vultures together and seven vulture species have been prepared. The performance accuracy of all the models was in a very high range (average AUC=0.938). Though 77% - 89% area is negligibly suitable to different species, Himalayan Griffon, Cinereous and Egyptian vultures had larger areas as compared to Long-billed, Eurasian Griffon, White-rumped and Red-headed vultures. Out of 23 variables used in the modeling, landuse-land cover (forest and waterbody), isothermality, and precipitation seasonality were the prominent determinants of the distribution of all the species. Agriculture and elevation played a minimal role. The data generated in the study could be used for the planning of vulture recovery by conservation and reintroduction. The less suitable areas could also be used for the management of ecologically plastic species by modifying such landscape into agroforestry, including animal husbandry.

AB  - Anticipating the effects of climate change on biodiversity and integrating them in planning protocols for the future are fundamental strategies to increase the effectiveness of conservation efforts. With climate change, species require dispersal skills to follow displacements of their suitable climates and therefore, spatial conservation interventions need to consider such dynamics. In general, common planning frameworks identify networks of conservation areas seemed important for species range shifts. However, it is highly unlikely that all the areas in a network present synchronous conservation value. Furthermore, given the continuous (spatial and temporal autocorrelated) nature of threats and ecological processes, the value of each area is largely dependent on the state of the neighboring areas in the recent past. In this study, a family of three models centered on the prioritization (not of single areas but) of temporal chains of areas as conservation units is presented. These models drive the use of financial investments through time in order to maximize the persistence of biodiversity in dynamic environments. Alike the most typical approaches, the here introduced models allow investments to be transferred between areas losing conservation relevancy to the areas that gain relevancy. A fictitious (but plausible) conservation plan for ten mammal species in Iberian Peninsula up to 2080 is used to illustrate the setting-up and outputs of the models. Results evidence that the conservation effectiveness achieved in each model depends on singular spatiotemporal distribution relationships among species and between species and distinct land-uses. Planners should then investigate the sensitivity of their goals to distinct decision-support tools even when driven by similar designs and constraints.

AB  - Climate warming challenges our approach to building systems of protected areas because it is likely to drive accelerating shifts in species distributions, and the projections of those future species distributions are uncertain. There are several important sources of uncertainty intrinsic to using species occurrence projections for reserve system design including uncertainty in the number of occurrences captured by any reserve selection solution, and uncertainty arising from the different approaches used to fit predictive models. Here we used the present and future predicted distributions of Iberian herptiles to analyze how dynamics and uncertainty in species distributions may affect decisions about resource allocation for conservation in space and time. We identified priority areas maximizing coverage of current and future (2020 and 2080) predicted distributions of 65 species, under "Mild" and "Severe" uncertainty. Next, we applied a return-on-investment analysis to quantify and make explicit trade-offs between investing in areas selected when optimizing for different times and with different uncertainty levels. Areas identified as important for conservation in every time frame and uncertainty level were the ones considered to be robust climate adaptation investments, and included chiefly already protected areas. Areas identified only under "Mild" uncertainty were considered good candidates for investment if extra resources are available and were mainly located in northern Iberia. However, areas selected only in the "Severe" uncertainty case should not be completely disregarded as they may become climatic refugia for some species. Our study provides an objective methodology to deliver "no regrets" conservation investments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Assessing the nature and magnitude of potential effects of climate change on populations is important to anticipating effects on species diversity for conservation planning. We used ecological niche modeling to predict present and future distributions of 49 species of manakins (Pipridae) and allies. Predictions for present-day distributions were highly coincident with independent test data, suggesting good predictive ability. Assuming no dispersal, projections of potential distributions under four scenarios of climate change predicted that 20% of manakin species would likely go extinct from their current ranges, and that distributions would in general be reduced and fragmented, regardless of the area of present-day potential distribution or rarity. Predicted changes in potential distributions, spatial configuration of suitable habitats, and geographic position of species ranges were more dramatic for species inhabiting flatlands than for montane species. These results are an example of how ecological niche modeling techniques can anticipate the nature and magnitude of changes in biodiversity in response to climate change.

AB  - With many species predicted to respond to a changing climate by shifting their distribution to climatically suitable areas, the effectiveness of static protected areas (PAs) is in question. The Madagascan PA network area has quadrupled over the past 15 years, and, although conservation planning techniques were employed to prioritise suitable areas for protection during this process, climate change impacts were not considered. We make use of species distribution models for 750 Madagascan vertebrate species to assess the potential impacts of climate change on (1) species richness across Madagascar, (2) species gain, loss and turnover in Madagascar's PAs and (3) PA network representativeness. Results indicate that Madagascar is predicted to experience substantial shifts in species richness, with most PAs predicted to experience high rates of species turnover. Provided there are no barriers to species movements, the representativeness of the current PA network will remain high for the species that are predicted to survive changes in climate by 2070, suggesting that little benefit will be gained from establishing new PAs. However, this rests on the assumption of mobility through areas currently characterised by fragmentation and anthropogenic activity, something that will require considerable expansion in conservation efforts in order to achieve.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have driven many wildlife species towards extinction. Among these species, the geographic distributions of many are poorly documented, which can limit the effectiveness of conservation. The critically endangered Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) is experiencing population decline throughout its range due to land-use changes and illegal trade for food and traditional medicine. Using distribution records and maximum entropy modeling, we predicted the potential distribution of the Chinese pangolin across Nepal. Most suitable potential habitats of the Chinese pangolin occurred in forest areas of the mid-hill region in central and eastern Nepal, followed by cultivated land. Almost all potential suitable habitats of the Chinese pangolin occurred outside of protected areas, and most of them were encroached upon by cultivated land, human settlements, and infrastructure developments. The results from this study provide baseline information on the potential suitable habitats of the Chinese pangolin in Nepal, which helps to develop site- and species-specific management plans and to identify priority areas to minimize the current threats to the pangolin and enhance the stewardship of species conservation.

AB  - Meadows are critical in arid and semi-arid Patagonia because of their importance for regional biodiversity. Despite this, little information on the spatial distribution of meadows is available, which hampers conservation planning. We modeled the spatial distribution of meadows across arid and semi-arid Patagonia, Argentina, and investigated conservation status of those areas predicted to contain meadows. We used high-resolution imagery available in Google Earth Software to visually estimate presence and absence of meadows. We used these observations and 11 socio-environmental predictor. variables to model the distribution of meadows using generalized linear, additive, boosting, and random forest models, as the basis for a final mean ensemble technique. The final ensemble model improved accuracy over any of the single models, with an accuracy (area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic plot) of 0.97. Based on the final ensemble model, only 0.14% of predicted meadows occur inside current International Union for Conservation of Nature level I, II or III protected areas. Our final ensemble model was an accurate representation of the distribution of. meadows in Patagonia and indicates they are severely under-represented within protected areas. This first regional map of meadow distribution across Argentinean Patagonia represents key information for planning actions to conserve this critical habitat. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 1. Freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most threatened and poorly protected globally. They continue to be degraded through habitat loss, pollution and invading species and conservation measures are urgently needed to halt declining trends in their biodiversity and integrity.
   2. During the past decade a suite of decision support tools and computational approaches have been developed for efficient and targeted conservation action in terrestrial or marine ecosystems. These methods may be poorly suited for planning in freshwater systems because connectivity in terrestrial and marine systems is typically modelled in a way unsuitable for rivers, where connectivity has a strong directional component.
   3. We modify the conservation prioritization method and software, zonation, to account for connectivity in a manner better suited to freshwater ecosystems. Prioritization was performed using subcatchment/catchment-based planning units and connectivity was modified to have directional upstream and downstream components consistent with the ecology of our target species.
   4. We demonstrate this modified method for rivers and streams in the southern North Island of New Zealand. Data included predicted occupancy from boosted regression tree models of species distributions for 18 fish species. The study area covered 2.1 million hectares and included 394 first- to fourth order catchment or subcatchment planning units.
   5. Realistic modelling of connectivity had a major influence on the areas proposed for conservation. If connectivity was ignored, recommended conservation areas were very fragmented. By contrast, when connectivity was modelled, high priority conservation targets consisted of entire river basins or headwater subcatchments.
   6. The proposed method serves as a starting point for the implementation of reserve selection methods in river ecosystems.

AB  - Climate change can lead to habitat loss and degradation, and consequently endangers species in a specific region. Besides addressing the priority areas of species distribution, an urgent consideration is to identify suitable conservation options and map areas according to their effectiveness when planning to conserve a rare species under climate change. Here, we conducted a study to develop potential conservation strategies and assess their effectiveness under different climate scenarios in Sanjiang ("Three rivers" in English) Plain (Amur, Ussuri and the Songhua Rivers) of Northeast China. We used the species distribution software MaxEnt to model current and future habitat distributions of endangered oriental white storks (Ciconia boyciana). Based on field surveys, experts' knowledge and literature findings, we developed the methods to identify conservation strategies. By including additional species presence sites derived from conservation strategies (a presumption of the further analyses) into MaxEnt, we predicted the future habitat distribution under the implementation of different conservation strategies. To estimate the effect of conservation strategies, we compared the differences in the extent of suitable habitat with and without conservation strategies under two different predicted climate change scenarios. The results showed that the suitable habitat of the oriental white stork in the study region dramatically declined by over 80% in the absence of conservation strategies under both scenarios. Predicted suitable habitats with conservation strategies had broader distribution ranges than those without. The strategy of reclaiming cropland back to wetland offers the most impressive effectiveness with a tenfold increase in suitable habitat, followed by the strategy of establishment of nature reserves with six fold and the strategy of artificial bird nest with two fold increase. Our approaches emphasize the effect of integration of knowledge of experts in conjunction with MaxEnt when mapping and assessing the effect of the conservation strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Albertine Rift is one of Africa's most biodiverse regions, but is threatened by habitat loss as a result of agricultural expansion and human development. Previous studies estimated that 30% of the region has been lost to agricultural conversion and we estimate here that 33% is allocated for mining concessions. For conservation planning, we used niche models for species endemic to the Albertine Rift and those that are globally threatened. We assessed where to conserve these species using three scenarios: (1) a baseline assuming equal conservation costs across all grid cells in the study area, (2) a scenario locking in existing protected areas (i.e. always selecting them by default) and assessing which unprotected areas require conservation, and (3) a scenario considering mining planned across the region. Marxan analyses produced similar results for the three scenarios, highlighting the importance of existing protected areas and the value of several community-managed or provincial protected areas in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The current protected area network covers 134,246 km(2) and an additional 64,586 km(2) would be required to ensure the conservation of all threatened and endemic species outside the parks and wildlife reserves. However, if trying to avoid mining concessions this increases to 145,704 km(2), an area larger than the existing protected areas. Some mining concessions harbour species with a restricted range and would thus need to be protected to ensure the persistence of threatened and endemic fauna and flora. These mining concessions should be challenged by the conservation community.

AB  - Climate change and other anthropogenic threats are increasingly imperilling the diverse biomes of Central Africa, which are globally important for biodiversity, carbon storage and people's livelihoods. The objectives of this paper were to: (i) map the vulnerability of 100 socio-ecologically important priority tree species in Central Africa to climate change, fire, habitat conversion, overexploitation, overgrazing and (ii) propose a spatially explicit strategy to guide restoration and conservation actions. We performed ensemble distribution modelling to predict the present and future distributions of the 100 species, assembled other anthropogenic threat exposure layers, assessed species' sensitivities to the five threats based on their trait profiles, and constructed species-specific vulnerability maps by combining the species' exposure and sensitivity. The results show that these 100 species are vulnerable to the five threats, with an average of 34% of their distribution ranges under high to very high vulnerability and 60% under medium to high vulnerability to at least one threat. Many species identified as most vulnerable in this study are not considered as threatened by the IUCN Red List, suggesting a need to update their conservation status, potentially through integration of the vulnerability mapping methodology we used here. We generated both species-specific maps and summary maps including all 100 species identifying priority areas for a) in-situ conservation, b) ex-situ conservation, and c) active planting or assisted natural regeneration. We present an online platform to enable easy access to the vulnerability and the conservation and restoration priority maps for decision makers and support conservation and restoration planning across Central Africa.

AB  - The conservation of rare species is typically challenging because of incomplete knowledge about their biology and distributions. Species distribution models (SDMs) have emerged as an important tool for improving the efficiency of rare species conservation. However, these models must include biologically relevant predictor variables at scales appropriate for discriminating suitable and unsuitable habitat. We used a species distribution modelling tool, maximum entropy (Maxent), to assess the relative influence of biologically relevant topographic characteristics, land cover features, geological formations, and edaphic factors on the occurrence of the endangered endemic orchid Spiranthes parksii (Navasota ladies' tresses). Our final model produced an excellent AUC value (0.984), with the permutation importance to model fit of predictor variables representing topographic characteristics, land cover features, geological formations, and edaphic factors summing to 8.17, 35.12, 10.43, and 46.28%, respectively. Local-scale edaphic variables were the most informative, with soil taxonomic units explaining the highest amount of variance (36.40%) of all variables included in the model. These results document the importance of local edaphic characteristics in discriminating between suitable and unsuitable habitat for S. parksii, and emphasize the importance of including local-scale edaphic factors in SDMs for species such as S. parksii with specialized habitat requirements and close relationships with other organisms.

AB  - Large mammals are declining globally due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Climate change is one of the factors known to alter the range of several mammalian species. An early understanding of the effect of climate change on species distributions can provide critical information for conservation planning. Nilgiritragus hylocrius (Nilgiri Tahr) is an endangered ungulate that is restricted to the montane grasslands of the Western Ghats, India. Currently, the Nilgiri Tahr is restricted to a fraction of its former range and is also prone to risks due to several ongoing anthropogenic pressures. However, the impact of global climate change on this emblematic species has seldom been estimated. The goal of our study was to use ecological niche models to quantify the effect of climate change on the habitats of Nilgiri Tahr. Using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm, we modelled the potential distribution of Nilgiri Tahr in its native range. The models were developed under the current climatic conditions and then projected onto two future climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and for three different time frames in the future (years 2030, 2050 and 2080). We identified that most of the climatically suitable habitats of Nilgiri Tahr would become unsuitable when global warming intensifies. Our models predicted a complete loss of suitable habitats in many existing protected areas in the Western Ghats. We use insights provided by our modeling results to propose conservation management plans to increase the likelihood of persistence of Nilgiri Tahr in the Western Ghats.

AB  - Beyond providing critical information to biologists, species distributions are useful for naturalists, curious citizens, and applied disciplines including conservation planning and medical intervention. Venomous snakes are one group that highlight the importance of having accurate information given their cosmopolitan distribution and medical significance. Envenomation by snakebite is considered a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization and venomous snake distributions are used to assess vulnerability to snakebite based on species occurrence and antivenom/healthcare accessibility. However, recent studies highlighted the need for updated fine-scale distributions of venomous snakes. Pitvipers (Viperidae: Crotalinae) are responsible for >98% of snakebites in the New World. Therefore, to begin to address the need for updated fine-scale distributions, we created VenomMaps, a database and web application containing updated distribution maps and species distribution models for all species of New World pitvipers. With these distributions, biologists can better understand the biogeography and conservation status of this group, researchers can better assess vulnerability to snakebite, and medical professionals can easily discern species found in their area.T

AB  - Population declines of many wildlife species have been linked to habitat loss incurred through land-use change. Incorporation of conservation planning into development planning may mitigate these impacts. The threatened Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is experiencing loss of native habitat and high levels of energy development across its multijurisdictional range. Our goal was to explore relationships of the species occurrence with landscape characteristics and anthropogenic effects influencing its distribution through evaluation of habitat suitability associated with one particular habitat usage, lekking. Lekking has been relatively well-surveyed, though not consistently, in all jurisdictions. All five states in which Lesser Prairie-Chickens occur cooperated in development of a Maxent habitat suitability model. We created two models, one with state as a factor and one without state. When state was included it was the most important predictor, followed by percent of land cover consisting of known or suspected used vegetation classes within a 5000 m area around a lek. Without state, land cover was the most important predictor of relative habitat suitability for leks. Among the anthropogenic predictors, landscape condition, a measure of human impact integrated across several factors, was most important, ranking third in importance without state. These results quantify the relative suitability of the landscape within the current occupied range of Lesser Prairie-Chickens. These models, combined with other landscape information, form the basis of a habitat assessment tool that can be used to guide siting of development projects and targeting of areas for conservation.

AB  - Climate change risk assessments are essential for the successful conservation and management of species under future climates. However, many management plans fail to include such assessments when evaluating threats to species or ecological communities. Species distribution models (SDMs) are versatile tools that can estimate species exposure to shifts in climate, but they lack information on the response capacity of species to climate change. Functional traits can be used in conjunction with SDMs to understand aspects of species biology that would suggest sensitivity to climate change. We illustrate how exposure to climate change and sensitivity of species based on their traits can be combined to generate predictions of climate change risk in four species listed as threatened (under state and federal legislation) and four unlisted plant species from the endemic Australian genus Persoonia (Proteaceae). We develop distribution models for each species using two emissions scenarios and assess four traits and two range metrics that are recognized as limiting factors in four potential climate change responses (reproduction, movement capability, habitat specialization, and spatial coverage) to assess the sensitivity of these eight species to climate change. Listed and unlisted species varied in niche breadth, environmental envelopes, and the percent contribution of variables to the model building process. Our models project a significant decline in habitat suitability under future climates at current occurrence locations for all species, and a 32-95% reduction in the total area (km2) of suitable habitat for all species by 2060, with significantly greater decline under the higher emissions scenario. Seven out of the eight species assessed ranked high for overall climate sensitivity therefore listing status may be a poor indicator of climate change risk to plant species. This has important implications for the continued focus on threatened taxa in conservation planning, particularly for hyper-diverse groups like plants and invertebrates where a species listing status is influenced by an oftenslow progress towards comprehensive assessments of threat status.

AB  - Despite much discussion about the utility of remote sensing for effective conservation, the inclusion of these technologies in species recovery plans remains largely anecdotal. We developed a modeling approach for the integration of local, spatially measured ecosystem functional dynamics into a species distribution modeling (SDM) framework in which other ecologically relevant factors are modeled separately at broad scales. To illustrate the approach, we incorporated intraseasonal water-vegetation dynamics into a cross-scale SDM for the Common Snipe (Gallinago gallinago), which is highly dependent on water and vegetation dynamics. The Common Snipe is an Iberian grassland waterbird characteristic of European agricultural meadows and a member of one of the most threatened bird guilds. The intraseasonal dynamics of water content of vegetation were measured using the standard deviation of the normalized difference water index time series computed from bimonthly images of the Sentinel-2 satellite. The recovery plan for the Common Snipe in Galicia (northwestern Iberian Peninsula) provided an opportunity to apply our modeling framework. Model accuracy in predicting the species' distribution at a regional scale (resulting from integration of downscaled climate projections with regional habitat-topographic suitability models) was very high (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.981 and Boyce's index of 0.971). Local water-vegetation dynamic models, based exclusively on Sentinel-2 imagery, were good predictors (AUC of 0.849 and Boyce's index of 0.976). The predictive power improved (AUC of 0.92 and Boyce's index of 0.98) when local model predictions were restricted to areas identified by the continental and regional models as priorities for conservation. Our models also performed well (AUC of 0.90 and Boyce's index of 0.93) when projected to updated water-vegetation conditions. Our modeling framework enabled incorporation of key ecosystem processes closely related to water and carbon cycles while accounting for other factors ecologically relevant to endangered grassland waterbirds across different scales, allowed identification of priority areas for conservation, and provided an opportunity for cost-effective recovery planning by monitoring management effectiveness from space.

AB  - Despite wide evidence of a quickly changing world, systematic conservation planning analyses are usually static assuming that the biodiversity being preserved in sites do not change through time. Here we generated a comprehensive ensemble forecasting experiment for 444 amphibian species inhabiting the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot. Models were based on four methods for modeling ecological niches, and three future climate simulations. Combinations of these models were used to estimate species occurrences. We used species occurrences to optimize the current and future representation of amphibians with different conservation targets based on their geographic range size. We compared spatial priority outcomes (variance of site selection frequency scores) under dynamic conditions, using a bi-dimensional plot in which the relative importance of each site in achieving conservation targets was assessed both for current time and to 2050. Projections for 2050 show that species richness pattern will remain approximately constant, whereas high turnover rates are forecasted. Selection frequency of several locations varied widely, with recurrent sites located at the north and southeast of the biome. As for 2050, spatial priorities concentrate in the northern part of the biome. Thirty-three sites have high priority for conservation as they play an important role now and will still stand as priority locations in 2050. We present a conceptual model for dynamic spatial conservation prioritization that helps to identify priority sites under climate change. We also call attention to sites in which risk of investment is high, and to those that may become interesting options in the future.

AB  - A global strategy is necessary to achieve the level of coordination, synergy and therefore optimization of resources to achieve the broad goal of conserving mammals worldwide. Key elements for the development of such a strategy include: an institutional subject that owns the strategy; broad conservation goals, quantitative targets derived from them and appropriate indicators; data on the distribution of species, their threats, the cost-effectiveness of conservation actions; and a set of methods for the identification of conservation priorities. Previous global mammal research investigated phylogeny, extinction risk, and the species and areas that should be regarded as global conservation priorities. This theme issue presents new key elements: an updated Red List Index, a new list of evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species, new high-resolution mammal distribution models, a global connectivity analysis and scenarios of future mammal distribution based on climate and land-cover change. Area prioritization schemes account for mammalian phylogeny, governance and cost-benefit of measures to abate habitat loss. Three discussion papers lay the foundations for the development of a global unifying mammal conservation strategy, which should not be further deterred by the knowledge gaps still existing.

AB  - Premise of the study : Oaks are dominant trees and key species in many temperate and subtropical forests in the world. In this study, we analyzed patterns of distribution of red oaks (Quercus, section Lobatae) occurring in Mexico and Central America to determine areas of species richness and endemism to propose areas of conservation.
   Methods : Patterns of richness and endemism of 75 red oak species were analyzed using three different units. Two complementarity algorithms based on species richness and three algorithms based on species rarity were used to identify important areas for conservation. A simulated annealing analysis was performed to evaluate and formulate effective new reserves for red oaks that are useful for conserving the ecosystems associated with them after the systematic conservation planning approach.
   Key results : Two main centers of species richness were detected. The northern Sierra Madre Oriental and Serranias Meridionales of Jalisco had the highest values of endemism. Fourteen areas were considered as priorities for conservation of red oak species based on the 26 priority political entities, 11 floristic units and the priority grid-cells obtained in the complementarity analysis. In the present network of Natural Protected Areas in Mexico and Central America, only 41.3% (31 species) of the red oak species are protected. The simulated annealing analysis indicated that to protect all 75 species of red oaks, 12 current natural protected areas need to be expanded by 120 000 ha of additional land, and 26 new natural protected areas with 512 500 ha need to be created.
   Conclusions : Red oaks are a useful model to identify areas for conservation based on species richness and endemism as a result of their wide geographic distribution and a high number of species. We evaluated and reformulated new reserves for red oaks that are also useful for the conservation of ecosystems associated with them.

AB  - Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) can help conservation planning by forecasting environmental suitability for an endangered species. Here, SDMs were constructed for stone crayfish (Austropotamobius torrentium) and white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes s. str.) to identify catchments in south-western Germany where environmental conditions are favourable for reintroduction. Maximum-entropy modelling (Maxent) was used with presence-only data to forecast environmental suitability for the two crayfish species based on five climate variables, slope, land cover, and a human impact index. SDMs showed good to excellent performance and were able to capture the range of both Austropotamobius species. Presence probabilities were mostly determined by climate variables, and climate niches partly overlap, with white-clawed crayfish occurring at conditions with less extreme winter temperatures and lower temperature seasonality than stone crayfish. Human impact contributed between 10 and 27% to the models and was negatively related to presence probabilities. Contribution of land cover was low (5%) but showed a positive relationship with deciduous broadleaf forest in both species. Both SDMs indicated several catchments with high predicted environmental suitability but no present occurrence records. Subsequent crayfish and habitat surveys in these catchments revealed four streams considered suitable for reintroduction and led to discovery of five previously unknown white-clawed crayfish populations. Overall, SDMs proved to be a powerful tool for conservation planning of freshwater crayfish species.

AB  - The Himalayan red panda is an endangered mammal endemic to Eastern Himalayan and South Western China. Data deficiency often hinders understanding of their spatial distribution and habitat use, which is critical for species conservation planning. We used sign surveys covering the entire potential red panda habitat over 22,453 km(2) along the mid-hills and high mountains encompassing six conservation complexes in Nepal. To estimate red panda distribution using an occupancy framework, we walked 1,451 km along 446 sampled grid cells out of 4,631 grid cells in the wet season of 2016. We used single-species, single-season models to make inferences regarding covariates influencing detection and occupancy. We estimated the probability of detection and occupancy based on model-averaging techniques and drew predictive maps showing site-specific occupancy estimates. We observed red panda in 213 grid cells and found covariates such as elevation, distance to water sources, and bamboo cover influencing the occupancy. Red panda detection probability (p) over cap (SE) estimated at 0.70 (0.02). We estimated red panda site occupancy (sampled grid cells) and landscape occupancy (across the potential habitat) (psi) over cap (SE) at 0.48 (0.01) and 0.40 (0.02) respectively. The predictive map shows a site-specific variation in the spatial distribution of this arboreal species along the priority red panda conservation complexes. Data on their spatial distribution may serve as a baseline for future studies and are expected to aid in species conservation planning in priority conservation complexes.

AB  - Multiple-use public lands require balancing diverse resource uses and values across landscapes. In the California desert, there is strong interest in renewable energy development and important conservation concerns. The Bureau of Land Management recently completed a land-use plan for the area that provides protection for modeled suitable habitat for multiple rare plants. Three sets of habitat models were commissioned for plants of conservation concern as part of the planning effort. The Bureau of Land Management then needed to determine which model or combination of models to use to implement plan requirements. Our goals were to: 1) develop a process for evaluating the existing habitat models and 2) use the evaluation results to map probable and potential suitable habitat. We developed a method for evaluating the construction (input data and methods) and performance of existing models and applied it to 88 habitat models for 43 rare plant species. We also developed a process for mapping probable and potential suitable habitat based on the existing models; potential habitat maps are intended only to guide future field surveys. We were able to map probable suitable habitat for 26 of the 43 species and potential suitable habitat for 41 species. Forty percent of the project area contains probable suitable habitat for at least one species (43,338 km 2), with much of that habitat (43%) occurring on lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Lands prioritized for renewable energy development contain 3% of the habitat modeled as suitable for at least one species. Our products can be used by agencies to review proposed projects and plan future plant surveys and by developers to target sites likely to minimize conflicts with rare plant conservation goals. Our methods can be broadly applied to understand and quantify the defensibility of models used in conservation and regulatory contexts.

AB  - Spatial conservation prioritization should seek to anticipate climate change impacts on biodiversity and to mitigate these impacts through the development of dynamic conservation plans. Here, we defined spatial priorities for the conservation of amphibians inhabiting the Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot that overcome the likely impacts of climate change on the distribution of this imperiled fauna. First, we built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 431 amphibian species both for current time and for the mid-point of a 30-year period spanning 2071-2099 (i.e. 2080). For modeling species' niches, we combined six modeling methods and three different climate models. We also quantified and mapped model uncertainties. Our consensus models forecasted range shifts that culminate with high species richness in central and eastern Atlantic Forest, both for current time and for 2080. Most species had a significant range contraction (up to 72%) and 12% of species were projected to be regionally extinct. Most species would need to disperse because suitable climatic sites will change. Therefore, we identified a network of priority sites for conservation that minimizes the distance a given species would need to disperse because of changes in future habitat suitability (i.e. climate-forced dispersal) as well as uncertainties associated to ENMs. This network also maximized complementary species representation across currently established protected areas. Priority sites already include possible dispersal corridors linking current and future suitable habitats for amphibians. Although we used the a top-ranked Biodiversity Hotspot and amphibians as a case study for illustrating our approach, our study may help developing more effective conservation strategies under climate change, especially when applied at different spatial scales, geographic regions, and taxonomic groups.

AB  - Context. Tropical ecosystems are widely recognised for their high species richness and outstanding concentrations of rare and endemic species. Previous studies either focussed on the effects of deforestation or climate change, whereas studies on the combined effects of these two major threats are limited.
   Aims. This research aimed to model current and future distributions of medium-to large-sized mammal species on the basis of different land-use and climate-change scenarios in 2050 and to assess whether the predicted effects of land-use change are greater than those of climate change and whether the combined effects of these drivers are greater than those of either individual driver.
   Methods. The present article demonstrates a method for combining nationwide wildlife-inventory data, spatially explicit species-distribution models, current and predicted future bioclimatic variables, other biophysical factors and human disturbance to map distributions of mammal species on the basis of different land-use and climate-change scenarios and to assess the role of protected areas in conservation planning.
   Key results. Seventeen medium-to large-sized mammal species were selected for modelling. Most selected species were predicted to lose suitable habitat if the remaining forest cover declines from the current level of 57% to 50% in 2050. The predicted effects of deforestation were stronger than the effects of climate change. When climate and land-use change were combined, the predicted impacts were more severe. Most species would lose suitable habitat and the average shift in species distribution was greater than 40%.
   Conclusions. The predicted effects were positive for only a few species and negative for most species. Current and future centres of mammal-species richness were predicted in large and contiguous protected forests and the average contribution of existing and proposed protected areas in protecting the focal species will increase from 73% to 80% across all scenarios.
   Implications. The present research advances the current understanding of the ecology of 17 medium-to large-sized mammal species with conservation relevance and the factors that affect their distributions at the landscape scale. In addition, the research demonstrated that spatially explicit models and protected areas are effective means to contribute to protection of mammal species in current and future land-use and climate-change scenarios.

AB  - As a megadiverse country with three global biodiversity hotspots, a growing human population, and a rapidly developing economy, South Africa exemplifies the challenges facing modern conservation biology. South Africa has established a protected areas network which encompasses 1527 National Parks, nature reserves, wilderness areas, mountain catchment areas, and World Heritage sites. However, the contribution of South Africa's protected areas to biodiversity conservation remains poorly known as many currently protected areas were selected based on the affordability of land or simply situated on sites that were unsuitable for commercial activities, rather than on the biological diversity within them. Here, we model the distribution of > 10,000 species, representing South Africa's endemic flora, to evaluate the conservation effectiveness of the current protected areas network. We show that the flora within protected areas has been better sampled than sites outside of protected areas. However, the current protected areas network fails to adequately encompass threatened taxa, many of which are found in threatened ecosystems. We identify locations that represent important conservation gaps, and we suggest that these areas should be included in future conservation planning.

AB  - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is responsible for reviewing the biological status of hundreds of species to determine federal status designations under the Endangered Species Act. The longleaf pine Pinus palustris ecological system supports many priority at-risk species designated for review, including five species of herpetofauna: gopher tortoise Gopherus polyphemus, southern hognose snake Heterodon simus, Florida pine snake Pituophis melanoleucus mugitus, gopher frog Lithobates (Rana) capito, and striped newt Notophthalmus perstriatus. To inform status decisions and conservation planning, we developed habitat suitability models to 1) identify habitat features that best predict species presence and 2) estimate the amount and distribution of suitable habitat across each species' range under current conditions. We incorporated expert judgment from federal, state, and other partners to capture variation in ecological settings across species' ranges, prioritize predictor variables to test in models, mitigate data limitations by informing the selection of pseudoabsence points, qualitatively evaluate model estimates, and improve the likelihood that experts will trust and use model predictions for conservation. Soil characteristics, land cover, and fire interval strongly influenced habitat suitability for all species. Suitable habitat was distributed on known species strongholds, as well as private lands without known species records. Between 4.7% (gopher frog) and 14.6% (gopher tortoise) of the area in a species' range was classified as suitable habitat, and between 28.1% (southern hognose snake) and 47.5% (gopher frog) of suitable habitat was located in patches larger than 1 km(2) (100 ha) on publicly owned lands. By overlaying predictions for each species, we identified areas of suitable habitat for multiple species on protected and unprotected lands. These results have direct applications to management and conservation planning: partners can tailor site-level management based on attributes associated with high habitat suitability for species of concern; allocate survey effort in areas with suitable habitat but no known species records; and identify priority areas for management, land acquisitions, or other strategies based on the distribution of species records, suitable habitat, and land protection status. These results can aid regional partners in implementing effective conservation strategies and inform status designation decisions of the USFWS.

AB  - Preliminary, large-scale assessments of global sea-level rise (SLR) have predicted significant impacts to coastal and island biodiversity. Region-specific estimates of SLR impacts that incorporate accurate species distributions and local rates of SLR are now required for effective conservation planning. Here we use a dataset of >13,000 occurrence records for lichens, obligate symbiotic fungi, in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain of eastern North America to model distributions of 193 species. The resulting models were used to quantify the amount of each species' distribution that is occupied by unsuitable land use types, along with the potential area that will be lost to SLR. We show that species have likely already lost an average of 32% of their distributional area to development and agriculture, and are predicted to lose an average of 12.4 and 33.7% of their distributional area with one foot (similar to 0.3 m) and six feet (similar to 1.8 m) of SLR, respectively. Functional and taxonomic groups were compared to identify specific effects of SLR. We show that species reproducing with symbiotic propagules have significantly larger distributions than species that reproduce sexually with fungal spores alone, and that the sexually reproducing species are predicted to lose greater distributional area to SLR. Cladonia species occupy significantly less area in the MACP than Parmotrema species and are predicted to lose more of their distributions to SLR. We further examined patterns of total species diversity and found that the area with the highest diversity is the Dare Peninsula in North Carolina, which is also predicted to lose the most land area to SLR. The workflow established here is flexible and applicable to estimating SLR impacts worldwide and can provide essential insights for local conservation planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Abundance and other aspects of population ecology have long been known to contribute to shaping the geography of species' distributions. In particular, abundance patterns have recently been shown to negatively correlate with environmental distance from conditions in the center of a species' abiotic niche, rather than vary with distance from the geographic center of a species' distribution. We tested for such associations across 8 species of endangered or threatened bird species in North America using population trend data derived from >4 decades of North American Breeding Bird Surveys. Although we found no consistent overall pattern, we did observe negative population trends at conditions that were the most extreme within species' niches. This suggests that niche peripherality is a relevant factor to consider in conservation planning. Specifically, environmentally peripheral sites may be poor places in which to protect populations of endangered and threatened species, irrespective of how centrally they may occur within species' geographic distributions.

AB  - Context Context Bats are considered as an ecological indicator of habitat quality due to their sensitivity to human-induced ecosystem changes. Hence, we will focus the study on two indicator species of bats as a proxy to evaluate structure and composition of the landscape to analyze anthropic pressures driving changes in patterns.
   Objectives This study develops a spatially-explicit model to highlight key habitat nodes and corridors which are integral for maintaining functional landscape connectivity for bat movement. We focus on a complex mountain landscape and two bat species: greater (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) horseshoe bats which are known to be sensitive to landscape composition and configuration.
   Methods Species distribution models are used to delineate high-quality foraging habitat for each species using opportunistic ultrasonic bat data. We then performed connectivity analysis combining (modelled) suitable foraging habitat and (known) roost sites. We use graph-theory and the deviation in the probability of connectivity to quantify resilience of the landscape connectivity to perturbations.
   Results Both species were confined to lowlands (< 1000 m elevation) and avoided areas with high road densities. Greater horseshoe bats were more generalist than lesser horseshoe bats which tended to be associated with broadleaved and mixed forests.
   Conclusions The spatially-explicit models obtained were proven crucial for prioritizing foraging habitats, roost sites and key corridors for conservation. Hence, our results are being used by key stakeholders to help integrate conservation measures into forest management and conservation planning at the regional level. The approach used can be integrated into conservation initiatives elsewhere.

AB  - Conservation planning and biodiversity assessments need quantitative targets to optimize planning options and assess the adequacy of current species protection. However, targets aiming at persistence require population-specific data, which limit their use in favor of fixed and nonspecific targets, likely leading to unequal distribution of conservation efforts among species. We devised a method to derive equitable population targets; that is, quantitative targets of population size that ensure equal probabilities of persistence across a set of species and that can be easily inferred from species-specific traits. In our method, we used models of population dynamics across a range of life-history traits related to species' body mass to estimate minimum viable population targets. We applied our method to a range of body masses of mammals, from 2 g to 3825 kg. The minimum viable population targets decreased asymptotically with increasing body mass and were on the same order of magnitude as minimum viable population estimates from species- and context-specific studies. Our approach provides a compromise between pragmatic, nonspecific population targets and detailed context-specific estimates of population viability for which only limited data are available. It enables a first estimation of species-specific population targets based on a readily available trait and thus allows setting equitable targets for population persistence in large-scale and multispecies conservation assessments and planning.

AB  - The genus Ferocactus has complex taxonomy and phylogenetic and evolutionary history, affected greatly by geographic and reproductive isolation in its diversification and evolution. However, the number of species classified in risk categories is shocking, therefore the knowledge on species' distribution patterns and their environmental determinants, as well as the processes of habitat loss due to land use change is important. In this paper, we used ecological niche modeling to generate potential distribution of nine species of Ferocactus protected by Mexican law, then using geographic information systems we obtained the bioclimatic profile of each species and the influence of climatic variables in their geographic distribution. We also evaluated the effects of the change of land use in their distribution area and estimated the safeguarded area within a Natural Protected Area. The results show that habitat loss is greater in the species whose distribution area is in the center of Mexico compared to those living in the Baja California Peninsula and the representativeness of most species is low in Natural Protected Areas. It might be necessary to re-evaluate the risk categories of species, as well as coordinate efforts to identify potential areas suitable for conservation strategies or recovery plans and to promote the decree of new areas (or extension thereof) to protect the habitat of the species.

AB  - Although most species distribution modeling (SDMs) are constructed at the species level, an appreciation of evolutionary processes has led to modeling above this level. In view of the difficulty in estimating the impacts of human actions on rare or deficient data species, we proposed a new approach to vulnerability assessment based on concepts already well established in the literature (ecological niche, niche conservatism, and extinction thresholds). We used distribution modeling to predict where species of the genus Phyllocycla (Calvert 1948) are most vulnerable to local extinctions and how the implementation of planned anthropic activities by the Brazilian government may modify the potential distribution of the genus in Brazil. We chose that genus because its conservation status is little known, especially due to the data gap about its geographical distribution. We proposed modeling the whole genus and used the niche conservatism theory to justify our methods. The anthropic activities considered in our analysis were agriculture and livestock, rural settlements, energy production installations, transportation, oil extraction, mining, and urbanization. We found that only 55.3% of the original potential distribution of Phyllocycla in Brazil remains available. The area compromised by anthropic activities comprises mainly the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes, with less impact on the Amazon. However, with the implementation of activities planned by the Brazilian government, it is possible that an additional 13.6% of this area will be unavailable to species of Phyllocycla, especially in the Amazon, where interest in mining and the implementation of new hydroelectric production have increased.

AB  - Crop wild relatives (CWR) intra- and interspecific diversity is essential for crop breeding and food security. However, intraspecific genetic diversity, which is central given the idiosyncratic threats to species in landscapes, is usually not considered in planning frameworks. Here, we introduce an approach to develop proxies of genetic differentiation to identify conservation areas, applying systematic conservation planning tools that produce hierarchical prioritizations of the landscape. It accounts for: (i) evolutionary processes, including historical and environmental drivers of genetic diversity, and (ii) threat processes, considering taxa-specific tolerance to human-modified habitats, and their extinction risk status. Our analyses can be used as inputs for developing national action plans for the conservation and use of CWR. Our results also inform public policy to mitigate threat processes to CWR (like crops living modified organisms or agriculture subsidies), and could advise future research (e.g. for potential germplasm collecting). Although we focus on Mesoamerican CWR within Mexico, our methodology offers opportunities to effectively guide conservation and monitoring strategies to safeguard the evolutionary resilience of any taxa, including in regions of complex evolutionary histories and mosaic landscapes.

AB  - As data about populations of indicator species become available, proactive strategies that improve representation of biological diversity within protected area networks should consider finer-scaled evaluations, especially in regions identified as important through course-scale analyses. We use density distribution models derived from a robust regional bird abundance dataset, coupled with habitat conservation plans, to evaluate a network of protected areas and to inform conservation and biodiversity planning in the greater Klamath Siskiyou Bioregion, an area recognized globally as a region of outstanding biological diversity. Our novel modeling approach allowed for comparisons of abundance of conservation focal species on federal vs. non-federal lands, federal lands that are protected to maintain natural habitats vs. federal lands managed for multiple uses, and seven protected areas of interest. Our comparisons highlight conservation opportunities for suites of species associated with coniferous forests, oak woodlands, and grasslands. Specifically, we found that species associated with oak woodland and grassland habitats, both habitats of conservation concern, were not well represented in the Bioregion's existing protected areas. These species would benefit from expanding the regional protected area network to include their associated at-risk habitats. In contrast, our results suggest that coniferous forests birds are well represented in the Bioregion's protected areas. We identify management opportunities specifically associated with the restoration of fire-adapted ecosystems that would benefit coniferous forest focal species on both federally protected areas and other multiple-use lands. Our analysis provides an example of how a finer-scaled evaluation of a regional protected area network adds value to course-scale evaluations of protected areas and biological diversity. Data and results from this research were used to inform science-based expansion of the Bioregion's network of protected areas.

AB  - Spatial decision-support tools are necessary for assessment and management of threats to biodiversity, which in turn is necessary for biodiversity conservation. In conjunction with the U.S. Geological Survey-Biological Resources Division's Species at Risk program, we developed a GIS-based spatial decision-support tool for relative risk assessments of threats to biodiversity on the U.S. Army's White Sands Missile Range and Fort Bliss (New Mexico and Texas) due to land uses associated with military missions of the two bases. The project tested use of spatial habitat models, land-use scenarios, and species-specific impacts to produce an assessment of relative risks for use in conservation planning on the 1.2 million-hectare study region. Our procedure allows spatially explicit analyses of risks to multiple species from multiple sources by identifying a set of hazards faced by all species of interest, identifying a set of feasible management alternatives, assigning scores to each species for each hazard, and mapping the distribution of these hazard scores across the region of interest for each combination of species/management alternatives. We illustrate the procedure with examples. We demonstrate that our risk-based approach to conservation planning can provide resource managers with a useful tool for spatial assessment of threats to species of concern.

AB  - Fire has shaped Australia?s diverse mammal fauna for millennia. However, ongoing changes to fire regimes threaten native mammal populations, and a significant conservation challenge is to understand and promote desirable forms of pyrodiversity (variation in fire regimes). A way forward is to quantify how different aspects of pyrodiversity influence whole mammal assemblages and produce dynamic maps of species distributions to inform conservation. We aimed to determine and map how spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes correlates with a diverse mammal assemblage comprising macropods, microbats, rodents, small marsupials and a monotreme. We built species distribution models for 17 species against fire, climate and environmental covariates in fire-prone woodlands of semi-arid Australia. Spatial measures of fire included the area, diversity and configuration of landscape elements, and temporal measures included time since fire and fire frequency. Native mammals showed a variety of responses to pyrodiversity. Microbats were more likely to occur as time since fire increased, whereas rodents were correlated with recently burned areas. Small dasyurid marsupials were correlated with the area of older post-fire age-classes, while western grey kangaroo occurrence was positively associated with high diversity of post-fire ages. Our new approach, using predictive models to map mammal distributions in relation to spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes, provides outputs that managers can use to improve conservation planning. This enables the positive and negative effects of fire to be better understood and will assist in achieving desirable forms of pyrodiversity that meet the needs of whole mammal assemblages.

AB  - Climate change affects both habitat suitability and the genetic diversity of wild plants. Therefore, predicting and establishing the most effective and coherent conservation areas is essential for the conservation of genetic diversity in response to climate change. This is because genetic variance is a product not only of habitat suitability in conservation areas but also of efficient protection and management. Phellodendron amurense Rupr. is a tree species (family Rutaceae) that is endangered due to excessive and illegal harvesting for use in Chinese medicine. Here, we test a general computational method for the prediction of priority conservation areas (PCAs) by measuring the genetic diversity of P. amurense across the entirety of northeast China using a single strand repeat analysis of twenty microsatellite markers. Using computational modeling, we evaluated the geographical distribution of the species, both now and in different future climate change scenarios. Different populations were analyzed according to genetic diversity, and PCAs were identified using a spatial conservation prioritization framework. These conservation areas were optimized to account for the geographical distribution of P. amurense both now and in the future, to effectively promote gene flow, and to have a long period of validity. In situ and ex situ conservation, strategies for vulnerable populations were proposed. Three populations with low genetic diversity are predicted to be negatively affected by climate change, making conservation of genetic diversity challenging due to decreasing habitat suitability. Habitat suitability was important for the assessment of genetic variability in existing nature reserves, which were found to be much smaller than the proposed PCAs. Finally, a simple set of conservation measures was established through modeling. This combined molecular and computational ecology approach provides a framework for planning the protection of species endangered by climate change.

AB  - Knowledge of a species' geographic distribution is crucial to assessing its vulnerability. It is also important to know if protected areas provide effective protection for raptor species. Here, we examine the species richness (S) patterns, factors predicting S and the effectiveness of protected areas (EPA) in the conservation of diurnal raptors in Venezuela. We modeled geographic distributions (SDM) of 64 raptor species using ecological niche models. Nine climatic and seven landscape metrics were used as environmental predictors. SDM were stacked to examine S and predictors of S were investigated using regression models. This study evaluated S patterns in the 13 bioregions defined for Venezuela. A gap analysis was performed to evaluate the EPA in the conservation of raptor diversity. Forty species showed a continuous distribution, whereas as disjunct distributions were observed in 24 species. Species richness differed among bioregions; six pairwise compared bioregions did not show differences. Guyana Massif and the mountains of northern Venezuela had the highest species richness. Landscape features, specifically canopy height, land cover and terrain slope explained most of the species richness. Environmental heterogeneity affected the distribution of S and is therefore important in conservation planning for Neotropical raptors. Responses from environmental variables used to predict S were scale dependent; it is necessary to standardize methods/experimental design to study the biogeography of raptors. Priority-setting for the conservation of raptors in Venezuela must consider restricted range species, even if they are not threatened. A new territorial ordering is urgent to improve the protection of this group of birds.

AB  - Zoning is an effective way to achieve regional planning and construction as well as standardized management. Efficient management zone designations would contribute to strengthening endangered species and biodiversity conservation of nature reserves. We evaluated the conservation effectiveness of the Baihuashan National Nature Reserve (BNNR), which was established primarily to conserve the vulnerable Brown Eared-Pheasant (Crossoptilon mantchuricum). We used species distribution models (SDMs) and GAP analysis to assess that the suitability of current functional zoning efforts to the protection of this species. Our results showed that current functional zoning is not adequate for protecting the Brown Eared-pheasant in BNNR. To optimize the conservation effectiveness for this species, we recommend a new functional zoning strategy be employed at BNNR, which is based on the distribution of the Brown Eared-pheasant and on the local economy. Our study thus provides a new strategy for optimizing the conservation effectiveness of functional zoning in nature reserves.

AB  - For 107 endemic mammal species in the Afro-Arabian region, Sahara-Sahel and Arabian Desert, we used ensemble species distribution models to: (1) identify the hotspot areas for conservation, (2) assess the potential impact of the projected climate change on the distribution of the focal species, and (3) assign IUCN threat categories for the focal species according to the predicted changes in their potential distribution range. We identified two main hotspot areas for endemic mammals: the Sinai and its surrounding coastal area in the East, and the Mediterranean Coast around Morocco in the West. Alarmingly, our results indicate that about 17% of the endemic mammals in the AfroArabian region under the current climate change scenarios could go extinct before 2050. Overall, a substantial number of the endemic species will change from the IUCN threat category "Least Concern" to "Critically Endangered" or "Extinct" in the coming decades. Accordingly, we call for implementing an urgent proactive conservation action for these endemic species, particularly those that face a high risk of extinction in the next few years. The results of our study provide conservation managers and practitioners with the required information for implementing an effective conservation plan to protect the biodiversity of the Afro-Arabian region.

AB  - Decision-support tools are commonly used to maximize return on investments (ROI) in conservation. We evaluated how the relative value of information on biodiversity features and land cost varied with data structure and variability, attributes of focal species and conservation targets, and habitat suitability thresholds for contrasting bird communities in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Specifically, we used spatial distribution maps for 20 bird species, land values, and an integer linear programming model to prioritize land units (1 km(2)) that met conservation targets at the lowest estimated cost (hereafter 'efficiency'). Across scenarios, the relative value of biodiversity data increased with conservation targets, as higher thresholds for suitable habitat were applied, and when focal species occurred disproportionately on land of high assessed value. Incorporating land cost generally improved planning efficiency, but at diminishing rates as spatial variance in biodiversity features relative to land cost increased. Our results offer a precise, empirical demonstration of how spatiallyoptimized planning solutions are influenced by spatial variation in underlying feature layers. We also provide guidance to planners seeking to maximize efficiency in data acquisition and resolve potential trade-offs when setting targets and thresholds in financially-constrained, spatial planning efforts aimed at maximizing ROI in biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Effective conservation of rare plant species requires a detailed understanding of their unique distributions and habitat requirements to identify conservation targets. Research suggests that local conservation efforts may be one of the best means for accomplishing this task. We conducted a geographical analysis of the local distributions of rare plants in Napa County, California, to identify spatial relationships with individual habitat types. We measured the potential contribution of individual habitats to rare plant conservation by integrating analyses on overall diversity, species per area, specificity-weighted richness, presence of hotspots, and the composition of the rare plant community in each habitat type. This combination of analyses allowed us to determine which habitats are most significant for rare plant conservation at a local scale. Our analyses indicated that several habitat types were consistently associated with rare plant species. In broad terms, grasslands, oak forests, coniferous forests, wetlands, serpentines, chaparral, and rock outcrops were most consistently highlighted. No single habitat stood out in every analysis however, and therefore we conclude that careful selection of an assemblage of habitats that best represents diverse, restricted and unique rare plant communities will be the most efficient approach to protecting rare plant habitat at local scales. Accordingly we present a means of identifying conservation targets and protecting global biodiversity through local efforts.

AB  - Mexican humid lowland tropical. forests have seen extensive perturbation and deforestation in recent decades, and, as such, effective conservation planning is crucial. We developed ecological niche models and predicted geographic distributions for 89 species of birds ecologically restricted to Mexican rain forests, and used heuristic complementarity algorithms to identify priority areas for conservation. Our results focused on a single contiguous region of northern Chiapas as a key area - all, species except three were predicted to co-occur in this area, which is made up of thremne highly complementary sub-areas. The relationship between this area and existing protected areas was explored, and concrete recommendations made for modification of existing protected areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The Paris Conference of Parties (COP21) agreement renewed momentum for action against climate change, creating the space for solutions for conservation of the ocean addressing two of its largest threats: climate change and ocean acidification (CCOA). Recent arguments that ocean policies disregard a mature conservation research field and that protected areas cannot address climate change may be oversimplistic at this time when dynamic solutions for the management of changing oceans are needed. We propose a novel approach, based on spatial meta-analysis of climate impact models, to improve the positioning of marine protected areas to limit CCOA impacts. We do this by estimating the vulnerability of ocean ecosystems to CCOA in a spatially explicit manner and then co-mapping human activities such as the placement of renewable energy developments and the distribution of marine protected areas. We test this approach in the NE Atlantic considering also how CCOA impacts the base of the food web which supports protected species, an aspect often neglected in conservation studies. We found that, in this case, current regional conservation plans protect areas with low ecosystem-level vulnerability to CCOA, but disregard how species may redistribute to new, suitable and productive habitats. Under current plans, these areas remain open to commercial extraction and other uses. Here, and worldwide, ocean conservation strategies under CCOA must recognize the long-term importance of these habitat refuges, and studies such as this one are needed to identify them. Protecting these areas creates adaptive, climate-ready and ecosystem-level policy options for conservation, suitable for changing oceans.

AB  - This study uses a scenario-based approach to ask what are the varying impacts to forest extent and biodiversity from sixteen climate change and forest conversion scenario combinations, and what do they suggest about future forest conservation policy directions? We projected these combinations onto existing forests in South Korea and grouped them into four forest categories. We used species distribution models for 1031 climate vulnerable plant species as a biodiversity index, and found that species richness loss due to forest conversion could be reduced significantly by deploying the scenarios which preserve forest areas that are climatically suitable for these species. Climate-suitable forest areas declined sharply and moved northward as future temperatures increase, and climate-suitable areas lost the highest proportion of forest extent under the current trend of forest conversion. We suggest climate refugia, defined as existing forests with suitable future climates, be protected from land use conversion as a way to preserve forest biodiversity. These spatially explicit results can be used for developing forest conservation policies, and the methods may be applicable to other forested regions. However, planners should consider the assumptions and uncertainties of climate projections, species distribution models, and land use trends when addressing forest biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Fishing and habitat degradation have increased the extinction risk of sharks, and conservation strategies recognize that survival of juveniles is critical for the effective management of shark populations. Despite the rapid expansion of marine protected areas (MPAs) globally, the paucity of shark-monitoring data on large scales (100s-1000s km) means that the effectiveness of MPAs in halting shark declines remains unclear. Using data collected by baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS) in northwestern Australia, we developed generalized linear models to elucidate the ecological drivers of habitat suitability for juvenile sharks. We assessed occurrence patterns at the order and species levels. We included all juvenile sharks sampled and the 3 most abundant species sampled separately (grey reef [Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos], sandbar [Carcharhinus plumbeus], and whitetip reef sharks [Triaenodon obesus]). We predicted the occurrence of juvenile sharks across 490,515 km(2) of coastal waters and quantified the representation of highly suitable habitats within MPAs. Our species-level models had higher accuracy (k >= 0.69) and deviance explained (>= 48%) than our order-level model (k = 0.36 and deviance explained of 10%). Maps of predicted occurrence revealed different species-specific patterns of highly suitable habitat. These differences likely reflect different physiological or resource requirements between individual species and validate concerns over the utility of conservation targets based on aggregate species groups as opposed to a species-focused approach. Highly suitable habitats were poorly represented in MPAs with the most restrictions on extractive activities. This spatial mismatch possibly indicates a lack of explicit conservation targets and information on species distribution during the planning process. Non-extractive BRUVS provided a useful platform for building the suitability models across large scales to assist conservation planning across multiple maritime jurisdictions, and our approach provides a simple for method for testing the effectiveness of MPAs.

AB  - Citizen science is a powerful tool for collecting large volumes of observational data on various species. These data are used to estimate distributions using environmental factors with Species Distribution Models (SDM). However, if citizens are inexperienced in recognizing organisms, they may report different species as the subject species. Here we show nation-wide bumblebee distributions using photographs taken by citizens in our project, and estimated distributions for six bumblebee species using land use, climate, and altitude data with SDM. We identified species from photographic images, and took their locations from GPS data of photographs or the text in e-mails. When we compared our data with conventional data for specimens in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), we found that the volume and the number of species were larger, and the bias of spatial range was lower, than those of GBIF. Our estimated distributions were more consistent with bumblebee distributions reported in previous studies than with those of GBIF. Our method was effective for collecting distribution data, and estimating distributions with SDM. The estimated SDM allows us to predict the previous and future species distributions, and to develop conservation policies taking account of future city planning and/ or global climate changes.

AB  - Protected areas have been established historically in residual places where the potential for extractive uses is low, implying that places at risk are usually under-protected. Argentina is no exception, with few protected areas established in productive regions that are prone to conversion. Here, using reptiles as a study group and considering the most important human threats in north-western Argentina, we estimated priority conservation areas where we expect species to persist in the face of climate change and land conversion. Protected areas cover no more than 9% of the study region, but represent less than 15% of reptile distributions. There are great opportunities for improving the conservation status in the region by protecting only 8% more of north-western Argentina, with the level of species protection inside the protected area network increasing almost four-fold, reaching 43% of species distributions on average and 59% of the distributions of threatened reptiles. Fortunately, the highest diversity of reptiles in the region does not match the places targeted for agriculture expansion. Our findings suggest that future prioritization schemes should embrace other groups that are especially diverse in the Chaco ecoregion, which overlaps with our study area.

AB  - Urban habitats, particularly wastelands and brownfields, maintain rich biodiversity and offer habitat for many species, even rare and endangered taxa. However, such habitats are also under socio-economic pressures due to redevelopment for housing and industrial uses. In order to maintain urban biodiversity, it is currently unknown how much open area must be preserved and whether conservation is possible without complete exclusion from economic development. In this study, we applied a simulation model based on species distribution models for plants, grasshoppers, and leafhoppers to investigate planning options for urban conservation with special focus on business areas. Altogether, we modelled the occurrence of 81 species of the urban species pool and analysed settings of different proportions of open sites, different habitat turnover times, and different lot sizes. Our simulations demonstrated that dynamic land use supports urban biodiversity in terms of species richness and rarity. Setting aside brownfields before redevelopment for a period of on average 15 years supported the highest conservation value. Consequently, we recommend integrating the concept of 'temporary conservation' into urban planning for industrial and business areas. This concept requires habitat to be destroyed by redeveloping brownfield sites to built-up sites, but simultaneously creating new open spaces due to abandonment of urban land uses at other locations. This maintains a spatio-temporal mosaic of different successional stages ranging from pioneer to pre-forest communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Orchids are among the most threatened plants due to habitat loss and illegal harvesting for horticultural demands. Sabah is a centre of orchid diversity, with approximately 1300 species of which 250 orchid taxa are endemic to Sabah. In this study, we conducted an IUCN Red List assessment on 136 endemic species and used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) to develop species distribution models for 47 species. The species distribution models were developed using presence-only data and six environmental predictors. The accuracy of the models were assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and models with an AUC of higher than 0.8 stacked together to produce a species richness heatmap. We found that 83% of the researched species were threatened, of which 14 species were assessed to be Critically Endangered, eight species as Endangered and 93 species as Vulnerable. The heatmap shows that all of the species occurred within the Totally Protected Area (TPA) network in western Sabah. The heatmap highlighted the mid-altitude areas adjacent to the Kinabalu and Crocker Range parks and Ulu Sipitang regions as areas with a high species richness that were outside the TPA network. These areas are also important for the conservation of the majority of the species assessed as Critically Endangered and Endangered. Urgent conservation actions are needed to protect these species from extinction. The results from this work will be used as part of an intensive conservation action plan for threatened endemic orchids of Sabah and used to identify important plant areas currently not within the existing TPA network.

AB  - 1. Climate change represents a major challenge for conservation in the future and undermines protection within reserve boundaries. Freshwater biodiversity is still under-represented within reserves world-wide, and connectivity among reserves will become increasingly crucial if species are to persist under climate change.
   2. We tested the likely benefits of including predicted species distributions in systematic reserve design for rivers under climate change and the impact of varying connectivity requirements on future representation.
   3. We used the modelled distribution of 126 east Australian Odonata to identify reserve networks using data for current or future (2055 and 2085) distributions either by filling gaps additively, or as separate targets in a single solution. We then assessed the potential improvements to species representation in the future using different types of connectivity penalties that emphasized either longitudinal riverine connections or connections to all neighbouring subcatchments.
   4. Solutions that did not include future distributions in the planning stages were 16 to 30% less likely to protect the same species by 2055 and 2085, respectively. Inclusion of species' future distributions in the design phase leads to short-term increases in cost, but in the longer term fewer additional areas are required to meet targets and this strategy is likely to be significantly more efficient than implementing systematic design in stages. In addition, solely targeting riverine connectivity was significantly less likely to protect current species in the future than if cross-catchment connections were included.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Where protected areas can be expanded to assist species adaptation to climate change, significant gains in efficiency are possible if longer term goals are considered when selecting sites. Furthermore, to improve the representation of species under future climates, reserve selection should consider inter-catchment connectivity, although the nature of optimal solutions will depend heavily on the range of taxa included, their dispersal capacity, and the availability of climatic refugia.

AB  - One of the risks faced by habitat restoration practitioners is whether habitats included in restoration planning will be used by the target species or, conversely, whether habitats excluded from restoration planning would have benefited the target species. With the goal of providing a quantitative decision-making approach that represented varying levels of risk tolerance, we used multiple probability decision thresholds (PDT) to predict the range of occurrence for three anadromous fishes (Oncorhynchus spp.) in a watershed in southwestern Washington, USA. For each species, we compared the predicted range of occurrence to the distribution used for restoration planning and quantified the amount of habitat blocked by anthropogenic barriers. Coho salmon (O. kisutch) had the broadest predicted range of occurrence (3061.6-6357.9 km; 0.75-0.25 PDT), followed by steelhead trout (O. mykiss; 1828.8-2836.8 km) and chum salmon (O. keta; 1373.9-1629.1 km). For each species, the predicted range of occurrence was similar or greater than the distribution used for restoration planning, suggesting that the current plan may exclude habitats that would benefit each species. Coho salmon had the greatest percentage of habitat blocked by anthropogenic barriers, followed by steelhead trout and chum salmon, respectively. Modeling species distributions at multiple risk-tolerance scenarios acknowledges uncertainty in restoration planning and allows practitioners to weigh the ecological benefits and budgetary constraints when considering locations for restoration. To effectively communicate restoration science to support practitioners in decision-making, we developed an R Shiny application online user interface available at: .

AB  - Aim
   Data shortages mean that conservation priorities can be highly sensitive to historical patterns of exploration. Here, we investigate the potential of regionally focussed species distribution models to elucidate fine-scale patterns of richness, rarity and endemism.
   Location
   Eastern Arc Mountains, Tanzania and Kenya.
   Methods
   Generalized additive models and land cover data are used to estimate the distributions of 452 forest plant taxa (trees, lianas, shrubs and herbs). Presence records from a newly compiled database are regressed against environmental variables in a stepwise multimodel. Estimates of occurrence in forest patches are collated across target groups and analysed alongside inventory-based estimates of conservation priority.
   Results
   Predicted richness is higher than observed richness, with the biggest disparities in regions that have had the least research. North Pare and Nguu in particular are predicted to be more important than the inventory data suggest. Environmental conditions in parts of Nguru could support as many range-restricted and endemic taxa as Uluguru, although realized niches are subject to unknown colonization histories. Concentrations of rare plants are especially high in the Usambaras, a pattern mediated in models by moisture indices, whilst overall richness is better explained by temperature gradients. Tree data dominate the botanical inventory; we find that priorities based on other growth forms might favour the mountains in a different order.
   Main conclusions
   Distribution models can provide conservation planning with high-resolution estimates of richness in well-researched areas, and predictive estimates of conservation importance elsewhere. Spatial and taxonomic biases in the data are essential considerations, as is the spatial scale used for models. We caution that predictive estimates are most uncertain for the species of highest conservation concern, and advocate using models and targeted field assessments iteratively to refine our understanding of which areas should be prioritised for conservation.

AB  - The contraction of the amount of suitable habitat due to climate change can result in a species becoming threatened with extinction. Strong evidence supports that this effect will be pronounced for several species of small mammals in the near future. We address these issues using the ensemble technique to generate potential distribution models for Neotropical marsupials associated with aquatic environments, Chironectes minimus and Lutreolina crassicaudata, and predict the effects of climate change on the distribution of these two species. We later evaluate the effectiveness of the Fully Protected Areas for the two species in the present and future scenarios. Based on our models, we recommend priority areas for the conservation of these species, emphasizing conservation efforts across borders between countries. Our results indicated that both species will suffer a significant restriction of their potential distributions until 2050. Our models predicted that the loss of suitable areas will be greater for C. minimus, with only nbsp;33% of the original distribution area remaining. The models also indicated that the current system of Fully Protected Areas in the Neotropical region will protect L. crassicaudata in a small area of its current and future potential distribution, inserted in climatically stable areas (14%). These scenarios for these species support strong impacts on the biodiversity protection in aquatic environments in the Neotropical region. We strongly recommend the priority planning and implementation of transboundary Fully Protected Areas in stable areas of distribution of these species to maintain the protection of these marsupials and the ecosystems to which they are associated.

AB  - <list list-type="1" id="jpe12335-list-0001"> Observations of species occurrences are often used to inform spatial prioritizations for the effective use of limited conservation resources. Additional species observations have the potential to change where a conservation group plans to invest. But by how much? How different would conservation priorities be if planners updated current observations with the information they will have next year? We sought to address these questions using a 111-year data set that reflects commonly used collection and prioritization practices. We quantify changes in the ranking of Tennessee watersheds brought on by annual additions of species observations made between 1900 and 2010. We ranked watersheds by their complementary contribution to overall species richness. We examine the sensitivity of our results to the number of watersheds prioritized. We expected the effect of new observations to diminish as the data set grew, and we found this to be the case. Importantly, however, additional observations may continue to significantly change conservation priorities in the future if current data collection trends continue. We found that, overall, additional observations can greatly affect priorities and that this result is sensitive to the number of watersheds ranked. Thus, the extent of planning activities moderates the effect of including additional data.Synthesis and applications. Long-term, opportunistically collected data of species locations are commonly used in conservation planning. We find that when using such data, additional species observations significantly affect subsequent priorities. This effect is most pronounced when data are sparse. As such, data collection should be a focus of very early conservation actions in new areas. Even in well-studied areas, however, additional observations may continue to change spatial priorities into the future, and so while data collection can decrease in well-studied areas, it should continue at a lower intensity. Our methods could also be used to determine the balance of data collection and conservation action in a new location.

AB  - Distribution data on biodiversity features is a major component of conservation planning that are often inaccurate; thus, the true distribution of each feature is commonly over- or underrepresented. The selection of distribution data sets may therefore lead to variability in the spatial configuration and size of proposed reserve networks and uncertainty regarding the extent to which these networks actually contain the biodiversity features they were identified to protect. Our goals were to investigate the impact on reserve selection of choosing different distribution data sets and to propose novel methods to minimize uncertainty about target attainment within reserves. To do so, we used common prioritization methods (richness mapping, systematic reserve design, and a novel approach that integrates multiple types of distribution data) and three types of data on the distribution of mammals (predicted distribution models, occurrence records, and a novel combination of the two) to simulate the establishment of regional biodiversity reserves for the state of Arizona (U. S. A.). Using the results of these simulations, we explored variability in reserve placement and size as a function of the distribution data set. Spatial overlap of reserve networks identified with only predicted distribution data or only occurrence distribution data never exceeded 16%. In pairwise comparisons between reserves created with all three types of distribution data, overlap never achieved 50%. The reserve size required to meet conservation targets also varied with the type of distribution data used and the conservation goal; the largest reserve system was 10 times the smallest. Our results highlight the impact of employing different types of distribution data and identify novel tools for application to existing distribution data sets that can minimize uncertainty about target attainment.

AB  - In the last 40 years, Italy has seen important changes: human pressure is increasing in flat and coastal areas while internal mountainous areas are being abandoned and naturally reforested. These changes have substantial impacts on the biodiversity of the region but no conservation strategy has ever explicitly considered them, and no systematic assessment of the existing protected areas has been carried out. We used a combination of distribution models and extents of occurrence to perform a gap analysis and an irreplaceability analysis. We evaluated the effectiveness of the protected areas for the conservation of terrestrial vertebrates, and we identified regions, species, and strategies that appear to be priorities for expanding and consolidating the existing network. The existing protected areas cannot be considered fully representative, and this is especially true for Sardinia where many of the gap species are located. The Alps and the Apennines represent the strongholds of species diversity, but most of the species of conservation interest are concentrated in the Mediterranean part of the peninsula, as well as in small areas of the plains, where human pressure is higher. Biodiversity and human presence are functionally linked through traditional agriculture and pasture and the only option for conservation is that of considering human presence and activities as an integral part of the system. In a human dominated landscape, protected areas must be planned and managed in conjunction with the matrix in which they are embedded and in the context of the environmental history of the region.

AB  - To plan endangered species conservation and to design adequate management programmes, it is necessary to predict their distributional response to climate change, especially under the current situation of rapid change. However, these predictions are customarily done by relating de novo the distribution of the species with climatic conditions with no regard of previously available knowledge about the factors affecting the species distribution. We propose to take advantage of known species distribution models, but proceeding to update them with the variables yielded by climatic models before projecting them to the future. To exemplify our proposal, the availability of suitable habitat across Spain for the endangered Bonelli's Eagle (Aquila fasciata) was modelled by updating a pre-existing model based on current climate and topography to a combination of different general circulation models and Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. Our results suggested that the main threat for this endangered species would not be climate change, since all forecasting models show that its distribution will be maintained and increased in mainland Spain for all the XXI century. We remark on the importance of linking conservation biology with distribution modelling by updating existing models, frequently available for endangered species, considering all the known factors conditioning the species' distribution, instead of building new models that are based on climate change variables only.

AB  - Protected areas arc the most common and most important strategy for biodiversity conservation and are called for under the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity. However, most protected areas have been designed to represent (and in theory protect for perpetuity) specific natural features, species and ecological communities in-situ, and have not taken into account potential shifts in ecosystem distribution and composition that could be induced by global climatic change. This paper provides an overview of the policy and planning implications of climate change for protected areas in Canada, summarizes a portfolio of climate change adaptation options that have been discussed in the conservation literature and by conservation professionals and provides a perspective on what is needed for the conservation community in Canada to move forward on responding to the threat posed by climate change.

AB  - Accurately demarcating distributions of biological taxa has long been at the core of ecology. Yet our understanding of the factors defining species range limits is incomplete, especially for tropical species in the Global South. Human-driven threats to the survival of many taxa are increasing, particularly habitat loss and climate change. Identifying distributional range limits of at-risk and data-limited species using Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can thus inform spatial conservation planning to mitigate these threats. The Madagascar Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus radama is the resident sub-species of the Peregrine Falcon complex distributed across Madagascar, Mayotte, and the Comoros Islands. There are currently significant knowledge gaps regarding its distribution, habitat preferences, and population size. Here, we use penalized logistic regression and environmental ordination to identify Madagascar Peregrine Falcon habitat in both geographic and environmental space and propose a population size estimate based on inferred habitat. From the penalized logistic regression model, the core habitat area of the Madagascar Peregrine Falcon extends across the central and northern upland plateau of Madagascar with patchier habitat across coastal and low-elevation areas. Range-wide habitat use in both geographic and environmental space indicated positive associations with high elevation and aridity, coupled with high vegetation heterogeneity and >95% herbaceous landcover, but general avoidance of areas >30% cultivated land and >10% mosaic forest. Based on inferred high-class habitat from the penalized logistic regression model, we estimate this habitat area could potentially support a population size ranging between 150 and 300 pairs. Following IUCN Red List guidelines, this subspecies would be classed as 'Vulnerable' due to its small population size. Despite its potentially large range, the Madagascar Peregrine Falcon has specialised habitat requirements and would benefit from targeted conservation measures based on spatial models to maintain viable populations.

AB  - Knowledge about spatial biodiversity patterns is a basic criterion for reserve network design. Although herbarium collections hold large quantities of information, the data are often scattered and cannot supply complete spatial coverage. Alternatively, herbarium data can be used to fit species distribution models and their predictions can be used to provide complete spatial coverage and derive species richness maps. Here, we build on previous effort to propose an improved compositionalist framework for using species distribution models to better inform conservation management. We illustrate the approach with models fitted with six different methods and combined using an ensemble approach for 408 plant species in a tropical and megadiverse country (Ecuador). As a complementary view to the traditional richness hotspots methodology, consisting of a simple stacking of species distribution maps, the compositionalist modelling approach used here combines separate predictions for different pools of species to identify areas of alternative suitability for conservation. Our results show that the compositionalist approach better captures the established protected areas than the traditional richness hotspots strategies and allows the identification of areas in Ecuador that would optimally complement the current protection network. Further studies should aim at refining the approach with more groups and additional species information. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Estimate the current and future distribution of brown trout and identify priority areas for conservation of the species. Location Rhone River basin and Mediterranean streams. Methods We first developed a spatially explicit species distribution model to estimate the current and future distribution of brown trout for three time horizons (2030, 2055 and 2080) and two climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). We then performed a prioritization analysis to identify priority areas for brown trout conservation, accounting for: (a) spatial dependencies along the riverine system, (b) several sources of uncertainty arising from climate-related forecasts and (c) different protected area scenarios by comparing hypothetical, optimal protected networks to an actual protected network designed by regional fish experts. Results Future projections of brown trout densities exhibited a general trend towards a gradual range contraction, with a significant risk of extirpation across mountainous regions of low to mid-elevation. Overall, the projected current and future distributions were well-covered by the existing protected network. In addition, up to 70% of the river reaches included in this expert-based protection network were also priorities in the optimal priority set (e.g. the best set of areas to maximize biodiversity protection). Finally, a large proportion of these reaches were invariably identified regardless of climate change scenarios and uncertainties or spatial dependencies. Main conclusions Our analytical approach highlighted priority areas for brown trout conservation which were robust to a set of climate and connectivity assumptions. This core priority network could be further refined by taking into account key fine-scale processes like thermal refugia. Therefore, we advocate for combining computational and expert-based approaches in conservation planning of riverine ecosystems to achieve a relevant consensus between regional-scale management and fine-grain ecological knowledge.

AB  - Traditionally, biodiversity conservation gap analyses have been focused on governmental protected areas (PAs). However, an increasing number of social initiatives in conservation (SICs) are promoting a new perspective for analysis. SICs include all of the efforts that society implements to conserve biodiversity, such as land protection, from private reserves to community zoning plans some of which have generated community-protected areas. This is the first attempt to analyze the status of conservation in Latin America when some of these social initiatives are included. The analyses were focused on amphibians because they are one of the most threatened groups worldwide. Mexico is not an exception, where more than 60% of its amphibians are endemic. We used a niche model approach to map the potential and real geographical distribution (extracting the transformed areas) of the endemic amphibians. Based on remnant distribution, all the species have suffered some degree of loss, but 36 species have lost more than 50% of their potential distribution. For 50 micro-endemic species we could not model their potential distribution range due to the small number of records per species, therefore the analyses were performed using these records directly. We then evaluated the efficiency of the existing set of governmental protected areas and established the contribution of social initiatives (private and community) for land protection for amphibian conservation. We found that most of the species have some proportion of their potential ecological niche distribution protected, but 20% are not protected at all within governmental PAs. 73% of endemic and 26% of micro-endemic amphibians are represented within SICs. However, 30 micro-endemic species are not represented within either governmental PAs or SICs. This study shows how the role of land conservation through social initiatives is therefore becoming a crucial element for an important number of species not protected by governmental PAs.

AB  - Modern conservation planning is systematic and oriented toward protection of rare or otherwise highly valued elements of biodiversity, representation of ecosystems, and maintenance of viable populations of focal species. Often these three approaches have been pursued in isolation. Combining them results in a more comprehensive and robust conservation strategy, but also requires the acquisition and analysis of tremendous quantities of data. Therefore, data limitations can be a significant impediment to rapid progress in conservation planning. I identify the primary surrogates of biodiversity used in current approaches to conservation planning and discuss the kinds and quality of data required. Criteria for narrowing the list of potential conservation targets to those that will be most useful include: (1) Validity: The target must be an element of conservation interest in its own right or have a well-documented or compelling relationship to such elements; (2) Data availability and uniformity: Information on selected targets must be readily available as digital, spatial databases that are relatively uniform and continuous in distribution across the planning region in order to avoid biases; and (3) Complementarity and comprehensiveness: The suite of targets selected should be complementary and span a broad spectrum of biodiversity or environmental variation. In order to make existing data more useful to conservation planning, governments should create coordinated national or continental information systems that include data on multiple surrogates of biodiversity.

AB  - Primula boveana Decne ex Duby is a threatened paleo-endemic plant in St. Catherine Protected Area (SCPA), south Sinai, Egypt which represents the remaining evidence from the Tertiary relict floras. Listed by IUCN Red List in 2014 as Critically Endangered, and there are urgent needs to carry out on-ground conservation actions. In this research we present steps to conserve Primula boveana through in-situ practices from planning to implementation, respectively through: a) evaluating the current conservation status through IUCN Red List and determining the environmental factors controlling the distribution of the species that are necessary for establishing the recovery program, b) determine the potential species habitat suitability under the current climate conditions using Maxent software, and c) based on the previous two steps, and in an experiment that is the first in this area, an attempt was done to cultivate dormant treated seeds directly in the suitable habitat for recovery. All of these steps aim to increase population size, Extent of Occurrence (EOO), and Area of Occupancy (AOO), which will contribute to minimize the impact of threats on the target species and reducing the risk of extinction. Environmental factors controlling the distribution of the P. boveana and habitat suitability range were extracted in detail using IUCN Red List Assessment and Species Distribution Model (SDM). Despite the low survival rates of seedlings, which reached 1% of the germinated seeds after 8 months from germination, about 140 new individuals were obtained to be added to the current population as a result of this step with an increase of more than 25 %. Also, the geographical range (EOO) after adding the recovery sites has increased by 230 %, which, if continued, could help reduce pressures on the species as well as the risk of extinction. During this study, we emphasized that the target species is marching toward extinction very quickly and needs rapid intervention to try to save it from the imminent extinction risk due to drought and climate change. Carrying out ex-situ conservation practices has become urgent due to the difficulty in ensuring the success of the in-situ conservation process in the future. Collecting and storing seeds, along with cultivation in greenhouses and botanical gardens, will aid in the conservation of the plant if it is extinct in the wild.

AB  - Monitoring for species occupancy is often carried out at local scales, reflecting specific targets, available logistics, and funding. Problematically, conservation planning and management operate at broader scales and use information inventories with good scale coverage. Translating information between local and landscape scales is commonly treated in an ad hoc manner, but conservation decision-making can benefit from quantifying spatial-knowledge relationships. Fauna occupancy monitoring, in particular, suffers from this issue of scale, as there are many different survey methods employed for different purposes. Rather than ignoring how informative these methods are when predicting regional distributions, we describe a statistical approach that identifies survey combinations that provide the greatest additive value in mammal detection across different scales. We identified minimal sets of survey methods for 53 terrestrial mammal species across a large area in Australia (New South Wales (NSW), 800,000km(2)) and for each of the 18 bioregions it encompasses. Utility of survey methods varied considerably at a landscape scale. Unplanned opportunistic sightings were the single largest source of species information (35%). The utility of other survey methods varied spatially; some were retained in minimal sets for many bioregions, while others were spatially restricted or unimportant. Predator scats, Elliot and pitfall trapping, spotlighting, and diurnal herpetofauna surveys were the most frequently included survey methods at a landscape scale. Use of our approach can guide identification of efficient combinations of survey methods, maximising detection and returns for monitoring. Findings and methodologies are easily transferable and are globally applicable across any taxa. They provide guidelines for managing scarce resources for regional monitoring programs, and improving regional strategic conservation planning.

AB  - Conservation efforts should be directed to species and areas in particular need. Several concepts for conservation prioritization exist. Following appropriate measures, we determined the World Heritage Site (WHS) "Nimba Mountains" and its flagship-species, the Nimba toad (Nimbaphlynoides occidentalis), to be both "irreplaceable" and "vulnerable". The biodiversity hotspot, Nimba Mountains, is a WHS "in danger". Conservation efforts are needed to ascertain the long-term persistence of the globally unique viviparous toad and other endemic species. To set the baseline for conservation management, we focussed on the relationships between environmental variables and the current and past toad distribution. With linear, generalised linear, generalised additive and zero inflation models we analysed the toads' distribution and range limits. Our results show that weather conditions limit the toads to higher elevations. Water impermeable geologic layers seem to be inevitable for adequate dry season dormancy sites, thus being the main factor predicting the patchy aboveground wet season distribution. This emphasises the importance of temporally used (non-breeding) environments. For conservation planning, we thus advise distribution models to include all habitats used by focal species. Human activities may further impact a species' abundance and distribution. Herein, we hypothesised that increased fire frequency and anthropogenic habitat alteration in the recent past changed overall habitat characteristics and thus resulted in decreasing toad numbers and an altered range size. Our ecological models indeed better predicted the past compared to the current toad range. This emphasises the importance to consider recent historical developments, before drawing conclusions from current distribution pattern in a conservation context. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Refugia - areas that may facilitate the persistence of species during large-scale, long-term climatic change -are increasingly important for conservation planning. There are many methods for identifying refugia, but the ability to quantify their potential for facilitating species persistence (ie their capacity) remains elusive. We propose a flexible framework for prioritizing future refugia, based on their capacity. This framework can be applied through various modeling approaches and consists of three steps: (1) definition of scope, scale, and resolution; (2) identification and quantification; and (3) prioritization for conservation. Capacity is quantified by multiple indicators, including environmental stability, microclimatic heterogeneity, size, and accessibility of the refugium. Using an integrated, semi-mechanistic modeling technique, we illustrate how this approach can be implemented to identify refugia for the plant diversity of Tasmania, Australia. The highest-capacity climate-change refugia were found primarily in cool, wet, and topographically complex environments, several of which we identify as high priorities for biodiversity conservation and management.

AB  - We know economic and social policy has implications for ecosystems at large, but the consequences for a given geographic area or specific wildlife population are more difficult to conceptualize and communicate. Species distribution models, which extrapolate species-habitat relationships across ecological scales, are capable of predicting population changes in distribution and abundance in response to management and policy, and thus, are an ideal means for facilitating proactive management within a larger policy framework. To illustrate the capabilities of species distribution modeling in scenario planning for wildlife populations, we projected an existing distribution model for ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) onto a series of alternative future landscape scenarios for Nebraska, USA. Based on our scenarios, we qualitatively and quantitatively estimated the effects of agricultural policy decisions on pheasant populations across Nebraska, in specific management regions, and at wildlife management areas.

AB  - To meet the requirements of Congressional legislation mandating the production of a "scientifically credible" conservation strategy for the threatened Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), the Interagency Spotted Owl Scientific Committee employed scientific methods to design a habitat reserve system. Information on the current and historical distributions of the owl and its habitats was reviewed in light of economic, political, and legal constraints; results were used to develop a preliminary reserve system of habitat "polygons." A map representing these polygons and their attendant properties served as a set of hypotheses that were tested. Statistical analyses of empirical data, predictions from ecological theory, predictions from population dynamics models, and inferences drawn from studies of related species were used to test properties of the preliminary map, including the number and sizes of habitat conservation areas (HCAs), their distribution. configuration, and spacing, and the nature of the landscape matrix between HCAs. Conclusions that failed to confirm specific map properties were used to refine the reserve system, a process that continued iteratively until all relevant data had been examined and all map properties had been tested. This conservation planning process has proven to be credible, repeatable, and scientifically defendable, and should serve as a model for wildlife management, endangered species recovery, and national forest planning.

AB  - There are currently no offshore wind energy developments (OWEDs) in North America, although numerous OWEDs have been proposed along the Atlantic Coast. Development pressure has been a catalyst for marine spatial planning (MSP) to identify suitable areas for OWED. However, integrating complex ecological information to guide OWED siting remains a substantial challenge. We developed spatial distribution models of marine birds from aerial surveys that we conducted from 2010 to 2012 throughout a 3800 km(2) area off the coast of Rhode Island. For seven groups of marine birds, we constructed either a density surface model or a presence-absence model that incorporated relevant environmental covariates. We integrated our spatial models, along with uncertainty, using spatial conservation prioritization (SCP) software. This identified sites with high marine bird conservation priority that aided evaluation of proposed OWED sites. We found that shallow nearshore waters had the highest conservation priority overall, but we also detected key offshore areas of high priority. Hypothetical OWEDs placed in conservation priority areas significantly reduced the overall distribution of focal species. Currently proposed OWED sites are located in areas of relatively low conservation priority and so would not substantially reduce the overall distribution of marine birds. This SCP approach when combined with quantitative models of bird distribution given relevant environmental covariates provides a robust framework that satisfies the principles of ecosystem-based MSP. Thus, this combined SCP-distribution modeling framework should be extremely helpful to decision makers as they evaluate proposed siting locations of OWEDs in the context of a dynamic marine system.

AB  - International conservation planning at the end of the twentieth century is dominated by coarse-filter, supra-organismal approaches to conservation that may be insufficient to conserve certain species such as the jaguar (Panthera onca). If we are to retain broadly distributed species into the next century, we need to plan explicitly for their survival across their entire geographic range and through political boundaries while recognizing the variety of ecological roles the species plays in different habitats. In March 1999 the Wildlife Conservation Society sponsored a priority-setting and planning excercise for the jaguar across its range from northern Mexico to northern Argentina. Field scientists from 18 countries reached consensus on four types of information: (1) the spatial Went of their jaguar knowledge, (2) the known, currently occupied range of jaguars, (3) areas with substantial jaguar populations, adequate habitat, and a stable and diverse prey base, and (4) point localities where jaguars have been observed during the last 10 years. airing the exercise, these experts also conducted a range-wide assessment of the long-term survival prospects of the jaguar and developed all algorithm for prioritizing jaguar conservation units occurring in major habitat types. From this work, we learned that the known, occupied range of the jaguar has contracted to approximately 46% of estimates of its 1900 range. Jaguar status and distribution is unknown in another 12% of the jaguar's former ranged including large areas in Maxim Colombia, and Brazil. But over 70% of the area where jaguars are thought to still occur was rated as having a high probability of supporting their long-term survival. Fifty-one jaguar conservation units representing 30 different jaguar geographic regions were prioritized as the basis for a comprehensive jaguar conservation program.

AB  - Global warming is expected to cause several modifications to physical environments, and sea level rise is a certain outcome. However, assessment of the potential impacts caused by sea level rise on biodiversity is still emerging. Therefore, we assessed the combined impact of global warming and sea level rise on the potential distribution of 19 coastal lowland anurans in the biodiversity hotspot Atlantic Forest. We applied a correlative species distribution model (SDM) (BIOCLIM) and GIS-based spatial analyses. We evaluated the extent of changes of potential distributions under extreme and moderate global warming scenarios as well as two extreme sea level rise scenarios. Our results suggest wide areas of suitable habitat for most species in the future. However, for 15% of these species the SDMs predict massive losses of range extent as a result of a combination of global warming and sea level rise. Such observations highlight an immediate need to consider the potential effects of sea level rise in conservation action plans. Since the current potential distribution of these anuran species is likely underestimated, we also analyzed their environmental niche under current conditions in order to provide a baseline for further field surveys. Considering this current state of knowledge for such species, species distribution modeling to help gather further information on unknown species is desirable.

AB  - Edible insects present unique opportunities for food and nutrition security in many African communities. However, the characteristics of habitats and spatial distribution of edible insects is not known and yet it is important for understanding their ecology, planning harvesting and conservation activities in the wild. The edible ground cricket (Henicus whellani) Chopard (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae) is an edible insect consumed in south eastern Zimbabwe with protein content > 50% on dry matter basis but harvesting is largely random and opportunistic. The aim of this study was to apply the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) presence-only species distribution modelling approach to understand the factors influencing distribution of H. whellani and map the potential areas for harvesting and conservation of the species. Geographical locations of sites where H. whellani is currently present were obtained from field reports from communities. Seven geographical factors which are mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, mean annual precipitation, seasonality of precipitation, soil type, elevation, vegetation density and land cover were used to run the model. The model showed a high prediction accuracy for H. whellani (AUC=0.86) indicating that the model can be used with confidence to predict distribution and potential habitats in S. E Zimbabwe. Results showed that soil type (46.7%) and vegetation density (17.5%) are the most important factors determining the distribution of H. whellani. The hotspots for H. whellani were identified and closely followed specific soil and vegetation gradients in the area. The model considered temperature (3.9%) and elevation (0.6%) as the least important factors in H. whellani distribution. The produced distributed maps can be used for planning efficient harvesting and conservation of this nutritious edible insect in Zimbabwe.

AB  - This paper studies the factors affecting passerine (Order Passeriformes) species richness in the Western Maghreb, a region at the southwestern border of the Palearctic reputed as a primary wintering ground for many common European birds. The effect of productivity, temperature, landscape structure and geographical location on bird richness was explored at 220 localities across Morocco. The models resulting from multivariate analyses supported the effects of productivity, temperature and landscape cover on bird richness, with higher numbers of species occurring in warm farmlands of the northwest. The most suitable areas for birds avoided the cold and arid expanses of the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara and overlapped with the most human-impacted sectors. Within these areas, we detected an interspersed distribution of sectors of high bird richness and low human incidence. These sectors can be used as priority targets for conservation programmes of common birds during the winter.

AB  - P>Europe has the world's most extensive network of conservation areas. Conservation areas are selected without taking into account the effects of climate change. How effectively would such areas conserve biodiversity under climate change? We assess the effectiveness of protected areas and the Natura 2000 network in conserving a large proportion of European plant and terrestrial vertebrate species under climate change. We found that by 2080, 58 +/- 2.6% of the species would lose suitable climate in protected areas, whereas losses affected 63 +/- 2.1% of the species of European concern occurring in Natura 2000 areas. Protected areas are expected to retain climatic suitability for species better than unprotected areas (P < 0.001), but Natura 2000 areas retain climate suitability for species no better and sometimes less effectively than unprotected areas. The risk is high that ongoing efforts to conserve Europe's biodiversity are jeopardized by climate change. New policies are required to avert this risk.

AB  - Pressure to conserve biodiversity with limited resources has led to increasing use of species distribution models (SDMs) for spatial conservation prioritization. Published spatial prioritization exercises often focus on well-studied groups, with data compiled from on-line databases of ad-hoc collections. Conservation plans generally aim to protect all components of biodiversity, and it is implied that the species used in prioritization act as surrogates. Here, we assess the sensitivity of spatial priorities to model and surrogate choice using a case study from a fragmented agricultural area of south eastern Australia that is poorly represented in the national reserve system. We model the distributions of 30 species of bird, microbat and bee using two types of SDM; generalised linear models based on systematic surveys that yield presence and absence observations, and MaxEnt models based on biodiversity database records. Eight prioritization scenarios were tested using Zonation software, and were based on either the presence-background or presence-absence SDMs and combinations of surrogacy among the three taxa. We found low correlations between SDMs generated for the same species using different modelling frameworks ( = 0.18, n = 26). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimates generated by MaxEnt were optimistic; on average 1.36 times higher than when tested against the systematic survey data. Conservation priorities were sensitive to the choice of surrogate and type of data used to fit SDMs, and though bats and birds formed moderately good surrogates for each other, there was less compelling evidence of surrogacy for bees. Because valid surrogacy is unlikely with most existing data sets, investment in high quality data for less-surveyed groups prior to planning should still be a priority. If this is not possible, then it is advisable to analyse the sensitivity of conservation plans to the assumed surrogacy and quality of data available.

AB  - Understanding seabird habitat preferences is critical to future wildlife conservation and threat mitigation in California. The objective of this study was to investigate drivers of seabird habitat selection within the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries to identify areas for targeted conservation planning. We used seabird abundance data collected by the Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies Program (ACCESS) from 2004-2011. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to model species abundance and distribution as a function of near surface ocean water properties, distances to geographic features and oceanographic climate indices to identify patterns in foraging habitat selection. We evaluated seasonal, inter-annual and species-specific variability of at-sea distributions for the five most abundant seabirds nesting on the Farallon Islands: western gull (Larus occidentalis), common murre (Uria aalge), Cassin's auklet (Ptychorampus aleuticus), rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) and Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus). The waters in the vicinity of Cordell Bank and the continental shelf east of the Farallon Islands emerged as persistent and highly selected foraging areas across all species. Further, we conducted a spatial prioritization exercise to optimize seabird conservation areas with and without considering impacts of current human activities. We explored three conservation scenarios where 10, 30 and 50 percent of highly selected, species-specific foraging areas would be conserved. We compared and contrasted results in relation to existing marine protected areas (MPAs) and the future alternative energy footprint identified by the California Ocean Uses Atlas. Our results show that the majority of highly selected seabird habitat lies outside of state MPAs where threats from shipping, oil spills, and offshore energy development remain. This analysis accentuates the need for innovative marine spatial planning efforts and provides a foundation on which to build more comprehensive zoning and management in California's National Marine Sanctuaries.

AB  - Habitat loss is the most important threat to species survival, and the efficient selection of priority areas is fundamental for good systematic conservation planning. Using amphibians as a conservation target, we designed an innovative assessment strategy, showing that prioritization models focused on functional, phylogenetic, and taxonomic diversity can include cost-effectiveness-based assessments of land values. Wereport new key conservation sites within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hot spot, revealing a congruence of ecological and evolutionary patterns. We suggest payment for ecosystem services through environmental set-asides on private land, establishing potential tradeoffs for ecological and evolutionary processes. Our findings introduce additional effective area-based conservation parameters that set new priorities for biodiversity assessment in the Atlantic Forest, validating the usefulness of a novel approach to cost-effectiveness-based assessments of conservation value for other species-rich regions.

AB  - Anthropogenic threats drive species to extinction and are the focus of extinction risk analyses and conservation planning. Threats are often quantified through higher level proxies, such as the human footprint (HF). We tested the effects that multiple methods of representing species' distribution and different quantifications of a HF map have on threat measurement, and how these influence conservation decisions. We quantified the magnitude of HF for 901 Southeast Asian mammals according to several methods. We ranked the species according to the measured HF value, and produced priority lists of top-impacted species. The different representations of species' distribution caused significant disagreement in HF calculations. HF values were on average lower when calculated in species' suitable habitat or occurrence points in comparison to the whole geographic range. Biases were non-linear and dependent on distal factors, such as the proportion of suitable habitat within species' range and species' habitat specialism. Using different HF quantifications also yielded disagreement, with 2-56% difference observed in species membership among priority lists. Threatened species were best predicted, and significantly placed in the top-ranking, when measuring their proportion of range exposed to high levels of HF. We thus show that the HF extent, not only its average value, determines species extinction risk. A well-framed global conservation strategy must address the quantification of human impact on biodiversity. The selection of quantification methods has implications for how such impact is evaluated. Improving techniques to quantify biodiversity threats will enhance the effectiveness of extinction risk analyses and conservation decisions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: To assess the representativeness values of Mesoamerican endemic birds within the current network of protected areas (PAs) to determine high-priority and complementary conservation areas to maximize the long-term protection of species.
   Location: From central Mexico to southern Panama.
   Methods: We selected 180 bird species that are geographically restricted to Mesoamerica and estimated their potential ranges using species distribution models. Then, using two different removal rules in ZONATION software, we assessed the species' representativeness levels within the current PA network. We also defined forest remnants that could be used to strategically expand PAs (to reach Aichi biodiversity targets) and maximize the species protection, explicitly considering anthropic pressures.
   Results: Current PAs cover similar to 13% of the land area of Mesoamerica, representing an average of similar to 19% of the total potential distribution for the endemic bird species considered. We also observed that there is <30% overlap between current PAs and the priority areas we define. Our prioritization analyses showed that strategically increasing protection coverage to 17%, as stipulated in the Aichi targets, would substantially increase the representativeness values of PAs (regardless of the removal rule used) and would increase the range by >35% for all species and >29% for threatened species. The consensus priority conservation areas identified were mainly distributed in Costa Rica (similar to 48%), Mexico (similar to 28%), and Panama (similar to 10%).
   Main conclusions Consistent with the global picture, Mesoamerican PAs showed low representativeness of their vulnerable endemic avifauna; therefore, well-informed decisions to guide conservation strategies are imperative. We provide insights about where future conservation efforts should focus to accomplish a representative and well-connected regional PA network.

AB  - Ecological niche modeling (ENM) has become an important tool in conservation biology. Despite its recent success, several basic issues related to algorithm performance are still being debated. We assess the ability of two of the most popular algorithms, GARP and Maxent, to predict distributions when sampling is geographically biased. We use an extensive data set collected in the Brazilian Cerrado, a biodiversity hotspot in South America. We found that both algorithms give richness predictions that are very similar to other traditionally used richness estimators. Also, both algorithms correctly predicted the presence of most species collected during fieldwork, and failed to predict species collected only in very few cases (usually species with very few known localities, i.e., < 5). We also found that Maxent tends to be more sensitive to sampling bias than GARP. However, Maxent performs better when sampling is poor (e.g., low number of data points). Our results indicates that ENM, even when provided with limited and geographically biased localities, is a very useful technique to estimate richness and composition of unsampled areas. We conclude that data generated by ENM maximize the utility of existing biodiversity data, providing a very useful first evaluation. However, for reliable conservation decisions ENM data must be followed by well-designed field inventories, especially for the detection of restricted range, rare species.

AB  - The KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service is undertaking a long-term project to determine the value of untransformed land for biodiversity conservation, to map these areas in accordance with their relative values, and to identify and prioritize irreplaceable areas. The overall goal of the initial stage of the project was to use existing data and expertise to define areas of conservation importance in KwaZulu-Natal. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the procedures used to incorporate insect species and subspecies into the project, including those for identifying insects of conservation concern and for making a first assessment of their distribution and conservation status. A biodiversity hierarchy (from landscapes through ecosystems and communities to species and populations) forms the basis of the analysis. Information received from taxonomists working in South Africa in response to a questionnaire survey was used to choose the species for inclusion in the initial analysis, A total of thirty-seven species and subspecies endemic to the Province in certain families of Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Mecoptera and Odonata were included. Existing distribution data were collated and the potential distributions of the endemics were modelled at a scale of 4 ha. Factors that potentially influence the distributions of the endemics were gleaned from the literature. Database queries using distribution data with a spatial resolution of: 250 in and cartographic overlays formed the basis of the modelling procedure. Two areas with little or no statutory protection, the high-lying grasslands of the northwestern region and much of the central region of the Province, are predicted to have a relatively high diversity of endemic insects. Fifty-one percent of the insect species and subspecies in the analysis met the two conservation goals, i.e. 1) at least 10% of their present distributions under formal conservation management, and 2) three such protected areas with viable populations. A benefit of modelling the potential distributions of endemics is that searching for populations of these insects can be directed to areas where they are expected to occur. The data collected can then be used to improve the distribution models for these insects, some of which are poorly known. The distributions and their associated conservation targets form a vital component of the iterative systematic conservation planning project currently underway in the Province.

AB  - Aim Although urbanization impacts many species, there is little information on the patterns of occurrences of threatened species in urban relative to non-urban areas. By assessing the extent of the distribution of threatened species across all Australian cities, we aim to investigate the currently under-utilized opportunity that cities present for national biodiversity conservation.
   Location Australian mainland, Tasmania and offshore islands.
   Methods Distributions of Australia's 1643 legally protected terrestrial species (hereafter 'threatened species') were compiled. We assessed the extent to which they overlapped with 99 cities (of more than 10,000 people), with all non-urban areas, and with simulated 'dummy' cities which covered the same area and bioregion as the true cities but were non-urban. We analysed differences between animals and plants, and examined variability within these groups using species accumulation modelling. Threatened species richness of true versus dummy cities was analysed using generalized linear mixed-effects models.
   Results Australian cities support substantially more nationally threatened animal and plant species than all other non-urban areas on a unit-area basis. Thirty per cent of threatened species were found to occur in cities. Distribution patterns differed between plants and animals: individual threatened plant species were generally found in fewer cities than threatened animal species, yet plants were more likely to have a greater proportion of their distribution in urban areas than animals. Individual cities tended to contain unique suites of threatened species, especially threatened plants. The analysis of true versus dummy cities demonstrated that, even after accounting for factors such as net primary productivity and distance to the coast, cities still consistently supported a greater number of threatened species.
   Main conclusions This research highlights that Australian cities are important for the conservation of threatened species, and that the species assemblages of individual cities are relatively distinct. National conservation policy should recognize that cities play an integral role when planning for and managing threatened species.

KW  - RESEARCH AGENDA
AB  - Vast gaps in available information on the spatial distribution of biodiversity pose a major challenge for regional conservation planning in many parts of the world. This problem is often addressed by basing such planning on various biodiversity surrogates. In some situations, distributional data for selected taxa may be used as surrogates for biodiversity as a whole. However, this approach is less effective in data-poor regions, where there may be little choice but to base conservation planning on some form of remote environmental mapping, derived, for example, from interpretation of satellite imagery or from numerical classification of abiotic environmental layers. Although this alternative approach confers obvious benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness and rapidity of application, problems may arise if congruence is poor between mapped land-classes and actual biological distributions. I propose three strategies for making more effective use of available biological data and knowledge to alleviate such problems by (1) more closely integrating biological and environmental data through predictive modeling, with increased emphasis on modeling collective properties of biodiversity rather than individual entities; (2) making more rigorous use of remotely mapped surrogates in conservation planning by incorporating knowledge of heterogeneity within land-classes, and of varying levels of distinctiveness between classes, into measures of conservation priority and achievement; and (3) using relatively data-rich regions as test-beds for evaluating the performance of surrogates that can be readily applied across data-poor regions.

AB  - To track future climate space, seed dispersal will be essential for plants, but dispersal ability is rarely measured or incorporated into species distribution models. Species distribution models (SDMs) can rank habitat suitability at a local scale, and they may be a valuable conservation planning tool for rare, patchily distributed species. Dispersal is essential for species to survive the threats of habitat destruction and climate change. Combining dispersal ability and habitat suitability at the landscape scale is important to understand and predict species spatial responses to environmental change. This study analyzed future species distributions based on habitat suitability and dispersal scenarios for 7 endangered and vulnerable taxa, using SDM and dispersal ability to predict the range of species distribution across central Italy in the near future 2050. Species distribution models (Ensembles of Small Models, ESMs) were carried out using 19 bioclimatic environmental variables downloaded from WorldClim 1.4. The study identified the most suitable area for this species in the central Apennines. The innovation of this study is the combination of SDMs with dispersal ability based on measured traits of local populations of rare species and subspecies. The main results show a combination of climate change with dispersal ability strongly affects the future potential distribution of the rare species. Thus, obtaining suitable and accessible areas in the near future possible is possible to identify the high suitable sites for the reinforcement of the natural population, ensuring habitat connectivity.

AB  - Indicators on the state of global biodiversity illustrate continued decline, while pressure on biodiversity keeps rising. This necessitates revisiting site prioritization and species protection for conservation. Patterns of richness and threat of four well-studied aquatic taxa, the fishes, crabs, molluscs and dragonflies largely coincide at the continental scale, at least in Africa. For this study, we focus on dragonflies, for which there is a point locality database, as a surrogate taxon, modeling the species at the fine-scale, using species distribution modeling. With this approach, we built a protected areas network using spatial planning software. Priority areas for dragonfly conservation largely coincided with analyses of global biodiversity hotspots. The Zambian swamps and woodlands, as well as the rainforests of the Lower Guinea and Congo Basin are emphasized as hotspots of dragonfly diversity. Among globally threatened species, 72% were recorded at least once in a protected area. Although the current reserve network covers 10.7% of the landscape, the proportional representation of species geographic distributions in reserves is only 1.2%. The reserve network is therefore inefficient concerning freshwater species, and many areas of conservation priority that are not formally protected remain. The advantage of operating at the fine scale, while covering a large geographic area is that it shifts the focus from the large-scale hotspots to smaller priority areas within and beyond hotspots. Also, by operating at the fine-scale for a large geographical area, the potential exists for local conservation managers to consider campaigning for the inclusion of the priority areas that are not formally protected, while adjacent to the existing reserve networks. Where this is not possible, we recommend monitoring these areas to detect future threats to the habitats that these might face. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tree species in mountainous areas are expected to shift their distribution upward in elevation in response to climate change, calling for a potential redesign of existing protected areas. This study aims to predict whether or not the distributions of two high-mountain tree species, Abies (Abies kawakamii) and Tsuga (Tsuga chinensis var. formosana), will significantly shift upward due to temperature change, and whether current protected areas will be suitable for conserving these species. Future temperature change was projected for 15 different future scenarios produced from five global climate models. Shifts in Abies and Tsuga distributions were then predicted through the use of species distribution models (SDMs) which included occurrence data of Abies and Tsuga, as well as seasonal temperature, and elevation. The 25 km x 25 km downscaled General Circulation Model (GCMs) data for 2020-2039 produced by the Taiwan Climate Change Projection and Information Platform was adopted in this study. Habitat suitability in the study area was calculated using maximum entropy model under different climatic scenarios. A bootstrap method was applied to assess the parameter uncertainty of the maximum entropy model. In comparison to the baseline projection, we found that there are significant differences in suitable habitat distributions for Abies and Tsuga under seven of the 15 scenarios. The results suggest that mountainous ecosystems will be substantially impacted by climate change. We also found that the uncertainty originating from GCMs and the parameters of the SDM contribute most to the overall level of variability in species distributions. Finally, based on the uncertainty analysis and the shift in habitat suitability, we applied systematic conservation planning approaches to identify suitable areas to add to Taiwan's protected area network.

AB  - The range size of species co-occurring in local assemblages is a pivotal variable in assessments of a site's conservation value. Assemblages featuring many small-ranged species are given more priority than assemblages consisting mainly of wide-ranging species. However, the assembly of relevant information can be challenging and local range size distributions of tropical invertebrates are rarely available for conservation planning. We present such data for sphingid moths in East Africa, a highly diverse region of high conservation value. We compare geographic range size distributions based on field samples with predictions from modelled range map data. Using this system as a case study, we provide evidence for a systematic sampling bias when inferring average local range sizes from field data. Unseen species (i.e., species present but missed in local sampling) are often those with small ranges (hence, of high conservation value). Using an elevational gradient, we illustrate how this bias can lead to false, counterintuitive assessments of environmental effects on local range size distributions. Furthermore, with particular reference to sphingid moths in the study region, we show that current protected areas appear unrelated to the spatial distribution of species richness or average geographic range sizes at a local scale. We discuss the need to treat field sampled data with caution and in concert with other data sources such as probabilistic models.

AB  - 1. To realize the potential of citizens to contribute to conservation efforts through the acquisition of data for broad-scale species distribution models, scientists need to understand and minimize the influences of commonly observed sample selection bias on model performance. Yet evaluating these data with independent, planned surveys is rare, even though such evaluation is necessary for understanding and applying data to conservation decisions.
   2. We used the state-listed fox squirrel Sciurus niger in Florida, USA, to interpret the performance of models created with opportunistic observations from citizens and professionals by validating models with independent, planned surveys.
   3. Data from both citizens and professionals showed sample selection bias with more observations within 50 m of a road. While these groups showed similar sample selection bias in reference to roads, there were clear differences in the spatial coverage of the groups, with citizens observing fox squirrels more frequently in developed areas.
   4. Based on predictions at planned field surveys sites, models developed from citizens generally performed similarly to those developed with data collected by professionals. Accounting for potential sample selection bias in models, either through the use of covariates or via aggregating data into home range size grids, provided only slight increases in model performance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Despite sample selection biases, over a broad spatial scale opportunistic citizen data provided reliable predictions and estimates of habitat relationships needed to advance conservation efforts. Our results suggest that the use of professionals may not be needed in volunteer programmes used to determine the distribution of species of conservation interest across broad spatial scales.

AB  - Biodiversity considerations in conservation system planning include three main criteria: representation, special elements, and focal species. A GIS-based approach utilizing simple models was used to assess existing biophysical data relative to these criteria for conservation system planning in Nova Scotia, Canada, with potential utility in applications elsewhere. Representative samples of natural landscapes were identified on the basis of size ( : 10 000 ha) and degree of naturalness (natural-cover, uneven-aged forests, low or zero road density). Special elements were selected, including hotspots of diversity and rarity, critical habitat for species at risk, significant wetlands, old and unique forests, and ecosites. Habitat requirements of viable populations of focal species (American moose, American marten, and Northern Goshawk) were identified using species distribution data, habitat suitability, and population viability analyses. Priority core. areas for biodiversity conservation system planning were identified on the basis of these three sets of criteria. Key areas of habitat connectivity were delineated by selecting the least-cost paths for focal species between relevant core areas through cost-distance. analyses based on habitat suitability, road density, and minimum corridor width. Collectively, these biodiversity considerations indicate that similar to 60% of Nova Scotia, including 32% in core areas, should be managed for conservation objectives to maintain genes, species, and ecosystems over time. Although data and modeling limitations require that our analysis of richness and diversity, habitat suitability, population viability, and core area selection be verified, the area calculations and other results are consistent with those in similar studies. Consequently, the system design and other information generated are useful for local and regional biodiversity conservation planning and management, and the methodological approach is of potential use in other regions where the necessary field-based data may be made available.

AB  - Conservation plans can benefit from understanding patterns of genetic structure because many endangered species are spatially fragmented. In particular, headwater species in high elevations are expected to exhibit a high level of population structure, as dispersal through lowland streams may be limited. Euastacus urospinosus is an endangered freshwater crayfish that, until recently, was thought to have a distribution of just 200 km(2). In the current study, we identified a total of 26 locations for this species across a 1225 km(2) region spanning the Brisbane and Mary River catchments of south-east Queensland, Australia. We then used mitochondrial DNA sequence data to investigate the population structure and the phylogeographic divergence between four uplands. We found significant population differentiation for this species, which conforms to the headwater model of genetic structure. Further, we found that fragmentation between these uplands is most likely historical, as the first divergence between lineages dated back 2.1 million years. Overall, we found no reason to remove the conservation rating of 'endangered' for this species. Conservation plans should seek to preserve the genetic integrity of these uplands by considering them to be genetically distinct and isolated populations.

AB  - We analyzed the overlap of the range of Pygochelidon melanoleuca in Brazil with active and planned hydropower plants in the country (current and future scenarios). We used the Random Forest, Maxent and Support Vector Machine algorithms to model the potential range of the species, which we then overlapped with the locations of active and planned hydropower plants in order to calculate how much the potential area of this species is and will be affected by them. Approximately 35% of active hydropower plants currently overlap with the potential distribution area of P. melanoleuca, and 44% of planned hydropower plants also coincide with this area. If the implementation of the planned hydropower plants occurs, the suitable habitat necessary for nesting and foraging of P. melanoleuca will be severely compromised.

AB  - The boreal forests of North America support billions of birds of over 300 species. The region remains mostly intact but is expected to undergo major changes over the next century due to anthropogenic climate change. This warming, and resulting changes in moisture regimes, are altering vegetation and disturbance dynamics, and will likely result in expansion of grasslands and deciduous forests, strongly challenging bird species to keep pace. We present a vulnerability-adaptation framework to guide bird conservation based on species' individual vulnerability and exposure to climate change. For sensitive species with declining populations, conservation should focus on management of current threats and species recovery in situ to improve adaptive capacity and facilitate future shifts in distribution. Sensitive species with high exposure to climate change may warrant more extensive intervention, such as habitat manipulation or even translocation. For species with lower sensitivity and stable populations, but high climate change exposure, long-term investments in protecting refugia and "stepping stones" will be most effective. In general, across all species, land-based approaches that "conserve nature's stage" by promoting geophysical diversity and habitat connectivity, maintaining natural disturbance dynamics, and facilitating broad shifts in bird distribution may prove most effective in maintaining species diversity. Implementation of this framework will require large-scale, interagency coordination on recovery plans, as well as adaptive forest management, designation of critical habitat, and land protection. Challenges include data gaps, uncertainty about future conditions, coordination of conservation actions during the nonbreeding periods, and the region's vast scale. However, given the region's continental importance, successful implementation of this framework could benefit birds throughout the western hemisphere.

AB  - Preventing biological invasions in areas of conservation concern represents the most cost-effective strategy to minimize the impact of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) on native communities. In this context, invasive Species Distribution Models (iSDMs) are a sound tool for predicting invasion risk in protected areas. Although their potential to support invasive species managers is widely acknowledged, evidence of iSDMs providing actual conservation solutions is still scarce. With this work, we propose an iSDM-based methodology that accounts for the role of multiple invasion drivers to assess the risk posed by 1AS in protected areas. Using a binomial Generalized Additive Model, we predicted the occurrence of a highly invasive plant in Mediterranean dune systems. According to the predicted IAS occurrence, we quantified the invasibility of protected sites inside the study area, classified each site in low to medium-high invasibility categories, and identified site-specific management perspectives. Our results encourage the use of iSDMs as a means of evaluating the risk posed by IAS in protected areas, and, at the same time, represent an attempt to fill the gap between theory and practice in conservation decision-making.

AB  - Most fish and shrimps have valuable ecological and commercial benefits. The difficulties of the collection of distribution records and volatile nature these marine organisms have limited their monitoring and conserving. MaxEnt modeling technique is ideal option for modeling distribution and habitat preference of different marine organisms. In this study, the present distribution of commercial fish and shrimps including orange-spotted grouper John's snapper, tigertooth croaker, banana and Jinga shrimps was predicted using MaxEnt and a set of environmental layers. Distribution modeling findings showed that this technique reflects well the actual distribution of species. Environmental predictors including iron, calcite, temperature, primary productivity and depth were the most important environmental factors determining the distribution of species. Finding of habitat preferences indicated that the recent habitats of the species have suitable environmental conditions for the species. The Persian Gulf, the Sea of Oman, the North Arabian Sea and Australia coasts of the South Pacific were predicted as the most suitable habitats for species. The finding of this study provided basic data to identify distribution areas and habitat preferences of commercial fish and shrimps for their recent management plans and conservation development.

AB  - Finding balance between the needs of people and wildlife is an essential component of planning sustainable landscapes. Because mammals make up a diverse and ecologically important taxon with varying responses to human disturbance, we used representative mammal species to examine how alternative land-use policies might affect their habitats and distributions in the near future. We used wildlife detections from camera traps at 1591 locations along a large-scale urban to wild gradient in northern Virginia, to create occupancy models which determined land cover relationships and the drivers of contemporary mammal distributions. From the 15 species detected, we classified five representative species into two groups based on their responses to human development; sensitive species (American black bears and bobcats) and synanthropic species (red foxes, domestic cats, and white-tailed deer). We then used the habitat models for the representative species to predict their distributions under four future planning scenarios based on strategic versus reactive planning and high or low human population growth. The distributions of sensitive species did not shrink drastically under any scenario, whereas the distributions of synanthropic species increased in response to anthropogenic development, but the magnitude of the response varied based on the projected rate of human population growth. This is likely because most sensitive species are dependent on large, protected public lands in the region, and the majority of projected habitat losses should occur in non-protected private lands. These findings illustrate the importance of public protected lands in mitigating range loss due to land use changes, and the potential positive impact of strategic planning in further mitigating mammalian diversity loss in private lands.

AB  - Across the world, wildlife must coexist with humans in modified and increasingly fragmented landscapes but balancing the competing land use objectives of economic production and conservation is challenging. Multi-objective optimisation and spatial conservation prioritisation can inform land use planning but have not yet explicitly accounted for the way species access multiple resources at different locations in a landscape. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach for conservation prioritisation that accounts for the spatial distribution of different resources as well as a species' movements. This suite of tools and models identifies Pareto-optimal solutions to competing objectives of economic production on the one hand, with conserving a species' food, drink and shelter requirements and movement corridors on the other. We demonstrate the broader functionality of these tools using a case study with competing objectives of clearing land for mining versus conservation of a vulnerable endemic species.

AB  - Reliable plans for desert bird conservation will depend on accurate prediction of habitat change effects on their distribution and abundance patterns. Predictive models can help highlight relationships between human-related and other environmental variables and the presence of desert bird species. Presence/absence of 30 desert bird species of Baja California peninsula was modelled on the basis of explanatory variables taken from the field, maps, and digital imagery. Generalized linear models were fit to each bird species using both variables representing human activity and other environmental factors as predictors that might influence distribution. Probability of species presence was used as a habitat suitability index to evaluate the effect of human activity when the model contained a significant human activity variable. No differences were found in bird species richness between natural sites and those transformed by agriculture or urbanization. Of 59 bird species recorded in surveys, 34% were positively or negatively associated with human-transformed habitats. Fourteen species seem to benefit from transformation of natural vegetation by agriculture or urbanization, while six were negatively affected. Sensitivity analyses of final models indicated all were robust. Results suggest that the occurrence of a large percentage of bird species inhabiting scrub habitats is sensitive to human habitat transformation. This finding has important conservation implications at regional scale as fragmentation and conversion of desert ecosystems into agricultural and urban areas affect the distribution of species that are highly selective for scrub habitat. Land use and anthropogenic activities seem to change ecological patterns at large spatial scales, but other factors could drive species richness distribution too (i.e. individual species response, species-energy relationships). The spatial modelling approach at regional scale used in this study can be useful for designing natural resource management plans in the Sonoran desert scrub.

We tested whether local-scale resources (host and nectar plants, canopy cover) or landscape context, measured at two scales, better explained the densities of four butterfly species. The density of Coenonympha tullia, which has host plants strongly associated with grassland habitats, was positively correlated with the amount of grassland in 0.5- and 1-km radius landscapes and only occurred in forests when they bordered grasslands. For the other species, Celastrina ladon, Cupido amyntula, and Vanessa cardui, local-scale resources better explained butterfly densities, emphasizing the importance of local habitat quality for butterflies. These three species also used host plants that were distributed more heterogeneously within and among habitat types. Our findings demonstrate the importance of host plant spatial distributions when determining the scale at which butterfly density relates to resources, and we recommend that both these distributions and landscape context be evaluated when developing butterfly monitoring programs, managing for species of concern, or modeling potential habitat.

AB  - Borneo harbours more endemic carnivores than does any other island in the world except Madagascar, and almost half of the Bornean carnivore species have been classified by The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as globally threatened. Here, a systematic conservation planning framework highlighted key carnivore landscapes, conservation research and intervention priorities, and gaps in current knowledge of Bornean carnivore ecology. All single-species predictive habitat suitability index (HSI) models presented in this issue (20 species, comprising all carnivores on Borneo except otters [Lutrinae] and sun bear Helarctos malayanus) were standardised by converting HSI values into binary maps, and combined to derive species richness maps to discuss and delineate areas of conservation priority. The highest predicted carnivore species richness (defined here as the sum of the binary threshold maps), corresponds to interior lowland, upland and lower montane forest, whereas areas with lowest predicted species richness correspond to coastal lowlands already largely converted to oil palm plantations. The 12 proposed areas of conservation importance for carnivores focus on large landscapes and connectivity between subunits, many centred around the tri-national Heart of Borneo initiative, with additional areas for wetland/lowland species. A large proportion of these proposed conservation landscapes are being exploited for commercial purposes (e.g., logging concessions) and would, therefore, improve in conservation value if their management became more sustainable. The most important research priorities for Bornean carnivores are species resilience to altered and fragmented landscapes; under-surveyed regions; and the effects and relative intensity of hunting across the island. The most pressing conservation interventions include conservation research on the most threatened Bornean carnivores: the Bornean ferret badger Melogale everetti and Hose's civet Diplogale hosei (highland endemics), and the flat-headed cat Prionailurus planiceps and otter civet Cynogale bennettii (wetland specialists). Targeted conservation research and integration of research findings into decision-making, maintaining and restoring connectivity, raising awareness and improving enforcement and governance are also important conservation interventions. Although more resources are needed for conservation and research, the joint effort of scientists, conservationists and government authorities in the identification of key carnivore landscapes, research priorities and conservation issues which this study presents raises hope that more targeted conservation efforts for Bornean carnivores will follow in the future.

AB  - Climate change impacts are important in shaping large ecotones, such as the transition zone between the Cerrado and Amazon rainforest (CAT) biogeographical domains. The accelerating rate of conversion of native vegetation, the most important factor for biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene, compounded by projected climate change impacts, requires a review of the effectiveness of existing designated protected areas (PA) and indigenous land (IL), where low-intensity and low-impact land use prevails. We identified priority tree species for conservation and quantified changes in their projected spatial distribution in future climate scenarios to estimate the conservation effectiveness of the current network of PA and IL in the CAT. Applying niche-based models to compare the geographical range of species in current and future climates, we estimated the displacement of species from their current distribution owing to projected climate change. We used four different IPCC emission scenarios for 2050 and quantified the losses or gains in species richness in PA and IL. All species were projected to suffer a reduction of climatically suitable area and a consequent range reduction. Inside both PA and IL there was a projected decrease in richness of the target species under climate change. The current PA network and designated IL in the CAT do not appear to safeguard future conservation of the species they currently contain. The future 'climate refugia' that our work identified could form the basis of plans to expand the protected area network in a region that remains under ever increasing pressure of deforestation in Brazil.

AB  - Effects of climate change on three species of Cupido (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae) with different biogeographic distribution in Andalusia, southern Spain.- Knowledge of the spatial distribution of rare or endangered species is of key importance to assess conservation status at different geographic scales and to develop conservation and recovery programs. In this paper we review and update the distribution of three species of Lycaenid butterflies in Andalusia (southern Spain): Cupido carswelli, C. lorquinii, and C. osiris. Cupido carswelli is endemic in south east Spain and is considered a vulnerable species in the Red Book of Invertebrates of Andalusia. Cupido lorquinii is an Iberian-Maghrebian endemism, found in the southern half of the Iberian peninsula. Cupido osiris, widely distributed in Europe and Central Asia, has its southern limit of distribution in Andalusia. We modeled the potential current distribution of these species in Andalusia, using Maxent. Their potential distribution was mainly conditioned by the presence of their host plants and, to a lesser extent, by climatic variables: rainfall during the warmest and coldest quarters of the year and annual mean temperature. AUC test values, sensitivity, and specificity for the three models were high, confirming the accuracy of the models and their high predictive values. We also modeled the potential future distributions of the three species under the climate change scenario A2a. Our results predict a significant reduction in the potential distribution for C. lorquinii -which has a wider distribution in Andalusia than the other two species-and for the more localized species, C. osiris and C. carswelli. This expected decline in the south of the Iberian peninsula highlights the pressing need to design and implement specific conservation plans for these species.

AB  - Global plant diversity is at risk due to anthropogenic changes to ecosystems, but given severely limited conservation resources, a reliable prioritisation strategy for species and sites is needed. Our objective was to identify key areas for conserving the phylogenetic diversity (PD) of threatened vascular plants in Italy, one of the most species-rich regions in the Mediterranean Basin. We used spatial data and the conservation status of 995 threatened vascular plants and applied a phylogenetically informed spatial planning to minimize conservation costs. We then determined the degree of overlap with existing protected areas and evaluated whether this PD-based prioritisation of areas provides adequate protection for threatened phylogenetically distinctive species (EDGE). The cost-effective procedure identified as priority for conservation 12% of the study territory, while achieving over 90% of conservation targets (total PD). We showed that priority areas and protected areas are moderately spatially mismatched. We also showed that not all top-EDGE species were met by the procedure applied, hence we conclude that the PD-based model indicated key areas for protection, but nevertheless additional attention is needed to protect top-EDGE species. This study represents one of the most comprehensive analyses, to date, for the conservation of the native flora in the Mediterranean, incorporating both spatial distribution and evolutionary relationships. Our work on the prioritisation of threatened plant species across Italy can serve as a guide for future conservation applications. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - White pines (Pinus subsect. Strobus) are important in many Northern Hemisphere forest ecosystems, and white pine species are often narrowly distributed or even endangered in China. In this study, we integrated phylogeography, ecological niche modeling, and conservation gap analysis to assess conservation priorities for the white pine species in China, and subsequently provided valuable insights for their effective conservation. First, to infer their phylogeographic structure, DNA sequence data were obtained for three plastid and two mitochondrial regions from 87 individuals representing all 12 natural species in China. Then, the effectiveness of existing protected areas (PAs) in China was evaluated by overlapping 1372 PAs to the current and future suitable habitats identified by MaxEnt. We also used the software Marxan to assess irreplaceable planning units (IPUs) and conservation priority areas. Our results revealed that the plastid and mitochondrial data generated different phylogenetic relationships, indicating historical introgressions among the white pine species. Additionally, half of the species in China, including endangered species such as P. dabeshanensis, P. wangii, and P. kwangtungensis, are poorly protected with low percentages (<10%) of suitable habitats held within the current PAs. We also identified 73,390 IPUs representing 201 conservation priority areas for the white pine species. Those IPUs, as well as priority areas, are also poorly protected especially in southern China. Our results demonstrated large conservation gaps for white pines in southern China that need to be filled by creating more nature reserves. Given these findings, we concluded that white pine species in China urgently need targeted conservation management to ensure effective protection and to maintain the species? overall genetic diversity. Such management should include in situ and ex situ conservation, ground protection, and assisted migration.

AB  - Aim It is increasingly recognized the importance of accounting for imperfect detection in species distribution modelling and conservation planning. However, the integration of detectability into a spatially explicit frame has received little attention. We aim (1) to show how to develop distribution maps of both detection probability and survey effort required to reliably determine a species presence/absence and (2) to increase awareness of the spatial variation of detection error inherent in studies of species occurrence.
   Location North-western Spain.
   Methods We registered the presence/absence of the endangered Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in 213 surveys performed in 40 of 104 territories once known to be occupied. We model simultaneously both detection probability and occurrence, using site occupancy modelling. With the resulting regression equations, we developed distribution maps of both detection probability and required sampling effort throughout the area.
   Results Of the studied territories, 72.5% were detected as occupied, but after accounting for imperfect detection, the proportion of sites truly occupied was 79%. Detectability decreased in territories with higher topographical irregularity and increased with both the time of day of the survey and the progress of the season. Spatial distribution of detectability showed a mainly north-south gradient following the distribution of slope in the area. The likelihood of occupancy increased with rockier, less forested surface and less topographical irregularity within the territory. A minimum of five surveys, on average, are needed to assess, with 95% probability, the occupancy status of a site, ranging from <= 3 to > 24 visits/territory depending on survey-and site-specific features.
   Main conclusions Accounting for detectability and its sources of variation allows us to elaborate distribution maps of detectability-based survey effort. These maps are useful tools to reliably assess (e.g. with 95% probability) occupancy status throughout a landscape and provide guidance for species conservation planning.

AB  - The Dakota skipper, Hesperia dacotae, (Hesperiidae) is an at-risk Lepidoptera species, limited in Canada to native mesic mixed-grass prairie habitat in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Due to declines in the native mesic mixed-grass prairie the Dakota skipper population is threatened by loss of habitat. Currently, there is little knowledge about Dakota skipper and the availability and distribution of suitable habitat within Saskatchewan. Our objective was to map potential Dakota skipper habitat using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) based species distribution model with climate, soil, and landscape predictor variables. Potential Dakota skipper habitat was found broadly in the mesic mixed-grass prairie region, however there is only similar to 217 km(2) of potential habitat (probability of occurrence 0.7-1). Locations with high probability of occurrence had soils with a significantly higher soil ammonium (NH4+) and silt content than low probability locations. While the Dakota skipper is broadly distributed in native mesic mixed-grass prairie of southeastern Saskatchewan, environmental constraints likely restrict this species to a limited proportion of the intact native prairie. Implications for insect conservation: Mapping landscape-level species distributions will assist in the development of conservation and management plans for the Dakota skipper in southeastern Saskatchewan including targeted surveys for unknown populations in areas of high potential, identification of potential reintroduction sites, and selection of lands for conservation.

AB  - Background. Just as for most other tortoise species, the once common Chaco tortoise, Chelonoidis chilensis (Testudinidae), is under constant threat across it distribution in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. Despite initial qualitative description of the species distribution and further individual reports of new locations for the species, there is no description of the species distribution in probabilistic terms. With this work we aim to produce an updated predictive distribution map for C. chilensis to serve as a baseline management tool for directed strategic conservation planning.
   Methods. We fitted a spatially expanded logistic regression model within the Bayesian framework that accounts for uncertainty on presence-only and generated pseudo-absence data into the parameter estimates. We contrast the results with reported data for the national networks of protected areas to assess the inclusion of the species in area-based conservation strategies.
   Results. We obtained maps with predictions of the occurrence of the species and reported the model's uncertainty spatially. The model suggests that potential suitable habitats for the species are continuous across Argentina, West Paraguay and South Bolivia, considering the variables, the scale and the resolution used. The main limiting variables were temperature-related variables, and precipitation in the reproductive period.
   Discussion. Given the alarming low density and coverage of protected areas over the distribution area of C. chilensis, the map produced provides a baseline to identify areas where directed strategic conservation management actions would be more efficient for this and other associated species.

AB  - Intra-seasonal changes of the ecological needs and the distribution patterns of multi-brooded bird species are a poorly studied but potentially important topic in avian conservation planning. In this study of a passerine species of conservation concern, the woodlark Lullula arborea, we highlight the conservation implications of spatial shifts of breeding territories and changes of habitat requirements during the course of the breeding season. We described the factors affecting the distribution and habitat selection of this species in the Trebbia river valley (northern Apennines, Italy), where we mapped woodlark territories during the average time of first and second clutches. A strong shift of territories towards higher altitudes with the progression of the season was observed. The habitat models predicting woodlark occurrence varied between the early and the late period. Specifically, fodder cover positively predicted occurrence early in the season, whereas late in the season occurrence was positively influenced by shrub cover, length of woodland edge, alfalfa cover and rocky areas. Accordingly, territories that were occupied throughout the entire season had greater fodder, shrub and rocky cover compared with those that were occupied only early in the season, suggesting that these variables were important in determining territory quality for woodlarks. Therefore, changing ecological needs of multi-brooded bird species during the breeding season have to be taken into account for defining appropriate conservation strategies. This was demonstrated by showing that the habitat variables predicting woodlark occurrence early in the season poorly predicted occurrence late in the season and vice versa. In conclusion, this study provides the first detailed assessment of habitat factors affecting the occurrence of breeding woodlarks in an important portion of the species' range, and represents the first explicit attempt to model seasonally changing ecological requirements of bird species for conservation purposes. Our findings suggest that complex data and flexible habitat management strategies are required to account for temporal changes in habitat suitability in multi-brooded bird species.

AB  - The phantom vampire, Vampyrum spectrum (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae), is the largest South American flying mammal classified as threatened by the IUCN. Despite the broad distribution of this species across South America, its low population density and the spatial isolation of its populations may compromise its response to the expected climate change. Using species distribution models, we increased our knowledge of the historical, current, and future spatial distribution patterns of this species. Considering past [last glacial maximum (LGM) and middle Holocene], current, and future climatic scenarios for the South American extent, we used MaxEnt, random forest (RF), and support vector machine methods to model the distribution of V. spectrum over time and identify/quantify climatically stable areas. We observed that our models achieved good performances for all algorithms, especially for RF. The spatial distribution patterns obtained from the models made it possible to identify areas where V. spectrum was more stable over time. From the LGM to the current and future scenarios, the overall balance is the loss of areas in the species distribution range. By using multitemporal analyses, we may be able to identify repeated historical patterns where some conservation areas may be effective in the future if the spatial patterns of distribution are similar to past distributions. Our work contributes to increasing the knowledge of the spatial distribution of the species, providing support for practical management and conservation plans while also showing the importance of predicting historical spatial patterns and considering their spatial trends.

AB  - Background: Conservation planning and the design of marine protected areas (MPAs) requires spatially explicit information on the distribution of ecological features. Most species of marine mammals range over large areas and across multiple planning regions. The spatial distributions of marine mammals are difficult to predict using habitat modelling at ecological scales because of insufficient understanding of their habitat needs, however, relevant information may be available from surveys conducted to inform mandatory stock assessments.
   Methodology and Results: We use a 20-year time series of systematic aerial surveys of dugong (Dugong dugong) abundance to create spatially-explicit models of dugong distribution and relative density at the scale of the coastal waters of northeast Australia (similar to 136,000 km(2)). We interpolated the corrected data at the scale of 2 km * 2 km planning units using geostatistics. Planning units were classified as low, medium, high and very high dugong density on the basis of the relative density of dugongs estimated from the models and a frequency analysis. Torres Strait was identified as the most significant dugong habitat in northeast Australia and the most globally significant habitat known for any member of the Order Sirenia. The models are used by local, State and Federal agencies to inform management decisions related to the Indigenous harvest of dugongs, gill-net fisheries and Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas.
   Conclusion/Significance: In this paper we demonstrate that spatially-explicit population models add value to data collected for stock assessments, provide a robust alternative to predictive habitat distribution models, and inform species conservation at multiple scales.

AB  - The Amazon rainforest covers more than 60% of Bolivia's lowlands, providing habitat for many endemic and threatened species. Bolivia has the highest rates of deforestation of the Amazon biome, which degrades and fragments species habitat. Anthropogenic habitat changes could be exacerbated by climate change, and therefore, developing relevant strategies for biodiversity protection under global change scenarios is a necessary step in conservation planning.
   In this research we used multi-species umbrella concept to evaluate the degree of habitat impacts due to climate and land cover change in Bolivia. We used species distribution modeling to map three focal species (Jaguar, Lowland Tapir and Lesser Anteater) and assessed current protected area network effectiveness under future climate and land cover change scenarios for 2050.
   The studied focal species will lose between 70% and 83% of their ranges under future climate and land-cover change scenarios, decreasing the level of protection to 10% of their original ranges. Existing protected area network should be reconsidered to maintain current and future biodiversity habitats. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Paubrasilia echinata is a widely cultivated endangered tree species with small populations restricted to a narrow strip of habitats along the Brazilian coast. The potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of P. echinata have yet to be investigated, and so it remains unknown whether protected areas will ensure the persistence of the species in the future. Here, we estimate the impacts of climate change on the distribution of P. echinata inside and outside of protected areas considering different climate change scenarios and two different sets of presence records: natural distribution and cultivated records. Future scenarios showed a gradual reduction in climatically suitable area both inside and outside of protected areas. Projections indicate a trend for a shift to the highlands of Southeast Brazil, and the loss of several areas throughout the entire distribution of the species. Predicted climatic conditions will be unsuitable for P. echinata inside most protected areas. Information provided here will be relevant in planning future national actions for this species, which is a must to properly protect this long-exploited tree.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs), especially those basing on climatic parameters, have frequently been used to project future species ranges and to develop conservation strategies. As suggested by several authors, we considered both different dispersal abilities and different evolutionarily significant units (ESUs, as determined in an earlier genetic survey). For our study species, the flightless ground beetle Carabus irregularis, SDMs for two ESUs from the western and the Carpathian area of the distribution range showed immense, and deviating future range contractions reflecting divergent ecological requirements. As minimal dispersal SDMs resulted in a stronger decline of future ranges than the maximal dispersal models, low dispersal ability tended to strengthen the already high vulnerability of the cold-adapted mountain species to global warming. Areas shown in our maximal dispersal models as offering climatically suitable habitats for C. irregularis in the future should be considered as potential areas of action in future conservation planning (e. g. assisted migration or assisted colonisation). Thus, both dispersal scenarios and different (if applicable) ESUs should be considered when developing SDMs as useful tools for species conservation strategies adapted to species' performance and differentiation patterns.

AB  - Mammals can serve as an indicator of global climate change impacts on species' distributions due to the wide range of ecological niches they utilize. Tropical Asia encompasses several biodiversity hotspots, is the largest reservoir of mammalian diversity on earth, and has already experienced the extinction of several mammal species either regionally or locally. Global climate change could become a significant driver of species extinction, either directly or synergistically with other factors, such as habitat loss, agricultural expansion, overexploitation, and land use change. Despite the variability of climatic regimes across tropical Asia, the potential impacts of climate change on continental-scale distributions of mammals have not been examined. To address this issue, we developed habitat suitability models for four threatened large mammals (Ursus thibetanus, Elephas maximus, Hoolock hoolock, and Panthera tigris tigris), across their entire distributions in Asia. We used presence-only distribution records and nine bioclimatic and environmental variables and built species-specific habitat suitability models using a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). We used a moderate and an extreme climate scenario (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) and three time steps: current, 2050, and 2070. Our results suggest that changes in annual precipitation, annual mean temperature, precipitation, and temperature seasonality could reduce suitable habitat for these mammals and therefore increase their extinction risks. However, several patches of stable habitat are projected to persist through the late twenty-first century, and these climate change refugia areas can be managed as an important strategy for conservation of the mammal species and the maintenance of biodiversity in the face of ongoing climate change. In this context, we recommend the following steps for the conservation of global mammal populations: (i) define the spatial extent (local, regional, or continental scale) of the target mammals, (ii) identify and prioritize climate change refugial areas following ecological niche models or other methods based on biological data, and (iii) implement management actions by analyzing current management tools and the strategies required (e.g., habitat restoration or assisted migration for prioritized species) to achieve long-term conservation goals.

AB  - Invertebrates are commonly ignored in conservation planning due to their vast diversity, difficulties with species identification, a poor understanding of their spatial patterns, and the impracticability of carrying out comprehensive sampling. Conservation planning for fauna is therefore often based on patterns of diversity and distribution of vertebrates, under the assumption that these are representative of animal diversity more generally. Here, we evaluate how well vertebrates act as umbrellas for invertebrate diversity and distribution in a highly diverse tropical savanna landscape, and we investigate the effect of vertebrate sampling intensity (i. e., number of surveys) on congruence results. We assessed congruence between each of the four classes of terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and twelve invertebrate families (representing four dominant invertebrate taxa: ants, beetles, flies, and spiders) by applying a range of modeling approaches to analyze patterns of cross-taxon congruence in species richness and composition across sampling sites. To investigate drivers of congruence, we applied generalized and distance-based linear models to identify environmental associations of richness and composition for each taxon, then examined variation in environmental associations across taxa. Vertebrate and invertebrate richness was weakly (< 30%) associated, and 60% of the significant associations were negative. Correlations in species composition between vertebrate and invertebrate taxa were also weak, with a maximum of 13% congruence. In most cases, pairwise correlation scores using data from single surveys of vertebrates were only marginally lower than those from multiple surveys. Poor among-site congruence between vertebrates and invertebrates was reflected by marked variation among taxa in their environmental associations. Our findings show that vertebrates are poor umbrellas for invertebrates in the tropical savannas of northern Australia in terms of geographic patterns of diversity and distribution and that this is not just an artifact of low vertebrate sampling intensity. Our study is one of the most comprehensive regional analyses of the congruence of vertebrate and invertebrate diversity, and it significantly adds to the growing evidence that empirical data on invertebrate diversity and distribution are required for conservation planning that effectively protects all faunal diversity.

AB  - Effective management of biodiversity in production landscapes requires a conservation approach that acknowledges the complexity of ecological and cultural systems in time and space. Fennoscandia has experienced major loss of forest biodiversity caused by intensive forestry. Therefore, the Countdown 2010 initiative to halt the loss of biodiversity in Europe is highly relevant to forest management in this part of the continent. As a contribution to meeting the challenge posed by Countdown 2010, we developed a spatially explicit conservation-planning exercise that used regional knowledge on forest biodiversity to provide support for managers attempting to halt further loss of biological diversity in the region. We used current data on the distribution of 169 species (including 68 red-listed species) representing different forest habitats and ecologies along with forest data within the frame of modern conservation software to devise a map of priority areas for conservation. The top 10% of priority areas contained over 75% of red-listed species locations and 41% of existing protected forest areas, but only 58% of these top priorities overlapped with core areas identified previously in a regional strategy that used more qualitative methods. We argue for aggregating present and future habitat value of single management units to landscape and regional scales to identify potential bottlenecks in habitat availability linked to landscape dynamics. To address the challenge of Countdown 2010, a general framework for forest conservation planning in Fennoscandia needs to cover different conservation issues, tools, and data needs.

AB  - For the effective conservation of vulnerable marine populations, knowledge of their distributions and spatially explicit management actions are essential. The use of physical features or coarse habitat types as surrogates of species distribution often does not provide an accurate enough (and hence useful) mapping of where species occur. This is further exacerbated in datapoor regions, where habitat maps in the marine environment are often patchy. A combination of satellite imaging analysis (for a rough classification of the main habitat types in shallow waters) and occupancy modelling based on data collected through dedicated underwater surveys is proposed as a relatively inexpensive and timely way to identify priority areas for the conservation of selected benthic species. The occupancy surveys provide estimates of the probability of presence, which can be used as weights of the importance of the available suitable habitat types in a potential habitat index (PHI). This approach was applied in the Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) for 6 benthic hard-bottom species of conservation importance. Repetitive SCUBA diving surveys were conducted at six 5 m depth zones between 0 and 30 m at 47 locations in the Aegean Sea to detect the presence of the target species. Occupancy was modelled using several environmental spatial covariates. The applied method explicitly incorporated imperfect detectability in the modelling process. Predictive distributional maps of PHI were produced for each species, identifying areas that could be prioritized for conservation measures. Despite some limitations, this approach can provide a baseline for the protection of vulnerable species, in the framework of adaptive management for marine conservation planning.

AB  - We developed a methodology for biodiversity evaluations within the process of Strategic Environmental Assessment and we applied it to the estimation of the effect of two Regional Plans of Development on all bird species inhabiting the Castilla y Leon region (northwestern Spain). The methodology is based on the evaluation of the effects of main development actions on the habitat requirements of species. from these evaluations, and from data on the current distribution and population size (number of individuals) of each species, we estimated the most likely pattern of distribution and population size after the full implementation of the plans for each species. The impacts of the plans were quantified as the differences between the pre- and postproject patterns after codifying them to compensate for differences in the quality of the information available among species. Overall, we conclude that the proposed methodology fulfills the requirements for its use within the SEA process as it allows for the assessment of cumulative impacts on every species, highlighting the development directions and the habitat types with major impacts, and ascertaining whether impacts affect species with either low or high conservation and/or economic value. Generalization of the proposed methodology to other regions or species will require wildlife-habitat models adequate for SEA analyses, so that we also propose guidelines for the development and validation of these models.

AB  - Species distribution models have become some of the most important tools for the assessment of the impact of climatic change, and human activity, and for the detection of failure in silvicultural or conservation management plans. In this study, we modeled the potential distribution of 13 tree species of temperate forests distributed in the Mexican state Durango in the Sierra Madre Occidental, for three periods of time. Models were constructed for each period of time using 19 climate variables from the MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy algorithm) modelling algorithm. Those constructed for the future used a severe climate change scenario. When comparing the potential areas of the periods, some species such as Pinus durangensis (Martinez), Pinus teocote (Schiede ex Schltdl. & Cham.) and Quercus crassifolia (Bonpl.) showed no drastic changes. Rather, the models projected a slight reduction, displacement or fragmentation in the potential area of Pinus arizonica (Engelm.), P. cembroides (Zucc), P. engelmanni (Carr), P. leiophylla (Schl), Quercus arizonica (Sarg), Q. magnolifolia (Nee) and Q. sideroxila (Humb. & Bonpl.) in the future period. Thus, establishing conservation and reforestation strategies in the medium and long term could guarantee a wide distribution of these species in the future.

AB  - Systematic data in the form of collections data are useful in biodiversity studies in many ways, most importantly because they serve as the only direct evidence of species distributions. However, collecting bias has been demonstrated for most areas of the world and has led some to propose methods that circumvent the need for collections data. New methods that model collections data in combination with abiotic data and predict potential total species distribution are examined using 25,111 records representing 5, 123 species of plants and animals from Guyana; some methods use the reduced number of 320 species. These modeled species distributions are evaluated and potential high-priority biodiversity sites are selected based on the concept of irreplaceability, a measure of uniqueness. The major impediments to using collections data are the lack of data that are available in a useful format and the reluctance of most systematists to become involved in biodiversity and conservation research.

AB  - Aim The dimensions of species vulnerability to climate change are complex, and this impedes efforts to provide clear advice for conservation planning. In this study, we used a formal framework to assess species vulnerability to climate change quantifying exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and then used this information to target areas for reducing vulnerability at a regional scale.
   Location The 6500-km(2) Mount Lofty Ranges region in South Australia.
   Methods We quantified the vulnerability of 171 plant species in a fragmented yet biologically important agro-ecological landscape, typical of many temperate zones globally. We specified exposure, using three climate change scenarios; sensitivity, as the adverse impact of climate change on species' spatial distribution; and adaptive capacity, as the ability of species to migrate calculated using dispersal kernels. Priority areas for reducing vulnerability were then identified by incorporating these various components into a single priority index.
   Results Climate change had a variable impact on species distributions. Those species whose range decreased or shifted geographically were attributed higher sensitivity than those species that increased geographic range or remained unchanged. The ability to adapt to range changes in response to shifting climates varies both spatially and between species. Areas of highest priority for reducing vulnerability were found at higher altitudes and lower latitudes with increasing severity of climate change.
   Main conclusions Our study demonstrates the use of a single spatially explicit index that identifies areas in the landscape for targeting specific conservation and restoration actions to reduce species vulnerability to climate change. Our index can be transferred to other regions around the world in which climate change poses an increasing threat to native species.

AB  - Efficient threatened species prioritisation and management is critical to the overall success of biodiversity conservation. Insufficient species information can make it challenging to accurately assess a species' extinction risk and develop appropriate management strategies. In this study we undertook field surveys and spatial data analysis to better understand the habitat and distribution of the threatened annual grass Arthraxon hispidus (Thunb.) Makino (Hairy Jointgrass) within its north coast New South Wales range. We developed and tested a high-resolution maximum entropy (Maxent) model, using field survey population mapping and freely available spatial data (e.g. soil, topography, foliage cover, hydrology) to identify its landscape distribution drivers, to predict its suitable habitat areas and to estimate its abundance. The model indicated that A. hispidus habitat occurs in non-woody vegetation in areas of high topographic wetness and persistent moisture, particularly in and around drainage lines or on south-facing slopes. We found that A. hispidus appears to be much more widespread than previously known, with high rates of occurrence at predicted but previously unsurveyed sites, and approximately 15 % of the study area projected to be suitable habitat for the species. We estimated that the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy of the species exceeded vulnerable species listing criteria thresholds within IUCN guidelines. This study demonstrates how species distribution modelling can add to existing resources to provide cost-effective data to inform and streamline conservation planning.

AB  - Climate change and biodiversity loss underscore the need for conservation planning, even in remote areas. Species distribution models (SDMs) can help identify critical habitat for reserve design and selection, and have quickly advanced to the fore of ecological inquiry. Such models are typically dominated by abiotic factors, following the Eltonian Noise Hypothesis (ENH) that physical features set the limits of species distributions. Nevertheless, recent studies challenge this notion and highlight the importance of biotic interactions. Resolving this discrepancy could have significant implications for conservation and ecological understanding. To test these ideas, we built distribution models for two large herbivores, muskoxen (Ovibos muschatus) and Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi), systematically observed across a vast spatial extent 65 islands spanning 800,000 km(2) in the Canadian High Arctic. To test the ENH we fit SDMs with two sets of predictors: (1) abiotic only (i.e. topographic, climatic) and (2) abiotic thorn biotic (i.e. vegetation communities, distance-to-heterospecifics). We evaluated these models and spatially estimated habitat suitability for each species. We found both sets of models had good predictive ability, although biotic variables (i.e. proportion of grass-lichen-moss) improved model performance and substantially narrowed areas of high habitat suitability. Niche overlap between caribou and muskoxen was moderate and highly suitable areas were spatially disjunct between species and largely outside protected areas. These results fail to support the ENH. Our study implies that biotic features, although often overlooked, may be important to the performance of SDMs and vital in identifying priority areas for conservation. For these large herbivores, reflecting trophic interactions in SDMs was essential when estimating areas of conservation value. Our approach helps prepare the way for improved projections regarding the prospects for wildlife while laying the foundation for biologically relevant protected areas. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Effective management of threatened and endangered species requires an understanding of how species of conservation concern are distributed spatially, as well as the spatial distribution of risks to the population, such as predation or human impacts (fishing, pollution, and loss of habitat). Identifying high-risk areas is particularly important when designing reserves or protected areas. Our novel approach incorporates data on distribution, movement, and diet of a generalist marine predator (harbor seals) to identify and map hot spots of predation risk for an endangered prey species (rockfish). Areas with high concentrations of seals (including some current marine reserves) are also estimated hot spots for rockfish predation. Although marine reserve planning currently targets areas with good habitat and low human disturbance, our modeling suggests that future terrestrial and marine reserve design may be made more effective by incorporating other components of the food web that either directly or indirectly interact with target species.

AB  - Aim We used chelonian distribution data to (1) predict suitable areas of the occurrence for freshwater turtle species using species distribution models and (2) evaluate whether these species are protected by the current network of protected areas (PAs).
   Location The Brazilian Amazon.
   Methods We generated predictions of suitable areas for chelonian occurrence based on BIOCLIM, SVM, GLM and maximum entropy modelling procedures. We used maximum entropy to run the gap analysis and compared the effectiveness of three kinds of protected areas with different levels of protection: (1) integral protection areas (IPA) only; (2) integral protection areas + sustainable use areas (IPA+ SUA); and (3) integral protection areas + sustainable use areas + indigenous lands (IPA + SUA + IL).
   Results We identified only one full gap species, Mesoclemmys nasuta, whose distribution is not included in any PAs. Other chelonian species have at least a portion of their distribution included in PAs. Some protected species and partial gap species occur in areas with high rates of deforestation. Considering PAs with the highest level of protection (IPA), only Rhinoclemmys punctularia and Kinosternon scorpioides achieve their conservation targets. In the IPA + SUA scenario, conservation targets of some species with small range sizes are not achieved. When all PA types were considered (IPA + SUA + IL), only two species fail to achieve their conservation targets, Acanthochelys macrocephala and M. nasuta.
   Main conclusions Despite the large number of PAs in the Brazilian Amazon, IPAs alone are not sufficient for capturing suitable areas for freshwater turtles. The inclusion of SUA and IL is crucial for achieving coverage targets for most species. However, chelonians may be overharvested in SUAs and ILs, due to their importance as a food resource. Areas that have high turtle richness next to existing PAs and the needs of traditional cultures should be considered in management planning for freshwater turtles.

AB  - Predictions of future species' ranges under climate change are needed for conservation planning, for which species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used. However, global climate model-based (GCM) output grids can bias the area identified as suitable when these are used as SDM predictor variables, because GCM outputs, typically at least 50X50 km, are biologically coarse. We tested the assumption that species ranges can be equally well portrayed in SDMs operating on base data of different grid sizes by comparing SDM performance statistics and area selected by four SDMs run at seven grid sizes, for nine species of contrasting range size. Area selected was disproportionately larger for SDMs run on larger grid sizes, indicating a cut-off point above which model results were less reliable. Up to 2.89 times more species range area was selected by SDMs operating on grids above 50X50 km, compared to SDMs operating at 1 km(2). Spatial congruence between areas selected as range also diverged as grid size increased, particularly for species with ranges between 20 000 and 90 000 km(2). These results indicate the need for caution when using such data to plan future protected areas, because an overly large predicted range could lead to inappropriate reserve location selection.

AB  - Including the distance species are able to move in predictive models improves conservation practice. Bird inventory projects carried out from 1993 to 2004 in Taiwan provide an opportunity to investigate the relationships among species distribution, movement distance, and the environment. We compared projected distributions of 17 Taiwanese endemic bird species using what we called the Standard Method (i.e. movement distance is zero) and what we called the Buffer Met hod (i.e. movement distance is longer than zero) in three presence-only models (GARP, MAXENT and LIVES). The Standard Method used species original occurrence records directly while the Buffer Method expanded the occurrence of species to areas 1 km(2) around each recorded location. We first tested the efficacy of the Buffer Method using ten common species of the 17, and then applied the method to two rare species of the 17. For both the common and rare species, the distributions predicted by the two methods showed slight but important differences. The Buffer Method for all species had a higher average predictive probability, while the Standard Method had a higher maximum predictive probability. Most of the values for the area under the curve (AUC) were over 0.8 with the exceptions of Taiwan Barbet (Megalaima nuchalis) and Taiwan Hwamei (Garrulax taewanus), which have recently separated from Indochinese Barbet (Megalaima annamensis) and Chinese Hwamei (Garrulax canorus), and since 2008 and 2006 have been regarded as species endemic to the study area. Kappa values showed good performance for all species using both methods. The Buffer Method, however, resulted in significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy values for all models of species (p < 0.05). We conclude that when modeling species distribution including the area where the species was censused along with areas within the minimum movement areas better defines the surrounding areas that might supplement core habitat requirements. Therefore, using the Buffer Method, species surrounding distribution can be obtained which provides a better understanding of the species distributions. Given that distribution size is a key to the conservation of species, we suggest the Buffer Method can be used in conservation planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The contribution of protected areas to biodiversity conservation is well attested but many taxa in many regions remain dependent on the unprotected wider landscape. To develop conservation plans for large mammals such as the Endangered pygmy hippopotamus Choeropsis liberiensis of West Africa's Upper Guinea Forests it is critical to understand the importance of unprotected land. Despite being a conservation priority, little is known about the habitat associations of this species, or its distribution across its range. Through a combination of field surveys, species distribution models and community questionnaires we investigated the use of unprotected areas by the pygmy hippopotamus in the Sierra Leone-Liberia border region. We found signs of the species in 128 of 525 1-km(2) cells surveyed. Our analysis suggested that the species is reasonably widespread in this region and is associated with major rivers. It occurred close to, but rarely within, large areas of intact forest, and 80.4% of pygmy hippopotamus signs were recorded outside protected areas. The expansion of the protected area network in this area is unrealistic in Sierra Leone and to some extent in Liberia, mainly because of anthropogenic pressure and the overlap of proposed protected areas with mining and logging concessions. Thus pygmy hippopotamus conservation activities in the region need to include programmes on community lands while maintaining a robust network of protected forests. Community-based conservation of the pygmy hippopotamus may prove valuable for other threatened and endemic species that are not confined to protected areas in this region.

AB  - Aim A number of assumptions underpinning the use of species distribution models to predict biological responses to climate change are violated for temperate and boreal tree species that are widespread, long-lived and genetically adapted to local climate conditions. To address this situation, we propose a methodology to account for the potential effects of genetic structure, adaptive potential and limited migration capacity. Location British Columbia, Canada. Methods Similar to the widely used no migration' and unlimited migration' scenarios, we employ more refined biological response scenarios to evaluate the potential effects of genetic adaptation to local environments and the capacity of species to adapt and migrate. These scenarios are realized by two sets of geographic delineations that partition the species range into multiple populations and that subdivide the study area into smaller landscape units. Results In a case study for British Columbia, we demonstrate how the approach can be used to evaluate the adequacy of a reserve system of 906 protected areas to ensure long-term maintenance of forest genetic resources for 48 tree species. We find that between 35% and 85% of locally adapted populations in protected areas are maintained under a median climate change scenario until the end of the century. A sensitivity analysis shows that assumptions about migration and adaptation capacity of species have a major effect on the projected conservation status. Main conclusions We propose that the results of species distribution models have practical value for conservation planning if the focus is on maintenance rather than loss of suitable habitat. Accounting for genetic structure, adaptive potential and migration capacity through best-case and worst-case scenarios provide important information to effectively allocate limited resources available for conservation action.

AB  - Information on where species occur is an important component of conservation and management decisions, but knowledge of distributions is often coarse or incomplete. Species distribution models provide a tool for mapping habitat and can produce credible, defensible, and repeatable information with which to inform decisions. However, these models are sensitive to data inputs and methodological choices, making it important to assess the reliability and utility of model predictions. We provide a rubric that model developers can use to communicate a model's attributes and its appropriate uses. We emphasize the importance of tailoring model development and delivery to the species of interest and the intended use and the advantages of iterative modeling and validation. We highlight how species distribution models have been used to design surveys for new populations, inform spatial prioritization decisions for management actions, and support regulatory decision-making and compliance, lying these examples back to our model assessment rubric.

AB  - Predicting how environmental factors affect the distribution of species is a fundamental goal of conservation biology. Conservation biologists rely on species distribution and abundance models to identify key habitat characteristics for species. Occupancy modeling is frequently promoted as a practical alternative to use of abundance in identifying habitat quality. While occupancy and abundance are potentially governed by different limiting factors operating at different scales, few studies have directly compared predictive models for these approaches in the same system. We evaluated how much occupancy and abundance are driven by the same environmental factors for a species of conservation concern, the greater short-horned lizard (Phrynosoma hernandesi). Occupancy was most strongly dictated by precipitation, temperature, and density of ant mounds. While these factors were also in the best-supported predictive models for lizard abundance, the magnitude of the effects varied, with the sign of the effect changing for temperature and precipitation. These discrepancies show that while occupancy modeling can be an efficient approach for conservation planning, predictors of occupancy probability should not automatically be equated with predictors of population abundance. Understanding the differences in factors that control occupancy versus abundance can help us to identify habitat requirements and mitigate the loss of threatened species.

AB  - Spatial relationships between distribution patterns of many species and vegetated habitats over multiple scales have been used in terrestrial ecosystems to help identify and map important areas for conservation and management. This approach is not widely used in characterizing habitat use of nekton species in estuaries, but it has great potential because these systems contain fairly discrete vegetated habitat types, and the distribution of nekton species can be influenced by the spatial arrangement of habitat. We examined the spatial relationships between estuarine habitats and nekton species to help map estuarine nekton communities for use in conservation planning. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), we measured area (m(2)) and edge density (m km(-2)) of estuarine habitats over multiple scales in Charlotte Harbor, Florida (USA). We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to examine spatial patterns of nekton community composition, habitat, and local habitat characteristics. RDA revealed that spatial patterns in nekton community composition were most highly correlated with distance from the nearest pass to the Gulf of Mexico (r = -0.97) and with salinity (r = 0.94) and area of continuous seagrass habitat (r = 0.91). We used GIS maps of 2 variables (distance from the nearest pass and area of continuous seagrass habitat) to model spatial patterns in nekton community composition and the distribution of several juveniles of fishery species (red drum Sciaenops ocellatus, gray snapper Lutjanus griseus, lane snapper L. synagris, sand seatrout Cynoscion arenarius, and spotted seatrout C. nebulosus). The results suggest that incorporating measures of habitat area (over multiple scales) and spatial position into spatial models of nekton distribution is useful in conservation and management planning.

AB  - Aim Traditional approaches for including species' distributions in conservation planning have presented them as long-term averages of variation. Like these approaches, the main waterfowl conservation targeting tool in the United States Prairie Pothole Region (US PPR) is based primarily on long-term averaged distributions of breeding pairs. While this tool has supported valuable conservation, it does not explicitly consider spatiotemporal changes in spring wetland availability and does not assess wetland availability during the brood rearing period. We sought to develop a modelling approach and targeting tool that incorporated these types of dynamics for breeding waterfowl pairs and broods. This goal also presented an opportunity for us to compare predictions from a traditional targeting tool based on long-term averages to predictions from spatiotemporal models. Such a comparison facilitated tests of the underlying assumption that this traditional targeting tool could provide an effective surrogate measure for conservation objectives such as brood abundance and climate refugia.
   Location US PPR.
   Methods We developed spatiotemporal models of waterfowl pair and brood abundance within the US PPR. We compared the distributions predicted by these models and assessed similarity with the averaged pair data that is used to develop the current waterfowl targeting tool.
   Results Results demonstrated low similarity and correlation between the averaged pair data and spatiotemporal brood and pair models. The spatiotemporal pair model distributions served as better surrogates for brood abundance than the averaged pair data.
   Main conclusions Our study underscored the contributions that the current targeting tool has made to waterfowl conservation but also suggested that conservation plans in the region would benefit from the consideration of inter- and intra-annual dynamics. We suggested that using only the averaged pair data and derived products might result in the omission of 46%-98% of important pair and brood habitat, respectively, from conservation plans.

AB  - Understanding what limits the distribution and abundance of species is critical for adopting optimal conservation planning strategies, although it is still difficult to obtain abundance data at broad spatial scales. Here we propose conservation priorities in the Brazilian Cerrado based on density values of 108 mammal species. These values were estimated by an abundant-centre model coupled with McGill and Collin's unified theory for macroecology. We assumed that species' densities decay with a Gaussian distribution towards the range borders from a maximum density placed at the centre of each species' range. We used allometric equations to estimate maximum densities, at the Cerrado region we corrected the estimated densities by the natural vegetation remnants. Then we used a Simulated Annealing algorithm to select alternative sets of areas that met several levels of minimum viable population sizes (MVPSs) for each species. With low MVPSs, there were a small number of highly irreplaceable areas located in the northwest region of the biome, whereas with high MVPSs, highly irreplaceable areas occurred in up to 95% of the biome. By incorporating principles from the unified theory of macroecology, we were able to generate a conservation network for the Cerrado biome aiming to prioritise species' persistence and not just their presence.

AB  - The aim of this study is to predict changes in the distribution and extent of habitat forming species defined as "Priority Marine Habitats" (PMHs) in the North-East (NE) Atlantic under future scenarios of climate-induced environmental change. A Species Distribution Modelling method was used for each PMH to map the potential distribution of "most suitable" habitat. The area and percentage cover was calculated within each country's Exclusive Economic Zone for the baseline (2009) and the projected (2100) years. In addition, a conservation management score was calculated based on the number of PMHs that co-occur in assessment units. Overall, this study reveals the potential for movement and/or change in the extent of some PMHs across the NE Atlantic under an increased ocean temperature scenario (4 degrees C) by 2100. There are regional differences in the predicted changes and some countries will experience greater/different changes than others. The movement of biodiversity hotspots (where one or more PMHs occur in the same broad area) provides both opportunities and risks for conservation management that are discussed. Co-operation between neighbouring countries and marine regions will require substantial enhancement in order to provide a robust adaptive management strategy going forward. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Protected areas are the basis of modern conservation systems, but current climate change causes gaps between protected areas and the species distribution ranges. To mitigate the impact of climate change on species distribution ranges, revision of protected areas are necessary. Alternatively, active management such as excluding competitive species or transplanting target species would be effective. In this study, we assessed optimal actions (revision of protected areas or active management) in each geographical region to establish an effective spatial conservation plan in Japan. Gaps between the protected areas and future potential habitats were assessed using species distribution models and 20 future climate simulations. Fagus crenata, an endemic and dominant species in Japan, was used as a target species. Potential habitats within the protected areas were predicted to decrease from 22,122 km(2) at present to 12,309 km(2) under future climate conditions. Sustainable potential habitats (consistent potential habitats both at present and in future) without the protected areas extended to 13,208 km(2), and were mainly found in northeast Japan. These results suggest that, in northeast Japan, revisions to protected areas would be effective in preserving sustainable potential habitats under future climate change. However, the potential habitats of southwestern Japan, in which populations were genetically different from northeastern populations, were predicted to virtually disappear both within and outside of protected areas. Active management is thus necessary in southwestern Japan to ensure intraspecific genetic diversity under future climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - As renowned species for use in sand fixation and traditional Chinese medicines, Ephedra sinica Stapf, Ephedra intermedia Schrenk ex Mey and Ephedra equisetina Bunge have important ecological and medicinal value. However, although conservation measures have been implemented, the suitable habitat for these species has been shrinking at a remarkable rate in recent years due to climate change and anthropogenic activities. The identification of suitable habitats for these three Ephedra is essential for their protection and cultivation. Thus, this study proposed a new method for planning the best species conservation habitat through fitting errors caused by a single model. The method modeled the current suitable habitats of the three Ephedra species using the MaxEnt model and evaluated the key environmental variables defining the Ephedra distribution based on recorded occurrence data for Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Qinghai. The results showed that human activities were the most important environmental parameter affecting the distribution of the three species, and land cover, ground frost frequency and precipitation accounted for an important proportion of the model evaluation. Second, the results obtained with the MaxEnt model were coupled with the finding from the Marxan model to identify priority conservation areas for the three Ephedra species. The results revealed that the most suitable habitats for E. sinica were mainly concentrated in eastern and central Inner Mongolia, E. intermedia was relatively distributed in southern and central Gansu, and the areas of E. equisetina were mainly distributed in northern Xinjiang. The priority conservation areas for E. sinica, E. intermedia, and E. equisetina were 38068.12 km2, 26446.74 km2 and 36360.6 km2, respectively. The comprehensive analysis indicated that be use of MaxEnt coupled with the Marxan model to model the suitable habitat of these Ephedra species eliminates the distribution errors introduced by each model alone. The protection of wild Ephedra should be a priority, and the scale of the artificial planting of Ephedra should be enlarged. Given these results, the three Ephedra species included in our study urgently need to be subjected to targeted conservation management to ensure the renewal of Ephedra communities and to maintain the supply of medicinal materials. This study provides a useful reference for the protection and cultivation of these three Ephedra.

AB  - Conservation adequacy is defined as the ability of conservation measures to sustain biodiversity. Although river network connectivity is important for maintaining key ecological processes and ensuring persistence of biodiversity, it also facilitates the propagation of threats along river networks, which may compromise the sustainability of freshwater biodiversity and therefore conservation adequacy. This study aims to introduce two modifications to river conservation planning related to connectivity and catchment condition that together can improve the adequacy of the priority areas identified. This will establish an operational framework for end-users, such as policy makers and NGOs. We operationalize the connectivity framework that has recently emerged in systematic river conservation planning by using a GIS coding system for catchment location in the conservation software package marxan. Additionally, we use a landscape measure of catchment disturbance to direct the conservation plan to the least-disturbed area while still meeting targets for the conservation of fish species used as surrogates for overall biodiversity in our study catchment, the Daly River in northern Australia. This proxy for condition aggregates information on land-use, extractive industries, point-source pollution, and water infrastructure. We successfully modelled the distribution of 39 fish species based on GIS-derived landscape descriptors (most important descriptors were; discharge, distance to river mouth, geology and conductivity). Results from the systematic planning analysis identified a portfolio of watersheds that delivered close to optimal upstream protection with around 4700 stream kilometres (30% of the total network). When using upstream disturbance as an extra penalty, most of the network stayed intact; however, a replacement area was found for a major tributary, which only added an extra 1% of the stream network to the total area. Synthesis and applications. Improving conservation adequacy by accounting for upstream connectivity and condition using this easy-to-implement framework and software package has the potential to facilitate further application of systematic methods in river conservation planning. Furthermore, integrating condition as a discounting factor can also improve conservation adequacy in a broad range of environments (including terrestrial and marine), while not necessarily increasing the management costs.

AB  - Current and expected shifts in climate are threatening global biodiversity and are forcing managers to re-evaluate how they plan for the protection of species and ecosystems. We propose and illustrate a methodology for identifying geographic locations where climate is expected to remain within the tolerances of conservation targets despite a generally warming climate. Using Generation 3 of the Canadian General Circulation Model and ClimateBC (a climate interpolation and downscaling tool). bioclimatic envelopes were developed for three examples of forest conservation targets. The geographic distribution of the resulting envelopes was projected for four timeslices, and then overlaid using ArcMap GIS software. The resultant intersection of points is presumed to indicate locations of persistent climate over the study's timeframe. Next, a target's current mapped distribution was overlaid with the distribution of climate expected to remain within its bioclimatic envelope; the intersection of these points is considered the target's "temporal corridor." Current locations with persistent climate are thus expected to provide climatic continuity over time, sufficient to sustain the conservation target. Whereas landscape corridors can provide connectivity in geographic space, temporal corridors are projected to provide continuity in climatic space and over time. The identification of such locations facilitates prioritization of sites for the acquisition or designation of protected areas, and provides guidance on where other current management policies and practices can persist. The projection and mapping of temporal corridors is conceptually simple, yet this can be a powerful tool with many potential applications to assist natural resources planners and managers in a rapidly changing environment.

AB  - When planning conservation and reintroductions of native species and control of invasive species, it is important to understand the environmental factors affecting species distributions. Habitat suitability largely determines where species can occur, but in addition to habitat and food resources, it is important to also consider human disturbance and climate when mapping possible distributions. We studied the environmental factors affecting the present distribution of the native Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) and the invasive North American beaver (C. canadensis) in Finland. We compared the role of food resources, aquatic habitat type, anthropogenic disturbance and climate for beaver occurrence with species distribution models. We created maps of suitable areas for the two species and compared how the results would change if these two ecologically similar species were modelled together. We found that aquatic habitat type and climate largely explain the present distributions of the species. In addition, there were differences between the species in their preference for food resources, aspen, birch and grey alder. However, we suspect that the species' reintroduction history, i.e. the differences in the present environment, much explain the differences found between the species. We conclude that when planning possible reintroductions for the Eurasian beaver, factors other than food resources should also be considered. We also suggest that studies on habitat suitability should consider the history of the species and include data from different environments. Thus, more comprehensive information for management planning would be achieved and a better ability to predict the location of optimal areas for the species.

AB  - Most existing protected area networks are biased to protect charismatic species or landscapes. We hypothesized that conservation networks designed to include unseen biodiversity-species rich groups that consist of inconspicuous taxa, or groups affected by knowledge gaps-are more efficient than networks that ignore these groups. To test this hypothesis, we generated species distribution models for 3006 arthropod species to determine which were represented in three networks of different sizes and biogeographic origin. We assessed the efficiency of each network using spatial prioritization to measure its completeness, the increment needed to achieve conservation targets, and its specificity, the extent to which proposed priority areas to maximize unseen biodiversity overlap with existing networks. We found that the representativeness of unseen biodiversity in the studied protected areas, or extrinsic representativeness, is low, with similar to 40% of the analyzed unseen biodiversity species being unprotected. We also found that existing networks should be expanded similar to 26% to 46% of their current area to complete targets, and that existing networks do not efficiently conserve the unseen biodiversity given their low specificity (as low as 8.8%) unseen biodiversity. We conclude that information on unseen biodiversity must be included in systematic conservation planning approaches to design more efficient and ecologically representative protected areas.

AB  - Wildlife on sandy beaches is often constrained by transformation of natural areas for human use. and opportunities for acquiring or restoring new habitat are rare. Storms can often force changes in land use naturally by reshaping coastal landforms, thereby creating high quality habitat: yet, wildlife requirements are seldom considered in post-storm recovery planning, and conservation practitioners lack suitable evidence to argue for the protection of habitats freshly formed by storms. Here we used a maximum-likelihood spatial modeling approach to quantify impacts of Hurricane Sandy (mid-Atlantic United States, October 2012) on nesting habitat of four bird species of conservation concern: American oystercatchers, black skimmers, least terns and piping plovers. We calculated the immediate storm-created changes (loss, persisting, gained) in nesting habitat under two levels of conservation protections: the current regulatory framework, and a scenario in which all potential habitats were under conservation protection. Hurricane Sandy resulted in apparent large gains for least terns ( +181 ha) and piping plovers (+289 ha). However, actual gains were reduced to 16 ha for plovers and reversed for least terns (net loss of 6.4 ha) because newly formed habitat occurred outside existing reserve boundaries. Similarly, under the current management framework, black skimmer nesting habitat decreased by -164 ha. We also tested whether birds benefited from newly created nesting habitat by identifying nest and colony locations for three years following Hurricane Sandy. All species overwhelmingly nested in habitat that existed prior the storm (76-98% of all nests/colonies): only a small percentage (17% for all species) occupied newly created habitat. We conclude that static spatial conservation efforts fail to capitalize on potentially large gains resulting from storms for several species and recommend flexible spatial conservation investments as a key input in post-storm recovery planning.

AB  - Safeguarding biodiversity has been one of the most important issues on the environmental and forest policies agenda since the 1990s. The problem remains in terms of decisions and knowledge on where to set appropriate conservation targets. Hence, we need detailed and reliable information about habitat structure and composition and methods for estimating this information over the whole spatial domain. In answer to this target, in France, the Ministry of Ecology launched an ambitious project to map the terrestrial vegetation at a scale of 1:25,000 known as CarHAB. This project initiated in 2011, will be used as a strategic spatial planning tool in answer to key issues in relation to biodiversity, conservation, green infrastructures and to report on the conservation status of habitats and species of community interest.
   We use species-distribution models (SDMs) to identify areas that are ecologically suitable for the presence of species based on specific habitat characteristics. Available techniques using graph theory enable identification of groups of species (assemblages) based on ecological affinities. Species co-occurrences (present within the same assessment plot), revealing a shared ecological niche, are analysed using algorithms-derived from graph theory in order to define different nodes of species affinities. Thus, the resulting assemblages are based on ecological similarities. Hence, these assemblages are used to develop models of the potential distribution of alpine vegetation communities. The BIOMOD platform is used to facilitate the simultaneous implementation of different modelling approaches that can be compared in order to choose the most suitable and accurate for each species assemblage obtained from graph theory. Using the different relevant spatially explicit results provides a more comprehensive vision of the communities' spatial distributions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge of a species' potential distribution and the suitability of available habitat are fundamental for effective conservation planning and management. However, the quality of information on the distribution of species and their required habitats is highly variable in terms of accuracy and availability across taxa and regions, particularly in tropical landscapes where accessibility is especially challenging. Species distribution models (SDMs) provide predictive tools for addressing gaps for poorly surveyed species, but they rarely consider biases in geographical distribution of records and their consequences. We applied SDMs and variation partitioning analyses to investigate the relative importance of habitat characteristics, human accessibility, and their joint effects in the global distribution of the Critically Endangered Blue-throated Macaw Ara glaucogularis, a species endemic to the Amazonian flooded savannas of Bolivia. The probability of occurrence was skewed towards more accessible areas, mostly secondary roads. Variability in observed occurrence patterns was mostly accounted for by the pure effect of habitat characteristics (76.2%), indicating that bias in the geographical distribution of occurrences does not invalidate species-habitat relationships derived from niche models. However, observed spatial covariation between land-use at a landscape scale and accessibility (joint contribution: 22.3%) may confound the independent role of land-use in the species distribution. New surveys should prioritise collecting data in more remote (less accessible) areas better distributed with respect to land-use composition at a landscape scale. Our results encourage wider application of partitioning methods to quantify the extent of sampling bias in datasets used in habitat modelling for a better understanding of species-habitat relationships, and add insights into the potential distribution of our study species and opportunities for its conservation.

AB  - The interdisciplinary nature of conservation problems is increasingly being incorporated into research, raising fundamental questions about the relative importance of the different types of knowledge and data. Although there has been extensive research on the development of methods and tools for conservation planning, especially spatial planning, comparatively little is known about the relative importance of ecological versus non-ecological data for prioritization, or the likely return on investment of incorporating better data. We demonstrate a simple approach for (1) quantifying the sensitivity of spatial planning results to different ecological and non-ecological data layers, and (2) estimating the potential gains in efficiency from incorporating additional data. Our case study involves spatial planning for coastal squeeze, a process by which development blocks coastal ecosystems from moving landward in response to sea-level rise. We show that incorporating spatial data on landowners' likelihood of selling had little effect on identifying relative priorities but drastically changed the outlook for whether conservation goals could be achieved. Better data on the costs of conservation actions had the greatest potential to improve the efficiency of spatial planning, in some cases generating more than an order of magnitude greater cost savings compared to ecological data. Our framework could be applied to other systems to guide the development of spatial planning and to identify general rules of thumb for the importance of alternative data sources for conservation problems in different socio-ecological contexts.

AB  - Data compiled during three fieldwork seasons and habitat models provided the tools to produce Species recovery plans for the endangered and endemic butterflies in Spain: Polyommatus violetae, P. golgus, Agriades zullichi, and Euchloe bazae. The distribution of each species has been updated with new field records. For E. bazae and P. violetae the known distribution records increased 33% and 8%, respectively. Detailed habitat descriptions, based on fieldwork data, are given for the four species and models show relatively small and fragmented habitat patches for P. violetae, P. golgus, and P. zullichi. Those areas might be particularly sensitive under a climate change scenario. Habitat of the four species is very specialized and mainly consists of open areas with grassland or scrub vegetation. Population densities are provided for the first time for these species and show low numbers for E. bazae, particularly in the area around Baza in SE Spain. 25 to 54% of the populations were apparently not threatened. For the rest, apparent habitat suitability threats were abandonment for E. bazae and P. violetae, trampling for A. zullichi, and overgrazing for P. golgus. Recovery plans included aspects on legislation, habitat management, precautionary measures (limit new developments and land use changes), research, and public awareness campaigns. Suggested habitat management actions are: (1) support extensive grazing and prevent overgrazing; (2) reduce the effect of trampling by visitors in mountain areas; and (3) woodland and scrub clearing of abandoned areas and pine plantations to improve the quality of grassland habitats.

AB  - The population of the endangered raptor species, Blakiston's fish owl Bubo blakistoni blakistoni, has been recovering recently due to conservation activities. The next conservation target is to expand their distribution, which is concentrated in eastern Hokkaido, Japan. In this study, we first built a static distribution model of the fish owl for the region in which it has stable populations. Using the habitat suitability map produced by the model, we projected the future range expansions of the owl using dynamic distribution modeling under scenarios with varied conservation activities and land-use changes. The static distribution model suggested that regions with substantial natural riparian forests and river length provided suitable owl habitats. It also indicated that maintenance and restoration of riparian forests would be important for owl conservation. Future projections of owl ranges indicated that an increase in breeding success would greatly contribute to range expansion. Additionally, the model results suggested that dispersal from the easternmost population (Konsen) was restricted due to the predominance of unsuitable surrounding areas and that existing populations are likely to expand their ranges into the currently unoccupied area in central Hokkaido (Yubari Mountains). However, there were large unexplained variations in the static distribution model and large uncertainties in the projections of future range expansions, suggesting that conservation activities should be planned flexibly and follow the actual range expansion processes of Blakiston's fish owl.

AB  - Identification of potential habitats of endemic species can facilitate conservation planning and rehabilitation programs in rangeland ecosystems. This study aimed to generate potential distribution maps of Astragalus verus Olivier, a valuable endemic and medicinal plant, in a semi-arid part of central Iran (with an approximate area of 1000 km(2)) using logistic regression (LR), nonparametric multiplicative regression (NPMR), and ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA) methods A stratified-random sampling approach was used to collect the presence-absence data, along with some environmental data, from 100 sites. Soil maps were obtained from 70 profiles, and climate maps were produced using data from 10 weather stations. Geostatistical methods were used to convert the obtained data to digital maps with 90m x 90m resolution. The species potential habitat maps were produced using ENFA, LR, NPMR, and an ensemble method. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using Cohen's kappa coefficient and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) based on both calibrated and independent data sets. Although no method was superior under all circumstances, ENFA performed slightly better due to the very high anthropogenic impacts in the study area. Potential habitat maps and the species response curves revealed that A. verus habitats were characterized by a pH of 7.5, moderate to relatively heavy soil texture (44%-48% clay content), moderate slope (10%-20%), low electrical conductivity (< 0.3 dS/m), and a soil saturation percentage of 45%-47%. These modeling approaches can be widely used to identify appropriate areas for rehabilitation and protection of endangered and valuable native plant species.

AB  - Species distribution in space is important in habitat conservation and biodiversity protection, so gaining knowledge about species range would be worthwhile to rescue endangered species and plan conservation policy. This study evaluates and compares the performance of an array of Species Distribution Models (SDMs), namely RF, SVM, MaxEnt, GLMNET, and MARS, in predicting rare sand cat distribution across a large unprotected sand dune area in central Iran. Due to absence of reliable data and difficulties in recording the species itself, the SDMs were challenged by limited data including 55 absence (background) and 40 presence points as well as nine climatic and geological parameters that influence on species distribution, including humidity, maximum, minimum and mean temperature, precipitation, amount of sunshine, ground water level, aspect, and DEM. Moreover, each model was replicated 20 times and the statistics including TSS, AUC, COR and Deviance were computed. Then, based on computed statistics, the model performances were evaluated by TUKEY and ANOVA. Finally, ensemble map was obtained by weighted approach using AUC. The results of this study showed that complex machine learning methods, like SVM, RF, and MaxEnt are more outperformed to predict the distribution of rare species.

AB  - The contributions of species to ecosystem functions or services depend not only on their presence but also on their local abundance. Progress in predictive spatial modelling has largely focused on species occurrence rather than abundance. As such, limited guidance exists on the most reliable methods to explain and predict spatial variation in abundance. We analysed the performance of 68 abundance-based species distribution models fitted to 800 000 standardised abundance records for more than 800 terrestrial bird and reef fish species. We found a large amount of variation in the performance of abundance-based models. While many models performed poorly, a subset of models consistently reconstructed range-wide abundance patterns. The best predictions were obtained using random forests for frequently encountered and abundant species and for predictions within the same environmental domain as model calibration. Extending predictions of species abundance outside of the environmental conditions used in model training generated poor predictions. Thus, interpolation of abundances between observations can help improve understanding of spatial abundance patterns, but our results indicate extrapolated predictions of abundance under changing climate have a much greater uncertainty. Our synthesis provides a road map for modelling abundance patterns, a key property of species distributions that underpins theoretical and applied questions in ecology and conservation.

AB  - In India, western tragopan is reported from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. We documented the current status and distribution of western tragopan in J&K. We also predicted its potential distribution in the state. We used literature, field surveys and semi-structured questionnaire surveys to ascertain the distribution and conservation status of the pheasant species in J&K. Between 2007 and 2011, we conducted counts of western tragopan in five areas: Tattakuti Wildlife Sanctuary, Khara Galli Conservation Reserve (CR), Limber Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS), Lacchipora WLS and Kazinag National Park (NP) to assess its current status. We estimated 113 callers of western tragopan from Kazinag NP, Limber WLS, Lacchipora WLS, Tattakuti WLS and Khara Galli CR. We also discovered four new sites Tattakuti WLS and Khara Galli CR (through direct surveys), Noorpur Galli and Narian-Ratannard (through secondary surveys) - of this species. We have confirmed the presence of western tragopan in Lacchipora WLS and re-confirmed its presence in Padder, Bhadarwa and Sudh Mahadev. Our habitat model predicted potential distribution of western tragopan, adding few additional potential sites. There is an urgent need to plan long-term monitoring and initiate appropriate measures to conserve the species.

AB  - Conservation resources are limited and need to be used where they can be most effective. Deciding where within a species range to implement conservation interventions requires knowledge of where threats operate and consideration of multiple spatial issues concerning patterns in abundance across species' ranges, and geographical and environmental gradients in these and other traits across species' ranges. Although these biogeographical patterns have been of great interest to ecologists for many years, the implications of these patterns for conservation are often unclear. Here we review these patterns in the context of targeting spatial conservation. We find that an inconsistent use of terminology, a lack of consistent rules and the use of imperfect datasets, hampers us drawing firm conclusions on the nature of these patterns. Evidence that abundance and ecological traits change systematically towards range edges is inconclusive. Abundance variation is influenced by many factors independent of position within a species range, including habitat type, habitat quality, environment, interspecific competition, dispersal ecology and metapopulation dynamics. This results in complex textured abundance patterns compared to a simple theoretical core-edge gradient. We conclude that any conservation practitioner looking to target the location of interventions will need to examine these patterns and processes for the species of interest. Current knowledge does not adequately inform spatial conservation prioritization for single-species conservation programmes and incorporating the complexities of spatial processes is challenging. The development of tools to inform spatial targeting of resources for single- or multiple-species conservation is required urgently to enable better use of conservation resources.

AB  - Numerous models for predicting species distribution have been developed for conservation purposes. Most of them make use of environmental data (e.g., climate, topography, land use) at a coarse grid resolution (often kilometres). Such approaches are useful for conservation policy issues including reserve-network selection. The efficiency of predictive models for species distribution is usually tested on the area for which they were developed. Although highly interesting from the point of view of conservation efficiency, transferability of such models to independent areas is still under debate. We tested the transferability of habitat-based predictive distribution models for two regionally threatened butterflies, the green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the grayling (Hipparchia semele), within and among three nature reserves in northeastern Belgium. We built predictive models based on spatially detailed maps of area-wide distribution and density of ecological resources. We used resources directly related to ecological functions (host plants, nectar sources, shelter microclimate) rather than environmental surrogate variables. We obtained models that performed well with few resource variables. All models were transferable-although to different degrees-among the independent areas within the same broad geographical region. We argue that habitat models based on essential functional resources could transfer better in space than models that use indirect environmental variables. Because functional variables can easily be interpreted and even be directly affected by terrain managers, these models can be useful tools to guide species-adapted reserve management.

AB  - Pressures are mounting for the adoption of a Global Biodiversity Framework that transforms conservation and sustainable use efforts worldwide. Underlying this challenge is the biodiversity paradox: biological diversity predominantly concentrates in the tropics, while human, institutional, and financial resources are primarily located at higher latitudes both north and south. Addressing the biodiversity paradox requires the expansion and mobilization of human, institutional and financial resources around the world. We outline a model championed by the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) that builds on the Species Conservation Cycle (Assess-Plan-Act-Network-Communicate) and recognizes that most conservation action occurs at the national or local level. Various strategies are applied to this end by the partners of Reverse the Red, a global movement that ignites strategic cooperation and science-based action to ensure the survival of wild species and ecosystems. The SSC contributes to Reverse the Red through two primary strategies: National Species Specialist Groups and Centers for Species Survival. By building on existing expert networks and catalyzing efforts with established local institutions, we aim to significantly expand capacity to implement conservation action at the national level and reverse the negative trends indicated by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the Red List of Ecosystems.

AB  - Large mammals that occur in low densities, particularly in the high-altitude areas, are globally threatened due to fragile climatic and ecological envelopes. Among bear species, the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) has a distribution that is restricted to Himalayan highlands with relatively small and fragmented populations. To date, very little scientific information on the Himalayan brown bear, which is vital for the conservation of the species and the management of its habitats, especially in protected areas of the landscape, is available. The present study aims to understand the effectiveness of existing Himalayan Protected Areas in terms of representativeness for the conservation of Himalayan brown bear (HBB), an umbrella species in high-altitude habitats of the Himalayan region. We used the ensemble approach of the species distribution model and then assessed biological connectivity to predict the current and future distribution and movement of HBB in climate change scenarios for the year 2050. Approximately 33 protected areas (PAs) currently possess suitable habitats. Our model suggests a massive decline of approximately 73.38% and 72.87% under 4.5 and 8.5 representative concentration pathway (RCP) respectively in the year 2050 compared with the current distribution. The predicted change in suitability will result in loss of habitats from thirteen PAs; eight will become completely uninhabitable by the year 2050, followed by loss of connectivity in the majority of PAs. Habitat configuration analysis suggested a 40% decline in the number of suitable patches, a reduction in large habitat patches (up to 50%) and aggregation of suitable areas (9%) by 2050, indicating fragmentation. The predicted change in geographic isotherm will result in loss of habitats from thirteen PAs, eight of them will become completely inhabitable. Hence, these PAs may lose their effectiveness and representativeness in achieving the very objective of their existence or conservation goals. Therefore, we recommend adaptive spatial planning for protecting suitable habitats distributed outside the PA for climate change adaptation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly widespread in the conservation literature. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including addressing practical conservation tasks on the basis of a spatially explicit assessment of environmental suitability for target taxa, which in turn allows for a transparent evaluation of needs and opportunities. Here we used the maximum entropy method (by means of the software MaxEnt) to model distribution of the rare Boreal Owl Aegolius funereus and the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius, which excavates the nest-holes used by the owl for breeding. We believe that monitoring surveys for Boreal Owl should consider areas suitable for both species as priority sites, whereas the provision of nest-boxes for the owl may be particularly desirable in habitat patches that are suitable for that species but not for the keystone species whose nest-holes represent the usual nest site for the owl. Finally, areas suitable for both species can represent priority areas for the conservation of forest birds in the Alps, as both species have been reported as umbrella and/or keystone species. Our example provides a possible framework to model management and monitoring opportunities in other species or species pairs, but such an approach can be used to infer the need for particular management options when both limiting factors and species distribution can be spatially modelled, and also to model the areas where different target species are more likely to overlap and interact. The use of distribution models as tools to address practical conservation tasks should also be encouraged in order to accomplish practical tasks according to sound knowledge and transparent methods.

AB  - Estimating historic distributions of species is a critical step in evaluating current levels of habitat loss, evaluating sites for potential restoration and reintroductions, and for conservation planning at a landscape scale. However historic distributions can be difficult to estimate objectively because substantial habitat changes may have occurred prior to comprehensive surveys. As a means to address this question, we evaluated a novel approach by creating spatial niche models for two species of psammophilic lizards. Using a partitioned Mahalanobis D-2 analysis and abiotic variables that were independent of anthropogenic change, we created niche models for the federally threatened Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard (Uma inornata) and for the flat-tailed horned lizard (Phrynosoma mcallii). The niche models estimated that within the Coachella Valley there were originally 32,164 ha of potential habitat for the fringe-toed lizard and 33,502 ha of potential habitat for the horned lizard. After screening these estimates of historic habitat for current conditions that would render that potential habitat unsuitable, we calculated a 91-95% loss of potential habitat for the fringe-toed lizard and an 83-92% loss for the horned lizard. Unlike the fringe-toed lizard, the horned lizard also occurs outside the Coachella Valley. Conducting a similar analysis throughout its range would provide an objective estimate of the total habitat loss experienced by this species. This information could be used to address whether granting it federal or state protection is warranted. For species whose distributions can be modeled with abiotic variables such as soils, elevation, topography, and climate, this approach may have broad applications for resolving questions regarding their current levels of habitat loss and regional conservation planning.

AB  - Iran has a diverse range of mammals. Climate change can alter the species' range, leading to expansion or contraction and affect the IUCN threatened species' distribution. We assessed the effects of climate change on the climatic niche and coverage of the protected areas for 16 threatened mammal species in Iran. The species' presence-only occurrence records, four predictor variables, two future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and 8.5) and two time steps (current and 2070) were used to build species distribution models by applying the ensemble approach in BIOMOD2. Species' responses to climate change under current condition showed different results: 8 of the 16 species are likely to gain climatically suitable space, but six species will probably lose climate range by 2070. Persian fallow deer and marbled polecat respond positively to the RCP 2.6 but will experience a range reduction in the RCP 8.5. Coverage of the protected area network will increase in both scenarios for six mammals. The coverage will maximize in RCP 2.6 for four species and decrease RCP 8.5 for another four species and vice versa. According to our model, the coverage will decrease for two species in both future scenarios. The overlap of the protected areas with the distribution pattern showed that in the next 50 years, climate change will negatively affect 60% of Iranian threatened mammals. The species' current and future distribution range and the designated refugia for climate change can be considered protected areas for conservation plans.

AB  - Theaceae, an economically important angiosperm family, is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical forests in Asia. In China, Theaceae has particularly high abundances and endemism, comprising similar to 75% of the total genera and similar to 46% of the total species worldwide. Therefore, predicting the response of Theaceae species to climate change is vital. In this study, we collected distribution data for 200 wild Theaceae species in China, and predicted their distribution patterns under current and future climactic conditions by species distribution modeling (SDM). We revealed that Theaceae species richness is highest in southeastern China and on Hainan Island, reaching its highest value (137 species) in Fujian Province. According to the IUCN Red List criteria for assessing species threat levels under two dispersal assumptions (no dispersal and full dispersal), we evaluated the conservation status of all Theaceae species by calculating loss of suitable habitat under future climate scenarios. We predicted that nine additional species will become threatened due to climate change in the future; one species will be classified as critically endangered (CR), two as endangered (EN), and six as vulnerable (VU). Given their extinction risks associated with climate change, we recommended that these species be added to the Red List. Our investigation of migration patterns revealed regional differences in the number of emigrant, immigrant, and persistent species, indicating the need for targeted conservation strategies. Regions containing numerous emigrants are concentrated in Northern Taiwan and coastal regions of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, while regions containing numerous immigrants include central Sichuan Province, the southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region, southwest Yunnan Province, northwest Sichuan Province, and the junction of Guangxi and Hunan provinces. Lastly, regions containing persistent species are widely distributed in southern China. Importantly, regions with high species turnover are located on the northern border of the entire Theaceae species distribution ranges owing to upwards migration; these regions are considered most sensitive to climate change and conservation planning should therefore be prioritized here. This study will contribute valuable information for reducing the negative impacts of climate change on Theaceae species, which will ultimately improve biodiversity conservation efficiency.

AB  - Global change poses significant challenges for ecosystem conservation. At regional scales, climate change may lead to extensive shifts in species distributions and widespread extirpations or extinctions. At landscape scales, land use and invasive species disrupt ecosystem function and reduce species richness. However, a lack of spatially explicit models of risk to ecosystems makes it difficult for science to inform conservation planning and land management. Here, I model risk to sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems in the state of Nevada, USA from climate change, land use/land cover change, and species invasion. Risk from climate change is based on an ensemble of 10 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) projections applied to two bioclimatic envelope models (Mahalanobis distance and Maxent). Risk from land use is based on the distribution of roads, agriculture, and powerlines, and on the spatial relationships between land use and probability of cheatgrass Bromus tectorum invasion in Nevada. Risk from land cover change is based on probability and extent of pinyon-juniper (Pinus monophylla; Juniperus spp.) woodland expansion. Climate change is most likely to negatively impact sagebrush ecosystems at the edges of its current range, particularly in southern Nevada, southern Utah, and eastern Washington. Risk from land use and woodland expansion is pervasive throughout Nevada, while cheatgrass invasion is most problematic in the northern part of the state. Cumulatively, these changes pose major challenges for conservation of sagebrush and sagebrush obligate species. This type of comprehensive assessment of ecosystem risk provides managers with spatially explicit tools important for conservation planning.

AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation are considered major threats for global biodiversity. As a direct consequence, connectivity is increasingly disrupted in many species, which might have serious consequences that could ultimately lead to the extinction of populations. Although a large number of reserves and conservation sites are designated and protected by law, potential habitats acting as inter-population connectivity corridors are, however, mostly ignored in the common practice of environmental planning. In most cases, this is mainly caused by a lack of quantitative measures of functional connectivity available for the planning process. In this study, we highlight the use of fine-scale potential connectivity models (PCMs) derived from multispectral satellite data for the quantification of spatially explicit habitat corridors for matrix-sensitive species of conservation concern. This framework couples a species distribution model with a connectivity model in a two-step framework, where suitability maps from step 1 are transformed into maps of landscape resistance in step 2 filtered by fragmentation thresholds. We illustrate the approach using the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis L.) in the metropolitan area of Cologne, Germany, as a case study. Our model proved to be well suited to identify connected as well as completely isolated populations within the study area. Furthermore, due to its fine resolution, the PCM was also able to detect small linear structures known to be important for sand lizards' inter-population connectivity such as railroad embankments. We discuss the applicability and possible implementation of PCMs to overcome shortcomings in the common practice of environmental impact assessments.

AB  - Land use changes. urbanisation and infrastructure developments in particular. cause fragmentation of natural habitats and threaten biodiversity. Tools and measures must be adapted to assess and remedy the potential effects on biodiversity caused by human activities and developments. Within physical planning, environmental impact assessment (EIA) and strategic environmental assessment (SEA) play important roles in the prediction and assessment of biodiversity-related impacts from planned developments. However, adapted prediction tools to forecast and quantify potential impacts on biodiversity components are lacking. This study tested and compared four different CIS-based habitat models and assessed their relevance for applications in environmental assessment. The models were implemented in the Stockholm region in central Sweden and applied to data on the crested tit (Parus cristatus), a sedentary bird species of coniferous forest. All four models performed well and allowed the distribution of suitable habitats for the crested tit in the Stockholm region to be predicted. The models were also used to predict and quantify habitat loss for two regional development scenarios. The study highlighted the importance of model selection in impact prediction. Criteria that are relevant for the choice of model for predicting impacts on biodiversity were identified and discussed. Finally, the importance of environmental assessment for the preservation of biodiversity within the general frame of biodiversity conservation is emphasised. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Climate change has been regarded as one of the major threats to endangered species, and offers a wide variety of challenges to current conservation strategies. Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is a critical initial step for improving in-situ conservation planning. In this study, we used MaxEnt to predict the impacts of climate change on habitat suitability for wild camel (Camelus ferus) in the Kumtag Desert both during the current period and projected into the 2050 s. Our results showed that (i) suitable habitat for wild camel was predicted to decrease by 43.81% by the 2050 s; (ii) currently established nature reserves protected 57.86% of currently suitable habitat; (iii) 44.15% of currently suitable habitat was predicted to be vulnerable to future climate change, with a minor increase in newly suitable habitat by the 2050 s; (iv) climate refuge areas amounted to 21,601 km2 and were mainly located in the core area of the desert. Given these results, we propose conservation implications to mitigate the impacts of climate change on wild camel, including intergrating the suitable habitat into the planning of a proposed national park, constructing habitat corridors, restoring water sources, and implementing long-term monitoring.

AB  - Large trees, as keystone structures, are functionally important in savanna ecosystems, and low recruitment and slow growth makes their conservation important. Understanding factors influencing their distribution is essential for mitigation of excessive mortality, for example from management fires or large herbivores. We recorded the locations of large trees in Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park (HiP) using GPS to record trees along 43 km of 10 m-wide transects. Maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) uses niche modeling to predict the distribution of a species from the probability of finding it within raster squares, based on environmental variables and recorded locations. MaxEnt is typically applied at a regional spatial scale, and here we assessed its usefulness when predicting the distribution of species at a small (local) scale. HiP has variable topography, heterogeneous soils, and a strong rainfall gradient, resulting in a wide variety of habitat types. We used locations of 179 Acacia nigrescens and 106 Sclerocarya birrea (large trees >= 5m), and raster environmental layers for: aspect, elevation, geology, annual rainfall, slope, soil and vegetation. A. nigrescens was largely restricted to the Imfolozi section, while S. birrea had a wider distribution across the reserve. Understanding the interaction of environmental variables dictating tree distribution may facilitate habitat restoration, and will assist planning decisions for persistence of large trees within reserves, including options to reduce fire frequency or herbivore impacts. Though the AUC (Area Under the Curve) values used to test model predictions were high for both species, the ground truthing test data showed that distribution for A. nigrescens was more accurate than that for S. birrea, highlighting the need for independent test data to assess model accuracy. We emphasize that MaxEnt can be used at finer spatial scales than those typically used for species occurrence, but models must be tested using spatially independent test data.

AB  - Financial and human resources allocated to biodiversity conservation are often limited, making it impossible to protect all natural places, and priority areas for protection must be identified. In this study, we applied ecological niche models to predict fish assemblages in the stream network of France. Four non-correlated conservation objectives were derived from these species assemblages: taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, natural heritage importance and socio-economic value. We proposed a multi-objective prioritization method based on the Pareto optimality principle to rank the planning units (i.e. 6097 subcatchments) according to their inherent trade-offs between the four conservation objectives. Four types of hydrosystems of great conservation importance presenting specific fish assemblages were identified: (i) the most upstream areas of large catchments; (ii) the most downstream areas of large catchments; (iii) the small coastal catchments of the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean; and (iv) the Mediterranean streams of medium altitude. The fish assemblages characterizing these hydrosystems were complementary and representative of the entire fish fauna of France. Most of these priority subcatchments were found to be practically suitable for the implementation of conservation actions, which is very promising for the protection of river biodiversity.

AB  - AimIdentification of priority conservation areas and evaluation of coverage of the current protected areas are urgently needed to halt the biodiversity loss. Identifying regions combining similar environmental traits (climate regions) and species assemblages (biogroups) is needed for conserving the biodiversity patterns and processes. We identify climate regions and biogroups and map species diversity across the Sahara-Sahel, a large geographical area that exhibits wide environmental heterogeneity and multiple species groups with distinct biogeographical affinities, and evaluate the coverage level of current network of protected areas for biodiversity conservation.
   LocationSahara-Sahel, Africa.
   MethodsWe use spatially explicit climate data with the principal component analysis and model-based clustering techniques to identify climate regions. We use distributions of 1147 terrestrial vertebrates (and of 125 Sahara-Sahel endemics) and apply distance clustering methods to identify biogroups for both species groups. We apply reserve selection algorithms targeting 17% of species distribution, climate regions and biogroups to identify priority areas and gap analysis to assess their representation within the current protected areas.
   ResultsSeven climate regions were identified, mostly arranged as latitudinal belts. Concentrations of high species richness were found in the Sahel, but the central Sahara gathers most endemic and threatened species. Ten biogroups (five for endemics) were identified. A wide range of biogroups tend to overlap in specific climate regions. Identified priority areas are inadequately represented in protected areas, and six new top conservation areas are needed to achieve conservation targets.
   Main conclusionsBiodiversity distribution in Sahara-Sahel is spatially structured and apparently related to environmental variation. Although the majority of priority conservation areas are located outside the areas of intense human activities, many cross multiple political borders and require internationally coordinated efforts for implementation and management. Optimized biodiversity conservation solutions at regional scale are needed. Our work contradicts the general idea that deserts are uniform areas and provide options for the conservation of endangered species.

AB  - Despite lessons from terrestrial systems, conservation efforts in marine systems continue to focus on identifying priority sites for protection based on high species richness inferred from range maps. Range maps oversimplify spatial variability in animal distributions by assuming uniform distribution within range and de facto giving equal weight to critical and marginal habitats. We used Marxan ver. 2.43 to compare species richness-based systematic reserve network solutions using information about marine mammal range and relative abundance. At a global scale, reserve network solutions were strongly sensitive to model inputs and assumptions. Solutions based on different input data overlapped by a third at most, with agreement as low as 10% in some cases. At a regional scale, species richness was inversely related to density, such that species richness hotspots excluded highest-density areas for all species. Based on these findings, we caution that species-richness estimates derived from range maps and used as input in conservation planning exercises may inadvertently lead to protection of largely marginal habitat.

AB  - Climate change is considered as an important environmental issue globally, affecting geographic distributions of endangered species, and reducing the extent of their natural habitats. We characterized the potential geographic distribution of a Near Threatened tree species, Pterocarpus marsupium, in South Asia. We evaluated the potential geographic distribution of the species under present and future conditions using ecological niche modeling ap-proaches. The future potential distribution of the species was examined under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5), using outputs from 8 general circulation models for 2050. The present-day distribution of the species covers much of India and Sri Lanka, and parts of Nepal and Bhutan. Model transfers for future-climate conditions indicated a potentially dramatic geographic shift of high-suitability areas for parts of the species' distribution, particularly in central India. In distributional areas that are adjacent to high-mountain areas, under climate change, suitable areas for the species are anticipated to shift towards higher elevations. The results of this study may be useful in identifying currently undocumented populations of P. marsupium, as well as in identifying sites likely to be suitable both at present and in the future for conservation management planning.

AB  - Environmental surrogates (land classes) for the distribution of biodiversity are increasingly being used for conservation planning. However; data that demonstrate coincident patterns in land classes and biodiversity are limited. We ask the overall question, "Are land systems effective surrogates for the spatial configuration of biodiversity for conservation planning?" and we address three specific questions: (1) Do different land systems represent different biological assemblages.? (2) Do biological assemblages on the same land system remain similar with increasing geographic separation? and (3) Do biological assemblages on the same land system remain similar with increasing land system isolation? Vascular plants, invertebrates, and microbiota were surveyed from 24 sites in four land systems in and northwest New South Wales, Australia. Within each land system, sites were located to give a hierarchy of inter-site distances, and land systems were classified as either "low isolation" (large and continuous) or "high isolation" (small patches interspersed among other land systems).
   Each type of land system supported components of biodiversity either not found, or found infrequently, on other land systems, suggesting that land systems function as surrogates for biodiversity, and that conservation-area networks representing land-system diversity will also represent biological diversity. However, the majority of taxa were found on more than one land-system type, suggesting that a large proportion of the plant, arthropod, and microbial biodiversity may be characterized by widespread species with low fidelity to particular land systems. Significant relationships between geographic distance among sites and differences among assemblages were revealed for all taxa except the microbiota. Therefore, as sites on the same land system were located farther apart, the assemblages at those sites became more different. This finding strongly suggests that conservation planning based on land-system diversity should also sample the geographic range occupied by each land system. Land-system isolation was not revealed to be a significant Source of variation in assemblage composition. Our research finds support for environmental surrogates for biodiversity in conservation planning, specifically the use of land systems and similarly derived land classifications. However, the need for explicit modeling of geographic distance in conservation planning is clearly indicated.

AB  - Increasing human activity along the coast has amplified the extinction risk of inshore delphinids. Informed selection and prioritisation of areas for the conservation of inshore delphinids requires a comprehensive understanding of their distribution and habitat use. In this study, we applied an ensemble species distribution modelling approach, combining results of six modelling algorithms to identify areas of high probability of occurrence of the globally Vulnerable Australian humpback dolphin in northern Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), north-western Australia. Model outputs were based on sighting data collected during systematic, boat-based surveys between 2013 and 2015, and in relation to various ecogeographic variables. Water depth and distance to coast were identified as the most important variables influencing dolphin presence, with dolphins showing a preference for shallow waters (5-15 m) less than 2 km from the coast. Areas of high probability (>0.6) of dolphin occurrence were primarily (90%) in multiple use areas where extractive human activities are permitted, and were poorly represented in sanctuary (no-take) zones. This spatial mismatch emphasises the need to reassess for future spatial planning and marine park management plan reviews for NMP. Shallow, coastal waters identified here should be considered priority areas for the conservation of this Vulnerable species.

AB  - Seagrasses form one of the most ecologically important and productive three-dimensional habitats in coastal seas. Knowing the global distribution of seagrass meadows is essential for conservation and blue carbon estimates. Here, we modelled the global distribution of seagrass using 43,037 occurrence records and 13 environmental variables within the modelling software MaxEnt at 30 arc sec resolution (c. 1 km at the equator). We found that sea surface temperature and distance from land contributed most in predicting seagrass distribution globally. Comparison of summing models for individual species, genera, and families found that a model combining all species occurrence records best fitted the known geographic distribution. In addition, this model fills geographic gaps in previous maps. We predicted the seagrass biome may occupy 1,646,788 km(2), more than double previous global estimates. Applications for this dataset include blue carbon estimates, spatial planning such as for designing Marine Protected Areas, environmental sensitivity mapping, and monitoring of change in biome cover.

AB  - Extensive urbanization in coastal southern California has reduced natural habitat in this biodi-versity hotspot. To better conserve ecological communities, state and federal agencies, along with local jurisdictions and private stakeholders, developed regional conservation plans for southern California. Although many protected areas exist within this region, the patchwork nature of these protected areas might not provide good coverage for species that require multiple habitat com-ponents, such as amphibians with complex life histories. Because of declines in the past century, the status of the western spadefoot (Spea hammondii) in southern California is of concern to state and federal wildlife agencies. Species distribution models (SDMs) can aid in determining the conservation status of imperiled species by projecting where suitable habitat remains and how much is protected from further development. We built SDMs that integrated site-occupancy data from systematic pitfall trapping surveys and presence-only data from biodiversity databases and citizen science platforms to project the current distribution of western spadefoots in southern California. Western spadefoot occurrence was positively related to the cover of grassland or shrub/scrub and the % sand in the soil within a 1000 m buffer, and was negatively related to slope, elevation, and distance to ephemeral streams or vernal pools. Most of the remaining un-protected habitat for western spadefoots is in the southern half of its historical range in western San Diego and Riverside counties. A few large tracts of spadefoot habitat exist on U.S. Department of Defense lands and smaller tracts remain on ecological reserves owned by state and local government agencies. Only small patches of habitat remain in the northern half of this clade's historical range in Ventura, Orange, Los Angeles, and San Bernardino counties. Existing regional conservation plans provide ostensible spatial coverage of the majority of extant habitat for western spadefoots in southern California, but most of the habitat within the jurisdiction of these plans lacks formal protection, exposing this species to further declines as urbanization continues in the 21st century.

AB  - Syngnathids are considered as flagship species for marine conservation. Seahorses and pipefish are highly vulnerable to anthropogenic and environmental disturbances, but most species are currently considered Data Deficient by IUCN, requiring more biological and ecological research. Although syngnathids are well known for their unusual breeding biology, some aspects on the ecology of this family have rarely received attention. The knowledge on the factors governing syngnathids distribution is limited to some species and geographical regions. The present study is the first approach to predict syngnathid habitat preference in Spanish coasts, particularly in a marine National Park. In this study, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) were implemented to investigate the preferential habitat and distribution of the pipefish Syngnathus acus in Cies Archipelago (Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park, PNIA). Occurrence data of the species obtained from 2016 to 2018 surveys in PNIA were modeled as a function of bathymetric (depth, slope), substrate (sediment texture) and oceanographic (waves exposure) variables, using GAM, Random Forest and Maxent algorithms. From those SDMs, prediction models were built and the ensemble map of predictions was performed. The variables that most determined the distribution of the species were depth and wave exposure. The results of this study provide information on (1) habitat preference in the most dominant species in PNIA, the pipefish S. acus, towards sustainable management of this species in the National Park, and (2) predictive statistical tools for proper spatial conservation plans of this syngnathid species.

AB  - Climate and land-use changes are projected to threaten biodiversity over this century. However, few studies have considered the spatial and temporal overlap of these threats to evaluate how ongoing land-use change could affect species ranges projected to shift outside conservation areas. We evaluated climate change and urban development effects on vegetation distribution in the Southwest ecoregion, California Floristic Province, USA. We also evaluated how well a conservation network protects suitable habitat for rare plant species under these change projections and identified primary sources of uncertainty. We used consensus-based maps from three species distribution models (SDMs) to project current and future suitable habitat for 19 species representing different functional types (defined by fire-response - obligate seeders, resprouting shrubs - and life forms - herbs, subshrubs), and range sizes (large/common, small/rare). We used one spatially explicit urban growth projection; two climate models, emission scenarios, and probability thresholds applied to SDMs; and high-resolution (90m) environmental data. We projected that suitable habitat could disappear for 4 species and decrease for 15 by 2080. Averaged centroids of suitable habitat (all species) were projected to shift tens (up to hundreds) of kilometers. Herbs showed a small-projected response to climate change, while obligate seeders could suffer the greatest losses. Several rare species could lose suitable habitat inside conservation areas while increasing area outside. We concluded that (i) climate change is more important than urban development for vegetation habitat loss in this ecoregion through 2080 due to diminishing amounts of undeveloped private land in this region; (ii) the existing conservation plan, while extensive, may be inadequate to protect plant diversity under projected patterns of climate change and urban development, (iii) regional assessments of the dynamics of the drivers of biodiversity change based on high-resolution environmental data and consensus predictive mapping, such as this study, are necessary to identify the species expected to be the most vulnerable and to meaningfully inform regional-scale conservation.

AB  - Cumulative environmental impact assessment (CEIA) at river basin level for hydroelectric projects is an evolving concept and has proved to be a useful tool to assess the cumulative impact of developmental projects on the natural ecosystems. However, the generality of CEIA studies is often contested because of methodological limitations, especially in the domain of biodiversity conservation and conservation planning. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) can be a useful tool in CEIA studies for conservation planning of threatened plants in hydroelectric project (HEP) areas. We elucidate this hypothesis taking the example of Lagerstroemia minuticarpa Debberm. ex P.C. Kanjilal, a critically endangered tree species in the Indian Eastern Himalaya. Standard ecological methods were employed to document occurrence records, estimate population size, and characterize habitats. ENM was used to estimate the species potential environmental niche and distribution areas. The possible impacts of HEPs on the potential habitats were predicted by overlaying the HEPs on the potential area map as well as using the conceptual network diagram. The study revealed that the species occupies an environmental niche characterized by humid to per-humid conditions, and is distributed mostly in the Lohit and Teesta basins. Potential areas of the species with high environmental suitability coincide with 19 HEPs, which point to a potential threat to the survival of the species. Network diagram indicated that project activities might deteriorate the habitats thereby affecting the population and regeneration of the species. Our study provides a framework for developing appropriate measures for species conservation and reintroduction at basin level using ENM.

AB  - Climate change disproportionately threatens alpine species, by reducing available habitat and by isolating their populations. These pressures are particularly relevant for rear-edge populations, which typically occupy more marginal habitat compared to populations at the core of species' ranges. We studied Caucasian grouse Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi in the Caucasus ecoregion, a global biodiversity hotspot where this species is endemic, to understand potential climate change impacts on the species. Specifically, we assessed how climate change impacts rear-edge populations and how important these populations are for understanding range shifts and adaptive capacity under climate change. We used maximum entropy modeling to assess changes in the distribution of climatically suitable habitat under present and 2070 climate conditions for the representative concentration pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5). Our results revealed that ignoring rear-edge populations leads to a significant underestimation of the future range (by about 14,700 km(2)). Rear-edge populations were better adapted to warmer climates compared to core populations, and ignoring them, therefore, also underestimates adaptive capacity. Preventing the loss of rear-edge populations should, therefore, be a priority for conservation planning in the face of climate change. Because the Caucasian grouse is associated with alpine mountain tops, conservation should focus on establishing connectivity between rear-edge and core populations (e.g., via transboundary corridors or assisted colonizations). Our study reveals how species distribution modeling can highlight the importance of rear-edge populations for mitigating climate change impacts on species of conservation concern.

AB  - When climate changes, species' distributions may either shift spatially or expand/contract around continuously-occupied refugia, altering the effectiveness of previously-fixed conservation reserve networks.
   We characterise the nature of climate-induced changes in species' distributions and the extent of protected habitat, using a topographically diverse, subtropical case-study region.
   Bioclimatic species' distribution models were developed for 13 representative forest-dependent species spanning four vertebrate classes. We used a fine-scale 0.25 km grid with nine environmental and eight climatic predictor variables, selected for biological and land-use realism and statistical independence. Downscaled climate data for future climate regimes were quantified from regional climate data together with the IPCC A1FI predictions for 2040 and 2090.
   Range limits and centroids of individual species' modelled habitat areas changed little between present (2000) and future climates. However the total amount of suitable habitat shrank within the initial range limits. Species with the greatest habitat reductions had the smallest proportions of their present habitat areas in refugia (habitat areas suitable under present and future climates), but the largest proportions of their future habitat areas. The absolute areas of species' habitat protected by legislation decreased, whereas the proportions that were protected changed little.
   Regional-scale climate change is likely to cause substantial species declines, together with reduced areas of protected suitable habitat. The observed nature of distributional change indicates that long-term regional species conservation will depend more on identifying, protecting, and restoring habitat refugia than on actions to facilitate larger-scale movements.

AB  - Global biodiversity declines, largely driven by climate and land-use changes, urge the development of transparent guidelines for effective conservation strategies. Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a widely used approach for predicting potential shifts in species distributions, which can in turn support ecological conservation where environmental change is expected to impact population and community dynamics. Improvements in SDM accuracy through incorporating intra- and interspecific processes have boosted the SDM field forward, but simultaneously urge harmonizing the vast array of SDM approaches into an overarching, widely adoptable, and scientifically justified SDM framework. In this review, we first discuss how climate warming and land-use change interact to govern population dynamics and species' distributions, depending on species' dispersal and evolutionary abilities. We particularly emphasize that both land-use and climate change can reduce the accessibility to suitable habitat for many species, rendering the ability of species to colonize new habitat and to exchange genetic variation a crucial yet poorly implemented component of SDM. We then unite existing methodological SDM practices that aim to increase model accuracy through accounting for multiple global change stressors, dispersal, or evolution, while shifting our focus to model feasibility. We finally propose a roadmap harmonizing model accuracy and feasibility, applicable to both common and rare species, particularly those with poor dispersal abilities. This roadmap (a) paves the way for an overarching SDM framework allowing comparison and synthesis of different SDM studies and (b) could advance SDM to a level that allows systematic integration of SDM outcomes into effective conservation plans.

AB  - Fragmentation and habitat loss pose major threats to global biodiversity. Especially forest dwelling species with small ranges and high habitat specialisation are affected by ongoing land use change. Building projects for infrastructural purposes, expanding settlements, and extensive agricultural areas are assumed to have a high impact on these species. The European Habitat's Directive aims to conserve and restore habitat networks to lower these impacts. We propose that the idea of securing habitat networks for protected species should be incorporated within large scale landscape planning e.g. by modelling and improving corridors for umbrella species. Within a Danish-German project we developed a model demonstrating potential connecting corridors for Muscardinus avellanarius, a specialised forest dwelling rodent species with low dispersal ability. We used presence data and eco-geographical variables to find a data based time-efficient procedure which may be applied also in other species for future landscape planning. The habitat suitability model shows that the hazel dormouse occupies a narrow niche with highly suitable habitats comprising edge habitats. It indicates the preference of forest patches, linear structures and networks of the mentioned habitats. Along with connectivity the diversity of suitable habitats diversity is the major factor predicting hazel dormouse presence. For conservation management, we calculated habitat corridors and highlight sections with missing connections. This allowed us to accentuate regions of high management interest. The results represent the foundation not only for this cross-border conservation project, but also for long-term dormouse conservation on a federal-state level.

AB  - The ever-increasing requirement of land for food production causes habitat loss and biodiversity decline. Human activities like agriculture are responsible for increases in global temperature, which may preclude species' survival if they cannot adapt to new climatic conditions or track suitable ones. Although negative impacts of climate change may act in synergy with agriculture when dispersion routes are blocked by croplands, agriculture is important to local economies. Therefore, the demand for land conversion causes conflict among stakeholders and decision makers. But can we benefit both economy and environment? Here we propose an approach to help find a balance between agriculture expansion and biodiversity conservation. We used suitable areas for agriculture to identify priority places to implement monocultures. We modeled species distributions to avoid sites with high conservation value and used species dispersal ability to minimize the distance between present-day and future suitable areas for species persistence. We used a decision-support tool to find a balance between economic development and species conservation, and we conclude that land use conversion is a threat for species persistence given that negative impacts caused by crops could be exacerbated by climate change. Unguided agriculture expansion into future species distribution areas is possible due to severe decreases in the areas for species to persist in the future. Facing this scenario, applying ecological knowledge to guide agriculture expansion is urgent if we want to spare species future distribution area in the Cerrado.

AB  - Effects of climate change are particularly important in the Mediterranean Biodiversity hotspot where rising temperatures and drought are negatively affecting several plant taxa, including endemic species. Assisted colonisation (AC) represents a useful tool for reducing the effect of climate change on endemic plant species threatened by climate change.
   We combined species distribution models (SDMs) for 188 taxa endemic to Italy with the IUCN red listing range loss threshold under criterion A (30%) to define: (a) the number of AC (measured as 2 x 2 km grid cells that should be occupied by new populations, i.e. grid cells = new populations) required to fully compensate for predicted range loss and to halt the decline below the 30% of range loss; (b) The number of cells necessary to compensate for range loss was calculated as the number of currently occupied cells lost under future climate due to unsuitable conditions. We used two representative concentration pathways, +2.6 and +8.5 W/m(2), optimistic and pessimistic scenarios respectively. Availability of suitable areas for AC was also assessed within the current species distribution and within protected areas.
   Under the optimistic scenario, no taxa would lose more than 30% of their range and AC would not be required. Under the pessimistic scenario, roughly the 90% of taxa showed a cell loss higher than 30%. Eight taxa were predicted to lose >95% of their range. For these species, AC was required from 13 to 16 new populations (=13-16 grid cells) per taxon to cap the range loss at 30%. For currently VU or EN species, an average number of 32-35 AC attempts would be necessary to fully compensate their range loss under a pessimistic scenario. Suitable recipient sites within protected areas falling in their projected range were identified, allowing for short-distance AC.
   Synthesis. Combining species distribution models and red listing thresholds under Criterion A has enabled the strategic planning of multiple species assisted colonisation minimising the effort in terms of new populations to be created and maximising the conservation benefit in terms of range loss compensation.

AB  - In the Portuguese Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) (NE Atlantic), little survey effort dedicated to cetacean species has been carried out in offshore waters. As a consequence, data on their occurrence, distribution and habitat preferences is scarce. In this area, 48 sea surveys along fixed transects within Continental Portugal and Madeira Island were performed in 2012 and 2013, from July to October, using platforms of opportunity. We used an environmental envelope approach and GAM habitat models to identify the role of oceanographic, topographic and geographical variables in shaping cetacean distribution. Results demonstrate the richness of offshore waters in this area as in 10,668 nmi sampled, we recorded 218 sightings from at least nine cetacean species, resulting in an overall ER of 2.04 sightings/100 nmi. The interaction of topographic and oceanographic features was shown to influence the distribution of the species/groups along the routes. Among the sighted species, only common dolphin showed a preference for coastal waters, while for all the other species high seas proved to be determinant. This result reinforces the need to address conservation issues in open ocean. This preliminary assessment showed the importance of the entire area for the distribution of different cetacean species and allowed the identification of several species/group specific potential suitable habitats.
   Considering the Habitats Directive resolutions, ACCOBAMS priorities, EEZ extension for the area and Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, and the urgent need for management plans, we suggest that the sampling strategy here presented is a cost-effective method to gather valuable data, to be used to improve cetacean habitat models in the area.

AB  - Forty-six percent of tropical raptors are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Tropical raptors are generally rare species. The scarce information on distribution patterns of rare species makes it difficult to establish reliable conservation plans. Weused ecological niche modelling to obtain good predictions of occurrence of two case species, the rare and endemic Gundlach's and Cuban Black-hawks in Cuba, based on presence-only data. We used records from an intensive survey undertaken in natural and modified environments. Data were integrated with environmental variables using Maxent to predict species distributions. Subsequently, we overlaid the resulting predicted distributions, the land use map and the protected areas layers to establish potential suitable habitat for these endemics and to determine if a better design of protected areas than the existing one can be proposed using both hawks' distribution in the design. Gundlach's Hawk distribution was fragmented, depending on forest distribution. Cuban Black-Hawk distribution was narrow, near the coastline. Forests and mangrove represent 57% and 45% of Gundlach's Hawk and Cuban Black-Hawk model predictions, respectively. 71% of the total forest area was represented in the distribution of Gundlach's Hawk. Mangrove area overlaps 45% of the Cuban Black-Hawk distribution. Six protected areas preserved 50% and 92% of their distributions, respectively. With few presence-only data of rare species, Maxent models were statistically and ecologically significant and reliable to develop distribution maps with high predictive power. Our results highlight the importance of natural habitats for conservation efforts of these endemic species. A good conservation program should include the protection of suitable nesting areas and expand the protected areas network containing suitable habitats for both species in forest and coastal areas. Wepropose the use of predictive modelling tools to strengthen conservation actions not only for rare raptors but for the 238 endemic and threatened birds of the Neotropics with scarce data, small population sizes, restricted distributions and often specialist habits.

AB  - Habitat degradation is a major threat to the survival of chiru (Pantholops hodgsonii). Detailed knowledge for habitat conservation in this steppe-dwelling ungulate is needed if effective conservation and management strategies are to be developed. The distribution of potential habitat and the relative value of habitat to chiru on a regional scale remains unknown, hindering landscape conservation planning. Our aim was to identify and rank chiru habitat across the Chang Tang region of the Tibetan Plateau. We assessed overall habitat suitability using geographical data, field surveys, and information contained within previous studies. We identified 10194 km(2) of optimal habitat (1.71 % of the region), 256816 km(2) of suitable habitat (43.17 % of the region), and 213799 km(2) of marginal habitat (35.94 % of the region). Our habitat model shows that suitable habitat is located primarily in the central (Nyingma county and Shuanghu county) and western (Geze county) regions of the study area. When we looked specifically at a chiru reserve (Chang Tang Nature Reserve) located within the study area, we found that over half of the reserve could be classified as suitable habitat. This highlights the regional importance of this reserve to chiru conservation. Our findings further indicate that the protection of suitable habitat and improvement of habitat linkages will be important features of any regional chiru conservation plan.

AB  - Understanding the patterns of biodiversity is central to species conservation planning. Here we illustrate chiropteran diversity and distribution pattern of the hill ranges of the Eastern Ghats of Odisha state, India using roost survey and mist net survey techniques. The present study recorded 23 bat species including two newly recorded species for the study site i.e., Hipposideros galeritus and Megaderma spasma. The bat capture rate was the highest in the moist deciduous forest describing higher bat populations compared with the places of human habitation. Utilities of 21 climate, three physiographic and two disturbance variables and species distribution modelling could reveal that the north-eastern part was more suitable for bat distributions than the southern part of the region. The climate, physiographic and disturbance variables were crucial in their distributions, where elevation and potential evapotranspiration were highly significant. Unlike other species, Taphozous melanopogon showed negative correlation with these variables. The mean diurnal temperature and precipitation seasonality have positive influence on bat distributions, indicating their resilience to seasonal precipitation changes and day time temperature fluctuations. The negative effect of temperature seasonality on the distribution of Pteropus giganteus could attribute to its vulnerability to climate change effects. The study provides inputs for monitoring the future spatio-temporal changes, suggesting long term conservation measures. It could generate basic information on the impacts of climate change on bat distribution in the future climate change scenario.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) play a critical role in conserving biodiversity and maintaining viable populations of threatened species. Yet, as global change could reduce the future effectiveness of existing PAs in covering high species richness, updating the boundaries of existing PAs or creating new ones might become necessary to uphold conservation goals. Modelling tools are increasingly used by policymakers to support the spatial prioritization of biodiversity conservation, enabling the inclusion of scenarios of environmental changes to achieve specific targets. Here, using the Western Swiss Alps as a case study, we show how integrating species richness derived from species distribution model predictions for four taxonomic groups under present and future climate and land-use conditions into two conservation prioritization schemes can help optimize extant and future PAs. The first scheme, the "Priority Scores Method" identified priority areas for the expansion of the existing PA network. The second scheme, using the zonation software, allowed identifying priority conservation areas while incorporating global change scenarios and political costs. We found that existing mountain PAs are currently not situated in the most environmentally nor politically suitable locations when maximizing alpha diversity for the studied taxonomic groups and that current PAs could become even less optimum under the future climate and land-use change scenarios. This analysis has focused on general areas of high species richness or species of conservation concern and did not account for special habitats or functional groups that could have been used to create the existing network. We conclude that such an integrated framework could support more effective conservation planning and could be similarly applied to other landscapes or other biodiversity conservation indices.

AB  - 1. A vast scientific literature has been devoted to identifying the best way to represent biodiversity for conservation in the last decade. Methods exist for deciding how to use scarce information and avoid omission and commission errors. The effect of these errors on reserve efficiency does not arise only from the accuracy of data representing conservation features, as usually considered. There are also several underlying assumptions associated with the type of data used that might affect accuracy of conservation decision-making and compromise achievement of conservation objectives.
   2. Here the effects of two management scenarios on selection of priority areas for conservation are explored. The spatial distribution of 10 native freshwater fish species in an Iberian basin under present-day and reference conditions were modelled and priority areas for both scenarios using the same spatial and cost constraints were identified.
   3. Priority areas identified under the present-day scenario reflected the up-to-date spatial distribution of species and avoided the selection of highly perturbed and costly areas. The isolated spatial distribution of native populations imposed by the current perturbation status limited the spatial connectivity between priority areas under the present-day scenario. Most importantly for the achievement of conservation objectives, priority areas selected under both scenarios did not overlap.
   4. Given that the reference scenario was based on potential presence of native species the actual representation of species would be overestimated if consideration were not given to restoring reference conditions (high commission errors). Based on results obtained it is recommended that planners give more consideration to the current perturbation status when identifying priority areas for conservation.

AB  - Most countries have committed to protect 17% of their terrestrial area by 2020 through Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, with a focus on protecting areas of particular importance for biodiversity. This means national-scale spatial conservation prioritisations are needed to help meet this target and guide broader conservation and land-use policy development. However, to ensure these assessments are adopted by policy makers, they mist also consider national priorities. This situation is exemplified by Guyana, a corner of Amazonia that couples high biodiversity with low economic development. In recent years activities that threaten biodiversity conservation have increased, and consequently, protected areas are evermore critical to achieving the Aichi targets. Here we undertake a cost-effective approach to protected area planning in Guyana that accounts for in-country conditions. To do this we conducted a stakeholder-led spatial conservation prioritisation based on meeting targets for 17 vegetation types and 329 vertebrate species, while minimising opportunity costs for forestry, mining, agriculture and urbanisation. Our analysis identifies 3 million ha of priority areas for conservation, helping inform government plans to double the current protected area network from 8.5 to 17%. As part of this, we also develop a new technique to prioritise engagement with local communities whose lands are identified as important to conservation. Our study both provides a scientifically robust, politically acceptable protected area expansion strategy for Guyana, and illustrates the importance of conservation planning at the country-scale to translate international commitments into national action.

AB  - Understanding the effects of climate change on primate ranging patterns is crucial for conservation planning. Rhinopithecus roxellana is an endangered primate species distributed in mountainous forests at the elevation of 1500-3500m a.s.l. in China. Our study site, the Shennongjia National Nature Reserve, represents the eastern-most distribution of this species. This area has experienced significant habitat loss and fragmentation because of human population growth, increased farming and logging, and climate change. To estimate how changes in temperature and rainfall will affect the presumed future distribution of this species, we examined eco-geographic factors including bioclimate, habitat (vegetation type, landcover, etc.), topography, and human impact (human population, gross domestic product, etc.), and provide suggestions for management and conservation. We used a maximum entropy approach to predict the location and distribution of habitats suitable for R. roxellana in the present, 2020, 2050, and 2080 based on 33 environmental parameters, three general circulation models, three emissions scenarios, and two dispersal hypotheses. According to the ensemble modeling, we found range reductions of almost 30% by 2020, 70% by 2050, and over 80% by 2080. Although no obvious differences were found in distribution change based on full and zero dispersal assumptions, our results revealed range reductions in response to elevational, latitudinal, and longitudinal gradients, with the monkeys forced to migrate to higher elevations over time. Bioclimte factors, such as temperature, precipitation, evapo-transpiration, and aridity condition, were dominant contributors to range shifting. As habitat loss due to human influence and climate change is likely to be even more severe in the future, we considered three conservation hot-spots in the Shennongjia area and recommended: (i) securing existing reserves and establishing new reserves, (ii) re-designing management systems to include the Shenongjia reserve and the surrounding reserves and highlighting ecosystem protection at higher elevations, and (iii) using finer-scale research to guide the conservation planning and education in order to enhance protection and awareness in the local community. National and provincial conservation policies should integrate projections of climate change in making effective conservation strategies. Am. J. Primatol. 77:135-151, 2015.

AB  - AimThe Asiatic cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus venaticus, a critically endangered large felid, has disappeared from vast tracks of its historical range across south-western Asia. It is currently confined to the arid ecosystems of central Iran for which little is known about its distribution and habitat linkages. We proposed the first evaluation of Asiatic cheetah's distribution and developed models of landscape suitability and connectivity to inform future conservation planning.
   LocationCentral Iran.
   MethodsWe analysed presence data of a 14-year-long cheetah monitoring programme according to environmental and anthropogenic factors, and generated an ensemble model of habitat suitability based on seven species distribution models (SDMs). We then used the concept of circuit theory and landscape connectivity prioritization (LCP) on resultant core habitats and landscape suitability to evaluate potential linkages between core areas.
   ResultsCore habitats, that is, the areas hosting the largest continuous suitable habitats for Asiatic cheetahs, covered approximately 49,144km(2) (c. 6.3% of the study area). Availability of prey species, avoidance of human-dominated areas and their infrastructures, and rough landscapes covered with sparse vegetation were the most predictive factors of the core habitats for the last cheetah population in Asia. Although relatively vast, the area of potential core habitats available to cheetahs appeared to be fragmented with limited connectivity between the northern and southern parts of this distribution.
   Main conclusionsOur approach highlights the importance of distribution models to recognize, at a coarse-scale level, a spatial population structure and habitat suitability characteristics for a large carnivore surviving at very low density. We have identified specific areas of suitable habitat where developing new landscape protection and adaptive conservation management; and improving the safety of important linkages between core habitats are likely to promote the conservation of the last surviving population of cheetah in Asia.

AB  - Survival and reproduction are the two primary life-history traits essential for species' persistence; however, the environmental conditions that support each of these traits may not be the same. Despite this, reproductive requirements are seldom considered when estimating species' potential distributions. We sought to examine potentially limiting environmental factors influencing the distribution of an oviparous reptile of conservation concern with respect to the species' survival and reproduction and to assess the implications of the species' predicted climatic constraints on current conservation practices. We used ecological niche modeling to predict the probability of environmental suitability for the alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii). We built an annual climate model to examine survival and a nesting climate model to examine reproduction. We combined incubation temperature requirements, products of modeled soil temperature data, and our estimated distributions to determine whether embryonic development constrained the northern distribution of the species. Low annual precipitation constrained the western distribution of alligator snapping turtles, whereas the northern distribution was constrained by thermal requirements during embryonic development. Only a portion of the geographic range predicted to have a high probability of suitability for alligator snapping turtle survival was estimated to be capable of supporting successful embryonic development. Historic occurrence records suggest adult alligator snapping turtles can survive in regions with colder climes than those associated with consistent and successful production of offspring. Estimated egg-incubation requirements indicated that current reintroductions at the northern edge of the species' range are within reproductively viable environmental conditions. Our results highlight the importance of considering survival and reproduction when estimating species' ecological niches, implicating conservation plans, and benefits of incorporating physiological data when evaluating species' distributions.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are cost-effective, transparent and flexible planning tools to support various areas in nature conservation. Variables taken from remote sensing (RS) are broadly applicable to biodiversity studies. In our study, we combined RS-variables (normalized differenced vegetation index and land surface temperatures), with topographic and geological variables to produce detailed SDMs in the context of a seed collection campaign of the Alpine Seed Conservation and Research Project. To identify effective predictor variable combinations we compiled three different variable sets and compared the predictive model performance.
   The full model, that combines all types of variables, slightly outperforms (average values for TSS: 0.91, AUC: 0.98, Kappa: 0.7) models that use topo-climatic variables (average values for TSS: 0.91, AUC: 0.98, Kappa: 0.68) or NDVI (average values for TSS: 0.85, AUC: 0.96, Kappa: 0.54) alone. We also produced ensemble models that performed slightly better compared to the different model algorithms used in our approach. We identified the temperature of the coldest month, mean NDVI and bedrock as important variables that determine the distribution of alpine plant species.
   Our full models show high accordance with actual species distribution ranges and are highly relevant for efforts to identify special areas for either in-situ or ex-situ conservation. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Gesellschaft fur &Okologie.

AB  - Bats are considered important bioindicators and deliver key ecosystem services to humans. However, it is not clear how the individual and combined effects of climate change and land-use change will affect their conservation in the future. We used a spatial conservation prioritization framework to determine future shifts in the priority areas for the conservation of 169 bat species under projected climate and' land-use change scenarios across Africa. Specifically, we modelled species distribution models under four different climate change scenarios at the 2050 horizon. We used land-use change scenarios within the spatial conservation prioritization framework to assess habitat quality in areas where bats may shift their distributions. Overall, bats' representation within already existing protected areas in Africa was low (similar to 5% of their suitable habitat in protected areas which cover similar to 7% of Africa). Accounting for future land-use change resulted in the largest shift in spatial priority areas for conservation actions, and species representation within priority areas for conservation actions decreased by similar to 9%. A large proportion of spatial conservation priorities will shift from forested areas with little disturbance under present conditions to agricultural areas in the future. Planning land use to reduce impacts on bats in priority areas outside protected areas where bats will be shifting their ranges in the future is crucial to enhance their conservation and maintain the important ecosystem services they provide to humans.

AB  - Large landscapes encompassing reserves and areas with other human uses are necessary for conservation of many species. Generating information for conservation planning over such landscapes may be expensive and time-consuming, though resources for conservation are generally limited and conservation is often urgent. We developed a sign-based occupancy survey to help prioritize conservation interventions by simultaneously assessing the distribution of 3 species, the lesser rhea, guanaco, and mara, and their association with human activities in a 20,000-km(2) landscape in the northern Patagonian steppe. We used a single-season occupancy model with spatial rather than temporal replication of surveys in order to reduce costs of multiple visits to sites. We used covariates related to detectability, environmental factors, and different human activities to identify the most plausible models of occupancy, and calculated importance weights of covariates from these models to evaluate relative impacts of human activities on each species. Abundance of goats had the strongest negative association with lesser rheas and guanacos, and road density with maras. With six months of fieldwork, our results provided initial hypotheses for adaptive conservation interventions for each species. Addressing high livestock densities for rheas and guanacos, poaching by urban hunters for all three species, and hunting by rural people for rheas are priorities for conservation in this landscape. Our methodology provided new insights into the responses of these species, although low detection probabilities for maras indicate that the sampling scheme should be altered for future monitoring of this species. This method may be adapted for any large landscape where a rapid, objective means for prioritizing conservation actions on multiple species is needed and data are scarce.

AB  - Conservation of small mammals requires knowledge of the genetically and ecologically meaningful spatial scales at which species respond to habitat modifications. Conservation strategies can be improved through the use of ecological niche models and genetic data to classify areas of high environmental suitability. In this study, we applied a Maxent model integrated with genetic information (nucleotide diversity, haplotype diversity and Fu's Fs neutrality tests) to evaluate potential genetic pool populations with highly suitable areas for two parapatric endangered species of tuco-tucos (Ctenomys minutus and C. lami). Our results demonstrated that both species were largely influenced by vegetation and soil variables at a landscape scale and inhabit a highly specific niche. Ctenomys minutus was also influenced by the variable altitude; the species was associated with low altitudes (sea level). Our model of genetic data associated with environmental suitability indicate that the genetic pool data were associated with highly suitable areas for C. minutus. This pattern was not evident for C. lami, but this outcome could be a consequence of the restricted range of the species. The preservation of species requires not only detailed knowledge of their natural history and genetic structure but also information on the availability of suitable areas where species can survive, and such knowledge can aid significantly in conservation planning.

AB  - European bat species are strictly protected by law, and the Member States of the European Union are obliged to record species condition and to contribute to their conservation. Habitat-suitability models are an essential aid in assessing the conservation status and distribution of a species. However, model performance depends on the data quality. This study compares habitat-suitability models that were generated from two data sets that differ in the degree of details included. The first model used data that were low in detail but freely available and the second used data that were very detailed but costly. Three hypotheses were addressed: (1) that the model using low-detailed data is sufficient in its performance to aid the assessment of species distribution and infrastructural planning; (2) the visualisation of actual species distribution is more accurate in the high-detailed model; and (3) habitat-suitability maps can depict species distribution better than species occurrence data alone. To develop models, climate, geographic and roosting data of Myotis bechsteinii were used. Models allowed very good spatial predictions of suitable habitats. However, the model using low-detailed data overestimated suitable habitat. The high-detailed model was more able to predict actual species distribution. These findings were supported by field evaluation where M. bechsteinii could only be detected in areas where both models predicted high habitat suitability. This framework is promising as it resulted in spatially explicit habitat-suitability maps and suggests that similar models may be used to improve the understanding of bat distribution and factors endangering other species of bats.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning has been used extensively throughout the world to identify important areas for maintaining biodiversity and functional ecosystems, and is well suited to address large-scale biodiversity conservation challenges of the twenty-first century. Systematic planning is necessary to bridge implementation, scale, and data gaps in a collaborative effort that recognizes competing land uses. Here, we developed a conservation planning process to identify and unify conservation priorities around the central and southern Appalachian Mountains as part of the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (App LCC). Through a participatory framework and sequential, cross-realm integration in spatial optimization modeling we highlight lands and waters that together achieve joint conservation goals from LCC partners for the least cost. This process was driven by a synthesis of 26 multi-scaled conservation targets and optimized for simultaneous representation inside the program Marxan to account for roughly 25% of the LCC geography. We identify five conservation design elements covering critical ecological processes and patterns including interconnected regions as well as the broad landscapes between them. Elements were then subjected to a cumulative threats index for possible prioritization. The evaluation of these elements supports multi-scaled decision making within the LCC planning community through a participatory, dynamic, and iterative process.

AB  - Hummingbirds are one of the most threatened bird groups in the world. However, the extent to which global climate change (GCC) and habitat loss compromise their conservation status remains unclear. Herein, we proposed to: (1) assess how predicted GCC impacts the distribution of non-migrant hummingbirds according to their conservation status, degree of restriction and habitat specificity; and (2) delineate priority conservation areas where species could persist in the face of both threats. We estimated the potential distributions of 49 species under current and future climates (year 2040, 2060, and 2080), analyzing the effects of current habitat loss and the importance of existing Protected Areas (PAs) on the species' ranges and hummingbird hotspot areas in Mexico. Our projections were consistent in the identity of the species that are most vulnerable to GCC: while 10.2% of species will have potentially habitat gains/stability ("winners"), the remaining 89.8% of species ("losers") will face habitat reductions under new climate conditions. These changes were mostly related to temperature increases (>2 degrees C) and rainfall decreases (<50 mm). The combined impacts of GCC and habitat loss may represent a higher risk, leading to an average reduction of 26-59% in species' ranges. Already-established Mexican PAs cover 12% of the hummingbirds' current ranges, but showed an important reduction of surface across the species distribution (on average >15%) and hotspot areas (>60%) for future. We identified highly resilient priority areas across southern Mexico, in Oaxaca and Guerrero. Ambitious conservation actions by decision-makers are now crucial to avoid losing these highly-vulnerable taxa. (C) 2021 Associac , ao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservaca.

AB  - Efforts to conserve migratory species have been challenged by a poor understanding of their temporally-dynamic distributions over large geographies. Consequently, most conservation plans have focused on the stationary periods despite the importance of migratory periods for overall population dynamics and fitness. Strategies that identify stopover sites for migratory species during migration and examine the potential for those sites to protect resident species may offer an efficient approach to enhance the conservation of both groups. Using crowd sourced data (i.e., eBird), we identified priority stopover sites (PSSs) that target protection of 30% of the seasonal average abundance of over 400 Nearctic-Neotropical migratory bird species in the Americas during spring and fall migratory periods. We then calculated the proportion of global abundance of 158 resident bird species including 27 imperiled species, that were captured on those sites, analysed the extent to which sites were protected, and forecast changes in land use. Around half or less of PSSs were shared between spring (52-54%) and fall (23-32%), indicating that planning efforts should be season-specific. Less than 10% of PSSs were protected, while 30-46% were in human modified landscapes. Even though our spatial algorithms targeted 30% of the abundance of migratory birds, comparable proportions of resident bird populations were also captured (36% of resident and 42% of imperiled bird populations in fall, 22% and 31% respectively in spring). Our findings demonstrate that protecting stopover sites for migrating species can provide co-benefits for resident and imperiled species.

AB  - Global biodiversity is undergoing rapid decline due to direct and indirect anthropogenic impacts to species and ecosystems. Marine species, in particular, are experiencing accelerated population declines leading to many species being considered at risk by regional, national, and international standards. As one conservation approach, decisions made using spatially explicit information on marine wildlife populations have the potential to facilitate recovery and contribute to national and international commitments toward conservation targets. Delineating areas of intense use by species at risk can inform future marine spatial planning and conservation efforts, including the identification of marine protected areas. Methods for detecting hotspots (e.g., areas with high density and/or abundance) enable categorical mapping of the most intensely used areas. Yet, many of the current methods for delineating hotspots, such as the top 5% threshold, are subjective and fail to account for spatial patterns. Our goal was to map spatially continuous distributions of marine mammal densities and employ quantitative statistical methods to extract hotspot locations on the northern coast of British Columbia. We integrated systematically surveyed species information with environmental variables using generalized additive models to predict marine mammal distribution and density. Hotspots were identified from the density surfaces using two approaches: aspatial top 5% method and spatially local Gi* statistic using three neighborhood definitions. Heterogeneous density patterns were observed for all species, and high-density regions were generally clustered in areas exhibiting oceanographic characteristics that may promote concentrated food resources. Combining species density surfaces and extracting hotspot locations identified regions important to multiple species and present candidate locations for future conservation efforts. Contributions from this research provide robust statistical methods to objectively map hotspot locations and generate GIS data products for informing coastal conservation decisions.

AB  - Recovery plans are the main tool used for restoration of threatened species in Australia, and identification of key threatening processes is an important feature of them. The aim of this study was to identify how climate change can be incorporated into the recovery planning process using a case study of threatened vertebrates in a global biodiversity hotspot, southwestern Australia. Analysis of 79 recovery planning documents for threatened vertebrate species in the region found that prior to the year 2004, climate change was not included as a threatening process. Post 2004, 32 of 54 (59.3%) documents included climate change as a threatening process. Using bioclimatic modelling, 43 of these species were ranked in terms of their potential exposure to climate change, and a gradient of management intervention aimed at mitigating their exposure to climate change was proposed. This intervention gradient ranged from active management actions aimed at species potentially at risk of extinction due to climate change, through to preservation of habitat in species predicted to lose between 0 and 25% of their current population size. It was proposed that as a priority, the recovery documentation of the 20 species predicted to be most at risk and thus needing a high level of management intervention should identify climate change as a key threatening process, and that more comprehensive analyses of climate change vulnerability be undertaken for these species. Such an approach aimed at prioritising climate change mitigation in threatened species would be useful for other regions where it has been predicted that climate change could have a negative impact on biodiversity.

AB  - Predicting species distributions has long been a valuable tool to plan and focus efforts for biodiversity conservation, particularly because such an approach allows researchers and managers to evaluate species distribution changes in response to various threats. Utilizing data from a long-term monitoring program and land cover data sets, we modeled the probability of occupancy and colonization for 38 bird Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) in the robust design occupancy modeling framework, and used results from the best models to predict occupancy and colonization on the Iowa landscape. Bird surveys were conducted at 292 properties from April to October, 2006-2014. We calculated landscape habitat characteristics at multiple spatial scales surrounding each of our surveyed properties to be used in our models and then used kriging in ArcGIS to create predictive maps of species distributions. We validated models with data from 2013 using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Probability of occupancy ranged from 0.001 (SE < 0.001) to 0.995 (SE = 0.004) for all species and probability of colonization ranged from 0.001 (SE < 0.001) to 0.999 (SE < 0.001) for all species. AUC values for predictive models ranged from 0.525 - 0.924 for all species, with 17 species having predictive models considered useful (AUC > 0.70). The most important predictor for occupancy of grassland birds was percentage of the landscape in grassland habitat, and the most important predictor for woodland birds was percentage of the landscape in woodland habitat. This emphasizes the need for managers to restore specific habitats on the landscape. In an era during which funding continues to decrease for conservation agencies, our approach aids in determining where to focus limited resources to best conserve bird species of conservation concern.

AB  - The current study combines the use of niche modelling with a site prioritization method to identify important areas for butterfly conservation in Italy. A novel machine learning method (bagging predictors) was used to predict the distribution of 232 species of butterflies across the Italian Peninsula. The results of the models were used to identify high-value sites with a multispecies prioritization method called zonation. In order to identify important areas for species of conservation concern, we incorporated a species weighting scheme to zonation analyses. We also used the results of the zonation analyses to identify a series of management landscapes on the basis of the similarity in species composition among sites. The basic zonation showed that most important areas for butterfly conservation are located in the Alps, the Appennine, the Apulia region and in the island of Sardinia. The inclusion of a species weighting scheme in the zonation analyses revealed the importance of two new areas located in Southern Italy and emphasized the importance of the Alps for species of conservation concern. The landscape identification procedure selected a series of landscapes, which provide protection to a full range of species ranging from the Alps to Mediterranean areas. Our study shows that the areas selected in our analyses should be given high priority in future conservation plans and monitoring schemes.

AB  - There is interest in linking outputs from land use simulators to bird species distribution models to project how boreal birds will respond to cumulative effects of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) conservation, harvest, fire, and energy-sector development in Alberta. Our hypotheses were: (1) species associated with older mixed-wood stands would decline more if harvest was shifted away from areas used by caribou to areas with more mixed-wood; and (2) species associated with older forests would be more negatively affected by the combined effects of harvest, fire, and non-forestry footprint than by harvest alone. We used vegetation data from two harvest scenarios produced in Patchworks as inputs for density models of 20 boreal forest songbird and woodpecker species in Alberta. We projected abundance of these species over 50 years under: 1) two scenarios created in Patchworks, without fire but with and without deferral of timber harvest within a caribou conservation zone on lands tenured to Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc.; (2) a scenario with fire but no human footprint; and (3) five scenarios in ALCES Online, in which habitat was affected by Patchworks harvest locations, fire (1-2 x current rate), and energy sector development (present or absent; with or without seismic line reclamation to improve caribou habitat). In the Patchworks scenarios, we found similar projected numbers of each bird species over time, whether harvest deferral occurred or not. Both harvest plans increased habitat and numbers for most species associated with older forests over 50 years, while most species associated with younger forests declined in both harvest plans, because average projected forest age increased over 50 years. Fire and other footprint generally reduced relative amount of habitat for species associated with older forests, which still increased over time, while other species responded positively or less negatively to fire. Seismic restoration created habitat for three-quarters of species that responded negatively to energy sector development over 50 years. As projections depended on whether just harvest, fire or all footprints were analyzed, multiple human impacts over time beyond harvest should be considered in conservation and land use planning based on long-term predictions about wildlife in anthropogenic landscapes.

AB  - AimDrivers of biodiversity loss are increasingly broad in scale, requiring conservation planning to move towards range-wide assessments. This is especially challenging for migratory species, such as reindeer or caribou (Rangifer tarandus), which use only a small portion of their range at a given point in time, and for which some parts of their range, such as calving grounds, may be much more important than others. Our aim was to identify potential calving ground habitat of wild tundra reindeer populations throughout Russia, where scarce knowledge about seasonal reindeer habitat is an obstacle for conservation planning, and to assess possible impacts from oil and gas development and climate change.
   LocationNorthern Eurasia.
   MethodWe used occurrence data from known reindeer calving grounds using species distribution models to first assess calving grounds characteristics and second predict their distribution across the Russian Arctic. We then compared our calving ground map with maps of oil and gas development, and a range of climate change indicators.
   ResultsWe found areas throughout the Russian Arctic that are suitable for calving, including for some wild reindeer populations where calving ground locations are unknown. Variables relating to resource availability in spring and predator avoidance were the strongest predictors in our model. Oil and gas development affects calving grounds especially in the Barents Sea region and in south-western Siberia, whereas climate change affects calving grounds on Taymyr, Chukotka, and Kamchatka.
   Main conclusionsWe conducted the first assessment of calving grounds of Russia's wild reindeer populations, highlighting the spatial heterogeneity of the threats that they may face. Given the potentially strong impact of oil and gas development and climate change, conservation planning should aim for designing resilient conservation networks that would allow Arctic biodiversity to freely move in time and space and thus to adapt to changing environments.

AB  - The Scaly-sided Merganser Mergus squamatus is a globally 'Endangered' species breeding in north-east Asia. Limited by information on the geographic distribution of suitable habitat, the conservation management programme has not been comprehensive or spatially explicit for the breeding population. This study combines potentially important environmental variables with extensive data on species occurrence to create the first species distribution model for the breeding Scaly-sided Merganser, followed by a GAP analysis to highlight the unprotected areas containing suitable habitat. The predictive map showing the most suitable breeding habitat for the Scaly-sided Merganser covered broad-leaved deciduous forest distributed in six provincial regions in south-east Russia, north-east China, and North Korea. The conservation GAP, i.e. 90% (38,813 km(2)) of highly suitable habitat, is mainly concentrated in the Sikhote-Alin and Changbai mountain ranges. This study suggests that prioritizing conservation of unprotected broad-leaved deciduous riverine forests within the above two mountainous regions should be included in international conservation planning, and the remaining suitable patches need to be preserved to allow range expansion in future. This predictive map improves the expert global assessment of breeding Scaly-sided Merganser distribution and provides a basic reference for establishing conservation areas or implementing conservation actions for the breeding Scaly-sided Merganser in north-east Asia.

AB  - We analyzed the spatial distribution of a snake assemblage from the Sierras de Ventania mountain range, a rich endemism area in east-central Argentina. We used field-collected and museum specimens combined with high resolution environmental variables to identify common distributional patterns, estimate the suitable habitat for each species, and develop a conservation proposal related to the Protected Natural Areas (PNAs) system. Distributional models diverged into two opposite patterns: suitable habitats for most species at relatively high altitude in the hills, and suitable habitats for Bothrops ammodytoides and Lygophis anomalus at relatively low altitude in the surrounding hill plain. We assessed two proposals based on different conservation algorithms: the additive benefit function (ABF), which favours hilly environments, prioritizing areas with high specific richness, and the core-area zonation (CAZ), which prioritizes the distribution of all species, further indicating areas with low richness in the surrounding plain. Regardless of the algorithm used, our results indicated that the existing PNAs are not effective in protecting the snake assemblage. Protecting at least 5% of the highest species richness areas (ABF) or 5% of the distribution core areas of all species (CAZ), the existing PNAs only represented 2.2% of these priority areas. Our findings are largely consistent with previous work, highlighting that a widespread area needs to be assigned for conservation purposes. Thus, protection of the snake assemblage should take place both inside and outside the PNAs.

AB  - Iranian endemic monocotyledons include 152 species belonging to 35 genera of 10 plant families and comprise about 2.08% of Iranian plant flora and approximately 6.9% of Iran's endemic flora. Amaryllidaceae, with 71 species, is the largest family of endemic monocots in Iran. Endemic species were categorized based on topographic zonations including basins (less than 300 m a.s.l.), lowlands (300?1000 m a.s.l.), semi-mountainous (1000?1500 m a.s.l.), mountainous (1500?2500 m a.s.l.), alpine (2500?3500 m a.s.l.), and subnivale (3500?4500 m a.s.l.). Iranian endemic monocots included critically endangered (CR): 60% (89 spp), endangered (EN): 17% (26 spp.), near threatened (NT): 12% (18 spp), vulnerable (VU): 8% (12 spp), and the least concern (LC): 3% (4 spp.). Besides, the Kurdistan?Zagros range and the Atropatenian phytogeographical units feature the highest numbers of critically endangered taxa and form the first class in conservation value and priority. This will aid in management planning, in situ and ex situ conservation, and modeling habitat suitability for rehabilitation and restoration plans.

AB  - This study utilized a finite mixture distribution model (FMDM) to identify the distribution of bird diversity in urban and suburban areas of the Taipei basin. The spatial patterns of Shannon's diversity index were estimated using Sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) with bird investigation data. To validate the results of FMDM, bird groups were classified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) based on bird presence-absence records. The probabilities exceeding FMDM's cut-off values for suburban bird communities were obtained from SGS realizations. The results showed that bird diversity in the Taipei basin could be comprised of two-component mixture distributions for urban and suburban bird communities, respectively. The FMDM bird diversity classifications fit the TWINSPAN groups of urban and suburban species. The spatial maps of bird diversity in the study area provide evidence that a metropolis can cause changes in the spatial characteristics of bird communities at the landscape level. Furthermore, the bird diversity and land use maps could be useful for future conservation and urban planning in Taipei Basin, particularly urban green spaces and wetlands. The maps could also be utilized in network planning of green belts or corridors for ecological conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to anthropogenic actions, species have become endangered or have been driven to the verge of extinction, requiring conservation plans to be developed and implemented. These plans include measures to protect and enhance remaining populations and to reintroduce populations within the native ranges. However, future habitat suitability in the face of climate change is rarely assessed, despite the fact that it could compromise conservation opportunities. It is attempted to carry this task out for the critically endangered European Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser sturio). Species presence/absence was documented for 196 basins between 1750 and 1850 over the Western Palearctic. A predictive distribution model was established from this database using Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and a pool of relevant environmental variables. Projections were performed at two time-steps, 2050 and 2100, using the HadCM3 Global Climate Model (GCM) and the A2 and A1FI emissions scenarios. The BRT model incorporated two general climatic descriptors, summer precipitation and annual air temperature, average slope served as a topographic predictor, and marine provinces as a macroecological variable. The statistical model performance allowed projections with the predictive deviance being 29 +/- 2.80 and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) being 0.86 +/- 0.02. The results obtained are in accordance with the species thermal preferences and with its hydrological habitat requirements. Most of the former sturgeon distribution range was assessed as being strongly affected by climate change, especially basins along the southern limit of its range. On this basis, proposals to integrate the climate change dimension into conservation strategy are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Bioblo Region is part of the "Chilean winter rainfall-Valdivian forests" biodiversity "hotspot" and is characterized by having a high rate of both endemism and habitat loss and fragmentation. Although birds make it possible to monitor these realities, in addition to the effects that Global Climate Change (GCC) has on their habitats, their knowledge is still scarce both in the Biobio Region and in Chile. A regional inventory would be costly on time, budget, and personnel. We evaluated the representativeness and completeness of a regional inventory obtained from bird records of ebird-Chile. The observed specific richness was 226 species and the expected richness was 249 species for the reg ion. We used the Clench parametric model and the non-parametric models: Chao1, iChao1, ACE, First Order Jackknife, and Second-Order Jackknife for all estimations. We identified 37 threatened species, 6 endemic species, and 3 rare species. We found a biased distribution of sampling efforts and species diversity to coastal communities. Greater attention and effort should be put into the study and conservation of the richness of the higher taxa of birds because they represent greater phylogenetic diversity. Studies on birds in the Biobio Region can use sources of information such as eBird-Chile to bridge the knowledge gap on birds, and the information obtained can be expressed in terms that can be integrated into land-use planning to advance towards the management and conservation of birds.

AB  - Endemic and restricted-range species are considered to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental change, which makes assessing likely climate change effects on geographic distributions of such species important to the development of integrated conservation strategies. Here, we determined distributional patterns for an endemic species ofDianthus(Dianthus polylepis) in the Irano-Turanian region using a maximum-entropy algorithm. In total, 70 occurrence points and 19 climatic variables were used to estimate the potential distributional area under current conditions and two future representative concentration pathway (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) scenarios under seven general circulation models for 2050. Mean diurnal range, iso-thermality, minimum temperature of coldest quarter, and annual precipitation were major factors that appeared to structure the distribution of the species. Most current potential suitable areas were located in montane regions. Model transfers to future-climate scenarios displayed upward shifts in elevation and northward shifts geographically for the species. Our results can be used to define high-priority areas in the Irano-Turanian region for conservation management plans for this species and can offer a template for analyses of other endangered and threatened species in the region.

AB  - Like elsewhere in West Africa, the landscapes of Sierra Leone are strongly human-dominated with consequences for large mammal distribution and diversity. Sierra Leone is currently going through a phase of post-war recovery, with accelerating development of the mining, forestry, agricultural and infrastructure sectors. As environmental issues are increasingly considered, comprehensive biodiversity information is required. Here we evaluate spatial patterns of large mammal diversity throughout Sierra Leone to make inferences about species persistence. We used systematic line transect sampling for assessing large mammal distribution. GLMs and canonical correspondence analyses were used to evaluate the relative importance of human impact for every species while controlling for environmental gradients and to make countrywide spatial model predictions. We further developed an algorithm to identify core distributional ranges for the most common species. A total of 562 km of transects were surveyed and 35 large mammal species encountered. Species diversity was impoverished in the country's south and center and strongly increased towards the north and east. Human impact did not determine the distribution of four species (brushed-tailed porcupine, bushbuck, giant rat, warthog), but was very influential on chimpanzee and yellow-backed duiker occurrence with U-shaped and negative responses, respectively. The remaining species showed mixed responses to human impact and environmental gradients. Predicting species persistence in West African human-dominated landscapes is complex. Pooling of species for land-use planning is therefore not recommended. Our study provides key information for land-use planning to separate areas with post-depletion species assemblages from more diverse regions with high conservation value.

AB  - Climate change is considered one of the greatest threats to biodiversity in future decades. Learning about the habitat preferences and geographical distributions of endangered species is critical for conservation management and planning in the context of climate change. This study investigated the effects of climate change on suitable habitat for Arborophila rufipectus Boulton, an endangered species that is endemic to southwest China. We used the known presence records for this species and a series of environmental variable layers to develop a predictive distribution model using maximum entropy modelling; this model was then used to assess the effects of future climate change on suitable habitat for this species. Our study indicated that climate change might have significant effects on suitable habitat for this species. By 2050, under a no-dispersal hypothesis, more than four-fifths of the habitat currently assessed as suitable would be lost, and the mean latitude of suitable habitat would shift northward by more than 100 kilometres. Based on this model, climate change would also aggravate habitat fragmentation. Under a full-dispersal hypothesis, all four climate trajectories developed by the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (Ccma) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) present similar trends: the area of suitable habitat is predicted to increase substantially, and habitat fragmentation would be mitigated under the two climate trajectories developed by the Goddard In- stitute for Space Studies (GISS). Finally, we offer some practical proposals for the future conservation of this endangered species.

AB  - Mollusca is a megadiverse phylum with an estimated number of 70,000-76,000 described species which can inhabit a wide variety of environments. Among them, land snails are a main component of terrestrial ecosystems and they play a pivotal role in ecosystem functioning. They are suffering habitat loss, overexploitation and competition from introduced species, but are regarded as a "non-charismatic" group for conservation purposes. Orthalicoidea is a dominant faunal element in the Neotropics and in Argentina includes 104 species that inhabit a variety of environments. Their abundance, diversity, comprehensive taxonomy and widespread representation in different ecoregions makes this molluscan group an excellent model for biodiversity assessments. The database used here consisted of 985 unique geographic records of 104 species. Species distribution models were generated using the Maximum Entropy method and Zonation v 3.1 was used to evaluate the proposed conservation goals. Three analyses including species distributions, the current protected areas system (PAs) and the Human print layer were carried out. This allowed the identification of priority areas for conservation, the percentage of the species distribution under PAs and analysis of the potential impacts under current land use and in the priority areas detected above. Sixty-one species were modeled, and 59 of them were included in the priority area selection process due to their high area under curve (AUC) scores. Five high priority areas located in the different ecoregions, were identified: 1-dry Chaco, 2-humid Pampas, 3-Southern Andean Yungas, 4-Alto Parana Atlantic Forests and 5-high Monte. A small percentage of the average distribution range of Orthalicoidean species (3%) was within the current protected areas. Highest-ranked priority areas for land snails are outside the current protected areas system. When human impact is considered, the priority areas are reduced in size and appear as small patches. However, highest priority areas for conservation continue being those detected in the above analyses. Most of the areas detected are used for economic purposes, creating conflicts of interest between the development of human activities and conservation. This study represents one of the first attempts to identify ecoregion level priority areas for a terrestrial invertebrate group. Further analyses, including new predictors and other molluscan taxa, would improve planning the conservation of poorly known invertebrate groups.

AB  - Aim: To review the conservation status of Headwater catfish Ictalurus lupus (Girard,1859) in the United States, including quantifying environmental correlates with range contraction and hybridization and introgression with Channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque, 1818) to inform conservation prioritization.
   Location: Texas and New Mexico, USA.
   Methods: We used random forest models to construct species distribution models (SDMs) based on historical (1980-1999) and contemporary (2000-2019) data and 13 classes of remotely sensed stream network data. We measured hybridization and introgression with the widely introduced Channel catfish using external morphology, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and a nuclear gene (RAG2).
   Results: Species distribution models illustrated temporal reduction in suitability for Headwater catfish among the species' namesake headwater streams, including streams with steeper slopes, faster velocities, and higher elevations. Modelling also revealed reduced suitability of larger streams greater distances from groundwater springs, the same streams frequently occupied by non-native Channel catfish. A general pattern of increased use of streams draining watersheds with altered or developed land uses was apparent. Assessment of introgression and hybridization with non-native channel catfish at nine locations showed evidence of ongoing or past hybridization at six locations. Persistence of potentially non-introgressed populations were found at three locations with smaller sample sizes.
   Main conclusions: Modelling temporal changes in Headwater catfish distribution provided critical insight into the types and locations of streams that should be targeted for habitat preservation or restoration. Conservation and management of Headwater catfish will require priority decisions based on existing levels of introgression and the practicality of preventing further contact with Channel catfish. Maintaining Headwater catfish populations in springs that are also heavily used by humans will be critical for conservation of the species in the United States.

AB  - Species distribution modelling is an important tool in planning conservation strategies, in predicting effects of environmental change and in delineating patterns of species diversity. Until now, the majority of studies dealing with predicted species distributions were conducted at regional scales by using climatic and biomass parameters with low spatial resolution as environmental variables. On the contrary, informed decision-making regarding conservation priorities mainly takes place on a local scale. We used the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP), environmental layers (derivates of high-resolution LANDSAT ETM + satellite images) and 13,380 geo-referenced records from collection and releve data to model distributions of vascular plant species in the Sahelian zone of Burkina Faso. For each species, records were divided randomly in a training dataset for model generation and a test dataset to evaluate the modelled distribution maps. Single distributions of 138 highly accurately modelled species were summed up for life forms and total species richness. Highest values of species richness are found in the NW of the study area. The pattern of vascular plant diversity appears to be closely linked to sandy soils and to water availability: watercourses, tiger bush vegetation and dune ridges are more diverse than pediplain. Chamaephytes show a more pronounced preference of dunes over pediplain than other life forms, while geophyte diversity is highest near watercourses. Hemicryptophyte diversity is most evenly distributed. Therophyte diversity is closest to all vascular plant diversity. Phanerophyte diversity is highest in tiger bush vegetation and close to watercourses. Our approach holds a wide application potential to model species distributions and diversity where environmental data are scarce. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Regional conservation planning can often make more effective use of sparse biological data by linking these data to remotely mapped environmental variables through statistical modelling. While modelling distributions of individual species is the best known and most widely used approach to such modelling, there are many situations in which more information can be extracted from available data by supplementing, or replacing, species-level modelling with modelling of communities or assemblages. This paper provides an overview of approaches to community-level modelling employed in a series of major land-use planning processes in the northeast New South Wales region of Australia, and evaluates how well communities and assemblages derived using these techniques function as surrogates in regional conservation planning. We also outline three new directions that may enhance the effectiveness of community-level modelling by: ( 1) more closely integrating modelling with traditional ecological mapping ( e. g. vegetation mapping); ( 2) more tightly linking numerical classification and spatial modelling through application of canonical classification techniques; and ( 3) enhancing the applicability of modelling to data-poor regions through employment of a new technique for modelling spatial pattern in compositional dissimilarity.

Large-extent spatial datasets are thus often used, but their analyses rarely deal with problems inherent to spatial datasets such as residual spatial autocorrelation, which can bias or even reverse results. Here we propose a procedure for analysing a large-scale count dataset integrating residual spatial autocorrelation in a Generalized Linear Model framework by combining and extending previously published methods. The first step concerns the selection of the environmental variables by a modified cross-validation procedure allowing for residual spatial autocorrelation. Then the second step consists in evaluating the spatial effect of the model using a spatial filtering approach based on the variogram parameters. We apply this method to the Black kite (Milvus migrans) to estimate the distribution and population size of this species in France. We found some divergence in estimated population size between spatial and non spatial models, as well as in the distribution map. We also found that the uncertainty of the model was underestimated by the residual spatial autocorrelation. Our analysis confirms previous results, that residual spatial autocorrelation should be always accounted for, especially in conservation where false results may lead to poor management decisions.

AB  - Predictive fish distribution models have utility in planning conservation measures for rare fish species. However, species rarity creates sampling and modeling difficulties that require an understanding of model accuracy. We evaluated existing distribution models for 10 rare fishes based on 2,026 community fish samples and associated riverine habitat. Our fieldwork provided an independent fish species inventory for 143 sample sites. This inventory was used to quantify species detectability for use as a weighting factor with which to correct false-negative modeling errors. Presence/absence data were compared with predictions to evaluate model accuracy as determined by Cohen's kappa and correct classification rates. Detection probabilities were generally small but ranged from 0 to 0.68. The models predicted species occurrence with relatively high success (average kappa = 45.6% and average correct classification rate = 74. 1 %). The habitat variables for predicting species occurrence varied among species; however, stream size and streamflow were the most influential. All distribution models had adequate predictive abilities and improved our understanding of fish distributions and the factors determining those distributions. Model accuracy statistics can provide managers with a measure of confidence when they are directing conservation activities.

AB  - An index of 'deforestation pressure' is suggested as useful for reserve planning alongside the currently used information on the species present at candidate sites. For any location, the index value is correlated with threats to habitat and thus also survival probabilities over time for members of species dependent on that habitat. Threats in the absence of reserves are key information for planning new reserves. The index is estimated using a regression approach derived from a dynamic, micro-econornic model of land use, with data on observed clearing of forest over space and time as well as biophysical and socioeconomic factors in land returns. Applying an estimated threat (or probability of clearing) function for Costa Rica to locations of interest yields relevant estimates of sites' deforestation pressure, which are used to evaluate proposed reserves and to suggest other candidate sites.

AB  - Organisms adapted to life at high elevations are particularly threatened by climate change, which can cause them to become isolated on mountain tops, yet their responses may vary according to their position in the food chain and their ecological flexibility. Predicting the future distributions of such organisms requires fine-tuned species-specific models. Building on a previous ecological niche model, we explored shifts in the suitability of habitats for the Endangered Andean cat Leopardus jacobita, and assessed how these will be represented within existing protected areas in the future. Using a robust set of presence records and corrected climate surfaces, we applied the Maxent algorithm to model habitat suitability for this carnivore and for its preferred prey, the mountain viscacha Lagidium viscacia. Our predictions indicate that the areas climatically suitable for Andean cats could contract by up to 30% by 2080 under the most pessimistic scenario, with an overall upwards shift of 225 m and a polewards displacement of 98-180 km. The predicted range contraction was more pronounced in the species' core range, in the Bolivian and Peruvian Andes, whereas suitable conditions may increase in the southern range in Patagonia. Bolivia and Peru are predicted to suffer the most marked decline in habitat representativeness within protected areas. The southern range appears to be less vulnerable to climate change, offering opportunities for the conservation of this genetically distinct population. We discuss the value and limitations of using species distribution modelling to assess changes in the potential distribution and conservation status of this and other Andean species.

AB  - Our view of the future of biodiversity remains limited to a restricted number of taxa, and some taxa, such as spiders, have been largely omitted. Here we provide the first assessment of effects of global change on threatened spiders using a red-listed vulnerable spider, Dolomedes plantarius (Clerck, 1757) as an example. We aim at applying this assessment to assist two conservation actions for this species, including a translocation program. We compiled all the available data on D. plantarius and modelled its current and future distributions on the basis of both climate and land cover variables at a fine resolution (0.1 degrees). We applied an ensemble modelling procedure on the basis of eight modelling techniques, and forecasted the future distribution ranges for two emission scenarios (A1 and B2) and three general circulation models. Despite uncertainty regarding the predictions, the models performed very well, and consensus emerged for models and climate scenarios to predict significant negative effects on the current distribution range of this species. In the UK, the translocated population and one out of three natural populations were predicted to remain in highly suitable environmental areas. In France, one out of six locations was predicted to remain suitable in the future. Given the phylogeographic background of this species, the predicted effects of environmental changes should be considered seriously, especially for the long-term viability of conservation programs. Our study demonstrated the importance and feasibility of studying the effects of climate change by the means of species distribution models on taxa with limited available data, such as spiders.

AB  - Two of the principal responses of species to recent climate change have been changes in range and abundance, leading to a global reshuffling of the geographic distribution of species. Such range changes may cause species to disappear from areas they currently occupy and, given the right conditions, to colonize new sites. This could affect the ability of site networks (such as protected areas) to conserve species. Identifying sites that will continue to provide suitable conditions for focal species under future climate change scenarios and sites that are likely to become unsuitable is important for effective conservation planning. Here we explore the impacts of climate change on terrestrial bird species of conservation concern in the Neotropics, and the consequences for the network of Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) identified to conserve them. We modelled changes in species distributions for 3,798 species across the Caribbean and Central and South America, accounting for species-specific biological traits (natal dispersal ability and generation length), to assess species occurrences within IBAs under different future climate scenarios. Based on the projected changes in species compositions, we identified potential management strategies for the individual sites of the network. We projected that future climate change will have substantial impacts on the distribution of individual species across the IBA network, resulting in very heterogenous impacts on the individual IBAs. Mean turnover of species of conservation concern within IBAs was 17% by 2050. Nonetheless, under a medium-warming scenario, for 73% of the 939 species of conservation concern, more than half of the IBAs in which they currently occur were projected to remain climatically suitable, and for 90% at least a quarter of the sites remain suitable. These results suggest that the IBA network will remain robust under climate change. Nevertheless, 7% of the species of conservation concern are projected to have no suitable climate in the IBAs currently identified for them. Our results highlight the importance of a network-wide perspective when taking management decisions for individual sites under climate change.

AB  - Advances in remotely sensed data for characterizing habitat have enabled development of spatially explicit predictive species distribution models (SDM) that can be essential tools for management. SDMs commonly use coarse-grain metrics, such as forest patch size or patch connectivity, over broad spatial extents. However, species distributions are likely driven in part by local, fine-grained habitat conditions. Conservation and management are often planned and applied locally, where coarse predictions may be uninformative or not sufficiently precise. We investigated the integration of high-resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) with avian point sampling data to develop a detection-corrected occupancy model to quantify habitat-occurrence relationships for two species with different habitats: the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) on a military installation in central Texas. We compared occupancy models that used only the more conventional, coarse remotely sensed metrics to models that also incorporated high-resolution LiDAR-derived metrics for vegetation height and canopy cover, to assess their use for predicting distributions. Models including LiDAR-derived vegetation height and canopy cover metrics were competitive for both species, and models without LiDAR-derived vegetation height had substantially lower model weights and explanatory strength. Area under curve estimates for the highest ranked models were high for warblers (0.864) and moderate for vireos (0.746). Using the best supported models for each species, we predicted the occurrence distribution for both species. The resulting predictions provide a decision support tool that enables assessment of the status, impacts, and mitigation of impacts to endangered species habitat on the installation due to land management and military training activities that is more standardized and accurate than current assessment approaches based on visual gestalt of habitat and expert opinion. Additionally, although previous species distribution models have been created for our focal species, most fail to match the grain and extent of most management actions or include local, fine-grained metrics that influence distributions. In contrast, we demonstrate that use of LiDAR with species occurrence data can provide precision and resolution at a scale that is relevant ecologically and to the operational scale of most conservation and management actions.

AB  - Climate change is likely to affect the persistence of large, space-requiring species through habitat shifts, loss, and fragmentation. Anthropogenic land and resource use changes related to climate change can also impact the survival of wildlife. Thus, climate change has to be integrated into biodiversity conservation plans. We developed a hybrid approach to climate-adaptive conservation landscape planning for snow leopards in the Himalayan Mountains. We first mapped current snow leopard habitat using a mechanistic approach that incorporated field-based data, and then combined it with a climate impact model using a correlative approach. For the latter, we used statistical methods to test hypotheses about climatic drivers of treeline in the Himalaya and its potential response to climate change under three IPCC greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. We then assessed how change in treeline might affect the distribution of snow leopard habitat. Results indicate that about 30% of snow leopard habitat in the Himalaya may be lost due to a shifting treeline and consequent shrinking of the alpine zone, mostly along the southern edge of the range and in river valleys. But, a considerable amount of snow leopard habitat and linkages are likely to remain resilient to climate change, and these should be secured. This is because, as the area of snow leopard habitat fragments and shrinks, threats such as livestock grazing, retaliatory killing, and medicinal plant collection can intensify. We propose this approach for landscape conservation planning for other species with extensive spatial requirements that can also be umbrella species for overall biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Effective wildlife management requires knowledge about the areas th at are most important within the distribution range or specific management unit of the focal species. Using the spatial conservation planning tool, Zonation, and spatial data on Finnish forests, we present a fast and relatively simple way to objectively prioritise large areas for our focal species, the capercaillie Tetrao urogallus. We constructed the capercaillie lekking landscape prioritisation using published knowledge on the species' habitat and connectivity requirements, and validated the results via comparison to capercaillie lekking-site data. The results show that connectivity considerations both at the home range and the population scale are essential in prioritisation of areas suitable for capercaillie lekking sites. In addition, inclusion of negative connectivity to agri-urban areas further enhances the congruence between the known lekking sites and the areas of high priority (48.7% of known leks falling into the best 20% priority category). We conclude that our approach can be used in several stages of spatial wildlife conservation planning: as a preliminary analysis to find areas subjected to more detailed inventories and modelling, in combination with other analytical tools, or as the main instrument enabling informative use of readily available data in operational large-scale land-use planning. The advantages of our approach include: 1) the ability to execute relatively simple and objective analyses covering wide spatial extents at a high resolution, 2) the possibility to incorporate several ecologically realistic species-specific connectivity components into the analyses, and 3) the potential to help managers target wildlife surveys or conservation and management operations.

AB  - Landscape connectivity has traditionally been studied for animal species rather than for plants, especially under a multispecies approach. However, connectivity can be equally critical for both fauna and flora and, thus, an essential point in the selection of key management areas and measures. This paper explores a spatially explicit framework to assess the contribution of habitat patches in the conservation and enhancement of plant functional connectivity and habitat availability in a multispecies context. It relies on graph theory and a habitat availability index and differentiates between two management scenarios: (i) conservation; and (ii) restoration, by considering current and potential species distribution based on species distribution models together with a vegetation survey. The results mapped at high spatial resolution priority target areas to apply management measures. We found that intervening in a small proportion of the study area may lead to double the average overall landscape connectivity of the studied species. This study aimed at proposing an innovative methodology that allows studying connectivity for multiple plant species at landscape scale while integrating their individual characteristics. The proposed framework is a step toward incorporating connectivity concerns into plant biodiversity management, based on a better understanding of landscape structure and functionality. Here, we illustrated its significant potential for local conservation and restoration planning and resource optimization.

AB  - AimAmong the numerous anthropogenic pressures threatening biodiversity, habitat destruction and climate change are pointed to as dominant. In response, a number of mitigation strategies are elaborated to save endangered living organisms. However, the taxonomic level and geographical extent at which conservation strategies should be designed and implemented remain generally unclear. Here, we aim to assess and discuss the importance to apply conservation strategies at an appropriate taxonomic scale. For this purpose, we focus our analyses on bumblebees (genus Bombus), a group of critically important and endangered pollinators.
   LocationWest-Palaearctic.
   MethodsWe use a species distribution modelling approach to investigate and compare climatic and habitat-related variables associated with the distribution of West-Palaearctic bumblebees. Our analyses are based on a data set gathering more than 125,000 unique observation points for 68 species.
   ResultsWe highlight species-specific associations with climatic and land cover variables, depicting the strong relevance of taxon-specific mitigation strategies for the conservation of those key pollinators. We also identify that the occurrence probability of localized and widespread species is mostly predicted by specific land cover characteristics and climatic conditions, respectively. Finally, we report the general absence of phylogenetic signal associated with the relative importance of each environmental variable in species distribution models, underlining the difficulty to predict species-specific environmental requirements based on evolutionary relationships.
   Main conclusionsIn the light of these results, we conclude that climate change and landscape destruction are not expected to drive the fate of all bumblebee species in a same direction, even for phylogenetically close lineages. We argue in favour of geographically and taxonomically adapted conservation strategies and discuss the limitations of untargeted action plans for species with different climatic/habitat requirements.

AB  - BackgroundReliable information on the distribution of target species and influencing environmental factors is essential for effective conservation management. However, ecologists have often derived data from costly field surveys. The Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides), a vulnerable Anatidae species, winters almost exclusively in China's Yangtze River floodplain, but wintering numbers have been steadily decreasing. To better safeguard this unique species, modern modeling approaches can be used to quantify and predict its suitablewintering habitat. Specifically, a potential wintering distribution map of this species is critically important.MethodsThis study used the maximum entropy approach to model a distribution map of this species. In total, data from 97 up-to-date sites were extracted from 1263 survey sites (excluding duplicate data). After eliminating spatial autocorrelation, 11 environmental variables, including factors related to climate, land structure, vegetation, and anthropogenic activities, were used for model prediction.ResultsThe prediction distribution map shows that the population has concentrated mainly in the boundary area of Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, especially along the Yangtze River. Modeling results suggest that areas within the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain, such as those in Hunan and Hubei provinces and the eastern coastal area of Zhejiang Province, demonstrate a potential level of medium suitability for this species to winter.ConclusionsResults from this study provide fundamental information for the restoration and management of the Swan Goose. Our visualized potential distribution map can assist in planning optimal conservation strategies, and consequently may help to increase the number of wintering populations in China.

AB  - Degradation, fragmentation, and loss of tropical forests has exponentially increased in the last decades leading to unprecedented rates of species extinctions and loss of ecosystems functions and services. Forest restoration is key to recover ecosystems health and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. However, restoring forests at the landscape scale presents many challenges, since it requires balancing conservation goals and economic development. In this study, we used a spatial planning tool (Marxan) to identify priority areas for restoration satisfying multiple objectives across a biological corridor in Costa Rica. Biological corridors are critical conservation instruments promoting forest connectivity while acknowledging human presence. Increasing forest connectivity requires restoration initiatives that will likely conflict with other land uses, some of them of high national economic importance. Our restoration plan sought to maximize the provision of forest-related services (i.e., seed dispersal, tourism and carbon storage) while minimizing the impact on current land uses and thus avoiding potential conflicts. We quantified seed dispersal and tourism services (birdwatching potential) using species distribution models. We used the carbon sequestration model of InVEST to quantify carbon storage potential. We tested different restoration scenarios that differed in whether land opportunity costs of current uses were considered or not when identifying potential restoration areas, or how these costs were estimated. We showed how a landscape-scale forest restoration plan accounting for only forest connectivity and ecosystem service provision capacity can greatly differ from a plan that considers the potential impacts on local livelihoods. Spatial planning tools can assist at designing cost-effective landscape-scale forest restoration plans, identifying priority areas where forest restoration can maximize ecosystem provision and increase forest connectivity. Special care must be paid to the use of adequate estimates of opportunity cost, to avoid potential conflicts between restoration goals and other legitimate land uses.

AB  - The umbrella species concept posits that protection of a single, wide-ranging species may confer protection to a large number of sympatric species. Due to their large home ranges, widespread distribution in the Mesoamerican Biodiversity Hotspot (MBH), and status as the focal species of numerous conservation initiatives, the jaguar Panthera onca is an ideal species to evaluate the umbrella strategy. Alter ground-truthing jaguar corridors from 2009-2016, we tested the umbrella value of jaguars for endemic herpetofauna (Amphibia, Reptilia) in Nuclear Central America (NCA). a similar to 370 000 km(2) sub-region of the MBH. NCA contains the greatest density of threatened reptiles in the Western Hemisphere and harbors extraordinary high diversity of amphibians, the most threatened class of vertebrate worldwide. Of the 304 regional endemics in NCA, the distributions of 187 (61.5 %) species of amphibians and reptiles overlapped ground-truthed jaguar range. The distributions of 14 reptiles, including a critically endangered Bothriechis spp. and two endangered Norops spp., occur exclusively within jaguar distribution. Similarly, the distributions of 19 amphibians, including four critically endangered Craugastor spp. and two critically endangered Plectrohyla spp. occur entirely within jaguar distribution. Our results indicate greater effectiveness of ground-tnnhed jaguar distribution than modeled and randomly selected networks in overlapping the distributions of endemic herpetofauna, especially threatened amphibians, in NCA. Substantiation of multi-taxa dependence on habitat in jaguar distribution would strengthen justification for wider application of the umbrella strategy beyond NCA and aid conservation planning in the MBH.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning requires spatial information on biodiversity. Such information is often unavailable, forcing spatial planning to rely on assumed relationships between species and environmental features. This problem is particularly acute in large, remote marine protected areas that are proliferating rapidly. Here, we use models to predict whether (a) macrobenthic biodiversity across four taxa (gorgonians, soft corals, hard corals, and sponges) with different life histories are congruent within seascape features through regional space; and (b) models generated in an intensively-sampled area in one region can predict the occurrence of habitat-forming macrobenthos in neighboring ones. All four taxa studied showed similar habitat preferences, but high variability in distributions among and within features suggesting factors other than simple geomorphology influence these regional biodiversity patterns. Nonetheless, models derived from one region accurately predicted the presence and absence of the same taxa hundreds of kilometers away. This transferability of models of species occurrences has the potential to deliver improved reserve design in data-deficient regions.

AB  - The Incidence Function Model (IFM) has been put forward as a tool for assessing conservation plans. A key benefit of the IFM is low data requirements: widely available species occurrence data and information about land cover. Citizen science is a promising source of such data; however, to use these data in the IFM there are typically two problems. First, the spatial resolution is too coarse, but existing approaches to downscaling species data tend not to extend to patch level (as required by the IFM). Second, widely available citizen science data typically report species' presences only. We devise ten different downscaling methods based on theoretical ecological relationships (the species-area relationship and the distance decay of similarity), and test them against each other. The better performing downscaling methods were based on patch area, rather than distance from other occupied patches. These methods allow data at a coarse resolution to be used in the IFM for comparing conservation management and development plans. Further field testing is required to establish the degree to which results of these new methods can be treated as definitive spatially-explicit predictions. To address the issue of false absences, we present a method to estimate the probability that all species have been listed (and thus that a species' absence from the list represents a true absence), using the species-accumulation curve. This measure of confidence in absence helps both to objectively identify a habitat network for fitting the IFM, and to target areas for further species recording. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mapping species richness and distributions is an important aspect of conservation and land use planning, but the time and cost of producing maps from field surveys is prohibitive. It is useful, therefore, if mappable environmental variables, from a readily accessible source, can be used as surrogates for species attributes. We evaluated the power of satellite-derived land cover information, from the Land Cover Map of Great Britain, to predict species richness and occurrences of terrestrial mammals in one hundred 10 x 10 km quadrats, from four regions of Britain. The predictive power of the land cover data was relatively poor - with a few exceptions, land cover explained less than half of the variation in mammal species richness and occurrence in regression models. Predictive power was considerably stronger when regions were analyzed separately than when analyzed together, and best fitting models varied between regions and between mammal taxa. Predictive power was also affected (positively or negatively depending on taxon) when PCA-ordinated land cover variables were used as predictors. The predictive strength of the land cover data was probably limited mostly by the high proportion of British mammal species with geographic distributions changing rapidly and independently of land cover (and hence the non-saturation of preferred habitats), and to a lesser extent by shortcomings in the mammal and land cover data, and the influence of landscape factors other than land cover on mammal distributions. The results suggest that regional stratification is essential when attempting to predict species richness and distributions, even across relatively limited areas such as Great Britain. We conclude that caution is necessary in using results from environmental information systems such as this as a basis for conservation and land use planning decisions.

AB  - Aim Understanding species distributions is fundamental to effective conservation planning. Data deficiency is common among rare and imperiled species and poses challenges for conservation planning because status assessments become reliant on scant data that can introduce bias. We used occupancy modelling to evaluate support for commonly accepted, but previously untested, hypotheses regarding factors that drive the occurrence of an imperiled and data-deficient amphibian, the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis). We investigated the potential for mismatch between areas likely to be identified as having high conservation priority based on the common assumption that hellbender occurrence corresponds to areas of high forest cover and those identified by well-informed models.
   Location South-west Virginia, USA.
   Methods We conducted triplicate surveys to detect C. alleganiensis in 49 stream reaches stratified across a land use gradient and two major drainages. We used a Bayesian multimodel framework to investigate factors associated with C. alleganiensis occupancy. We used the best-performing models to predict probability of occupancy at the scale of a 50-m stream reach throughout our study area and identify areas most likely to be occupied.
   Results Occurrence of C. alleganiensis was explained primarily by differences in underlying geology and topography (i.e. physiography) and negative effects of agriculture were only modestly supported. Best-performing models suggested similar to 35% of our study area was occupied. Our findings suggest that predictions from models informed by presence-only data and current land use would likely underestimate C. alleganiensis occupancy by as much as one-third and incorrectly classify over half the currently occupied area to be of little importance to the species.
   Main conclusion Our study highlights the potential danger of assuming that the distribution of data-deficient species can be approximated using untested, but commonly accepted, species-habitat associations.

AB  - Olympic mudminnow (Novumbra hubbsi) is the only endemic freshwater fish species in Washington State and is limited to south-western and northern coastal wetlands there. Population decline has led to its listing as state 'Sensitive', while recent genetic analysis has identified north coast populations as a sub-group of potential concern because of historical isolation and low level of occurrence. Substantial knowledge gaps about the species have made further assessment of conservation status difficult and hampered proactive conservation measures. This article describes a three-tiered approach to evaluate conservation status, comprising: (i) a set of high-priority research questions identified by experts and stakeholders to advance conservation knowledge; (ii) a habitat suitability model to identify environmental factors related to the presence and absence of the species; and (iii) synthesis of information from that suitability model and other research to evaluate status using IUCN Red List criteria. Together these components provide an initial research agenda to guide future management and monitoring. Evidence for an elevated conservation status of Olympic mudminnow across its entire range is mixed, with knowledge about changes in distribution and population over time lacking in many places. The case for enhanced conservation status is strongest for the genetically distinct populations along the northern coast, where suitable habitat is limited and populations highly disjointed. Development of a monitoring network that would detect changes in distribution and abundance of key populations is a central requirement for the conservation of the species, which is threatened by the effects of climate, land use change and invasive species. Involving stakeholders in conservation planning at early stages allows development of robust, practical research questions based on shared data and diverse expertise. This is particularly valuable where species knowledge is highly constrained. These elements produce confidence in implementing research and management actions that are more likely to gain wide acceptance and increase knowledge of conservation status and needs over time.

AB  - Characterized as one of the largest biodiversity hot spots, the Cerrado ecoregion is home to a wide variety of endemic species. Several threats such as agricultural expansion and habitat fragmentation put the species of the Cerrado ecosystems and biodiversity at risk. Thus, this study analysed the genus Eremanthus, which has abundant species in the Cerrado and suffers from intense anthropogenic pressure due to overexploitation, mainly as a material utilized for the construction of fences and the extraction of essential oils. Environmental suitability was estimated for the genus for the present and future (2070), in order to characterize the importance of the climate in the species distribution and to analyse the conservation status of the genus. The Species Distribution Modelling and Gap Analysis showed that the areas of environmental suitability are limited and are found in a matrix composed of a high presence of anthropic activity, which can intensify the loss of species habitat and increase the vulnerability of the group. The studied species were classified as Endangered and Vulnerable according to IUCN criteria, presenting very reduced areas of environmental suitability projected in the future and a low percentage of species in protected areas, that may influence possible species extinctions in the genus. Thus, this study provides insights to assist in conservation planning and reinforces the importance of protecting the biodiversity of the Cerrado.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are essential tools to aid conservation biologists in evaluating the combined effects of environmental change and human activities on natural habitats and for the development of relevant conservation plans. However, modeling species distributions over vast and remote regions is often challenging due to poor and heterogeneous data sets, and this raises questions regarding the relevance of the modeling procedures. In recent years, there have been many methodological developments in SDM procedures using virtual species and broad data sets, but few solutions have been proposed to deal with poor or heterogeneous data. In the present work, we address this methodological challenge by studying the performance of different modeling procedures based on 4 real species, using presence-only data compiled from various oceanographic surveys on the Kerguelen Plateau (Southern Ocean). We followed a practical protocol to test for the reliability and performance of the models and to correct for limited and aggregated data, as well as accounting for spatial and temporal sampling biases. Our results show that producing reliable SDMs is feasible as long as the amount and quality of available data allow testing and correcting for these biases. However, we found that SDMs could be corrected for spatial and temporal heterogeneities in only 1 of the 4 species we examined, highlighting the need to consider all potential biases when modeling species distributions. Finally, we show that model reliability and performance also depend on the interaction between the incompleteness of the data and species niches, with the distribution of narrow-niche species being less sensitive to data gaps than species occupying wider niches.

AB  - Effective species conservation and management requires information on species distribution patterns, which is challenging for highly mobile and cryptic species that may be subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors across international boundaries. Understanding species-habitat relationships can improve the assessment of trends and distribution by explicitly allowing high-resolution data on habitats to inform abundance estimation and the identification of protected areas. In this study, we aggregated an unprecedented set of survey data of a marine top predator, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), collected in the UK (SCANS II, Dogger Bank), Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, to develop seasonal habitat-based density models for the central and southern North Sea. Visual survey data were collected over 9 yr (2005-2013) by means of dedicated line-transect surveys, taking into account the proportion of missed sightings. Generalized additive models of porpoise density were fitted to 156,630 km of on-effort survey data with 14,356 sightings of porpoise groups. Selected predictors included static and dynamic variables, such as depth, distance to shore and to sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) grounds, sea surface temperature (SST), proxies for fronts, and day length. Day length and the spatial distribution of daily SST proved to be good proxies for "season," allowing predictions in both space and time. The density models captured seasonal distribution shifts of porpoises across international boundaries. By combining the large-scale international SCANS II survey with the more frequent, small-scale national surveys, it has been possible to provide seasonal maps that will be used to assist the EU Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives in effectively assessing the conservation status of harbor porpoises. Moreover, our results can facilitate the identification of regions where human activities and disturbances are likely to impact the population and are especially relevant for marine spatial planning, which requires accurate fine-scale maps of species distribution to assess risks of increasing human activities at sea.

AB  - Fagus mexicana Martinez (Mexican beech) is an endangered Arcto-Tertiary Geoflora tree species that inhabit isolated and fragmented tropical montane cloud forests in eastern Mexico. Exploring past, present, and future climate change effects on the distribution of Mexican beech involves the study of spatial ecology and temporal patterns to develop conservation plans. These are key to understanding the niche conservatism of other forest communities with similar environmental requirements. For this study, we used species distribution models by combining occurrence records, to assess the distribution patterns and changes of the past (Last Glacial Maximum), present (1981-2010), and future (2040-2070) periods under two climate scenarios (SSP 3-7.0 & SSP 5-8.5). Next, we determined the habitat suitability and priority conservation areas of Mexican beech as associated with topography, land cover use, distance to the nearest town, and environmental variables. By considering the distribution of Mexican beech during different periods and under different climate scenarios, our study estimated that high-impact areas of Mexican beech forests were restricted to specific areas of the Sierra Madre Oriental that constitute refugia from the Last Glacial Maximum. Regrettably, our results exhibited that Mexican beech distribution has decreased 71.3% since the Last Glacial Maximum and this trend will for the next 50 years, migrating to specific refugia at higher altitudes. This suggests that the states of Hidalgo, Veracruz, and Puebla will preserve the habitat suitability features as ecological refugia, related to high moisture and north-facing slopes. For isolated and difficult-to-access areas, the proposed methods are powerful tools for relict-tree species, which deserve further conservation.

AB  - The riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) is one of the most endangered mammals in the world due to fragmentation of its habitat in the semi-arid Karoo region of South Africa, to which it is endemic. It is an umbrella conservation species for the riparian shrubland associated with the seasonal drainage system of the Karoo, where its presence is an indicator of ecosystem health. In this study, we analysed historical survey data to derive an improved assessment of the current B. monticularis population status and distribution. Geospatial analysis was conducted using geographical information systems, and distribution modelling was performed using Maxent. Extent of occurrence for the species is 54,227 km(2), and area of occupancy is 2943 km(2). Estimates of 157-207 mature individuals confirm an alarmingly small species population size, and it appears that no subpopulation has > 50 mature individuals. Our findings thus support the continued classification of this species as 'critically endangered' under IUCN Red List criteria. However, with most remaining habitat occurring outside of protected areas, and with habitat loss being exacerbated by climate change, a viable conservation plan remains elusive.

AB  - Aim: The practical value of the single-species approach to conserve biodiversity could be minimal or negligible when sympatric species are limited by factors that are not relevant to the proposed umbrella species. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated as follows: (1) habitat suitability and potential movement corridors of a single umbrella species, giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca); (2) habitat suitability of sympatric mammals; and (3) the potential effectiveness of the single-species corridor planning to preserve suitable habitat and its connectivity of other focal species.
   Location: Qinling Mountains, central part of China (15,000 km(2)).
   Methods: We collected species distribution, environmental and anthropogenic data and conducted species occupancy modelling for giant panda and six other sympatric species (i.e., takin Budorcas taxicolor, tufted deer Elaphodus cephalophus, Chinese goral Naemorhedus griseus, Reeve's muntjac Muntiacus reevesi, leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis and yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula). We then conducted circuit models to identify potential corridors for each species and evaluated the effectiveness of giant panda corridors to restore the habitat connectivity for these sympatric mammals.
   Results: Occupancy modelling revealed that each species had a unique set of environmental variables associated with its distribution in the Qinling Mountains. We found that giant panda and all other focal species had some degree of fragmentation to their suitable habitat that required restoring habitat connectivity. Among the eight potential giant panda corridors, conservation efforts to reduce anthropogenic impacts would significantly improve the effectiveness of six corridors, while the other two corridors would require altering the vegetation. Five proposed giant panda corridors had remarkable overlap with corridors proposed for other species. We suggest two giant panda corridors as a priority due to their potential to maximize the benefits to both giant panda and a broader suite of mammals.
   Main conclusions: Corridor planning in this region of China will likely continue using the single-species policy, but our results highlight that not all potential giant panda corridors have equal effectiveness for other wildlife species. When offered multiple alternative actions, conservation planners can prioritize corridor development based on a multispecies perspective without loss of connectivity for the priority species. This approach has strong implications to the conservation of wildlife communities in China, and elsewhere, where conservation plans developed for a single-species garner most available funding and institutional support.

AB  - Aim Maintaining biodiversity in the face of land use and climate change is a paramount challenge, particularly when distributions of many species remain incompletely known. Emerging technologies help address this data deficiency by facilitating the collection of spatially explicit data for multiple species from multiple taxa. In this study, we combine acoustic and visual sensor surveys to inform conservation and land use planning in an area experiencing rapid climate and land use change. Location Mojave Desert, California, United States. Methods We deployed camera traps and acoustic detectors at 210 sites between March and July 2016. We identified photographic detections of mammals and acoustic recordings of songbirds to the species level and used multispecies occupancy models to estimate and evaluate species' occupancy probabilities. We then extrapolated model results to the region and forecasted how projected climate and land use changes might affect species' occupancy probabilities in 50 years. Lastly, we identified areas with high conservation value (i.e., high relative species richness) now and in 50 years, and related the distributions of these areas to land use designations. Results We detected 15 mammal and 68 songbird species. At the community level, occupancy decreased with increasing temperatures and distances to woodlands. We forecasted that occupancy probabilities and areas with high conservation value would decline in 50 years due to projected increases in maximum temperatures and identified that up to 43%, 24% and 27% of land designated for renewable energy development, recreation and military activities, respectively, encompassed these high value areas. Main conclusions Cooler areas close to woodlands and water are of high conservation value to mammals and songbirds in the Mojave. These areas will become increasingly limited with changing climate, however, making their protection from human disturbance imperative. We encourage continued use of visual and acoustic sensors across large spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales as tools to inform land use and wildlife conservation.

AB  - Global conservation prioritization usually emphasizes areas with highest species richness or where many species are thought to be at imminent risk of extinction. However, these strategies may overlook areas where many species have biological traits that make them particularly sensitive to future human impact but are not yet threatened because such impact is currently low. In this article, we identify such areas for the world's mammals using latent extinction risk, the discrepancy between a species' current extinction risk and that predicted from models on the basis of biological traits. Species with positive latent risk are currently less threatened than their biology would suggest, usually because they inhabit regions or habitats still comparatively unmodified by human activity. Using large new geographic, biological, and phylogenetic databases for nearly 4,000 mammal species, we map the global geographic distribution of latent risk to reveal areas where the mammal fauna is still relatively unthreatened but has high inherent sensitivity to disturbance. These hotspots include large areas such as the Nearctic boreal forests and tundra that are unrepresented in most current prioritization schemes, as well as high-biodiversity areas such as the island arc from Indonesia to the south Pacific. Incorporating latent extinction risk patterns into conservation planning could help guard against future biodiversity loss by anticipating and preventing species declines before they begin.

AB  - Only a few studies have shown positive impacts of ecological compensation on species dynamics affected by human activities. We argue that this is due to inappropriate methods used to forecast required compensation in environmental impact assessments. These assessments are mostly descriptive and only valid at limited spatial and temporal scales. However, habitat suitability models developed to predict the impacts of environmental changes on potential species' distributions should provide rigorous science-based tools for compensation planning. Here we describe the two main classes of predictive models: correlative models and individual-based mechanistic models. We show how these models can be used alone or synoptically to improve compensation planning. While correlative models are easier to implement, they tend to ignore underlying ecological processes and lack accuracy. On the contrary, individual-based mechanistic models can integrate biological interactions, dispersal ability and adaptation. Moreover, among mechanistic models, those considering animal energy balance are particularly efficient at predicting the impact of foraging habitat loss. However, mechanistic models requiremore field data compared to correlative models. Hence we present two approaches which combine both methods for compensation planning, especially in relation to the spatial scale considered. We show how the availability of biological databases and software enabling fast and accurate population projections could be advantageously used to assess ecological compensation requirement efficiently in environmental impact assessments.

AB  - Detecting the determinants of spatiotemporal distribution are important, along with the identification of drivers for the decline of the species, for ecological conservation and restoration. Here, we applied maximum entropy (Maxent)-type species-distribution modeling to investigate current and future potential distributions of an endangered canopy tree, Shorea robusta C. F. Gaertn. (Dipterocarpaceae) in Purbachal, Bangladesh. The model was constructed using 280 location records covering the entire range of S. robusta, with nine environmental variables related to climate, geography, and soil conditions included. Two scenarios [representative concentration pathways (RCPs): 4.5 and 8.5] were used to predict altered S. robusta distribution due to climate change. The precision of predicted distributions was supported sufficiently by the binomial test of omission (similar to P = 0.00) and area under the curve analysis (0.79-0.89). The current distributions were mostly determined by precipitation and soil nitrogen. Maxent modeling predicted that the suitable area for S. robusta forests will decline by 21% and 24% (Global Climate Models) and 26% and 28% (Regional Climate Models) relative to the present area according to ACCESS1-0 and CCSM4, respectively, under RCP8.5 by 2070 due to temperature rise, precipitation variability, seasonal dryness, and drought stress. These results showed that precipitation and soil nitrogen are important predictors of the current distribution and conservation of S. robusta forests. Furthermore, our results accentuate the potential negative impact of climate change, thereby encouraging further development of conservation and restoration plans for S. robusta by identifying suitable habitats in the region.

AB  - Climate change may increase plant invasion risk, but few studies have paid attention to the relationship between climate change and plant invasion in conservation areas at a global scale. The primary objective of our study was to determine whether climate change would allow or even increase the likelihood that invasive alien plant species would invade conservation areas across the world and in particular regions. We modeled current and future potential distributions of invasive alien plant species using bioclimatic variables in the program Maxent. Our study found that global climate change would not lead to plant invasions in every conservation area, but it would provide the conditions for few invasive plant species to impact conservation areas in some regions. Greenhouse gas concentrations could aggravate the regional invasion of invasive plant species and make larger changes of ability of invasive plant species to invade conservation areas in low gas concentration scenario than high gas concentration scenario. Immediate measures must be taken to deal with this problem, such as developing global indicators of biological invasion and designing long-term management plans at different geographical scales.

AB  - We tested the prediction that climate-driven changes might alter bird species composition in reserves of the Cerrado region of Brazil. First, we modelled the current distributions and the potential future projections of 38 endemic or rare bird species. We used eight modelling techniques within the BIOMOD computational framework in an ensemble-forecasting approach to reach a consensus scenario. Then we compared current and future (2046-2060) distributions under different scenarios (reserve size and bird dispersal) with the current Brazilian reserve system to assess the adequacy of protection (representation) of each species and detect gaps in their protection. Finally, to identify areas with high probability of occurrence of several species, we calculated cumulative climatic suitability of all 38 species for both current and future scenarios. None of the 38 species is covered under any current or future scenarios, revealing that the current reserve system is highly inefficient in conserving the analyzed bird species. The implementation of new reserves to cover species in current and future climate scenarios is recommended in areas in the south-eastern part of the Cerrado region and in the mountains of east Brazil. Due to the already high land use of the southeast region of the Cerrado, the application of non-traditional conservation measures should be evaluated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The leading causes of the worldwide decline in biodiversity are global warming, allied with natural habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we propose an analysis of the synergistic effects of these two factors in 63 species of Amazonian lizards. We predicted that the high-climatic suitability areas of species would be significantly impacted by different deforestation scenarios and the resultant landscape structure and considered that forest-dwelling species would be especially susceptible to deforestation scenarios. We also pointed out species threatened by both drivers and suggested critical areas for their future conservation. According to our results, most species will face future reductions in suitable areas for their occurrence according to five different patterns, two of which represent significant risks for 15 species. Some of these species already deal with severe habitat loss and fragmentation of their current distribution ranges, whereas others will suffer a considerable area reduction related to future range shifts. We emphasize the importance of protected areas (PAs), especially indigenous lands, and the need to plan combined strategies involving PAs' maintenance and possible implementation of ecological corridors. Finally, we highlight eight species of thermoconformer lizards that constitute present and future conservation concerns related to the combined effects of climate change and habitat loss and that should be carefully evaluated in extinction risk assessments.

AB  - ContextLight pollution can alter animal movements and landscape connectivity. This is particularly true in urban landscapes where a need to incorporate conservation issues in urban planning is urgent.ObjectivesWe investigated how potential light-reduction scenarios at conurbation scale change landscape connectivity for bats.MethodsThrough random stratified sampling and species distribution modelling, we assessed the relative importance of light pollution on bat presence probability and activity. We recorded bats during one entire night on each 305 sampling points in 2015. In 2016, we surveyed 94 supplementary points to evaluate models performance. We used our spatial predictions to characterize landscape resistance to bat movements. Then we applied a least-cost modelling approach to identify nocturnal corridors and estimated the impact of five light-reduction scenarios on landscape connectivity for two light non-tolerant bat species.ResultsWe found that light pollution detected from satellite images was a good predictor of bat presence and activity up to 700m radius. Our results exhibited contrasting responses to average radiance: M. daubentonii responded negatively, P. nathusii had a positive response for low values then a negative response after a threshold radiance value of 20W.m(-2).sr(-1) and E. serotinus responded positively. Five and four light-reduction scenarios significantly improved landscape connectivity for M. daubentonii and P. nathusii respectively.ConclusionsLight-reduction measures should be included in urban planning to provide sustainable conditions for bats in cities. We advocate for the use of our methodological approach to further studies to find the best trade-off between conservation needs and social acceptability.

AB  - Identification of species' Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) is fundamental to conservation planning and species distribution models (SDMs) are a powerful tool commonly used to do this. Presence-only data are increasingly being used to develop SDMs to aid the conservation decision-making process. The application of presence-only SDMs for marine species' is particularly attractive due to often logistical and economic costs of obtaining systematic species' distribution data. However, robust model validation is important for conservation management applications that require accurate and reliable species' occurrence data (e.g., spatially explicit risk assessments). This is commonly done using a random subset of the data and less commonly with fully independent test data. Here, we apply a spatial block cross-validation (CV) approach to validate a MaxEnt presence-only model using independent presence/absence survey data for a highly mobile, marine species (humpback whale,Megaptera novaengliae) in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). A MaxEnt model was developed using opportunistic whale sightings (2003-2007) and then used to identify areas differing in habitat suitability (low, medium, high) to conduct a systematic, line-transect, aerial survey (2012) and derive a density surface model. A spatial block CV buffering strategy was used to validate the MaxEnt model, using the opportunistic sightings as training data and independent aerial survey sightings data as test data. Moderate performance measures indicate MaxEnt was reliable in identifying the distribution patterns of a mobile whale species on their breeding ground, indicated by areas of high density aligned to areas of high habitat suitability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MaxEnt models can be useful and cost-effective for designing a sampling scheme to undertake systematic surveys that significantly reduces sampling effort. In this study, higher quality information on whale reproductive class (calf vs. non-calf groups) was obtained that the presence-only data lacked, while sampling only 18% of the GBR World Heritage Area. The validation approach using fully independent data provides greater confidence in the MaxEnt model, which indicates significant overlap with the main breeding ground of humpback whales and the inner shipping route. This is important when evaluating presence-only models within certain conservation management applications, such as spatial risk assessments.

AB  - Biologists who develop and apply habitat models are often familiar with the statistical challenges posed by their data's spatial structure but are unsure of whether the use of complex spatial models will increase the utility of model results in planning. We compared the relative performance of nonspatial and hierarchical Bayesian spatial models for three vertebrate and invertebrate taxa of conservation concern (Church's sideband snails [Monadenia churchi], red tree voles [Arborimus longicaudus], and Pacific fishers [Martes pennanti pacifica]) that provide examples of a range of distributional extents and dispersal abilities. We used presence-absence data derived from regional monitoring programs to develop models with both landscape and site-level environmental covariates. We used Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and a conditional autoregressive or intrinsic conditional autoregressive model framework to fit spatial models. The fit of Bayesian spatial models was between 35 and 55% better than the fit of nonspatial analogue models. Bayesian spatial models outperformed analogous models developed with maximum entropy (Maxent) methods. Although the best spatial and nonspatial models included similar environmental variables, spatial models provided estimates of residual spatial effects that suggested how ecological processes might structure distribution patterns. Spatial models built from presence-absence data improved fit most for localized endemic species with ranges constrained by poorly known biogeographic factors and for widely distributed species suspected to be strongly affected by unmeasured environmental variables or population processes. By treating spatial effects as a variable of interest rather than a nuisance, hierarchical Bayesian spatial models, especially when they are based on a common broad-scale spatial lattice (here the national Forest Inventory and Analysis grid of 24 km2 hexagons), can increase the relevance of habitat models to multispecies conservation planning.

AB  - Background and research aims. The Andean paramo is renowned for its unique biodiversity and sensitivity to environmental threats. However, vulnerability assessments remain scarce, which hinders our capacity to prioritize and apply efficient conservation measures. To this end, we established the Red List of the paramo vascular flora from the Nevados National Natural Park and proposed conservation strategies for its threatened species. Methods. We performed International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessments by evaluating Criterion B, including sub-criteria B1-Extent of Occurrence and B2-Area of Occupancy, and using a systematic geographic-ecological approach for conditions a (Location analysis) and b (Continuing decline). We then executed a Conservation Gap Analysis to prioritize species for in-situ and/or ex-situ conservation. Results. Summing our 233 evaluated species with previous assessments, we completed the Red List of 262 paramo species and encountered 3% Threatened (7 VU, one EN), 44% Not Threatened (65 LC, 50 NT), and 53% Data Deficient. We acknowledged Lupinus ruizensis as Endangered and Aequatorium jamesonii, Carex jamesonii, Elaphoglossum cuspidatum, Miconia latifolia, Miconia alborosea, Pentacalia gelida, and Themistoclesia mucronata as Vulnerable. Conclusion. The eight threatened species should be included as target species in the PNN Nevados management plan 2023-2028 and regarded as national conservation priorities. Implications for Conservation. We recommend in-situ conservation for Medium-Priority species A. jamesonii, E. cuspidatum, and T. mucronata with thorough monitoring, paired with sub-population transfers for High-Priority species C. jamesonii. For the endemic L. ruizensis and P. gelida, we suggest combined in-situ/ex-situ strategies taking advantage of national germoplasm collections, like the seed bank of the Bogota Botanical Garden Jose Celestino Mutis.

AB  - Background: For prioritising practical conservation measures in areas of high endemic plant diversity, a fine-scale hierarchy of sites needs to be established. In this context, conservation sites designed at local and regional levels are considered a network of interconnected areas.Aims: The main aim was to identify two hierarchical levels of a network of conservation sites, called micro hotspots' and nano hotspots', and test their efficiency for achieving conservation objectives across the island of Sardinia, Mediterranean Basin.Methods: We analysed the spatial distribution of endemic vascular plant species (EVPS) richness. Additionally, the area, perimeter, connectivity and surplus costs for the protection of all endemic plant populations were used as ranking criteria for a hierarchical classification.Results: We identified eight micro hotspots and 82 nano hotspots. Amongst the three possible solutions compared, the integrated network of micro and nano hotspots resulted in more effective conservation than any of the single-level network solutions with only micro or nano hotspots, and it included 89% of all EVPS in a relatively small areal extent.Conclusions: The identification of hotspot networks at the regional level allowed determining priority areas to implement conservation efforts for EVPS. The integration of micro hotspots with nano hotspots resulted in the most effective network from both conservation and economic perspectives. We suggest that our model may provide an effective tool for integrated and effective conservation actions in the Mediterranean Basin.

AB  - Many wader populations around the world are declining as a consequence of habitat degradation or loss. It is therefore important to identify species-specific habitat demands accurately and to define the important factors explaining species distribution, in order to develop tools that can be used in conservation planning. The aim of this study is to create reliable, functional and ecologically interpretable predictive distribution models for five breeding wader species.
   The archipelago of SW Finland in the Baltic Sea.
   We used multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to create single-species and multiresponse distribution models based on 525 study islands and 12 abiotic and biotic environmental variables. Model evaluation was carried out on independent data not used in model building (100 + 116 islands). The models were tested for discrimination with receiver-operating characteristic statistics and for calibration with Millers calibration statistics (MCS).
   The single-species models for the turnstone (Arenaria interpres), redshank (Tringa totanus) and oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) showed good predictive abilities, regarding both discrimination and calibration, when evaluated on independent data. The multiresponse models for the less prevalent species, common sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) and the common ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula) had better discriminative abilities than the single-species models. The most influential predictor overall was occurrence of small larids. Exposure, area of forest and low and flat areas were also important, as well as shore habitats.
   We found that the ability of MARS to fit non-linear and multiresponse models makes it a useful method to quantitatively relate species occurrence to environmental characteristics of a complex environment.

AB  - The crocodile lizard, Shinisaurus crocodilurus AHL, 1930, is a monotypic taxon, restricted in occurrence to southern China and northern Vietnam. Wild populations are presently suffering tremendous declines, mainly due to illegal poaching, habitat destruction, and fragmentation, which already led to the extinction of populations in Guangxi and Hunan provinces in China. In order to accelerate the discovery of so far unknown populations of S. crocodilurus and to identify suitable priority areas for conservation strategies, we determined the species' potential distribution using correlative species distribution models (SDMs) based on locality records and a set of satellite-based environmental predictors. In addition, we evaluated the coverage of the species' potential distribution with designated protected areas according to IUCN standards. The resulting SDM revealed potentially suitable habitats to be scattered and disconnected while being very small in size. Moreover, present coverage with nature reserves is extremely poor, underlining the urgent need for improved habitat protection measures and potential population restoration of S. crocodilurus.

AB  - Remediation prioritization frequently falls short of systematically evaluating the underlying ecological value of different sites. This study presents a novel approach to delineating sites that are both contaminated by any of eight heavy metals and have high habitat value to high-priority species. The conservation priority of each planning site herein was based on the projected distributions of eight protected bird species, simulated using 900 outputs of species distribution models (SDMs) and the subsequent application of a systematic conservation tool. The distributions of heavy metal concentrations were generated using a geostatistical joint-simulation approach. The uncertainties in the heavy metal distributions were quantified in terms of variability among 1000 realization sets. Finally, a novel remediation decision-making approach was presented for delineating contaminated sites in need of remediation based on the spatial uncertainties of multiple realizations and the priorities of conservation areas. The results thus obtained demonstrate that up to 42% of areas of high conservation priority are also contaminated by one or more of the heavy metal contaminants of interest. Moreover, as the proportion of the land for proposed remediated increased, the projected area of the pollution-free habitat also increased. Overall uncertainty, in terms of the false positive contamination rate, also increased. These results indicate that the proposed decision-making approach successfully accounted for the intrinsic trade-offs among a high number of pollution-free habitats, low false positive rates and robustness of expected decision outcomes.

AB  - A thorough understanding of biodiversity status and trends through time is necessary for decision-making at regional, national, and subnational levels. Information readily available in databases allows for development of scenarios of species distribution in relation to habitat changes. Existing species occurrence data are biased towards some taxonomic groups (especially vertebrates), and are more complete for Europe and North America than for the rest of the world. We outline a procedure for development of such biodiversity scenarios using available data on species distribution derived from primary biodiversity data and habitat conditions, and analytical software, which allows estimation of species' distributions, and forecasting of likely effects of various agents of change on the distribution and status of the same species. Such approaches can translate into improved knowledge for countries regarding the 2010 Biodiversity Target of reducing significantly the rate of biodiversity loss-indeed, using methodologies such as those illustrated herein, many countries should be capable of analyzing trends of change for at least part of their biodiversity. Sources of errors that are present in primary biodiversity data and that can affect projections are discussed.

AB  - Assessing a species' threatened status and then developing specific conservation strategies accordingly rely heavily on knowing that species' complete and accurate spatial distribution. In this study, we used the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) in China to represent a large threatened species for which distribution information is limited and spatially biased. We grouped the two main sources of black bear occurrence data into two different resolutions: (1) coarse resolution data corresponding specific management units (e.g., nature reserves) that cover large areas, and (2) fine resolution data composed of longitude and latitude records that were bias in their geographic range. Our distribution mapping approach integrated those two data types to examine black bear spatial patterns across the country. We used both presence and absence data in the Random Forest algorithm to predict black bear distribution at coarse (30 km) and fine (3 km) resolutions, and then refined the coarse-scale prediction with the fine-scale prediction using a map fusion technique based on the Bayes theorem. We thus generated an integrated high resolution range map that was both more accurate than the coarse-scale map and more representative of the black bear geographic range than was the fine-scale map. Our results showed that the total estimated range of Asiatic black bears in China was 462.3 x 10(3) km(2), 77.50% less than the most recent IUCN range map and 70.90% less than the area of habitat (AOH) estimation. Using those results, we identified two island and six mainland management units in China and, based on the predicted habitat conditions, proposed specific conservation strategies for each unit. Our study results provide practical knowledge and pragmatic guidance for future conservation planning and action for this species, and our framework provides an example and template for range estimations of species with similar types of occurrence records.

AB  - Taxonomic and geographic biases in ecological research are widely recognised. In addition, information bias within a species can impact our understanding of their biology. This can lead to an underestimation of potential intra-or inter-population level variation and plasticity, and incomplete inferences about species response curves across environmental gradients. The consequences of these 'species stereotypes' are misestimation of the potential niche and narrow, potentially biased, views of habitat and diet preferences. For example, species may be characterised as ecologically static, or a habitat, diet, or prey 'specialist'. Several factors can contribute to the formation of a 'stereotype', including a focus on extant populations, or a subset of them, that only partially represent the full historical distribution of a species, and an emphasis on species interactions derived from a small number of potential communities. Such species stereotypes are likely widespread and impact on many taxa. These misconceptions can have knock-on effects for conservation programmes and lead to ineffective or harmful conservation interventions such as actively managing species in marginal habitats, not identifying key threats and incorrect predictions of vulnerability to environmental change. Recognising biases is vital to addressing these potential problems and providing accurate information for conservation programmes. Biases can be identified by evaluating historical distributions, translocations within historical distributions, developing mechanistic distribution models and assessing traditional ecological knowledge. We suggest that explicit assessment of biases and potential stereotypes are included in red listing or species assessments, biodiversity action plans, and protected area network design and evaluation.

AB  - It is generally assumed that gathering more data is a good investment for conservation planning. However, the benefits of additional data have seldom been evaluated by analyzing the return on investment. If there are diminishing returns in terms of improved planning, then resources might be better directed toward other actions, depending on their relative costs and benefits. Our aim was to determine the return on investment from spending different amounts on survey data before undertaking a program of implementing new protected areas. We estimated how much protea data is obtained as a function of dollars invested in surveying. We then simulated incremental protection and loss of habitat to determine the benefit of investment in that data on the protection of proteas. We found that, after an investment of only US$ 100,000 (similar to 780,000 South Africa Rand [ZAR]), there was little increase in the effectiveness of conservation prioritizations, despite the full data set costing at least 25 times that amount.

AB  - Over the past decades, global environmental changes have led to unfavorable effects on migratory birds. However, many species that encounter climate change are listed as least concern by International Union for Conservation of Nature. Using species distribution models, we quantified the redistributions of breeding and wintering sites of oriental honey buzzards, OHB (Pernis ptilorhynchus), a long-distance migratory raptor that often preys on the larvae of wasps and bees under changing climate based on shared socio-economic pathways scenarios. We also incorporated climate and land use risks based on climate anomalies and vegetation dynamics to assess future conservation strategies. The results revealed a significant range contraction on the wintering and breeding areas of the OHB species by 2050 and 2100. Our results suggest that the migration distance will likely increase under all scenarios. In addition, we found many high-risk areas across OHB habitats while refugia areas were relatively only covered a small proportion. Habitat restoration and developing new protected areas become a fundamental strategy for OHB conservation. Our approaches have provided comprehensive insights into broad biogeographic dynamics under multifaceted threats and how to tackle global changes through the specific landscape management for long-distance migrants.

AB  - The continuing decline and loss of biodiversity has caused an increase in the use of interventionist conservation tools, such as translocation. However, many translocation attempts fail to establish viable populations, with poor release site selection often flagged as an inhibitor of success. We used species distribution models (SDMs) to predict the climate suitability of 102 release sites for amphibians, reptiles, and terrestrial insects and compared suitability predictions between successful and failed attempts. We then quantified the importance of climate suitability relative to 5 other variables frequently considered in the literature as important determinants of translocation success: number of release years, number of individuals released, life stage released, origin of the source population, and position of the release site relative to the species' range. Probability of translocation success increased as predicted climate suitability increased and this effect was the strongest among the variables we considered, accounting for 48.3% of the variation in translocation outcome. These findings should encourage greater consideration of climate suitability when selecting release sites for conservation translocations and we advocate the use of SDMs as an effective way to do this.

AB  - Amphibians are among the most threatened taxonomic groups worldwide. A fundamental step in species conservation is identifying the habitat requirements of the target species. However, this determination can often be problematic in endangered species because, by definition, they often only occupy a very limited number of sites. Moreover, when found, they are often in low abundance, and thus their detectability is low, yielding false "absence" data. Maximum entropy niche modeling provides a tool using only the presence data to predict potential habitat distributions of endangered species whose distributions have become highly limited. We provide two examples in the current study for the fire salamander, Salamandra infraimmaculata, and the green toad, Bufo viridis. S. infraimmaculata is considered endangered in Israel and near endangered worldwide. B. viridis is classified as locally endangered in Israel. Soil type was the most important predictor of the distribution of S. infraimmaculata and, to a lesser extent, also predicted the distribution of B. viridis. In addition, S. infraimmaculata larvae were also associated with high elevation areas. B. viridis was negatively associated with distance to urban areas and low solar radiation level. The potential distribution maps determined for S. infraimmaculata and B. viridis can help in planning future wetland use management around its existing populations, discovering new populations, identifying top-priority survey sites, or set priorities to restore its natural habitat for more effective conservation.

AB  - Given the rate of projected environmental change for the 21st century, urgent adaptation and mitigation measures are required to slow down the on-going erosion of biodiversity. Even though increasing evidence shows that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species' range shifts, changes in phenology and species' extinctions, accurate projections of species' responses to future environmental changes are more difficult to ascertain. This is problematic, since there is a growing awareness of the need to adopt proactive conservation planning measures using forecasts of species' responses to future environmental changes.
   There is a substantial body of literature describing and assessing the impacts of various scenarios of climate and land-use change on species' distributions. Model predictions include a wide range of assumptions and limitations that are widely acknowledged but compromise their use for developing reliable adaptation and mitigation strategies for biodiversity. Indeed, amongst the most used models, few, if any, explicitly deal with migration processes, the dynamics of population at the "trailing edge" of shifting populations, species' interactions and the interaction between the effects of climate and land-use.
   In this review, we propose two main avenues to progress the understanding and prediction of the different processes A occurring on the leading and trailing edge of the species' distribution in response to any global change phenomena. Deliberately focusing on plant species, we first explore the different ways to incorporate species' migration in the existing modelling approaches, given data and knowledge limitations and the dual effects of climate and land-use factors. Secondly, we explore the mechanisms and processes happening at the trailing edge of a shifting species' distribution and how to implement them into a modelling approach. We finally conclude this review with clear guidelines on how such modelling improvements will benefit conservation strategies in a changing world. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

AB  - In spite of its importance in nation-wide conservation planning, comprehensive information on geographic distribution of threatened plants in India is lacking. Even the threat status of these plants is ambiguous and the country's effort to conserve them is not widely known. A critical analysis of these aspects is essential for identifying gaps in threatened plant conservation. Keeping these in view, we present a review of the existing knowledge on geographic distribution pattern of threatened plants of India, their threat status, and conservation action undertaken to recover these species. Using the available data, we unravel patterns of distribution of these threatened plants in different states of India. When ranking of the families was done based on the total number of species under different threat categories, Orchidaceae (644), Fabaceae (185), Poaceae (164), Rubiaceae (103), Asteraceae (88), Euphorbiaceae (72), Asclepiadaceae (62) and Acanthaceae (60) constituted more than half of the total threatened plant species of India. A review on conservation efforts so far undertaken in different parts of the country revealed that the biodiversity-rich phytogeographic regions such as the Himalayas, North East India, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands had lesser conservation efforts in comparison to the Western Ghats, Vindhyas and Peninsular regions of India. The skewed distribution of threatened plants in different states did not truly reflect their absolute presence or absence; rather it is the result of incomplete survey because of the difficult geomorphological and associated geo-climatic conditions, tough terrain and remote locations. In addition, the current data on threatened plants suffer from methodological shortcomings such as classification without using the population data that are so crucial in modern day threat classification, and lack of long-term observational data. The review emphasizes the use of modern tools such as ecological niche modelling for population inventory, area of occupancy and extent of occurrence, and trends in population size and regeneration for precise threat classification conforming to globally accepted methods (e.g. IUCN version 3.1). The works undertaken through the support of Department of Biotechnology, GoI for conservation of 156 threatened plant species under different disciplines of conservation biology during the past three decades have also been compiled and reviewed. A successfully tested protocol following an integrated approach for threatened species conservation is recommended for future conservation action.

AB  - Most species face multiple anthropogenic disruptions. Few studies have quantified the cumulative influence of multiple threats on species of conservation concern, and far fewer have quantified the potential relative value of multiple conservation interventions in light of these threats. We linked spatial distribution and population viability models to explore conservation interventions under projected climate change, urbanization, and changes in fire regime on a long-lived obligate seeding plant species sensitive to high fire frequencies, a dominant plant functional type in many fire-prone ecosystems, including the biodiversity hotspots of Mediterranean-type ecosystems. First, we investigated the relative risk of population decline for plant populations in landscapes with and without land protection under an existing habitat conservation plan. Second, we modeled the effectiveness of relocating both seedlings and seeds from a large patch with predicted declines in habitat area to 2 unoccupied recipient patches with increasing habitat area under 2 projected climate change scenarios. Finally, we modeled 8 fire return intervals (FRIs) approximating the outcomes of different management strategies that effectively control fire frequency. Invariably, long-lived obligate seeding populations remained viable only when FRIs were maintained at or above a minimum level. Land conservation and seedling relocation efforts lessened the impact of climate change and land-use change on obligate seeding populations to differing degrees depending on the climate change scenario, but neither of these efforts was as generally effective as frequent translocation of seeds. While none of the modeled strategies fully compensated for the effects of land-use and climate change, an integrative approach managing multiple threats may diminish population declines for species in complex landscapes. Conservation plans designed to mitigate the impacts of a single threat are likely to fail if additional threats are ignored.

AB  - Here we develop a framework to design multi-species monitoring networks using species distribution models and conservation planning tools to optimize the location of monitoring stations to detect potential range shifts driven by climate change. For this study, we focused on seven bat species in Northern Portugal (Western Europe). Maximum entropy modelling was used to predict the likely occurrence of those species under present and future climatic conditions. By comparing present and future predicted distributions, we identified areas where each species is likely to gain, lose or maintain suitable climatic space. We then used a decision support tool (the Marxan software) to design three optimized monitoring networks considering: a) changes in species likely occurrence, b) species conservation status, and c) level of volunteer commitment. For present climatic conditions, species distribution models revealed that areas suitable for most species occur in the north-eastern part of the region. However, areas predicted to become climatically suitable in the future shifted towards west. The three simulated monitoring networks, adaptable for an unpredictable volunteer commitment, included 28, 54 and 110 sampling locations respectively, distributed across the study area and covering the potential full range of conditions where species range shifts may occur. Our results show that our framework outperforms the traditional approach that only considers current species ranges, in allocating monitoring stations distributed across different categories of predicted shifts in species distributions. This study presents a straightforward framework to design monitoring schemes aimed specifically at testing hypotheses about where and when species ranges may shift with climatic changes, while also ensuring surveillance of general population trends.

AB  - Current distribution records for Batrisodes texanus Chandler have become more refined since the species was federally listed as endangered in the United States almost 30 years ago. Distribution and range records are compiled from a variety of sources, including dedicated surveys of karst biota in various preserves in Williamson County, Texas, and karst feature investigations triggered by development requirements established for compliance with the Endangered Species Act. The species range is determined by factors not considered in current delineations generated in 1992 of karst fauna regions that serve as a model for de facto recovery units used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Current recovery unit delineations might inhibit official downlisting of species despite significant existing and planned conservation efforts. This untenable situation probably is the direct result of improper boundary placement between recovery units; the authors recommend modifying a single recovery unit boundary to better reflect the distribution of the species as determined by in situ field surveys. The authors recommend modifying the recovery unit system to include the entire range of the species within a single recovery unit.

AB  - Climate variability is the most influential driver altering the natural habitats of species leading to worldwide biodiversity loss. Understanding the climatic niche of vulnerable species and predicting its shift due to impending climate change is highly important to assess the damage. It also helps to plan and implement long term ex-situ or in-situ strategies to protect the species and its fragile habitats. Though, various important species of Himalayas are exploited for their economic and medicinal benefits, yet the impact of climate change on species have not been efficiently documented. Present study, is an attempt to understand the impact of climate vulnerability on habitat suitability of Hippophae salicifolia, a multipurpose species that grows particularly on the riparian fronts of river Ganga in Central Himalayas, using species distribution modeling. The Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model with field observed occurrence locations of the species and CMIP5 (Couple Model Inter-comparison Project) derived bioclimatic variables were used for the study. The predictions were done on the geographic area of Central Himalayas in Uttarakhand state of India according to four IPCC RCPs (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, Representative Concentration Pathways) for the future periods 2050 and 2070. Our results show that the estimated potential (threshold-1) area along the riparian fronts is around 2050 km(2) for the current period. Whereas, for the future years, the suitable area is likely to be lost by 87% for all climate change scenarios making H. salicifolia highly vulnerable in it' s actual habitats. An upward shift in the habitat of the species by 1700 m amsl (2800-4500 m amsl) is also predicted. Shift of species from its micro-habitats due to climate reflects unusual patterns and demands the vital need of applying climate adaptive management for habitat conservation. Present study presents a baseline database for broad-scale applicability of riparian front restoration for species conservation.

AB  - Species distribution models have been used to predict the distribution of invasive species for conservation planning. Understanding spatial transferability of niche predictions is critical to promote species-habitat conservation and forecasting areas vulnerable to invasion. Grain size of predictor variables is an important factor affecting the accuracy and transferability of species distribution models. Choice of grain size is often dependent on the type of predictor variables used and the selection of predictors sometimes rely on data availability. This study employed the MAXENT species distribution model to investigate the effect of the grain size on model transferability for an invasive plant species. We modelled the distribution of Rhododendron ponticum in Wales, U.K. and tested model performance and transferability by varying grain size (50 m, 300 m, and 1 km). MAXENT-based models are sensitive to grain size and selection of variables. We found that over-reliance on the commonly used bioclimatic variables may lead to less accurate models as it often compromises the finer grain size of biophysical variables which may be more important determinants of species distribution at small spatial scales. Model accuracy is likely to increase with decreasing grain size. However, successful model transferability may require optimization of model grain size.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Climate change is one of the most significant drivers of habitat loss and species extinction, particularly montane endemic species such as Juniper trees, which are restricted to unique habitats. Therefore, assessing the impact of climate change on the extinction risk of species is a promising tool or guide for species conservation planning. The loss in species habitat due to global warming indicates the level of extinction or endangerment. Predictions of suitable habitats are outputs from assessment analysis. This will help conservationists discover new populations of endemic species and help raise the awareness of local people to save and rescue these endangered species.
   Climate change is an important driver of biodiversity loss and extinction of endemic montane species. In China, three endemic Juniperus spp. (Juniperus pingii var. pingii, J. tibetica, and J. komarovii) are threatened and subjected to the risk of extinction. This study aimed to predict the potential distribution of these three Juniperus species under climate change and dispersal scenarios, to identify critical drivers explaining their potential distributions, to assess the extinction risk by estimating the loss percentage in their area of occupancy (AOO), and to identify priority areas for their conservation in China. We used ensemble modeling to evaluate the impact of climate change and project AOO. Our results revealed that the projected AOOs followed a similar trend in the three Juniperus species, which predicted an entire loss of their suitable habitats under both climate and dispersal scenarios. Temperature annual range and isothermality were the most critical key variables explaining the potential distribution of these three Juniperus species; they contribute by 16-56.1% and 20.4-38.3%, respectively. Accounting for the use of different thresholds provides a balanced approach for species distribution models' applications in conservation assessment when the goal is to assess potential climatic suitability in new geographical areas. Therefore, south Sichuan and north Yunnan could be considered important priority conservation areas for in situ conservation and search for unknown populations of these three Juniperus species.

AB  - The bush dog (Speothos venaticus), listed as CITES Appendix 1 - vulnerable, is a small (5-6 kg), rarely seen canid from Central and South America. The World Conservation Union Canid Specialist Group (IUCN CSG) recommended that research with this species focus on their basic ecology so that a data-driven conservation strategy can be formulated. Information on the bush dog, however, has been lacking since standard field techniques have had little or no success with this species. The S. venaticus Status and Distribution Survey was developed in an attempt to use indirect methodologies to determine the bush dog's conservation status in the wild, its current distribution, and identify ecological needs by correlating habitat types to bush dog sightings. Survey responses and literature generated a database with 399 historic bush dog locations recorded between 1834 and 2004. These locational records were used to update the species' range extent map, an important conservation planning tool. With year and precision of data accounted for, we analyzed land use coverage at known locations where bush dogs have historically been reported to evaluate the likelihood that the species persists in the area today. In addition, these locations provided training data for generation of potential distribution maps (i.e., areas of occupancy) using ecological niche modeling (i.e., Maximum Entropy) and bioclimatic data. These analyses revealed that 20% of the historic bush dog locations are associated with fragmented or altered habitat. These results allowed the status of bush dog habitat to be re-evaluated and areas that require more intensive research and protection to be identified. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. The importance of monitoring biodiversity to detect and understand changes throughout time and to inform management is increasingly recognized. Monitoring schemes should be globally unified, spatially integrated across scales, long term, and cost-efficient.
   2. We propose a framework to design optimized multispecies-targeted monitoring networks over large areas. The method builds upon previous developments on systematic conservation planning in terms of optimizing resource allocation in space, and comprises seven steps: (a) determine which questions will be addressed, (b) define species to be monitored, (c) compile occurrence data for all defined species, (d) predict the overall distribution of each species, (e) collect relevant environmental data and identify homogeneous strata, (t) set targets for the minimum number of monitoring sites per species and/or stratum and (g) identify optimal monitoring sites.
   3. We tested whether the monitoring networks designed with our framework have increased performance when compared to networks obtained with simple-random or stratified-random sampling by using a set of different indicators. To that end, we designed monitoring networks using optimized and non-optimized sampling schemes, applied to a case study in Portugal, where the goal was to design a monitoring network for amphibians and reptiles, to complement the one currently established in Spain.
   4. Results allowed us to conclude that monitoring networks designed with our method tend to outperform the non-optimized ones, in terms of higher species diversity (i.e. higher number of species and equity across monitoring sites), higher representation of environmental strata, and particularly higher coverage of rare species, with less survey effort.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We developed a framework to allocate monitoring sites for multiple species at broad scales using predictive models and optimization algorithms currently applied in systematic conservation planning. This framework presents field survey cost-efficiency advantages when compared to other standard sampling designs and can significantly contribute to improving the design of monitoring schemes. Thus, we recommend its application to design new multispecies monitoring networks or to extend existing ones.

AB  - Although spatial scale is important for understanding ecological processes and guiding conservation planning, studies combining a range of scales are rare. Habitat suitability modelling has been used traditionally to study broad-scale patterns of species distribution but can also be applied to address conservation needs at finer scales. We studied the ability of presence-only species distribution modelling to predict patterns of habitat selection at broad and fine spatial scales for one of the rarest mammals in the UK, the grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus). Models were constructed with Maxent using broad-scale distribution data from across the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) and fine-scale radio-tracking data from bats at one colony. Fine-scale model predictions were evaluated with radio-tracking locations from bats from a distant colony, and compared with results of traditional radio-tracking data analysis methods (compositional analysis of habitat selection). Broad-scale models indicated that winter temperature, summer precipitation and land cover were the most important variables limiting the distribution of the grey long-eared bat in the UK. Fine-scale models predicted that proximity to unimproved grasslands and distance to suburban areas determine foraging habitat suitability around maternity colonies, while compositional analysis also identified unimproved grasslands as the most preferred foraging habitat type. This strong association with unimproved lowland grasslands highlights the potential importance of changes in agricultural practices in the past century for wildlife conservation. Hence, multi-scale models offer an important tool for identifying conservation requirements at the fine landscape level that can guide national-level conservation management practices.

AB  - Forecasting the colonization process is important for wildlife managers who supervise the reintroduction of endangered species or control the spread of invasive species. Patch connectivity is thus critical to predicting the fates of expanding populations. Connectivity in river networks results from river dendritic structure and dispersal modality of organisms. Both factors may strongly affect the colonization process and the efficiency of conservation action plans. Based on empirical data, we simulated, using a simplified model with limited number of parameters, the colonization of a large river network, the Loire River, by the native Eurasian beaver and the invasive African clawed frog. For each species, we inferred model parameters (dispersal behavior and distances) by comparing the simulated and the observed distributions. Using network theory, we evaluated the efficiency of alternative conservation strategies to prevent or promote colonization of the river network. Network robustness to fragmentation and disturbance was also assessed. The model acdurately predicted > 70% of the observed species ranges. Conservation strategies that selectively protect habitat patches with the highest connectivity values provide a weak advantage at preventing connectivity loss compared to random protection strategies. In contrast, the targeted destruction of highly connected patches had a much stronger effect on the fragmentation of the network than the random removal of habitat patches. Spatial network topology strongly contributes to determining colonization patterns of large river watersheds. Network theory allows tests for robustness of rivers to fragmentation and disturbance, and identification of strategies for conservation planning.

AB  - Networks of sites of high importance for conservation of biological diversity are a cornerstone of current conservation strategies but are fixed in space and time. As climate change progresses, substantial shifts in species' ranges may transform the ecological community that can be supported at a given site. Thus, some species in an existing network may not be protected in the future or may be protected only if they can move to sites that in future provide suitable conditions. We developed an approach to determine appropriate climate-change adaptation strategies for individual sites within a network that was based on projections of future changes in the relative proportions of emigrants (species for which a site becomes climatically unsuitable), colonists (species for which a site becomes climatically suitable), and persistent species (species able to remain within a site despite the climatic change). Our approach also identifies key regions where additions to a network could enhance its future effectiveness. Using the sub-Saharan African Important Bird Area (IBA) network as a case study, we found that appropriate conservation strategies for individual sites varied widely across sub-Saharan Africa, and key regions where new sites could help increase network robustness varied in space and time. Although these results highlight the potential difficulties within any planning framework that seeks to address climate-change adaptation needs, they demonstrate that such planning frameworks are necessary, if current conservation strategies are to be adapted effectively, and feasible, if applied judiciously.

AB  - Loss of forest naturalness challenges the maintenance of green infrastructure (GI) for biodiversity conservation and delivery of diverse ecosystem services. Using the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi target #11 with its quantitative and qualitative criteria as a normative model, we aim at supporting landscape planning through a pioneering assessment of the extent to which existing amounts and spatial distributions of High Conservation Value Forests (HCVFs) meet these criteria. Highly forested and committed to both intensive wood production and evidence-based conservation targets of 17-20% protected areas, Sweden was chosen as a case study. Specifically, we estimated the amount, regional representation, and functional connectivity of HCVF patches using virtual bird species, validated the results using field surveys of focal bird species, and assessed conservation target fulfilment. Finally, we linked these results to the regional distribution of forest land ownership categories, and stress that these provide different opportunities for landscape planning. Even if 31% of forest land in Sweden is officially protected, voluntarily set-aside, or not used for wood production now and in the future, we show that applying the representation and connectivity criteria of Aichi target #11 reduces this figure to an effective GI of 12%. When disaggregating the five ecoregions the effective GI was 54% for the sub-alpine forest ecoregion, which hosts EU's last intact forest landscapes, but only 3-8% in the other four ecoregions where wood production is predominant. This results in an increasing need for forest habitat and landscape restoration from north to south. The large regional variation in the opportunity for landscape planning stresses the need for a portfolio of different approaches. We stress the need to secure funding mechanisms for compensating land owners' investments in GI, and to adapt both the approaches and spatial extents of landscape planning units to land ownership structure.

AB  - The available tools and approaches to inform conservation decisions commonly assume detailed distribution data. We examine how well-established ecological concepts about patterns in local richness and community turnover can help overcome data limitations when planning future protected areas. To inform our analyses, we surveyed tree species in protected areas in the southern Appalachian Mountains in the eastern USA. We used the survey data to construct predictive models for alpha and beta diversity based on readily observed biophysical variables and combined them to create a heuristic that could predict among-site richness in trees (gamma diversity). The predictive models suggest that site elevation and latitude in this montane system explain much of the variation in alpha and beta diversity in tree species. We tested how well resulting protected areas would represent species if a conservation planner lacking detailed species inventories for candidate sites were to rely only on our alpha, beta and gamma diversity predictions. Our approach selected sites that, when aggregated, covered a large proportion of the overall species pool. The combined gamma diversity models performed even better when we also accounted for the cost of protecting sites. Our results demonstrate that classic community biogeography concepts remain highly relevant to conservation practice today.

AB  - Over recent years species distribution models have been used for the identification of suitable cultivation zones for native plant species. Valeriana carnosa is one of the most frequently used native plants in Patagonian popular medicine, its underground organs being obtained from natural populations. Considering the growing market demand, it is now necessary to design strategies for the cultivation and conservation of this valuable species. In this study, Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) using the Maxent model was used to predict potential geographical distributions of V. carnosa under current and future climatic conditions and considering the projected climate changes for the next fifty years in Argentinean Patagonia. Results showed that by 2070 it is expected that 22 % of the area with climatic conditions suited to V. carnosa will be lost. Most of these areas lie in the steppe region, and the remaining geographic areas with suitable climatic conditions will be found mainly in the Cordillera and PreCordillera regions. We identified five endangered V. carnosa populations in Patagonia. This study provides a novel tool for planning in situ cultivation of V. carnosa and preserving genetic material from endangered populations, considering the climate projections for the coming decades in Patagonia.

AB  - Environmental assessments of regional development projects have been used in Mexico to determine where conflicts between conservation of biodiversity and resource extraction are likely to occur. Species-rich areas have been acknowledged as a priority for conservation. However, biological information is incomplete and biased toward accessible sites, so species-rich areas cannot be depicted directly from current biological knowledge.
   An alternative approach to predicting species-rich areas is presented in this article. It is based on the gap analysis technique and involves the use of ordination analysis and generalized linear models integrated with a geographic information system. This approach was used for locating species-rich areas in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Oaxaca, where a regional forestry development project was proposed. Baseline information consisted of gee-referenced collection sites of terrestrial vertebrates. Thirty-two species assemblages were identified by the ordination analysis, as well as by 25 generalized linear models. Validation of six of these models showed no significant differences between observed and predicted species frequencies.
   Results demonstrated that species-rich areas could be depicted even under the constraints of environmental assessment in Mexico. A large number of species could be used in this analysis due to the minimal information required for each species record. This predictive approach optimized available biological information for the integration of conservation into regional development planning.

AB  - The Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) seeks to assess the conservation status of the world vascular plants by 2020, and to guarantee that at least 750/0 threatened taxa are conserved in situ. A comprehensive evaluation of IUCN categories for 7269 Spanish vascular plants (GSPC Target 2), using distribution data and environmental niche models, is presented. A gap analysis to assess the percentage of threatened plants effectively conserved in situ (considering national parks, plant micro-reserves and recovery or conservation plans) was also conducted (Target 7). The result is that only 44.4% threatened species are subject to an adequate in situ protection. An appropriate management of additional natural protected areas towards the conservation of threatened plants would make Spain meet this threshold, but severe deficiencies should be corrected. The methodology presented here is proposed as a tool to assess the degree of achievement of GSPC targets. This procedure can be quickly implemented and allows an easy evaluation of the progress, as well as the pending tasks in a given period of time.

AB  - Faced with unpredictable environmental change, conservation managers face the dual challenges of protecting species throughout their ranges and protecting areas where populations are most likely to persist in the long term. The former can be achieved by protecting locally rare species, to the potential detriment of protecting species where they are least endangered and most likely to survive in the long term.
   Using British butterflies as a model system, we compared the efficacy of two methods of identifying persistent areas of species' distributions: a single-species approach and a new multispecies prioritization tool called ZONATION. This tool identifies priority areas using population dynamic principles (prioritizing areas that contain concentrations of populations of each species) and the reserve selection principle of complementarity.
   ZONATION was generally able to identify the best landscapes for target (i.e. conservation priority) species. This ability was improved by assigning higher numerical weights to target species and implementing a clustering procedure to identify coherent biological management units.
   Weighting British species according to their European rather than UK status substantially increased the protection offered to species at risk throughout Europe. The representation of species that are rare or at risk in the UK, but not in Europe, was not greatly reduced when European weights were used, although some species of UK-only concern were no longer assigned protection inside their best landscapes. The analysis highlights potential consequences of implementing parochial vs. wider-world priorities within a region.
   Synthesis and applications. Wherever possible, reserve planning should incorporate an understanding of population processes to identify areas that are likely to support persistent populations. While the multispecies prioritization tool ZONATION compared favourably to the selection of 'best' areas for individual species, a user-defined input of species weights was required to produce satisfactory solutions for long-term conservation. Weighting species can allow international conservation priorities to be incorporated into regional action plans but the potential consequences of any putative solution should always be assessed to ensure that no individual species of local concern will be threatened..

AB  - The importance of targeting ecological and evolutionary processes in reserve design has been widely acknowledged in the literature but rarely implemented on islands. Using Socotran reptiles as models, we aim to relate richness of widespread and restricted-range species directly with landscape variables and to compare the impact of setting conservation targets for lineages versus species. Socotra Island is a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, containing high levels of endemism in relation to its area, especially of reptiles, the vertebrates with the most comprehensive available genetic data. We predicted the occurrences of reptile species using distribution models and used a novel approach to interpolate maps of spatial phylogenetic patterns. Patterns of intra and interspecifc diversity and differences between spatial outputs of lineage and species richness were related to eco-geographic variables. We evaluated differences in target achievement for each conservation unit within protected areas (PAs) under the current Zoning Plan (ZP) using gap and reserve design analyses. Although intraspecific richness was strongly correlated with interspecific richness, differences in their spatial distribution reached similar to 30% in some areas. Differences were more pronounced for wide-ranging than restricted-range taxa. Gap analysis indicates that most conservation units are under-represented in sanctuaries and that intra and interspecific richness were significantly higher outside PAs. This work will guide local-scale conservation planning as the ZP is due to be re-evaluated. This is one of the few studies on islands using genetic data from an entire class of vertebrates to incorporate lineage diversity in reserve design. This study provides an alternative methodological framework for supporting the use of landscape and genetic tools in reserve design, circumventing the use of phylogenetic distances and deterministic spatial interpolation of lineage diversity that can be widely applied to other systems.

AB  - Limited data on the spatial, environmental, and human dimensions of small-scale fisheries hinder conservation planning, so the incorporation of fishers' local ecological knowledge may be a valuable way to fill data gaps while legitimizing management decisions. In Peru, vulnerable and poorly assessed juvenile smooth hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna zygaena) are the most commonly caught shark species in a small-scale drift gillnet fishery. We conducted semistructured interviews with 87 hammerhead fishers in three major Peruvian ports to elucidate the spatiotemporal niche of the hammerhead fishery and environmental drivers of juvenile hammerhead catch. We also built a biophysical model of hammerhead distribution that correlated remotely sensed environmental variables with a spatially explicit fishery observer dataset. Overall, we found a consensus between fishers' knowledge and species distribution modeling. Sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a emerged as important environmental drivers of juvenile hammerhead catch, with both fishers' knowledge and the biophysical model identifying similar habitat preferences (similar to 20-23 degrees C and log chl-a >-1.6 mg/m(3)). Participatory mapping of fishing grounds also corresponded to the spatiotemporal patterns of predicted hammerhead distribution. This study points to the utility of combining fishers' knowledge and biophysical modeling for spatial, temporal, and/or dynamic management of these sharks in Peru and in other data-poor fisheries globally.

AB  - This paper presents a species distribution model (SDM) to quantify relationships between environmental variables and habitat suitability using unbalanced presence-absence data common in ecology. The proposed model applies a stratified sample balancing scheme for the random forest classifier where every classification tree receives a balanced sample of presence and absence. The model is applied to the Australian coast's seagrass habitats, where seagrass populations have been on the decline. Australian Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (ACEAS) seagrass presence-absence data is used to train the model. Seagrasses are observed at 97.6% of the survey locations, and seagrass absence is recorded at only 2.4% of the survey locations. The proposed model's accuracy is validated with an independent dataset on seagrass presence from the Coastal and Marine Resources Information System (CAMRIS). The environmental variables used in the analysis are obtained from the Ecological Marine Units (EMU) dataset. The variables on human-driven stressors to seagrass habitats due to ship traffic are obtained from World Port Index. The proposed model predicts seagrass absence at a recall rate of 80%, whereas the random forest recall rate is 24%. The model's variable importance profile aligns with the main drivers behind seagrass habitats reported in the literature. A case study is conducted for quantifying the impacts of two proposed ports in the Gulf of Carpenteria on the local seagrass habitats. Results show that balancing improves the explanatory and predictive capabilities of an SDM to define conditions resulting in a species' absence, aiding conservation planning with realistic species distributions.

AB  - Habitat connectivity is crucial for the conservation of species restricted to fragmented populations within human-dominated landscapes. However, identifying habitat connectivity for apex predators is challenging because trophic interactions between primary productivity and prey species influence both the distribution of habitats, and predator movement. Our goal was to assess habitat connectivity for Indochinese tigers (Panthera tigris) in Thailand. We quantified suitable habitat and dispersal corridors based an ensemble species distribution model that included prey distributions, primary productivity, and abiotic variables and was based on camera-trap data from 1996 to 2013 in 15 protected areas. We employed graph theory to evaluate the relative importance of habitat patches and dispersal corridors to the overall connectivity network. We found that tiger occurrence models with and without prey distributions performed well (Area Under the Curve: 0.932-0.954). However, inclusion of prey distributions significantly improved model performance (P < 0.001). Protected areas with tigers at the time of our surveys were highly isolated with high resistance to movement within the dispersal corridors, and four of them have lost their tiger populations since. Potential habitat patches outside of protected areas were also mostly isolated, but it was encouraging to find that there is ample potential habitat that tigers are not occupying. The Huai Kha Kaeng - ThungYai habitat patch and Kaeng Krachan dispersal corridor were the most important for overall habitat connectivity. Generally, integrating prey distributions into assessments of connectivity is a promising approach that can be widely applied to predict species occurrence and delineate dispersal corridors, thereby supporting conservation planning of tigers and other large carnivores.

AB  - Although the impacts of climate change on biodiversity are increasing worldwide, few studies have attempted to forecast these impacts on Amazon Tropical Forest. In this study, we estimated the impact of climate change on Amazonian avian assemblages considering range shifts, species loss, vulnerability of ecosystem functioning, future effectiveness of current protected areas and potential climatically stable areas for conservation actions. Species distribution modelling based on two algorithms and three different scenarios of climate change was used to forecast 501 avian species, organized on main ecosystem functions (frugivores, insectivores and nectarivores) for years 2050 and 2070. Considering the entire study area, we estimated that between 4 and 19% of the species will find no suitable habitat. Inside the currently established protected areas, species loss could be over 70%. Our results suggest that frugivores are the most sensitive guild, which could bring consequences on seed dispersal functions and on natural regeneration. Moreover, we identified the western and northern parts of the study area as climatically stable. Climate change will potentially affect avian assemblages in southeastern Amazonia with detrimental consequences to their ecosystem functions. Information provided here is essential to conservation practitioners and decision makers to help on planning their actions.

AB  - Conservation-planning approaches must be supported by a good understanding of the geographical distribution of species. Despite the efforts conducted so far to compile data on aquatic insects, the information on the distribution of water beetles in Morocco is scarce. In this study, we assess for the first time the degree of inventory quality of aquatic insects in Africa. Using an exhaustive database of Moroccan water beetles, likely the most complete database for any group of aquatic insects in Africa (with 11,229 records for 305 species), we specifically aim to explore the patterns of species richness, sampling effort and inventory completeness at four different spatial resolutions, identifying those spatial units that can be considered as sufficiently surveyed, and locating areas in need of further sampling effort. Our results showed a lack of complete and extensive inventory data; as less than 12% of Moroccan cells at the coarsest resolution assessed (45 ') can be considered as well surveyed (slope < 0.1 and survey completeness > 70%), while at the finest resolution (7 '), only 1% of Moroccan cells could be identified as being well prospected. Finally, we highlight the importance of these procedures to improve monitoring planning of aquatic fauna and to improve their effective conservation and management. Implications for insect conservation Considerable information is still required to provide an accurate picture of the richness patterns of aquatic insects in North-Western Africa. Thus, results on the pattern of species richness must be used cautiously, as they could be just mirroring the pattern of sampling effort carried out. We recommend the use of modelling procedures as a shortcut to improve our knowledge on the biodiversity patterns of aquatic insects in North-Western Africa and to establish efficient conservation strategies for their protection.

   Methods
   Distributions of 154 herpetological species were predicted using maximum entropy models, and groups of significantly co-occurring species (biotic elements) were identified. Environmental gradients were characterized for the complete area and for the area covered by each biotic element, by performing a principal component analysis on the data matrix composed of nine environmental variables. The first two principal component analysis axes were classified into four categories each, and those categories were combined with each other resulting in an environmental classification with 16 categories. To identify priority conservation areas, biotic elements and environmental categories were used as surrogates for the neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity, respectively. Priority areas for conservation were identified under three scenarios: (1) setting targets for species only; (2) setting targets for species and for each environmental category of the overall area; and (3) setting targets for each species and for each environmental category within each biotic element.
   Results
   Nine biotic elements were identified - four for the amphibians and five for the reptiles. Priority areas identified in the three scenarios were similar in terms of amount of area selected, but exhibited low spatial agreement.
   Main conclusions
   Prioritization exercises that integrate surrogates for evolutionary processes can deliver spatial priorities that are fairly different to those where only species representation is considered. While new methods are emerging to incorporate molecular data in conservation prioritization, it is unlikely to be enough data for enough taxa for this to be feasible in many regions. We develop an approach using surrogates for both the neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity that may enhance biodiversity persistence and representation when molecular data are not available or geographically comprehensive.

AB  - Biotic and abiotic factors are increasingly acknowledged to synergistically shape broad-scale species distributions. However, the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in predicting species distributions is unclear. In particular, biotic factors, such as predation and vegetation, including those resulting from anthropogenic land-use change, are underrepresented in species distribution modeling, but could improve model predictions. Using generalized linear models and model selection techniques, we used 129 estimates of population density of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) from 5 continents to evaluate the relative importance, magnitude, and direction of biotic and abiotic factors in predicting population density of an invasive large mammal with a global distribution. Incorporating diverse biotic factors, including agriculture, vegetation cover, and large carnivore richness, into species distribution modeling substantially improved model fit and predictions. Abiotic factors, including precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, were also important predictors. The predictive map of population density revealed wide-ranging potential for an invasive large mammal to expand its distribution globally. This information can be used to proactively create conservation/management plans to control future invasions. Our study demonstrates that the ongoing paradigm shift, which recognizes that both biotic and abiotic factors shape species distributions across broad scales, can be advanced by incorporating diverse biotic factors.

AB  - Many species have already experienced distributional shifts due to changing environmental conditions, and analyzing past shifts can help us to understand the influence of environmental stressors on a species as well as to analyze the effectiveness of conservation strategies. We aimed to (1) quantify regional habitat associations of the California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica); (2) describe changes in environmental variables and gnatcatcher distributions through time; (3) identify environmental drivers associated with habitat suitability changes; and (4) relate habitat suitability changes through time to habitat conservation plans. Southern California's Western Riverside County (WRC), an approximately 4,675km(2) conservation planning area. We assessed environmental correlates of distributional shifts of the federally threatened California gnatcatcher (hereafter, gnatcatcher) using partitioned Mahalanobis D-2 niche modeling for three time periods: 1980-1997, 1998-2003, and 2004-2012, corresponding to distinct periods in habitat conservation planning. Highly suitable gnatcatcher habitat was consistently warmer and drier and occurred at a lower elevation than less suitable habitat and consistently had more CSS, less agriculture, and less chaparral. However, its relationship to development changed among periods, mainly due to the rapid change in this variable. Likewise, other aspects of highly suitable habitat changed among time periods, which became cooler and higher in elevation. The gnatcatcher lost 11.7% and 40.6% of highly suitable habitat within WRC between 1980-1997 to 1998-2003, and 1998-2003 to 2004-2012, respectively. Unprotected landscapes lost relatively more suitable habitat (-64.3%) than protected landscapes (30.5%). Over the past four decades, suitable habitat loss within WRC, especially between the second and third time periods, was associated with temperature-related factors coupled with landscape development across coastal sage scrub habitat; however, development appears to be driving change more rapidly than climate change. Our study demonstrates the importance of providing protected lands for potential suitable habitat in future scenarios.

AB  - Bioclimatic envelope models use associations between aspects of climate and species' occurrences to estimate the conditions that are suitable to maintain viable populations. Once bioclimatic envelopes are characterized, they can be applied to a variety of questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation. However, some have questioned the usefulness of these models, because they may be based on implausible assumptions or may be contradicted by empirical evidence. We review these areas of contention, and suggest that criticism has often been misplaced, resulting from confusion between what the models actually deliver and what users wish that they would express. Although improvements in data and methods will have some effect, the usefulness of these models is contingent on their appropriate use, and they will improve mainly via better awareness of their conceptual basis, strengths, and limitations.

AB  - Identifying networks of sites that efficiently represent the biotic diversity of larger regions is a prerequisite for effective, conservation planning. Recent approaches for systematic conservation planning rely on the idea of complementarity, i.e., the selection of networks of sites that complement each other in their species composition. A major obstacle in applying these methods is the need for detailed data on species distribution, which is usually not available. In this study, we test the hypothesis that cluster analysis based on environmental variables (rainfall, temperature, and lithology) can be used to identify sets of complementary sites that efficiently represent regional species diversity. The performance of this approach (which we term environmental cluster analysis, ECA) is evaluated using an extensive database of the flora of Israel as a test case. Our results indicate that the ECA performed significantly better than a random null model in representing regional floristic diversity. Moreover, sites representing regions (clusters) defined by the ECA were more efficient in capturing the floristic diversity of Israel than sites representing the floristic regions of the area. In contrast to our expectation, the efficiency of the ECA was particularly pronounced in the analysis of rare species. The main mechanism behind the superiority of the ECA was its ability to identify sets of sites characterized by high turnover of species, rather than individually rich sites. The overall results suggest that ECA may serve as an important tool for the identification of complementary networks of conservation sites.

AB  - Mexico is home to a large number of reptile species and has one of the greatest diversities of venomous snakes, among which the rattlesnakes pertaining to the Crotalus genus stand out. Out of more than 40 species in the country, nine are found in Zacatecas: C. aquilus, C. atrox, C. basiliscus, C. lepidus, C. molossus, C. polystictus, C. pricei, C. scutulatus and C. willardi. Although these reptiles are important, due to their relevance in terms of ecology, cultural use and public health, their conservation is impacted by multiple factors, such as habitat fragmentation and indiscriminate killing. Thus, most species within this genus are found in some type of risk category at both the national and international level. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential distribution and diversity of rattlesnakes at the municipal level in the understudied state of Zacatecas. To do this, we analyzed and described the global distribution of nine rattlesnake species by building species distribution models, which determined their potential distribution based on a set of ecological variables and presence records. The resulting models were used to assess the diversity of rattlesnake species potentially present in each municipality within the state. Thirty-nine (67.24 %) out of fifty-eight municipalities registered at least one rattlesnake species. Fresnillo, Sombrerete and Valparaiso were some of the municipalities showing greatest diversity. Moreover, C. atrox, C. lepidus, C. molossus and C. scutulatus were the most widely found species in the state. On the other hand, C. basiliscus, C. polystictus, C. pried and C. willardi were rarely spotted and so, information on their distribution patterns within Zacatecas is limited. Finally, the areas having the largest potential for the distribution of these species were defined. These findings should make field work much more time- and cost-effective, facilitating the collection of in situ data that are useful for management and conservation plans of these species in Zacatecas.

AB  - Populations see their range fluctuate in relation to environmental variations, including climate change, and their survival is linked to the maintenance of large enough populations and broad enough distributions during these variations. Most amphibian populations are threatened by numerous ecological and anthropogenic variables acting in synergy with climate change. Accumulating basic ecological data such as range enables the development of population and range dynamics, themselves resulting on adequate conservation plans. Karsenia koreana is the only known Asian plethodontic salamander, occurring in a very restricted area only. Based on presence data, we created an ecological model using six bioclimatic factors with low multicollinearity to define the adequate habitat of the species, and we modelled the predicted suitability of the Korean landscape following four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) predicting climate change scenarios based on CO2 concentrations in 2050 and 2070. The maximum entropy model for the current distribution produced a landscape suitability considerably wider than the current known distribution. The projected ranges for each RCP indicated marked increases, decreases and shifts in areas with suitable landscapes due to climate change. The lowest RCP prediction resulted in an increase in suitable area, although potentially without connectivity with current populations, while the highest RCP predictions resulted in a decrease. Our results highlight the potential negative impact of climate change, thus requiring updates in conservation plans for K. koreana. The methods used here can be replicated with any land-dwelling species, and our results reflect expected range shifts for most amphibians of the northern hemisphere.

AB  - There has been uncertainty in the national gap analysis program about including non-breeding birds in distribution models because of concerns that distributions of migrant and winter birds are difficult to predict and are not necessary to assess biodiversity patterns. New Mexico gap analysis included migrant and non-breeding birds assuming that distributions could be predicted using habitat associations, and that excluding non-breeding bird habitat from avian richness projections potentially underestimates community types important to birds. We compared biodiversity estimates including non-breeding birds (inclusive estimate-324 species) to estimates including only breeding birds (breeding bird estimate-257 species) in terms of estimated patterns of species richness. Inclusive and breeding bird richness estimates agreed about general locations of some species-rich areas and the most species-poor areas in the state, but were less comparable for intermediate al:eas of bird occurrence. We found < 50% agreement between the two estimates about areas with highest species richness. When non-breeding birds were included, over 2,000,000 ha of short grass steppe shifted to a higher richness category and another 11,600 ha moved into the highest richness category. Graminoid wetlands, playa lakes, and waters in eastern New Mexico also showed elevated richness levels in the inclusive estimate. Our analyses indicate that only assessing breeding distribution does not reliably predict relative importance of areas used by birds throughout New Mexico and should not be used exclusively to identify potential gaps in conservation for land-use evaluation and planning.

From the gaps and opportunities observed in France, we suggest a set of practical and scientific recommendations in order to strengthen their use in systematic conservation planning for terrestrial biodiversity (protected networks, green infrastructure and land settlement). The two main advices are to adopt an iterative approach between field survey and data analysis, and the selection of the species groups to inventory. The iterative process consists of regularly using available valid data to identify spatial and taxonomic gaps in the inventory, to model the potential distribution of each species and to estimate their ecological niche. During the distribution inventory project, this information can enable the sorting of new data according to their plausibility (data validation process) and should be used to identify priority areas for new field surveys. As scientific literature concludes that there is low consistency of biodiversity congruence relationship, we suggest increasing taxonomic representation in new atlases projects in order to provide a more complete view of species distribution for nature conservation initiatives. Ideally, the species groups should be rich in restricted range and low mobility species, or rich in habitat specialist species or contain species playing a recognized role in ecosystem functioning. Taking into account practical and technical criteria, a list of taxa is proposed for new distribution atlases. This proposal would cover about 20 % of known terrestrial species compared to current 5 %, with more effort on invertebrates, plants and fungi.

AB  - Species distribution models are a useful tool and are now often used in many branches of biology, especially when dealing with threatened organisms. In combination with GIS techniques, these models are especially important and valuable for predicting the occurrence of rare species, for example orchids. Orchids are an endangered plant group, protected worldwide. Questions about their conservation are therefore highly discussed, but not all factors affecting their survival and distribution are known. Here we present an example of using SDMs for analysing orchid species occurrence data from the Jeseniky Mountains in the Czech Republic. Our data were analysed using the MaxEnt program, which produces species distribution maps and thus allows the prediction of the potential occurrence of orchids at yet unknown localities. This program also determines the environmental factors affecting species distribution. This is important for the better protection of orchids, because only by knowing these factors can new localities be found or the management plans that are crucial for maintaining orchid localities be improved. We studied the most abundant orchid species in the given region. We determined the most important factors affecting their occurrence and also areas, where new sites are most likely to be discovered and depicted them in potential distribution maps. This approach can help in finding new localities of orchids and in understanding, which environmental factors influence the occurrence of endangered orchids.

AB  - In 2008, the IUCN threat status of the Asian tapir (Tapirus indicus) was reclassified from vulnerable to endangered. The latest distribution map from the IUCN Red List suggests that the tapirs native range is becoming increasingly fragmented in Peninsular Malaysia, but distribution data collected by local researchers suggest a more extensive geographical range. Here, we compile a database of 1261 tapir occurrence records within Peninsular Malaysia, and demonstrate that this species, indeed, has a much broader geographical range than the IUCN range map suggests. However, extreme spatial and temporal bias in these records limits their utility for conservation planning. Therefore, we used maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to elucidate the potential extent of the Asian tapir's occurrence in Peninsular Malaysia while accounting for bias in existing distribution data. Our MaxEnt model predicted that the Asian tapir has a wider geographic range than our fine-scale data and the IUCN range map both suggest. Approximately 37% of Peninsular Malaysia contains potentially suitable tapir habitats. Our results justify a revision to the Asian tapir's extent of occurrence in the IUCN Red List. Furthermore, our modeling demonstrated that selectively logged forests encompass 45% of potentially suitable tapir habitats, underscoring the importance of these habitats for the conservation of this species in Peninsular Malaysia.

AB  - Climate change poses a challenge to the conventional approach to biodiversity conservation, which relies on fixed protected areas, because the changing climate is expected to shift the distribution of suitable areas for many species. Some species will persist only if they can colonize new areas, although in some cases their dispersal abilities may be very limited. To address this problem we devised a quantitative method for identifying multiple corridors of connectivity through shifting habitat suitabilities that seeks to minimize dispersal demands first and then the area of land required. We applied the method to Proteaceae mapped on a 1-minute grid for the western part of the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, to supplement the existing protected areas using Worldmap software. Our goal was to represent each species in at least 35 grid cells (approximately 100 km(2)) at all times between 2000 and 2050 despite climate change. Although it was possible to achieve the goal at reasonable cost, caution will be needed in applying our method to reserves or other conservation investments until there is further information to support or refine the climate-change models and the species' habitat-suitability and dispersal models.

AB  - In landscapes where natural habitat is highly fragmented, any method for assessment of population persistence or potential for biodiversity should be based upon metapopulation theory, taking into account the spatial and temporal dynamics of species. We argue that methods based upon species distribution data, population viability analyses (PVA), or landscape indices alone all have severe flaws. We introduce an approach based upon a combination of the three methods, in which ecologically scaled landscape indices (ESLI) are compared to spatial standards derived from both analysis of distribution data and PVA-type simulations. We derive spatial standards, introducing the key patch approach. Key patches are large patches with a stabilizing role in habitat networks. Key patch standards were developed using spatial analysis of presence-absence data and calibrated metapopulation models for marshland bird species. We show examples of the application of this approach in land use management at both regional and national planning scales. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exploring trends in species richness and the distribution of individual species over time as well as the factors affecting these trends informs conservation priorities in protecting species and ecosystems as a whole. We used data from 41 park-wide line transect surveys in 2009 and 2014 and multi-season occupancy models with multi-species data to explore trends in species richness and distribution of individual species and factors affecting these trends in Nyungwe National Park (NNP), Rwanda. Mammalian species richness and the distributional range of 5 of the 7 species increased between 2009 and 2014 in NNP. The probability of colonization of a species into a new area in 2014, where it was not present in 2009, was highest in sites with a lower probability of poaching activity, close to tourist trails, and at lower elevations. The probability of colonization with no poaching activity was about 50% but dropped to about 10% with a 100% chance of poaching activity. Duiker species had the largest increase in distribution during the study, while there was a decrease in the distribution of the eastern chimpanzee and blue monkey. Our results suggest that increased patrols could be implemented in areas of the park with low species richness and areas with a low probability of occurrence for species of conservation concern to combat poaching activity and thus increase the probability of a species moving into a new area. Our use of a single multi-season model for multiple species explicitly accounts for imperfect detection and species-specific identities, while allowing for inferences to be made about rarely detected species by sharing covariates with common species. These results can be used to improve conservation planning in NNP for species management and ranger patrol protocols, and our modelling framework is broadly applicable to any protected area with presence/absence species field data.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning aims to design networks of protected areas that meet conservation goals across large landscapes. The optimal design of these conservation networks is most frequently based on the modeled habitat suitability or probability of occurrence of species, despite evidence that model predictions may not be highly correlated with species density. We hypothesized that conservation networks designed using species density distributions more efficiently conserve populations of all species considered than networks designed using probability of occurrence models. To test this hypothesis, we used the Zonation conservation prioritization algorithm to evaluate conservation network designs based on probability of occurrence versus density models for 26 land bird species in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. We assessed the efficacy of each conservation network based on predicted species densities and predicted species diversity. High-density model Zonation rankings protected more individuals per species when networks protected the highest priority 10-40% of the landscape. Compared with density-based models, the occurrence-based models protected more individuals in the lowest 50% priority areas of the landscape. The 2 approaches conserved species diversity in similar ways: predicted diversity was higher in higher priority locations in both conservation networks. We conclude that both density and probability of occurrence models can be useful for setting conservation priorities but that density-based models are best suited for identifying the highest priority areas. Developing methods to aggregate species count data from unrelated monitoring efforts and making these data widely available through ecoinformatics portals such as the Avian Knowledge Network will enable species count data to be more widely incorporated into systematic conservation planning efforts.
   Mejoria de la Efectividad de la Planeacion Sistematica de la Conservacion con Datos de Densidad La planeacion sistematica de la conservacion tiene como meta disenar redes de areas protegidas que cumplan con objetivos de conservacion a lo largo de grandes paisajes. El diseno optimo de estas redes de conservacion se basa con mayor frecuencia en modelos de idoneidad de habitat o probabilidad de occurrencia de especies, a pesar de la evidencia existente de que las predicciones de esos modelos pueden no estar fuertemente correlacionadas con la densidad de especies. Hipotetizamos que las redes de conservacion disenadas con las distribuciones de la densidad de especies conservan con mayor eficiencia a las poblaciones de todas las especies consideradas que las redes disenadas con modelos de probabilidad de occurencia. Para probar esta hipotesis usamos el algoritmo Zonation de planeacion de la conservacion para evaluar los disenos de redes de conservacion basados en la probabilidad de ocurrencia versus los modelos de densidad para 26 especies de aves terrestres en el noroeste del Pacifico en los Estados Unidos. Evaluamos la efectividad de cada red de conservacion con base en las densidades pronosticadas de cada especie y la diversidad de especies pronosticada. Las clasificaciones de Zonation de los modelos de alta densidad protegieron a mas individuos por especie cuando las redes protegieron el 10-40% de la mas alta prioridad del paisaje. Comparado con los modelos basados en la densidad, los modelos basados en la ocurrencia protegieron a mas individuos en el 50% mas bajo de las areas prioritarias de los paisajes. Las dos estrategias conservaron la diversidad de especies de formas similares: la diversidad pronosticada fue mas alta en las localidades de alta prioridad en ambas redes de conservacion. Concluimos que tanto los modelos de densidad como los de probabilidad de ocurrencia pueden ser utiles para establecer prioridades de conservacion, pero que los modelos basados en la densidad son mas adecuados para identificar las areas de mas alta prioridad. Desarrollar metodos para agregar datos de conteos de especies a partir de esfuerzos de monitoreo no relacionados y hacer que estos datos esten disponibles en portales eco-informaticos como la Avian Knowledge Network permitira que los datos de conteos de especies se incorporen mas ampliamente en esfuerzos de planeacion sistematica de la conservacion.

AB  - Little is known about the ecology of the rare marbled cat Pardofelis marmorata on Borneo. In addition, the little information that is available on the species often comes from incidental sightings. Here we use the MaxEnt algorithm to produce a habitat suitability map for this species based on a compilation of existing data. We collected 105 marbled cat occurrence records for Borneo, of which 27 (Balanced Model) or 69 (Spatial Filtering Model) were used to estimate potential habitat suitability. The resulting relative habitat suitability map showed key conservation areas in Borneo. According to these results it appears that the most suitable habitats for marbled cat are lowland forests, but these forests are most threatened by deforestation and other anthropogenic activities. It is imperative to develop appropriate conservation strategies for the marbled cat on Borneo, including long-term research and monitoring, reduction of human disturbances in lowland forests, increased data-sharing and research networking, and stakeholder involvement for conservation planning and activities.

AB  - Methods for reserve selection and conservation planning often ignore uncertainty. For example, presence-absence observations and predictions of habitat models are used as inputs but commonly assumed to be without error We applied information-gap decision theory to develop uncertainty analysis methods for reserve selection. Our proposed method seeks a solution that is robust in achieving a given conservation target, despite uncertainty in the data. We maximized robustness in reserve selection through a novel method, "distribution discounting," in which the site- and species-specific measure of conservation value (related to species-specific occupancy probabilities) was penalized by an error measure (in our study, related to accuracy of statistical prediction). Because distribution discounting can be implemented as a modification of input files, it is a computationally efficient solution for implementing uncertainty analysis into reserve selection. Thus, the method is particularly useful for high-dimensional decision problems characteristic of regional conservation assessment. We implemented distribution discounting in the zonation reserve-selection algorithm that produces a hierarchy of conservation priorities throughout the landscape. We applied it to reserve selection for seven priority fauna in a landscape in New South Wales, Australia. The distribution discounting method can be easily adapted for use with different kinds of data (e.g., probability of occurrence or abundance) and different landscape descriptions (grid or patch based) and incorporated into other reserve-selection algorithms and software.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation threatens biodiversity, causes population isolation and reduces the availability of resources. When species ranges span geopolitical borders, management of transboundary populations and securing their connectivity can be compromised by different conservation priorities and juridical efforts. Using a combination of species distribution modelling and circuit theory, we modelled suitable habitats for four conservation-dependent mammalian megafauna in northeastern Iran, bordering Turkmenistan and Afghanistan which is part of the larger Kopet Dag Ecoregion in central Asia. Our multispecies approach aimed to identify key habitats and potential national and international corridors for Persian leopard (Panthera pardus), bezoar goat (Capra aegagrus), urial (Ovis orientalis) and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) based on environmental variables. Between 18 to 34% of the study area was identified as suitable habitat for each species with a moderate variability in coverage by conservation network, ranging between 14 to 43%). Importantly, we identified three key landscapes which can enhance the connectivity between main populations of the species in northeastern Iran as well as neighboring countries. Most of the suitable landscapes along the Iran-Turkmenistan borderlands are protected on the Iranian side, providing a source for landscape connectivity across the border. In contrast, the main suitable landscapes for megafauna in northeastern Iran are located far from the Afghan border. Our multispecies approach provided an empirical framework for spatial conservation planning for the mammalian megafauna across the Kopet Dag Ecoregion and can direct future survey efforts to identify critical wildlife areas in Turkmenistan and Afghanistan, two countries with scarce data on biodiversity.

AB  - Climate change presents a serious threat to global biodiversity. Loss of pollinators in particular has major implications, with extirpation of these species potentially leading to severe losses in agriculture and, thus, economic losses. In this study, we forecast the effects of climate change on the distribution of hoverflies in Southeast Europe using species distribution modelling and climate change scenarios for two time-periods. For 2041-2060, 19 analysed species were predicted to increase their areas of occupancy, with the other 25 losing some of their ranges. For 2061-2080, 55% of species were predicted to increase their area of occupancy, while 45% were predicted to experience range decline. In general, range size changes for most species were below 20%, indicating a relatively high resilience of hoverflies to climate change when only environmental variables are considered. Additionally, range-restricted species are not predicted to lose more area proportionally to widespread species. Based on our results, two distributional trends can be established: the predicted gain of species in alpine regions, and future loss of species from lowland areas. Considering that the loss of pollinators from present lowland agricultural areas is predicted and that habitat degradation presents a threat to possible range expansion of hoverflies in the future, developing conservation management strategy for the preservation of these species is crucial. This study represents an important step towards the assessment of the effects of climate changes on hoverflies and can be a valuable asset in creating future conservation plan, thus helping in mitigating potential consequences.

AB  - Animals are central to numerous ecological processes that shape the structure and function of ecosystems. It follows that species that are strongly linked to specific functions can represent these functions spatially and hence be useful in conservation planning. Here we test this notion of 'functional species surrogacy' for the conservation of seagrass meadows that have been impacted by stressors. We measured algal herbivory and herbivorous fish assemblages across a range of seagrass meadows in the Moreton Bay Marine Park, Queensland, Australia. We determined the suitability of herbivorous fish to act as a surrogate for the function of algal herbivory and modelled the abundance of this surrogate, and thus herbivory, in seagrass meadows to compare the spatial distribution of this function within existing reserves. We used underwater video systems to determine the abundance of all herbivorous fish species in seagrass meadows. The abundance of the dusky rabbitfish (Siganus fuscescens) was the best predictor of algal herbivory in seagrass meadows, supporting the suitability of this species as a functional surrogate. The distribution of dusky rabbitfish, and therefore the ecological function of herbivory, was not well represented in the Moreton Bay Marine Park protected areas. Only 7% of the equivalent area of seagrass meadows protected in marine reserves were found to have high abundances of dusky rabbitfish. We demonstrate that the abundance of functionally important herbivores can be suitable as a surrogate for herbivory in seagrass conservation. Our findings show that data on the spatial distribution of ecological functions can alter priorities for reserve design, and we suggest that our functional approach to species surrogacy is likely to improve conservation performance in seagrass ecosystems.

AB  - This study combines niche modeling and systematic area prioritization using distribution data for 131 species of amphibians and reptiles from Northeast India and Burma, with two objectives: (i) to evaluate the performance of the current conservation area network in Northeast India with respect to the representation of amphibians and reptiles, and (ii) to identify potential areas for expanding the current conservation area network. In a two-step protocol, maximum entropy niche modeling was used to project species' potential geographic occurrences, and the resulting probabilistic distribution data were used to prioritize areas with algorithms that maximize the representation of all species in minimal total area. The results provided a critical assessment of conservation priorities in this data-deficient region, and indicate the utility of combining niche modeling with systematic area prioritization in such situations. Many areas that had been overlooked in previous assessments were identified. Although the existing protected areas were found to be inadequate for representation of amphibian and reptile diversity, the prioritization results show that by targeting a minimal representation of 5% of the current total area suitable for each species, the gaps can be filled with a relatively modest (0.41%) increase in the current total area covered by the network. Extended analyses were also performed to assess the effects of putatively rare species on reserve selection, which showed that the inclusion of these taxa can change the prioritization solutions significantly. The prioritization results also highlight areas of Northeast India that warrant attention from future surveys. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Primate conservation requires a better knowledge of the distributions and statuses of populations in both large areas of habitat and in areas for which we currently have no information. We focused on spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) and howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. This Mexican state has protected large tracts of forest, and has historical records for both primates, although very little is known about them. To update our knowledge of the distributions of these primates and identify potential areas in which they are present, we modeled their geographic distributions by characterizing their ecological niches using the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP), performed interviews and carried out field surveys. The predicted distributions, surveys and interviews indicate that the distributions of these primates are restricted to northeastern Oaxaca. The results suggest that spider monkeys occupy a wider area and elevational range than howler monkeys. Throughout that range there is a wide variety of suitable habitats for these primates. Most of the sites where monkeys were recorded in the field are not officially protected and there was evidence of hunting and habitat destruction. It is important to improve protection, economic alternatives and environmental education as we move towards an integral solution for the conservation of these species. Validation of the GARP model was done for A. geoffroyi, since we had obtained enough field data for this species; this validation indicated that the predicted distribution of the species was statistically better than expected by chance. Hence, ecological niche modeling is a useful approach when performing an initial assessment to identify distribution patterns, detecting suitable areas for future exploration, and for conservation planning. Our findings provide an improved basis for primate conservation and productive fieldwork in Oaxaca.

AB  - Modelling the future suitable climate space for tree species has become a widely used tool for forest management planning under global climate change. Teak (Tectona grandis) is one of the most valuable tropical hardwood species in the international timber market, and natural teak forests are distributed from India through Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. The extents of teak forests are shrinking due to deforestation and the local impacts of global climate change. However, the direct impacts of climate changes on the continental-scale distributions of native and non-native teak have not been examined. In this study, we developed a species distribution model for teak across its entire native distribution in tropical Asia, and its non-native distribution in Bangladesh. We used presence-only records of trees and twelve environmental variables that were most representative for current teak distributions in South and Southeast Asia. MaxEnt (maximum entropy) models were used to model the distributions of teak under current and future climate scenarios. We found that land use/land cover change and elevation were the two most important variables explaining the current and future distributions of native and non-native teak in tropical Asia. Changes in annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality and annual mean actual evapotranspiration may result in shifts in the distributions of teak across tropical Asia. We discuss the implications for the conservation of critical teak habitats, forest management planning, and risks of biological invasion that may occur due to its cultivation in non-native ranges.

AB  - As animal populations continue to decline, frequently driven by large-scale land-use change, there is a critical need for improved environmental planning. While data-driven spatial planning is widely applied in conservation, as of yet it is rarely used for primates. The western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) declined by 80% within 24 years and was uplisted to Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2016. To support conservation planning for western chimpanzees, we systematically identified geographic areas important for this taxon. We based our analysis on a previously published data set of modeled density distribution and on several scenarios that accounted for different spatial scales and conservation targets. Across all scenarios, typically less than one-third of areas we identified as important are currently designated as high-level protected areas (i.e., national park or IUCN category I or II). For example, in the scenario for protecting 50% of all chimpanzees remaining in West Africa (i.e., approximately 26,500 chimpanzees), an area of approximately 60,000 km(2) was selected (i.e., approximately 12% of the geographic range), only 24% of which is currently designated as protected areas. The derived maps can be used to inform the geographic prioritization of conservation interventions, including protected area expansion, "no-go-zones" for industry and infrastructure, and conservation sites outside the protected area network. Environmental guidelines by major institutions funding infrastructure and resource extraction projects explicitly require corporations to minimize the negative impact on great apes. Therefore, our results can inform avoidance and mitigation measures during the planning phases of such projects. This study was designed to inform future stakeholder consultation processes that could ultimately integrate the conservation of western chimpanzees with national land-use priorities. Our approach may help in promoting similar work for other primate taxa to inform systematic conservation planning in times of growing threats.

AB  - The data in this article provide information about the species richness of each political unit in Myanmar and their preliminary conservation status. The dataset was compiled by gathering scattered data from different sources. The majority of the data were compiled from the authors' collections and historical and recent floristic treatments. Online databases and herbarium specimens were additional resources used for data compilation. In total, 603 species were documented and species names were standardized in accordance with the International Plant Names Index and Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group. Species composition between political units was calculated using the minimum variance of the Jaccard's dissimilarity matrix. Conservation status for 558 pteridophyte species from Myanmar was evaluated based on the global occurrences and occurrences only in Myanmar, and species with less than three occurrences were excluded from the analysis. This dataset can be applied as the reference data for future taxonomic revisions, biodiversity assessments, and conservation planning. Moreover, the data can be used for global diversity assessment, broad-scale species distribution modeling and bioclimatic modeling. The data provided in this manuscript have been analyzed and discussed in Khine and Schneider [1]. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In the northeastern United States, pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.)-scrub oak (Quercus iIicifolia Wang.) communities are increasingly threatened by development and fire suppression, and prioritization of these habitats for conservation is of critical importance. As a basis for local conservation planning in a pitch pine-scrub oak community in southeastern Massachusetts, we developed logistic-regression models based on multiscale landscape and patch variables to predict hotspots of rare and declining bird and moth species. We compared predicted moth distributions with observed species-occurrence records to validate the models. We then quantified the amount of overlap between hotspots to assess the utility of rare birds and moths as indicator taxa. Species representation in hotspots and the current level of hotspot protection were also assessed. Predictive models included variables at all measured scales and resulted in average correct classification rates (optimal cutpoint) of 85.6% and 89.2% for bird and moth models, respectively. The majority of moth occurrence records were within 100 m of predicted habitat. Only 13% of all bird hotspots and 10% of all moth hotspots overlapped, and only a few small patches in and around Myles Standish State Forest were predicted to be hotspots for both taxa. There was no correlation between the bird and moth species-richness maps across all levels of richness (r = -0.03, p = 0.62). Species representation in hotspots was high, but most hotspots had limited or no protection. Given the lack of correspondence between bird and moth hotspots, our results suggest that use of species-richness indicators for conservation planning may be ineffective at local scales. Based on these results, we suggest that local-level conservation planning in pitch pine-scrub oak communities be based on multitaxa, multiscale approaches.

AB  - Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have become increasingly useful for conservation issues. Initially designed to predict distributions of species from incomplete datasets, SDMs may also identify environmental conditions associated with higher occurrences and abundances of widely distributed taxa. Using sighting records of 15 widely distributed mammals from French Guiana, including primates, carnivores, rodents and ungulates, we used three SDMs -based on (i) entropy, (ii) genetic algorithm, (iii) Mahalanobis distance - to investigate relationships between species occurrence and predictive variables such as vegetation, biogeographic units, climate, and disturbance index. Maximal entropy procedures resulted in more accurate projected conditions: the accuracy of the predicted distributions was higher than 90% in nine species among the 15 tested, and predicted occurrences were correlated to field-measured abundances for nine species. The Genetic algorithm implemented with GARP had lower accuracy, with predicted occurrences correlated to abundances for three species only. Finally, Mahalanobis distance had a much lower performance and failed to find any correlation between occurrences and abundances. In the case of MaxEnt modelling, since map projection summarized more appropriate environmental conditions and identified areas likely to act as sources and/or corridors, we propose to use those appropriate environmental conditions as a proxy of conductance for landscape connectivity planning. We provide evidence here that SDMs can identify not only more suitable environmental conditions, but also areas hosting higher abundances for a large set of species with key ecological roles. Further management applications of this environmental suitability index could help in designing corridors between protected areas.

AB  - Aim: The quantification of species range shifts is critical for developing effective plans to conserve biodiversity. There are numerous methods and metrics for quantifying species range shifts, but we currently lack a comprehensive review of existing approaches used in species range shift studies.
   Location: Global.
   Time period: 2013 - 2014.
   Major taxa studied: All taxa.
   Methods: We conducted a quantitative literature review to first identify the methods currently used for defining a species' range over a particular time and then to identify metrics used for measuring changes in species ranges over time. We provide a roadmap for the selection of methods and metrics for measuring species ranges and species range shifts by discussing opportunities, assumptions and constraints of the different approaches.
   Results: Our literature review revealed six main methods for defining species ranges: observational studies, grid-based mapping, convex hull, kriging, species distribution modelling and hybrid methods. These methods are used with three main metric classes to measure species range shifts: changes in range limit, size and the probability of species occurrences or suitability. Most methods for defining species ranges and subsequent range shifts can be applied to different spatial extents and resolutions and taxa. However, only species distribution models (SDMs) and hybrid methods allow for the exploration of the relationship between species occurrence and environmental variables, and only these methods can be used for forecasting species ranges into future environments. Likewise, the inclusion of ecological processes in range shift calculations requires researchers to use hybrid methods or mechanistic models.
   Main conclusions: Our review revealed a high diversity of methods and metrics used to quantify species range shifts. As these methods and metrics underlie many of the conservation strategies proposed for climate change mitigation (e.g., protection of refugia), we urge the conservation community to evaluate underlying approaches for defining species ranges and measuring species range shifts with an equal level of scrutiny as the conservation strategies that these methods and metrics enable.

AB  - Conservation planning and biodiversity management require information on landscape connectivity across a range of spatial scales from individual home ranges to large regions. Reduction in landscape connectivity due changes in land use or development is expected to act synergistically with alterations to habitat mosaic configuration arising from climate change. We illustrate a multiscale connectivity framework to aid habitat conservation prioritization in the context of changing land use and climate. Our approach, which builds upon the strengths of multiple landscape connectivity methods, including graph theory, circuit theory, and least-cost path analysis, is here applied to the conservation planning requirements of the Mohave ground squirrel. The distribution of this threatened Californian species, as for numerous other desert species, overlaps with the proposed placement of several utility-scale renewable energy developments in the American southwest. Our approach uses information derived at three spatial scales to forecast potential changes in habitat connectivity under various scenarios of energy development and climate change. By disentangling the potential effects of habitat loss and fragmentation across multiple scales, we identify priority conservation areas for both core habitat and critical corridor or stepping stone habitats. This approach is a first step toward applying graph theory to analyze habitat connectivity for species with continuously distributed habitat and should be applicable across a broad range of taxa.

AB  - Conservation planning is often based on static mapping of species' ranges orhabitat distributions. Succession and disturbance alter, however, habitat quality and quantity through time especially under global climate and land use change scenarios; hence, static protected areas may not ensure habitat persistence and species survival. Here, we examined the relative merits of static and dynamic (floating) protected areas for the conservation of American marten (Martes americana) habitat in a dynamic boreal forest of Quebec (Canada). Forest dynamics were modeled using a spatially-explicit landscape disturbance model and protected areas were selected based on the quality and compactness of marten home ranges using MARXAN. Static protected areas were fixed in space during 200 year simulations of boreal forest dynamics, while dynamic protected areas were re-located every 50 years to track dynamic habitat. Dynamic protected areas supported more high quality home ranges through time than static protected areas. The locations of dynamic protected areas were constrained, however, by the highly fragmented forest patterns created through logging and fire in unprotected areas. Our findings emphasize the often-overlooked point that if dynamic conservation planning is to be successful in the long term, the landscape matrix quality surrounding protected areas must be managed in such a way that options remain when it comes to re-planning.

AB  - Reliable identification of hotspot areas with high numbers of threatened plant species has a central role in conservation planning. We investigated the potentiality of identifying the distribution, richness and hot-spots of threatened plant species at a 25 ha resolution using eight state-of-the-art modelling techniques (GLM, GAM, MARS, ANN, CTA, GBM, MDA and RF) in a taiga landscape in north-eastern Finland. First, the individual species models developed based on occurrence records of 28 species in the 1677 grid squares and derived from different statistical techniques were extrapolated to the whole study area of 41 750 km(2). Second, the projected presence/absence maps were then combined to create species richness maps, and the top 5% of grid cells ranked by species richness were classified as hotspots. Finally, we created an overall summary map by combining the individual hotspot maps from all eight modelling techniques and identified areas where the individual hotspots maps overlapped most. There were distinguishing differences in projections of the geographic patterns of species richness and hotspots between the modelling techniques. Most of the modelling techniques predicted several hotspot locations sporadically around the study area. However, the overall summary map showed the highest predictive performance based on Kappa statistics, indicating that the locations where the hotspot maps from the eight models coincided most harboured highest observed species richness. Moreover, the summary map filtered out the patchy structures of individual hotspot maps. The results show that the choice of modelling technique may affect the accuracy and prediction of hotspot patterns. Such differences may hamper the development of useful biodiversity model applications for conservation planning, and thus it is beneficial if the conservation decision-making can be based on sets of alternative maps and overlaying of predictions from multiple models.

AB  - Land cover change accompanying large-scale and rapid urbanization has caused major losses to biodiversity, with urban planning that incorporates biodiversity conservation being urgently needed. Understanding how land cover impacts the distribution and dynamics of breeding sites of biodiversity indicator species could facilitate the creation of long-term, landscape-scale urban planning to enhance biodiversity. Here, we identified land cover factors that influence the distribution and dynamics of the breeding sites of goshawks, a biodiversity indicator species, in the urban areas of Kanagawa, Japan. We analyzed how breeding site presence and absence data were correlated with land cover factors using a logistic regression model. To evaluate the dynamics in breeding site distribution, a meta-population dynamics model was used to analyze the relationship between breeding site occupancy history and land cover factors over 6 years. Forest cover, open land, and highly vegetated urban cover positively affected the distribution of goshawk breeding sites. However, the relative importance of highly vegetated urban cover was not as high as forest cover or open land. Forest cover negatively affected local extinction probability, while forest cover and open areas positively affected local colonization probability. In comparison, highly vegetated urban cover had low relative importance for the distribution of breeding sites, with no relationship being detected for breeding site distribution dynamics. The importance of forest cover and open land for both the distribution and dynamics of goshawk breeding sites emphasizes the importance of these land cover types for the breeding of urban-dwelling goshawks. Therefore, managers should focus on maintaining forests and open land to conserve goshawk breeding sites in urban areas to facilitate their long-term viability. Highly vegetated urban cover was considered to be less important for the long-term viability of goshawk breeding sites.

AB  - Species conservation plans frequently rely on information that spans political and administrative boundaries, especially when predictions are needed of future habitat under climate change; however, most species conservation plans and their requisite predictions of future habitat are often limited in geographical scope. Moreover, dispersal constraints for species of concern are not often incorporated into distribution models, which can result in overly optimistic predictions of future habitat. We used a standard modeling approach across a suite of 23 taxa of amphibians and reptiles in the North American deserts (560,024 km(2) across 13 ecoregions) to assess impacts of climate change on habitat and combined landscape population dispersal simulations with species distribution modeling to reduce the risk of predicting future habitat in areas that are not available to species given their dispersal abilities. We used 3 general circulation models and 2 representative concentration pathways (RCPs) to represent multiple scenarios of future habitat potential and assess which study species may be most vulnerable to changes forecasted under each climate scenario. Amphibians were the most vulnerable taxa, but the most vulnerable species tended to be those with the lowest dispersal ability rather than those with the most specialized niches. Under the most optimistic climate scenario considered (RCP 2.6; a stringent scenario requiring declining emissions from 2020 to near zero emissions by 2100), 76% of the study area may experience a loss of >20% of the species examined, while up to 87% of the species currently present may be lost in some areas under the most pessimistic climate scenario (RCP 8.5; a scenario wherein greenhouse gases continue to increase through 2100 based on trajectories from the mid-century). Most areas with high losses were concentrated in the Arizona and New Mexico Plateau ecoregion, the Edwards Plateau in Texas, and the Southwestern Tablelands in New Mexico and Texas, USA. Under the most pessimistic climate scenario, all species are predicted to lose some existing habitat, with an average of 34% loss of extant habitat across all species. Even under the most optimistic scenario, we detected an average loss of 24% of extant habitat across all species, suggesting that changing climates may influence the ranges of reptiles and amphibians in the Southwest.

AB  - In the changing climatic conditions, species distribution modelling is considered as a key strategy to estimate the probable influence of climatic variabilities on the habitat ranges of any species. The present study explores the potential distribution of Aconitum heterophyllum under current and future climatic scenarios. The results unfold that the distribution of this endemic species is governed significantly by bio12, i.e., Annual Precipitation. Ensemble modelling predicted that higher altitudes of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh are suitable habitats for A. heterophyllum. However, the future climatic modelling revealed that there will be a significant decrease in the suitable habitats for A. heterophyllum. Most of the shrinkage of habitats is predicted to occur within the time period of 2050, which seriously challenges their survival. The present study recommends an urgent need to frame a pertinent conservation and management policy for Aconitum heterophyllum and will act as a framework for planning such a policy.

AB  - Conservation decision-making often relies on species' distribution changes in response to anthropogenic disturbances but overlook their temporal responses. Filling the knowledge gap on the temporal shifts as elusive responses of wild animals to human activity is important because this may provide information for more proactive conservation planning. In this study, we used camera traps in a field survey technique to investigate the trade-offs between spatial and temporal responses of a mammal community to major human activities in Qinling Mountains, China. We focused on five most abundant mammalian species including giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), takin (Budorcas taxicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus), and Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus), and examined the drivers of, and the trade-offs between the change of their spatial distributions and daily activity patterns in response to anthropogenic disturbances. We found that in response to human interferences, giant panda and takin mainly changed their distributions, while wild boar, tufted deer and Chinese goral altered their daily activity patterns, indicating the elusive responses of the latter species under anthropogenic stressors. In addition, anthropogenic stressors such as farming and tourism have more profound impacts on mammal communities than previously revealed by species distribution modeling only. For nature reserves that aim to conserve multiple species simultaneously, a more flexible, adaptive management framework is thus needed to capture the trade-offs between multiple species' spatial and temporal responses to anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - The rapid ecological shifts that are occurring due to climate change present major challenges for managers and policymakers and, therefore, are one of the main concerns for environmental modelers and evolutionary biologists. Species distribution models (SDM) are appropriate tools for assessing the relationship between species distribution and environmental conditions, so being customarily used to forecast the biogeographical response of species to climate change. A serious limitation of species distribution models when forecasting the effects of climate change is that they normally assume that species behavior and climatic tolerances will remain constant through time. In this study, we propose a new methodology, based on fuzzy logic, useful for incorporating the potential capacity of species to adapt to new conditions into species distribution models. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to include different behavioral responses of species when predicting the effects of climate change on species distribution. Favorability models offered in this study show two extremes: one considering that the species will not modify its present behavior, and another assuming that the species will take full advantage of the possibilities offered by an increase in environmental favorability. This methodology may mean a more realistic approach to the assessment of the consequences of global change on species' distribution and conservation. Overlooking the potential of species' phenotypical plasticity may under- or overestimate the predicted response of species to changes in environmental drivers and its effects on species distribution. Using this approach, we could reinforce the science behind conservation planning in the current situation of rapid climate change.

AB  - Climate change is not only a major threat to biodiversity, it is also a big challenge to the development of conservation strategies. Scientists and practitioners need to select or avoid areas at greatest risk for species protection, i.e., acting in a proactive or a reactive manner. This proactive/reactive dichotomy takes a particular formulation under the likely changes in climate. Selecting for low-risk areas (usually referred to as climate refugia) is supposed to protect more species with a greater guarantee of their long-term persistence. As a consequence, populations at greatest risk are left unprotected and probably committed to extinction. On the other hand, managing species in high-risk areas is more expensive than setting aside areas of climate refugia and encompasses a set of uncertainties, which makes highly-threatened species more costly and difficult to save. Here, we combine ecological niche models and metrics of climate change to develop spatial conservation schemes for mammals in the Brazilian Amazon. These schemes efficiently identify networks of high-risk and refugia priority areas within species current and future distributions, while complementing the protection already achieved by the Amazon's network of protected areas (PAs). We found that, on average, 25% of mammal distribution is already represented in the established network of PAs. Also, 26% of high-risk and 17% of refugia priority areas overlap with indigenous lands. In addition, species distributions were found mostly in high-risk, compared to in refugia priority areas. We highlight that the strategy to be employed does not necessarily should be binary and a mix of both strategies would guarantee the protection of a larger number of species.

AB  - Resource limitations often prevent the active management required to maintain habitat quality in protected areas. Because restrictions in access or allowable public activities are the sole conservation measure in these locations, an important question to consider is whether species of conservation concern truly benefit from parcels that are shielded from human disturbance. Here, we assess the conservation benefit of protecting birds from human recreation on over 204 km of sandy beaches by (a) estimating the total area of beach-nesting bird habitat that has been created by conservation protections; (b) quantifying the change in nesting habitat extent should further conservation protections be implemented; and (c) providing data to inform future protected area expansion. We use a maximum entropy species distribution modeling approach to estimate the extent and quality of suitable habitat for four beach-nesting bird species of conservation concern under the existing management regime and compare it to scenarios in which the entire study area is either unprotected of fully protected from human disturbance. Managing humans has dramatic conservation returns for least terns and piping plovers, creating extensive nesting habitat that otherwise would not exist. There is considerable scope for conservation gains, potentially tripling the extent of nesting areas. Expanding conservation footprints for American oystercatchers and black skimmers is predicted to enhance the quality of existing nesting areas. The work demonstrates the utility of modeling changes in habitat suitability to inform protected area expansion on ocean beaches and coastal dunes.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) underpin the sustainable management of marine ecosystems but require accurate knowledge of species distributions. Recently, advances in tracking technology and habitat modelling have enabled the production of large-scale species distribution models (SDM), which provide the basis for hotspot mapping. In the UK, hotspot mapping to inform seabird MPA identification has involved converting observed or predicted distributions to polygons using either Maximum Curvature or Getis-Ord (Gi*) analysis. Here, we apply both mapping techniques to UK-wide, breeding season SDM predictions for four seabird species (Black-legged Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, Common Guillemots Uria aalge, Razorbills Aka torda and European Shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis) in order to compare their performance and inform seabird MPA. When using Maximum Curvature, grid cells within the identified maximum curvature boundaries were defined as hotspots. For Getis-Ord analysis, we defined hotspots as either (1) grid cells containing the top 1% or (2) the top 5% Gi* scores or (3) cells in which Gi* scores were statistically significant. Hotspots based upon Maximum Curvature or statistically significant Gi* scores covered the greatest area and were generally larger than current marine Special Protection Areas. Hotspots based on the top 1% or top 5% of Gi* scores were smaller and were concentrated around the largest breeding colonies. All hotspot methods consistently identified several high-density areas that should be prioritised for seabird conservation. Ultimately, the choice of hotspot identification method should be informed by considering species ecology alongside conservation goals to ensure hotspots are of sufficient size to protect target populations.

AB  - Determining a species' geographic range is important for conservation planning, yet this information is lacking for many raptors. In rapidly changing environments, defining current and predicting future distributions can help define priority areas for monitoring and research. The Laggar Falcon (Falco jugger) is a rare and understudied raptor resident across the Indian subcontinent, categorized as Near Threatened, with populations potentially in rapid decline. Using a Species Distribution Modelling framework we update current distribution and predict future distribution based on two future climate change scenarios for 2050. Our current distribution model had high predictive accuracy, and defined core areas of high climatic suitability in western India and southeastern Pakistan. Three bioclimatic variables contributed 79.9% to model prediction: mean temperature of the wettest quarter (50.1%), precipitation seasonality (17.6%), and precipitation in the driest month (12.2%). Projecting our model into climate change scenarios for 2050 resulted in up to 6% mean gain in suitable climate space for a lower emission scenario, but a 5% mean loss in suitable climate by 2050 in a high emissions scenario. All future predictive models showed similar multidirectional range movements within the current predicted core range. Based on these results, Laggar Falcon distribution may not be adversely affected by climate change. We recommend directed population surveys and monitoring based on current model predictions of areas of highest climate suitability, which are likely where Laggar Falcons will persist into the near future. Regular monitoring and research will enhance our knowledge for this raptor, while contributing further data to improve our model predictions.

AB  - We evaluated the vulnerability of nesting sites (sandbanks) available to Podocnemis expansa, P. unifilis and P. sextuberculata to human threats and the coverage of these areas by a public policy created to conserve turtles. Species distribution models were used to identify potential nesting areas in the Brazilian Amazon, where sandbanks were mapped through satellite imagery. Values of threats (deforestation, mining, dams and density of human communities) were normalized from 0 to 1 and summed in each 100 km2 pixel. We calculated the mean value of threats and sandbanks area for each basin. Basins with the greatest values for those variables were considered as the most vulnerable. We calculated the coverage of turtle nesting sites that have conservation actions in relation to the sandbanks available and if they are located in the most vulnerable basins. The areas of greatest gaps in conservation actions and vulnerability are located in the Tocantins-Araguaia basins and in rivers such as: Branco, Guapore ', Amazonas, Solimo similar to es, Madeira, Tapaj ' os and Xingu. Nesting sites included by the public policy covered 15.17 % of the number of basins and about 21 % of total sandbank areas, encompassing 11 % of the most vulnerable basins and 43 % of their sandbanks. We suggest the prioritization of conservation actions in areas of greatest gaps in conservation activities and vulnerability. In addition, we propose the articulation among institutions and the increase of initiatives of community-based conservation management to increase the geographical coverage of the greatest impacted regions.

AB  - Context. For conservation of any species, we need baseline data that will guide conservation planning strategies. Identifying plant resources used by animal species for food and shelter is the first important step towards fauna conservation. The second step is to determine the extent and distribution of these resources and thus identify prime habitat or habitat that could be improved through suitable management actions. This information provides the necessary spatial targeting required to make the most of few resources and a shortage of time.
   Aims. Applying this model approach, we identified plant species used as food or shelter resources by the conservationally significant quokka (Setonix brachyurus) across Rottnest Island, Western Australia in the aftermath of the hottest and driest summer on record.
   Methods. Dietary analysis was carried out using microhistological examination of plant cuticle remains from faecal samples for 67 locations across the island. Plants acting as diurnal rest shelters (n = 73 sites) were identified through observation of individuals flushed during surveys. Identifying key resources requires both a comprehensive analysis of the current use, as well as knowledge of availability of resources to determine selectivity. We therefore compared food plants or rest sites with a comprehensive survey of floristic diversity and abundance for 210 stratified-randomly located sites across the island.
   Key results. Weidentified eight plant species that quokkas fed on preferentially and identified four plant species that were the principal shelter sites. We then used hyperspectral remote sensing data to map the distribution of these plant species to quantify their distribution and identify key habitat areas.
   Conclusions. Understanding resource limitation over the most physiologically challenging time of the year provides important information for quokka conservation. Quokkas prefer Malvaceae species as food plants, and use dense, abundant shrubs for shelter.
   Implications. Quokkas appear to have shifted their use of food plants since a previous study (50 years ago), likely reflecting modification of island vegetation due to anthropogenic influences, fire and herbivory over time. In the face of changing climate, this information will serve as an important guide towards conservation management actions on the island (e.g. future planning of revegetation and habitat protection/enhancement).

AB  - Non-indigenous species (NIS) pose a major threat to biodiversity and the functioning and services of ecosystems. Despite their rapid spread in coastal waters worldwide, biotic invasions are widely disregarded in marine conservation planning. To guide conservation actions, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms determining the success of NIS are therefore needed. Here we develop a combined modelling approach to identify the key drivers and community assembly processes determining the occurrence of invasive benthic invertebrates, using Danish coastal waters as a case study. To reflect factors affecting the introduction, establishment and spread of NIS throughout the area, we compiled long-term monitoring data on NIS, as well as information on commercial shipping, environmental conditions and estimates of larvae settling densities derived from drift model simulations informed by species traits. We then applied a set of species distribution models to identify the key drivers determining the occurrence of NIS. Our results demonstrate a significant positive effect of vessel activity, a negative effect of depth and bottom salinity, as well as a positive effect of the simulated settling densities on the probability of presence. Taken together, our results highlight the role of commercial shipping, habitat characteristics and passive advection of early-life stages on the presence of NIS. Our combined modelling approach provide improved process understanding on the key community assembly processes determining the presence of NIS and may serve to guide monitoring, management and conservation planning in order to limit future invasions and their negative consequences on coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Aim Species distribution models and geographical information system (GIS) technologies are becoming increasingly important tools in conservation planning and decision-making. Often the rich data bases of museums and herbaria serve as the primary data for predicting species distributions. Yet key assumptions about the primary data often are untested, and violation of such assumptions may have consequences for model predictions. For example, users of primary data assume that sampling has been random with respect to geography and environmental gradients. Here we evaluate the assumption that plant voucher specimens adequately sample the climatic gradient and test whether violation of this assumption influences model predictions.
   Location Bolivia and Ecuador.
   Methods Using 323,711 georeferenced herbarium collections and nine climatic variables, we predicted the distribution of 76 plant species using maximum entropy models (MAXENT) with training points that sampled the climate environments randomly and training points that reflected the climate bias in the herbarium collections. To estimate the distribution of species, MAXENT finds the distribution of maximum entropy (i.e. closest to uniform) subject to the constraint that the expected value for each environmental variable under the estimated distribution matches its empirical average. The experimental design included species that differed in geographical range and elevation; all species were modelled with 20 and 100 training points. We examined the influence of the number of training points and climate bias in training points, elevation and range size on model performance using analysis of variance models.
   Results We found that significant parts of the climatic gradient were poorly represented in herbarium collections for both countries. For the most part, existing climatic bias in collections did not greatly affect distribution predictions when compared with an unbiased data set. Although the effects of climate bias on prediction accuracy were found to be greater where geographical ranges were characterized by high spatial variation in the degree of climate bias (i.e. ranges where the bias of the various climates sampled by collections deviated considerably from the mean bias), the greatest influence on model performance was the number of presence points used to train the model.
   Main conclusions These results demonstrate that predictions of species distributions can be quite good despite existing climatic biases in primary data found in natural history collections, if a sufficiently large number of training points is available. Because of consistent overprediction of models, these results also confirm the importance of validating models with independent data or expert opinion. Failure to include independent model validation, especially in cases where training points are limited, may potentially lead to grave errors in conservation decision-making and planning.

AB  - Detailed information on potentially suitable habitats and forecasted alterations thereof under climate change scenarios are critical for the conservation planning of endangered taxa, in particular those with small distribution ranges. The Huu Lien Tiger Gecko, Goniurosaurus huuliensis, is a is a micro-endemic species in northern Vietnam. The species is listed in the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered and in CITES Appendix II due to habitat loss and overexploitation for the international pet trade. Climate change has been globally acknowledged to impact on many species and it likely has negative influences on G. huuliensis. In this study, an ensemble modeling technique is employed, trained with climate and vegetation cover conditions, to identify the contemporary potential distribution of this species and assess its alterations under different climate change scenarios. Our predictions suggest that the current potential distribution of G. huuliensis mostly covers the known sites of occurrence and their surroundings. These areas will narrow significantly and/or shift towards higher latitudes under novel climate conditions as can be expected according to future IPCC scenarios. To safe-guard in-situ populations of G. huuliensis in the context of the potentially severe impacts, we provide a core refugia map that identifies key regions for priority conservation measures, including Lang Son Province and small sites in Bac Giang and Thai Nguyen Provinces, northern Vietnam. We highly recommend that the Huu Lien Nature Reserve be selected as a "centre" to kick-off conservation actions for the target species.

AB  - Conservation area networks (CAN) must overlap spatial patterns of conservation priorities in order to ensure their persistence. Threatened species are among the least controversial biodiversity features taken into account to guide conservation policies. Due to growing human pressure and climate change worldwide, chances of planning an effective CAN may be reduced. Santa Fe province is located in the center-east of Argentina and encompasses four bioregions highly threatened of the subtropical temperate South America. Intensive agriculture, livestock and hunting have led to the loss and degradation of its natural habitats and the current CAN fails on the coverage of bioregions. Our aim was to find out areas that enhance the persistence of threatened bird species in the Santa Fe province. We defined spatial conservation priorities that overlap environmentally suitable areas of species over time and overcome the likely impacts of human activity. Conservation priorities (top 20%) belonged mainly to Dry Chaco and Atlantic bioregions and will remain the same in the province. The current CAN mismatches spatial patterns of environmental suitability of threatened species. Sporophila hypochroma, Asthenes hudsoni and Spartonoica maluroides may lose more than half of their current environmentally suitable area in the future. Human activity will lead to a CAN which will require a great number of patches and a large perimeter. Searching for the most environmentally suitable areas of species over time while minimizing conflicts with human activities is a useful conservation strategy regardless the biogeographical context considered.

AB  - Over the past few years, predicting species spatial distributions has been recognized as a powerful tool for studying biological invasions in conservation biology and planning, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Species spatial distribution models (SDMs) are used extensively for assessing the effects of changes in habitat suitability, the impacts of climate change, and the realignment of the existing conservation priorities. SDMs relate known patterns of species occurrences to a specific set of environmental conditions. Accordingly, we have used MaxEnt SDM tool in order to provide habitat suitability models of 5 keynote fish species: European sprat ( Sprattus sprattus L. ), red mullet ( Mullus barbatus, L .), horse mackerel ( Trachurus mediterraneus, L .), bluefish ( Pomatomus saltatrix, L. ) and whiting ( Merlangius merlangus, L .), inhabiting the Bulgarian region of the Black Sea. Presence-only (PO) data collected by pelagic surveys performed between 2017 and 2019 was further utilized to link known species occurrence localities with selected abiotic factors, such as surface sea temperature and salinity, dissolved oxygen, and speed of currents. Biotic interactions were also considered for fitting the patterns of habitat suitability models. The SDMs, obtained from the present research study, prove to have satisfactory predictive accuracy to be further implemented for conservation measures and planning, stock management policy-making, or ecological forecasting.

AB  - Introduction: Climate change represents a problem that generates long-term impacts and is considered a threat to the conservation of many species. Objective: To evaluate the impact of climate change on the distribution areas of 10 trees species characteristic of cloud forests in the state of Oaxaca. Materials and methods: The impact was evaluated for two-time horizons (2050 and 2080) and two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) under the Had GEM2-ES general atmospheric circulation model. Current and future distribution was modeled with MaxEnt. The distribution of Carpinus tropicalis, Juglans pyriformis, Liquidambar styraciflua, Litsea glaucescens, Magnolia dealbata, Magnolia schiedeana, Ostrya virginiana, Symplocos coccinea, Zinowiewia concinna and Taxus globosa were obtained from the herbarium specimen review. Results and discussion: In RCP 4.5, J. pyriformis, L. styraciflua, L. glaucescens and S. coccinea increased (2.8 % to 20.5 %) their area of distribution. In this scenario, the rest of the species reduced their area by up to 30 % compared to the current distribution. In RCP 8.5-2050, J. pyriformis and O. virginiana had a gain of more than 5 %. All species showed a reduction greater than 10 % under the RCP 8.52080 scenario. The models showed area under the curve greater than 0.8 and partial ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) greater than 1.7. Conclusions: Understanding the response of 10 species to climate change will serve as a basis for proposing conservation and monitoring plans, since nine of them are in some category of risk.

In this regard, predicting potential invasion risks by IAPs is essential to support conservation planning into areas of high conservation value (AHCV) such as sites exhibiting exceptional botanical richness, assemblage of rare, and threatened and/or endemic plant species. Here, we identified AHCV in Georgia, a country showing high plant richness, and assessed the susceptibility of these areas to colonization by IAPs under present and future climatic conditions. We used actual protected areas and areas of high plant endemism (identified using occurrences of 114 Georgian endemic plant species) as proxies for AHCV. Then, we assessed present and future potential distribution of 27 IAPs using species distribution models under four climate change scenarios and stacked single-species potential distribution into a consensus map representing IAPs richness. We evaluated present and future invasion risks in AHCV using IAPs richness as a metric of susceptibility. We show that the actual protected areas cover only 9.4% of the areas of high plant endemism in Georgia. IAPs are presently located at lower elevations around the large urban centers and in western Georgia. We predict a shift of IAPs toward eastern Georgia and higher altitudes and an increased susceptibility of AHCV to IAPs under future climate change. Our study provides a good baseline for decision makers and stakeholders on where and how resources should be invested in the most efficient way to protect Georgia's high plant richness from IAPs.

AB  - Context Understanding the environmental and anthropogenic factors influencing habitat selection of multiple species is a foundation for quantifying human impacts on biodiversity and developing effective conservation measures. Objectives To determine the effect of multiple scales of environmental/topographic and anthropogenic variables and landscape patterns on habitat suitability of terrestrial mammals in Bhutan, assess the effectiveness of the current protected area network, identify areas of high species richness outside of the existing protected area, and evaluate the potential effectiveness of indicator and umbrella species for conservation planning. Methods We modelled multi-scale habitat selection of sixteen species of terrestrial mammals across Bhutan using data from a nation-wide camera trap survey. We used the predicted species distribution maps to assess the multi-species conservation effectiveness of the existing protected area network. We performed simulations to identify high priority areas for multiple species based on their habitat suitability, proximity to existing protected areas and overall connectivity within the predicted distribution of species. We used correlation analysis among predicted occurrence maps and multivariate cluster analysis to identify potential indicator species. We evaluated the potential utility of each species as umbrella species by assessing how well optimal protected areas for that species would protect suitable habitat for all 16 species simultaneously. Results Protected areas and forest cover were strongly associated with habitat use of most modelled species. Additionally, topographical features, like terrain roughness and slope position, contributed to habitat selection of multiple species, but often in different ways. Environmental and topographical variables were mostly selected at medium to broad scales. Anthropogenic variables (agriculture and built-up areas) were negatively associated with habitat suitability of most species at both fine and broad scales. Conservation effectiveness assessment of existing protected areas found protected areas in south-central Bhutan have high effectiveness in terms of both mean and total richness protected. Similarly, biological corridors in the south-central region offered high mean richness protection. Our simulation of optimal areas for additional protection found areas abutting protected areas in southern Bhutan offered high relative species richness protection. Our umbrella species analysis found muntjac, wild pig, serow, sambar and Asian golden cat are the most effective umbrella species for broader biodiversity protection. Our indicator species analysis found tiger, gaur, dhole, clouded leopard, Asian black bear and common leopard as effective indicator species. Conclusions This study highlights the need to protect optimally located species-rich areas outside the current protected areas. This kind of multi-species habitat assessment provides important information to optimize future conservation and development plans at national and regional scales.

AB  - Conservation genetics provides wildlife managers powerful tools to assist conservation planning, being recognized as an important biodiversity component. Nevertheless, communication between wildlife conservation actors is still not effective. Furthermore, wildlife conservation funds are often allocated to conservation actions incompatible with thorough long-term genetic research. In the Neotropics, the political organization of the territory, the complex socio-economic context, and the environmental heterogeneity impose additional challenges to the use of genetics for wildlife conservation. Here we present an assessment of the state-of-the-art on the conservation genetics of the giant anteater, as a study case. We use this species to discuss key wildlife threats and challenges along nine major Neotropical biomes. We review the main scientific research on the species, comprising and analyzing genetic data, and focusing on each biome and its region-specific threats. Our genetic meta-analysis reveals low levels of genetic diversity for the species, signs of population differentiation and dissimilar demographic trends per biome. Large-scale investigations are needed to disclose between hypotheses of panmixia, population structure and local adaptation, and to better assess the species demography. The limited information available for a known Vulnerable species perfectly illustrates the need for greater and internationally concerted investment in genetic/genomic research in the Neotropics. Finally, we describe the main wildlife conservation challenges per biome assessed, and present open research questions to which genetics could be of paramount importance.

AB  - Stemming biodiversity loss requires strategic conservation guided by well articulated targets, whether they be proactive (e.g., protect biodiverse areas) or reactive (e.g., protect threatened species). Both types of targets can be effective, but there are trade-offs, especially for broadly distributed taxa such as migratory species, a group for which conservation has been challenged by limited knowledge of distributions throughout the annual cycle. We combined spatiotemporal distribution models with population trend data to first examine focal areas for the conservation of Neotropical migratory birds (n = 112 species) during the non-breeding period in the Western Hemisphere, based on a proactive approach (highest diversity) versus a reactive approach (strongest declines). For focal areas, we then assessed the extent of recent anthropogenic impact, protected area status, and projected changes in land cover using shared socioeconomic pathways. Spatial priorities for high diversity emphasized southern Mexico and northern Central America, and were strikingly different from areas with species in stronger decline, emphasizing the Andean cordilleras. Only 1.4% of the non-breeding region met targets for diversity and decline, mostly in southern Central America. Areas prioritized to conserve high species diversity have experienced less recent anthropogenic impact than areas prioritized for species in decline but are predicted to experience more rapid land conversion to less suitable agricultural landscapes in the next three decades. Our findings indicate how efficient conservation efforts will depend on the careful consideration of desired targets combined with reliable predictions about the locations and types of land cover change under alternative socioeconomic futures.

AB  - During the last few decades, human-driven activities have led to indiscriminate habitat destruction and exploitation of many plant species in Kashmir Himalaya. As a result, many species have become threat-ened and are struggling for survival. Of particular concern are the endemic and critically endangered spe-cies which have the highest risk of the extinction, hence warranting immediate conservation actions. Therefore the current study was carried out to understand the distribution, ecology and conservation implications of the four critically endangered endemic plants of Kashmir Himalaya. Habitat distribution modelling showed that the suitable potential areas for the species occurred from subalpine to alpine meadowlands with an elevational range of 1500-4600 m asl. The output of the MaxEnt model and field surveys have revealed that their highest potential distribution is in Panchari, Khrew, Ramnagar, Pahalgam, Gurez, Sonamarg, Gulmarg and Kishtwar forest ranges. Based on the field explorations and herbarium records, Saussurea costus (Falc.) Lipsch have 27 distribution areas, Gentiana kurroo Royle 18, Lilium polyphyllum D. Don 12 and Aconitum chasmanthum Stapf have 15. Precipitation of the driest month and annual mean temperature played an important role in the distribution of the studied species. The species started their lifecycle with the onset of the spring season, flowered in summer, fruit in autumn and senesce in the winter season. Under natural conditions, the number of days required for germination ranged from 180 to 210 where cold stratification played a pivotal role. Since last few decades, the pop-ulations of these species have been shrinking in their natural habitats due to over-exploitation for medic-inal purposes and habitat destruction through amplified humanoid interferences like the expansion of agricultural land, road building, grazing and urbanization. Thus there is an urgent need to come up with positive strategies to save whatever is left and plan long term rescue measures not only to protect these species from extinction but also to reintroduce them along with framing the plans to supply sustained raw materials for medicine.

AB  - Data scarcity impedes a comprehensive impact assessment of the 38 dams currently proposed within the highly biodiverse central African nation of Gabon. Here, we present a multiple-species MaxEnt distribution modeling approach to assess species richness for freshwater fishes at the landscape level and demonstrate its utility in identifying proposed dam sites in Gabon that fall in highly diverse areas. We modeled habitat suitability for 202 of Gabon's fresh and brackish water fish species based on georeferenced presence data from museum specimens and a set of ecologically meaningful environmental conditions. We removed poor performing species from the model and compiled the distributions of 114 well-performing species to generate a new metric, the species pseudorichness index (pR), defined as the cumulative number of species that are highly suited to the habitat in a given segment of river. We used pR as a proxy for true species richness and use this metric to evaluate the distribution of freshwater fish diversity relative to the proposed dam development in Gabon. We found that more than 80% of the proposed dams in Gabon overlap with areas of high pR, implying that planned hydroelectric development in Gabon may disproportionately affect high diversity areas. These dams deserve more focused baseline assessments and conservation action. This approach provides a rapid way to initiate a landscape-scale assessment of freshwater fish diversity to inform conservation decisions in areas that are species rich, but data poor.

AB  - To date, the predominant use of systematic conservation planning has been to evaluate and conserve areas of high terrestrial biodiversity. Although studies in freshwater ecosystems have received recent attention, research has rarely considered the potential trade-offs between protecting different dimensions of biodiversity and the ecological processes that maintain diversity. We provide the first systematic prioritization for freshwaters (focusing on the highly threatened and globally distinct fish fauna of the Lower Colorado River Basin, USA) simultaneously considering scenarios of: taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity; contemporary threats to biodiversity (including interactions with nonnative species); and future climate change and human population growth. There was 75% congruence between areas of highest conservation priority for different aspects of biodiversity, suggesting that conservation efforts can concurrently achieve strong complementarity among all types of diversity. However, sizable fractions of the landscape were incongruent across conservation priorities for different diversity scenarios, underscoring the importance of considering multiple dimensions of biodiversity and highlighting catchments that contribute disproportionately to taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity in the region. Regions of projected human population growth were not concordant with conservation priorities; however, higher human population abundance will likely have indirect effects on native biodiversity by increasing demand for water. This will come in direct conflict with projected reductions in precipitation and warmer temperatures, which have substantial overlap with regions of high contemporary diversity. Native and endemic fishes in arid ecosystems are critically endangered by both current and future threats, but our results highlight the use of systematic conservation planning for the optimal allocation of limited resources that incorporates multiple and complementary conservation values describing taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity.

AB  - Spatial conservation prioritization concerns trade-offs between marine conservation and resource exploitation. This approach has been increasingly used to devise spatial management strategies for fisheries because of its simplicity in the optimization model and less data requirement compared to complex dynamic models. However, most of the prioritization is based on static models or algorithms; whose solutions need to be evaluated in a dynamic approach, considering the high uncertainty and opportunity costs associated with their implementation. We developed a framework that integrates species distribution models, spatial conservation prioritization tools and a general grid-based dynamic model (Grid-DM) to support evaluation of ecological and economic trade-offs of candidate conservation plans. The Grid-DM is spatially explicit and has a tactical management focus on single species. We applied the Grid-DM to small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) in Haizhou Bay, China and validated its spatial and temporal performances against historical observations. It was linked to a spatial conservation prioritization tool Marxan to illustrate how the model can be used for conservation strategy evaluation. The simulation model demonstrated effectiveness in capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of the target fishery as well as the socio-ecological effects of conservation measures. We conclude that the model has the capability and flexibility to address various forms of uncertainties, simulate the dynamics of a targeted fishery, and to evaluate biological and socioeconomic impacts of management plans. The modelling platform can further inform scientists and policy makers of management alternatives screening and adaptive conservation planning.

AB  - Conservation interventions in developing countries are frequently thwarted by socio-economic agendas, severely limiting the scope and rigor of biodiversity and habitat conservation. Very few ecological assessments incorporate human interests in conservation prioritization, creating asynchrony between planning and implementation. For conservation actions to be logistically feasible, multiple criteria including ecological, social, economic and administrative aspects must be considered. Understanding how these different dimensions interact spatially is also important for gauging the potential for conservation success. Here, we use a guild of select mammalian carnivores (wild canids and hyenas) in India to (i) generate distribution maps at the spatial scale of administrative sub-districts, that are relevant to management, (ii) examine ecological, social and biogeographic factors associated with their distribution, assess key threats, and identify areas important for their conservation, (iii) use prioritization tools for balancing habitat conservation, human needs and economic growth, and (iv) evaluate the spatial congruence between areas with high conservation potential, and areas currently in focus for protection efforts, conservation investments, and infrastructure development. We find that the current Protected Area system does not adequately cover or represent diverse habitats, that there is immense potential for States to increase financial investments towards alternative conservation strategies, and, most infrastructure projects may be potentially jeopardizing important carnivore habitats where the two overlap. Our framework allowed for identifying locations where conservation investments would lead to the highest benefits for carnivores as flagships, which also benefit other species across habitats. We make a case for re-evaluating how large-scale prioritization assessments are made, and for broadening the purview of conservation policies in India and other developing countries.

AB  - Aim The Appalachian forests ecoregion in eastern North America supports a diverse and highly endemic temperate biota, which is potentially threatened by rapid climate change. We investigated possible outlooks for biodiversity in this biologically important ecoregion under future climate change. Location Appalachian forests ecoregion, USA. Methods We estimated distributional shifts for 258 forest-dependent vertebrates of conservation concern in four major taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles) under short- (2040) and long-term (2080s) climate change using ecological niche modelling. We examined which groups are likely most vulnerable to climate change and identified places predicted to experience the greatest changes in their species assemblages and those predicted to support high species richness under various future scenarios. To assess species' vulnerability, we compared and regressed future projected range against present range estimates for each species. To evaluate which places could see greatest changes, we mapped species richness and turnover in each taxonomic group. Results A total of 30%-33% and 31%-38% of species were predicted to lose > 50% of area that is currently climatically suitable under short- and long-term climate change, respectively. We expect climate change to impact amphibians and mammals more than birds and reptiles: a much larger fraction of amphibian and mammal (22%-48% in 2040; 29%-56% in 2080s) species were predicted to lose more than half of their present climatically suitable habitat area compared with birds and reptiles (1%-12% in 2040; 6%-12% in 2080s). While species were predicted to move northward and upslope assuming full dispersal, the Blue Ridge, Cumberland Plateau and southern Central Appalachians subregions are poised to remain as richness hotspots under the broad range of scenarios explored in this study. Main conclusions Our results highlighted species groups and locations that policymakers and conservation practitioners should emphasize in planning vertebrate conservation efforts in the Appalachians under future climate scenarios.

AB  - The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove ecosystem in the world, is under threat from historical and future human exploitation and sea level rise. Limited scientific knowledge on the spatial ecology of the mangroves in this world heritage ecosystem has been a major impediment to conservation efforts. Here, for the first time, we report on habitat suitability analyses and spatial density maps for the four most prominent mangrove species - Heritiera fomes, Excoecaria agallocha, Ceriops decandra and Xylocarpus mekongensis. Globally endangered H. fomes abundances declined as salinity increased. Responses to nutrients, elevation, and stem density varied between species. H. fomes and X. mekongensis preferred upstream habitats. E. agallocha and C. decandra preferred down-stream and mid-stream habitats. Historical harvesting had negative influences on H. fomes, C. decandra and X. mekongensis abundances. The established protected area network does not support the most suitable habitats of these threatened species. We therefore recommend a reconfiguration of the network to include these suitable habitats and ensure their immediate protection. These novel habitat insights and spatial predictions can form the basis for future forest studies and spatial conservation planning, and have implications for more effective conservation of the Sundarbans mangroves and the many other species that rely on them.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to predict species occurrence and to seek insight into the factors behind observed spatial patterns in occurrence, and thus can be a valuable tool in species conservation. In this study, we used MaxEnt software to explain the occurrence of a protected forest-dwelling species, the Siberian flying squirrel. We produce occurrence maps covering the main distribution area for the species in the European Union. Using an exceptionally extensive presence-absence dataset collected with a standardized method, we evaluated the relative role of predation pressure, climate, and amount of habitat affecting flying squirrel occurrence. We found that regional variation in mean winter temperature had relatively large predictive power for flying squirrel occurrence. In addition, the regional abundance of flying squirrels was partly explained by differences in predation pressure. The results also support the conclusion that areas with older forests and nearby agricultural areas are optimal for the species. Our study shows that multiple factors affect the species' occurrence in large spatial scales. We also conclude that climate is having a large effect on species occurrence, and thus the changing climate has to be taken into account in conservation planning. Our results help conservation managers in targeting surveys and protection measures on various spatial scales, and decision makers in focusing on the factors that drive the species' occurrence. Our results also indicate that we would need additional tools and measures in the EU for achieving a favourable conservation status of those species that occur in commercial forests.

AB  - A range of conceptual models can be used to characterize landscapes. The type of model used is important because it can have a strong influence on the understanding of biotic responses to landscape change and on the conservation recommendations that might be made. Conceptual landscape models vary from single-species ones that are based on a species perspective of a landscape (e.g. the landscape contour model) to those based on a human perspective of a landscape. Examples of this second group of landscape models include extremely well-known and widely applied ones such as the island model, the patch-matrix-corridor model and the variegation model. The different models have different strengths and limitations. However, these are rarely considered in landscape and conservation planning and many workers appear to be captive to a particular conceptual framework and particular model (especially the island and patch-matrix-corridor models).

AB  - Species occurrence and abundance models are important tools that can be used in biodiversity conservation, and can be applied to predict or plan actions needed to mitigate the environmental impacts of hydropower dams. In this study our objectives were: (i) to model the occurrence and abundance of threatened plant species, (ii) to verify the relationship between predicted occurrence and true abundance, and (iii) to assess whether models based on abundance are more effective in predicting species occurrence than those based on presence-absence data. Individual representatives of nine species were counted within 388 randomly georeferenced plots (10 m x 50 m) around the Barra Grande hydropower dam reservoir in southern Brazil. We modelled their relationship with 15 environmental variables using both occurrence (Generalised Linear Models) and abundance data (Hurdle and Zero-Inflated models). Overall, occurrence models were more accurate than abundance models. For all species, observed abundance was significantly, although not strongly, correlated with the probability of occurrence. This correlation lost significance when zero-abundance (absence) sites were excluded from analysis, but only when this entailed a substantial drop in sample size. The same occurred when analysing relationships between abundance and probability of occurrence from previously published studies on a range of different species, suggesting that future studies could potentially use probability of occurrence as an approximate indicator of abundance when the latter is not possible to obtain. This possibility might, however, depend on life history traits of the species in question, with some traits favouring a relationship between occurrence and abundance. Reconstructing species abundance patterns from occurrence could be an important tool for conservation planning and the management of threatened species, allowing scientists to indicate the best areas for collection and reintroduction of plant germplasm or choose conservation areas most likely to maintain viable populations.

AB  - Background. Climate change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, pushing species to shift their distribution ranges and making existing protected areas inadequate. Estimating species distribution and potential modifications under climate change are then necessary for adjusting conservation and management plans; this is especially true for endangered species. An example of this issue is the huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus), an endemic endangered deer from the southern Andes Range, with less than 2,000 individuals. It is distributed in fragmented populations along a 2,000 km latitudinal gradient, in Chile and Argentina. Several threats have reduced its distribution to <50% of its former range.
   Methods. To estimate its potential distribution and protected areas effectiveness, we constructed a species distribution model using 2,813 huemul presence points throughout its whole distribution range, together with 19 bioclimatic layers and altitude information from Worldclim. Its current distribution was projected for years 2050 and 2070 using five different Global Climate Models estimated for scenarios representing two carbon Representative Concentration Routes (RCP)-RCP4.5 and RCP6.0.
   Results. Based on current huemul habitat variables, we estimated 91,617 km(2) of suitable habitat. In future scenarios of climate change, there was a loss of suitable habitat due to altitudinal and latitudinal variation. Future projections showed a decrease of 59.86-60.26% for the year 2050 and 58.57-64.34% for the year 2070 according to RCP4.5 and RCP6.0, respectively. Protected areas only covered only 36.18% of the present distribution, 38.57-34.94% for the year 2050 and 30.79-31.94% for 2070 under climate change scenarios.
   Discussion. Modeling current and future huemul distributions should allow the establishment of priority conservation areas in which to focus efforts and funds, especially areas without official protection. In this way, we can improve management in areas heavily affected by climate change to help ensure the persistence of this deer and other species under similar circumstances worldwide.

AB  - Regional conservation planning increasingly draws on habitat suitability models to support decisions regarding land allocation and management. Nevertheless, statistical techniques commonly used for developing such models may give misleading results because they fail to account for 3 factors common in data sets of species distribution: spatial autocorrelation, the large number of sites where the species is absent (zero inflation), and uneven survey effort. We used spatial autoregressive models fit with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to assess the relationship between older coniferous forest and the abundance of Northern Spotted Owl nest and activity sites throughout the species' range. The spatial random-effect term incorporated in the autoregressive models successfully accounted for zero inflation and reduced the effect of survey bias on estimates of species-habitat associations. Our results support the hypothesis that the relationship between owl distribution and older forest varies with latitude. A quadratic relationship between owl abundance and older forest was evident in the southern portion of the range, and a pseudothreshold relationship was evident in the northern portion of the range. Our results suggest that proposed changes to the network of owl habitat reserves would reduce the proportion of the population protected by up to one-third, and that proposed guidelines for forest management within reserves underestimate the proportion of older forest associated with maximum owl abundance and inappropriately generalize threshold relationships among subregions. Bayesian spatial models can greatly enhance the utility of habitat analysis for conservation planning because they add the statistical flexibility necessary for analyzing regional survey data while retaining the interpretability of simpler models.

AB  - There have been few targeted studies of small felids in Sumatra and there is little information on their ecology. As a result there are no specific management plans for the species on Sumatra. We examined data from a long-term camera trapping effort, and used Maximum Entropy Modeling to assess the habitat use and distribution of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi), Asiatic golden cats (Pardofelis temminckii), leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis), and marbled cats (Pardofelis marmorata) in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. Over a period of 34,166 trap nights there were low photo rates (photo events/100 trap nights) for all species; 0.30 for golden cats, 0.15 for clouded leopards, 0.10 for marbled cats, and 0.08 for leopard cats. There is overlap in the predicted distributions of clouded leopards, golden cats, and marbled cats; indicating areas of high conservation importance for these species within the park. The predicted distribution of leopard cats was discrete from the other species which is important to consider in the development of conservation strategies. This study provides important documentation of small felid distribution in Sumatra, information for the development of management strategies within the park, and a basis upon which to develop future research for the species.

AB  - Empirical studies and habitat suitability modeling project significant shifts in species distributions in response to climate change. Because habitat fragmentation can impede species range shifts, wildlife corridors may have increasing importance in enhancing climate resilience for species persistence. While habitat connectivity has been studied for over four decades, the design of connectivity specifically to facilitate species movement in response to climate change is a relatively new challenge. We conducted a systematic review of 116 relevant papers from 1996-2017. Research focused on assessing the utility of habitat connectivity for climate change adaptation by species (N = 29) and modeling and mapping climate-wise connectivity for planning purposes (N = 55). Others addressed fundamental questions of connectivity related to climate adaptation (N = 31). Based on empirical data and computer simulations examining species range shifts in response to climate change at leading edges of current distributions; it is clear that large protected areas connected through linkages, and stepping stones embedded in a permeable matrix promote population persistence and facilitate range expansion. We identified 13 approaches to modeling climate-wise connectivity based on either focal species or landscape structure. When prioritizing areas for connectivity conservation, approaches include focusing on connecting areas of low climate velocity, refugia, climate analogs, or linking current to future suitable habitats. Riparian corridors should be considered in connectivity plans because of their importance as natural movement corridors, climate gradients, and refugia. Guidance is provided on selecting the best methods for connectivity design depending on the objectives, available data, and landscape context. Future research needs to evaluate the functionality of climate-wise connectivity models for facilitating range shifts and compare connectivity outcomes across modeling approaches.

AB  - The distribution of the Eurasian badger (Meles meles, L.) in the Netherlands is fragmented and adult mortality is high in many places because of traffic casualties. Both these facts affect the survival and dispersal of badgers in a negative way and are suggested to be the main causes of the decline of this species. For this reason the species receives special attention from the government in the national Nature Policy Plan and also from the lower administration in the provinces in their policy on physical planning and nature conservation, To evaluate changes in land use by means of spatial scenarios and conservation strategies in favour of the species, an individual-based simulation model was built that describes population dynamics in space and time. The model was used to evaluate three scenarios. The results indicate that the survival of groups benefits strongly from measures directed at lowering adult mortality. Also the (re)colonization of suitable but not inhabited areas increases the survival and is favoured by measures that encourage dispersal. The results indicate that simulation models as described are useful tools for establishing the comparative effectiveness of plans or measures aimed at increasing the viability of the species.

AB  - Conservation of any taxon requires sound information on its distribution and abundance. Modern area selection techniques are critically dependent especially on distribution data, yet for poorly surveyed taxa, such as invertebrates, these are often not available. In this paper we bring together gradsect biological survey methods and protected area selection algorithms to address this problem. We present an approach which places survey routes, based on the gradsect survey design method of spanning maximum environmental gradients, in areas poorly or completely unsurveyed/sampled. This record absence gradient selection' technique can be used to plan further efficient and effective field surveys for the collection of distribution data for inadequately sampled taxa. This method is not intended as a replacement for distribution modelling techniques, but rather as an addition to the toolbox used by conservation planners.

AB  - Effective monitoring of the current status of species distributions and predicting future distributions are very important for conservation practices at the ecosystem and species levels. The human population, land use, and climate are important factors that influence the distributions of species. Even though future simulations have many uncertainties, such studies can provide a means of obtaining species distributions, range shifts, and food production and help mitigation and adaptation planning. Here, we simulate the population, land use/land cover and species distributions in the Eastern Ghats, India. A MaxEnt species distribution model was used to simulate the potential habitats of a group of endemic (28 species found in this region) and rare, endangered, and threatened (RET) (22 species found in this region) plant species on the basis of IPCC AR5 scenarios developed for 2050 and 2070. Simulations of populations in 2050 indicate that they will increase at a rate of 1.12% relative to the base year, 2011. These increases in population create a demand for more land for settlement and food productions. Land use land cover (LULC) simulations show an increase in built-up land from 3665.00 km(2) in 2015 to 3989.56 km(2) by 2050. There is a minor increase of 0.04% in the area under agriculture in 2050 compared with 2015. On the other hand, the habitat simulations show that the combined effects of climate and land use change have a greater influence on the decline of potential distributions of species. Climate change and the prevailing rate of LULC change will reduce the extents of the habitats of endemic and RET species (60% and 40%, respectively). The Eastern Ghats have become extensively fragmented due to human activities and have become a hotspot of endemic and RET species loss. Climate and LULC change will enhance the species loss and ecosystem services.

AB  - An understanding of cetacean distribution is necessary to gain insights into crucial ecological processes for species conservation management. However, cetacean habitat preference and distribution in the northern Savu Sea, Indonesia, are still poorly understood. We use maximum entropy modeling with five environmental predictors to describe habitat preference and distribution of seven cetacean species in the northern Savu Sea. Our study confirms that static predictors are the most important variables in explaining habitat preferences of seven cetacean species in the northern Savu Sea. Seasonally, each cetacean species has a different environmental preference.Globicephala macrorhynchusprefers the open nearshore areas adjacent to deep waters.Stenella attenuatais associated with nearshore habitats and higher productivity areas.Stenella longirostrisprefers nearshore habitat during coastal upwelling events.Tursiops truncatusprefers nearshore sheltered habitat.Grampus griseushabitats are highly related to depth and steep gradients around the isobaths of 200-1,000 m.Feresa attenuataare associated with deep waters and cooler sea temperature.Pseudorca crassidensprefers protective bays with productive waters. This study provides important information for reviewing marine spatial plans of the northern Savu Sea, specifically on managing species fisheries interaction, optimizing surveillance, and regulating marine traffic.

AB  - Data on species occurrence at the scale of their distributional range and the determination of their habitat use requirements are essential to support conservation and define management plans that account for their habitat requirements. For wideranging species, such as cetaceans, especially considering that their marine habitats include offshore areas, collection of such data is challenging. In the absence of dedicated surveys, alternative methodologies are needed, such as the use of data collected from platforms of opportunity and modelling techniques to predict distribution in unsurveyed areas. Using 6 years of cetacean occurrence data collected along cargo ship routes between the Iberian Peninsula, northwestern African coasts and the Macaronesian islands, we developed ecological niche models to assess habitat preferences and predict suitable habitats of the eight most frequently sighted cetacean taxa in the area. Explanatory variables used for model fitting included topographic, oceanographic, detectability, geographic and seasonal features. To provide a robust habitat characterisation, along with predictions of habitat suitability, making best use of occurrence datasets, we applied two modelling techniques, GAM and Maxent, which offer complementary strengths. Coastal areas provide important habitats for common and bottlenose dophins, while other dolphin species (spotted and striped dolphins) have a more oceanic distribution. The predicted niches of Cuvier's beaked whale and minke whales are mainly in the high seas at northern latitudes. Suitable habitats for sperm whales and pilot whales are mostly in southern areas in continental slope regions. For all the species, models indicated that areas around seamount features offer suitable habitats, likely of high relevance in oligotrophic offshore waters. As such, dedicated survey effort in such areas would facilitate development and implementation of appropriate management plans, which are currently lacking. Our models offer an important contribution to baseline knowledge of cetacean distribution at basin-scale in the region and could support the definition of priority areas, monitoring plans, and conservation measures, essential to comply with the requirements of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

AB  - It is increasingly recognized that biotic interactions could play a significant role in species distribution modelling. To assess the conservation effectiveness of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) reserves in a changing climate, we combined both biotic variables (food availability) and abiotic (climatic and geographic) to project the potential changes of distribution and quality of giant panda habitats using the most recent IPCC-CMIP5 climate scenarios. Our results suggested that climate change would adversely affect giant pandas through habitat degradation, in that: (1) 52.9-71.3% of the current habitats could be lost; (2) the giant panda habitats could become more fragmented and isolated; and (3) both the quantity and quality of habitats in the current giant panda reserves could substantially contract, and approximately 20% of the reserves could lose all habitat representations in this century. Additionally, we found that climate change would make it increasingly necessary to translocate small populations of pandas from the southwestern to the northwestern part of the current distribution range to ensure population viability. Our results suggest the need for immediate change in current conservation policies and formulating adaptation plans for giant panda conservation in a changing climate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is a threat to biodiversity, and adaptation measures should be considered in biodiversity conservation planning. Protected areas (PA) are expected to be impacted by climate change and improving their connectivity with biological corridors (BC) has been proposed as a potential adaptation measure, although assessing its effectiveness remains a challenge. In Mesoamerica, efforts to preserve the biodiversity have led to the creation of a regional network of PA and, more recently, BC. This study evaluates the role of BC for facilitating plant dispersal between PA under climate change in Mesoamerica. A spatially explicit dynamic model (cellular automaton) was developed to simulate species dispersal under different climate and conservation policy scenarios. Plant functional types (PFT) were defined based on a range of dispersal rates and vegetation types to represent the diversity of species in the region. The impacts of climate change on PA and the role of BC for dispersal were assessed spatially. Results show that most impacted PA are those with low altitudinal range in hot, dry, or high latitude areas. PA with low altitudinal range in high cool areas benefit the most from corridors. The most important corridors cover larger areas and have high altitude gradients. Only the fastest PFT can keep up with the expected change in climate and benefit from corridors for dispersal. We conclude that the spatial assessment of the vulnerability of PA and the role of corridors in facilitating dispersal can help conservation planning under a changing climate.

AB  - Background: A number of conservation and societal issues require understanding how species are distributed on the landscape, yet ecologists are often faced with a lack of data to develop models at the resolution and extent desired, resulting in inefficient use of conservation resources. Such a situation presented itself in our attempt to develop waterfowl distribution models as part of a multi-disciplinary team targeting the control of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in China.
   Methods: Faced with limited data, we built species distribution models using a habitat suitability approach for China's breeding and non-breeding (hereafter, wintering) waterfowl. An extensive review of the literature was used to determine model parameters for habitat modeling. Habitat relationships were implemented in GIS using land cover covariates. Wintering models were validated using waterfowl census data, while breeding models, though developed for many species, were only validated for the one species with sufficient telemetry data available.
   Results: We developed suitability models for 42 waterfowl species (30 breeding and 39 wintering) at 1 km resolution for the extent of China, along with cumulative and genus level species richness maps. Breeding season models showed highest waterfowl suitability in wetlands of the high-elevation west-central plateau and northeastern China. Wintering waterfowl suitability was highest in the lowland regions of southeastern China. Validation measures indicated strong performance in predicting species presence. Comparing our model outputs to China's protected areas indicated that breeding habitat was generally better covered than wintering habitat, and identified locations for which additional research and protection should be prioritized.
   Conclusions: These suitability models are the first available for many of China's waterfowl species, and have direct utility to conservation and habitat planning and prioritizing management of critically important areas, providing an example of how this approach may aid others faced with the challenge of addressing conservation issues with little data to inform decision making.

AB  - Conservation management often requires decision-making without perfect knowledge of the at-risk species or ecosystem. Species distribution models (SDMs) are useful but largely under-utilized due to model uncertainty. We used an ensemble modeling approach of two independently derived SDMs to explicitly address common modeling impediments and directly inform conservation decision-making for piping plovers in a heavily populated mid-Atlantic (USA) coastal zone. We summarized previously published Bayesian network and maximum entropy models to highlight similarities and differences in structure, and we compared the relative importance of predictors used. Despite differences in analytical approach, relative importance of factors driving nest-site selection was consistent. Models demonstrated considerable agreement when comparing a binary (suitable/unsuitable) measure of suitability. Instances of model consensus (i.e., overlapping areas of predicted piping plover nesting habitat between models) provide a stronger "signal" in model results, reducing uncertainty related to biases or errors associated with either model. We tested model accuracy using a common dataset of plover nests initiated within the focal areas between 2013 and 2015, and we examined congruency in model outputs. Nearly, 90% of all nests occurred in areas predicted suitable by at least one model, and at least 33% of the total nests were predicted in areas suitable by both. Because models predominantly agreed on what drives piping plover nest-site selection, areas predicted suitable by a single model should not be discounted. This case study demonstrates how models can effectively inform conservation planning by explicitly identifying the management objective, presenting robust evidence to allow managers to evaluate outcomes of alternative management decisions, and clearly communicating results that address real-world conservation problems. Our results can greatly increase the piping plover management community's ability to prioritize candidate sites for future protection, manage existing nesting habitat appropriately, and make a compelling case for conservation actions against competing land use objectives.

AB  - Chia-Ying Ko, Ruey-Shing Lin, Tzung-Su Ding, Chih-Hao Hsieh, and Pei-Fen Lee (2009) Identifying biodiversity hotspots by predictive models: a case study using Taiwan's endemic bird species. Zoological Studies 48(3): 418-431. Predicting species distributions and identifying biodiversity hotspots are essential in designing conservation strategies. Because of different spatial scales and/or species characteristics, uncertainty still exist as to which model is the best. Several models have been proposed to calculate the probability of species occurrences, predict biodiversity hotspots, and decide importance levels of those hotspots. We constructed predictive distribution models for 14 of 16 endemic bird species in Taiwan using a fine-resolution (1 x 1 km) breeding bird distribution dataset compiled over the past decade as well as environmental variables. We compared the performances of the 4 models: logistic regression (I-R), multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP), and artificial neural network (ANN). Maps for biodiversity hotspots were generated based on the species distributions from the 4 models. To account for potential uncertainty, we constructed hotspot maps using a frequency histogram and probability density function approaches. Based on the distribution maps and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, all of our models made good predictions for each species (all AUC values were > 0.75). The nonlinear models (GARP, ANN, and LR) provided better predictions than did the linear (MDA) model. GARP was the most consistent model when evaluated by it kappa, sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity values for each species and the 3 species categories (common, uncommon, and rare species). The prevalence of all species did not affect the final predictive performance. The 5 biodiversity hotspot maps derived from the frequency histogram approach showed a relatively similar pattern to maps generated by the probability density function, which indicated that of mid- to high-elevation areas had higher probabilities. In spite of some inconsistencies, the hotspot maps identified from these 2 approaches were fairly representative when evaluated against currently known hotspots. A GAP analysis indicated only 25% of the hotspots are currently protected by national parks. We concluded that the LR, GARP, ANN, and MIDA models are all feasible to use for modeling bird species distributions. Although there were some limitations, we suggest using a combination approach to identify common features and conservation priorities of biodiversity hotspots. Comparing known and predicted hotspots can promote the reliability of the models as well as provide managers with greater confidence when planning conservation policies. Finally, this approach to identifying common features and conservation priorities of biodiversity hotspots can be applied to evaluate conservation efforts and provide a better tool to achieve efficient conservation. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.3/418.pdf

AB  - Moist, mixed conifer (MMC) forests, which encompass more than 11 million ha in the Inland Northwest, USA and adjacent Canada, were extensively modified after Euro-american occupation by now-outdated forestry practices and wildfire suppression. Those activities homogenized tree composition and density, modified forest soils, increased risks to insect and disease epidemics, and, in combination with longer drought periods ultimately increased the prevalence of unusually severe wildfires to further homogenize landscapes. Recommendations for restoring structure and function include re-establishing natural fire regimes and disturbance-patch size distributions across landscapes, as well as restoring and maintaining large, old early-seral dominant trees (LOEST), large snags and coarse woody debris, while accounting for physiographic influences. Implementing such recommendations with sensitivity to wildlife conservation requires additional details to account for habitat needs at the planning levels of national forests and districts. We synthesized silviculture-specific literature for wildlife species of greatest conservation concern listed in the strategic wildlife conservation plans of Inland Northwest states ("strategy" species), others of social and economic importance ("focal" species), and some others that are either important in the ecologies of strategy species or otherwise offer literature having particular relevance to MMC silviculture ("facilitative" species). Evaluations of habitat selection behavior and comparisons of species specific habitat values to tree-stocking guidelines used by silviculturists indicated that most species reviewed are likely to respond positively to restoration, and that a wide array of extant silvicultural methods can be used, provided that large snags and acceptable levels of coarse woody debris are recruited or retained. Thinning followed by routine prescribed burning will be problematic for some wildlife species. Knowledge of wildlife responses to variation in the size distribution of disturbance patches is limited, as is knowledge of wildlife population responses to intentional forestry. Coupling new wildlife research to forest modeling and manipulative experiments within adaptive management and monitoring frameworks will improve predictions of wildlife population responses over the long time frames and multiple spatial scales associated with strategic planning.

AB  - Background: The Andes-Amazon basin of Peru and Bolivia is one of the most data-poor, biologically rich, and rapidly changing areas of the world. Conservation scientists agree that this area hosts extremely high endemism, perhaps the highest in the world, yet we know little about the geographic distributions of these species and ecosystems within country boundaries. To address this need, we have developed conservation data on endemic biodiversity (similar to 800 species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and plants) and terrestrial ecological systems (similar to 90; groups of vegetation communities resulting from the action of ecological processes, substrates, and/or environmental gradients) with which we conduct a fine scale conservation prioritization across the Amazon watershed of Peru and Bolivia. We modelled the geographic distributions of 435 endemic plants and all 347 endemic vertebrate species, from existing museum and herbaria specimens at a regional conservation practitioner's scale (1: 250,000-1: 1,000,000), based on the best available tools and geographic data. We mapped ecological systems, endemic species concentrations, and irreplaceable areas with respect to national level protected areas.
   Results: We found that sizes of endemic species distributions ranged widely (< 20 km(2) to > 200,000 km(2)) across the study area. Bird and mammal endemic species richness was greatest within a narrow 2500-3000 m elevation band along the length of the Andes Mountains. Endemic amphibian richness was highest at 1000-1500 m elevation and concentrated in the southern half of the study area. Geographical distribution of plant endemism was highly taxon-dependent. Irreplaceable areas, defined as locations with the highest number of species with narrow ranges, overlapped slightly with areas of high endemism, yet generally exhibited unique patterns across the study area by species group. We found that many endemic species and ecological systems are lacking national-level protection; a third of endemic species have distributions completely outside of national protected areas. Protected areas cover only 20% of areas of high endemism and 20% of irreplaceable areas. Almost 40% of the 91 ecological systems are in serious need of protection (= < 2% of their ranges protected).
   Conclusions: We identify for the first time, areas of high endemic species concentrations and high irreplaceability that have only been roughly indicated in the past at the continental scale. We conclude that new complementary protected areas are needed to safeguard these endemics and ecosystems. An expansion in protected areas will be challenged by geographically isolated micro-endemics, varied endemic patterns among taxa, increasing deforestation, resource extraction, and changes in climate. Relying on pre-existing collections, publically accessible datasets and tools, this working framework is exportable to other regions plagued by incomplete conservation data.

AB  - Simple Summary Charismatic Sumatran mammals (i.e., the elephant, orangutan, and tiger) play a pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem balance. Nevertheless, these species have encountered multifaceted threats due to habitat disturbances, leading to their potential extinction. Thus, understanding current species ranges, together with investigating the most essential factors for the species, are crucial for developing conservation strategies. We predicted the potential range of three charismatic mammals in Sumatra Island using anthropogenic, biophysical, topographic, and climatic parameters based on ensemble machine learning algorithms. This study also comprehensively describes how land ownerships can shape the existence of these three species. Finally, we provide recommendations based on our findings for species conservation planning and management options. Tropical Rainforest Heritage sites of Sumatra are some of the most irreplaceable landscapes in the world for biodiversity conservation. These landscapes harbor many endangered Asiatic mammals all suffering multifaceted threats due to anthropogenic activities. Three charismatic mammals in Sumatra: Elephas maximus sumatranus, Pongo abelii, and Panthera tigris sumatrae are protected and listed as Critically Endangered (CR) within the IUCN Red List. Nevertheless, their current geographic distribution remains unclear, and the impact of environmental factors on these species are mostly unknown. This study predicts the potential range of those species on the island of Sumatra using anthropogenic, biophysical, topographic, and climatic parameters based on the ensemble machine learning algorithms. We also investigated the effects of habitat loss from current land use, ecosystem availability, and importance of Indonesian protected areas. Our predictive model had relatively excellent performance (Sorensen: 0.81-0.94) and can enhance knowledge on the current species distributions. The most critical environmental predictors for the distribution of the three species are conservation status and temperature seasonality. This study revealed that more than half of the species distributions occurred in non-protected areas, with proportional coverage being 83%, 72%, and 54% for E.m. sumatranus, P. abelii, and P.t. sumatrae, respectively. Our study further provides reliable information on places where conservation efforts must be prioritized, both inside and outside of the protected area networks, to safeguard the ongoing survival of these Indonesian large charismatic mammals.

AB  - Understanding patterns of biodiversity in deep sea systems is increasingly important because human activities are extending further into these areas. However, obtaining data is difficult, limiting the ability of science to inform management decisions. We have used three different methods of quantifying biodiversity to describe patterns of biodiversity in an area that includes two marine reserves in deep water off southern Australia. We used biological data collected during a recent survey, combined with extensive physical data to model, predict and map three different attributes of biodiversity: distributions of common species, beta diversity and rank abundance distributions (RAD). The distribution of each of eight common species was unique, although all the species respond to a depth-correlated physical gradient. Changes in composition (beta diversity) were large, even between sites with very similar environmental conditions. Composition at any one site was highly uncertain, and the suite of species changed dramatically both across and down slope. In contrast, the distributions of the RAD components of biodiversity (community abundance, richness, and evenness) were relatively smooth across the study area, suggesting that assemblage structure (i.e. the distribution of abundances of species) is limited, irrespective of species composition. Seamounts had similar biodiversity based on metrics of species presence, beta diversity, total abundance, richness and evenness to the adjacent continental slope in the same depth ranges. These analyses suggest that conservation objectives need to clearly identify which aspects of biodiversity are valued, and employ an appropriate suite of methods to address these aspects, to ensure that conservation goals are met.

AB  - The lack of information about species distribution, also known as Wallacean shortfall, targets most species, even charismatic animals like felids, limiting the performance of scientific study and conservation planning. The knowledge about species distribution (specifically occurrence data) is also affected by restriction of data availability and dispersion of existing information in many data sources. Therefore, we created and tested the reliability and validity of Felidae occurrence database at spatial resolution of 0.5 decimal degree by: (i) investigating knowledge bias generated by charismatic attributes, species detectability, and spatial data aggregation; and (ii) evaluating climatic niche predictability and species-niche patterns mediated by ecological or phylogenetic, which is the main concern of database utilization in macroecological studies. We found 3,549 spatially unique felid occurrence records around the world, considering a resolution scale of 0.5 decimal degree. Numbers of occurrences were positively related to body mass and distribution area (R-2 = 0.2, p < 0.001), revealing that charismatic attributes influences the choice of study species and making the Wallacean shortfall more critical for small-bodied than large-bodied felids. All species had systematic or random point patterns, which can efficiently capture climatic variation into species distribution. Climatic variables efficiently described the distributions of felids' niches, through two general proprieties, marginality and tolerance. Niche marginality has spatial and evolutionary signature, since it relates to time of divergence, body mass, and distribution area. Therefore, this database can support macroecological studies due to the non-spatial bias of occurrences and the species predictability of climatic variables, despite the species bias.

AB  - Canada's boreal forest region is among the most extensive and largely intact ecosystems on earth, but has experienced rapid industrial development in the last half-century. Calls for urgent conservation action have been prompted by the increasing pace of development and declines in biodiversity, including songbirds. To assist conservation decision making, we introduce a framework to facilitate selection of the highest priority areas for a given conservation objective. We varied six key decision points representing possible constraints or a priori conservation factors: (1) prioritization metric (species representation vs. diversity), (2) geographic stratification, (3) degree of anthropogenic disturbance, (4) species' conservation status, (5) species' ecological association, and (6) climate-change and uncertainty discounting. Using the Zonation conservation planning tool, we evaluated landbird conservation priorities across 128 scenarios for 63 passerine species based on current and projected future density predictions. We compared Zonation land rankings across scenarios with respect to consistency, efficiency (additive and proportional conservation value per unit area), and the relative contributions of each of the six factors of interest. We found large differences between solutions depending on constraints and conservation objectives, and relatively low conservation efficiency overall, with the largest gains in overall conservation value observed in areas ranging from 0.31-0.56 of the study region. This reflects the large range of conservation opportunities still present in the Canadian boreal region, and the widely dispersed nature of landbird distributions, which results in high substitutability among similar areas. However, we did find increasing consistency among solutions as multiple constraints were considered. In particular, stratifying solutions geographically resulted in more consistent priorities, although at the expense of efficiency. Other constraints, including climate change, disturbance- and uncertainty-discounting, and the selection and weighting of species, helped to further focus priorities. Although no single scenario can be viewed as prescriptive, we provide a roadmap for prioritizing boreal songbird conservation efforts across multiple conservation objectives.

AB  - Large protected areas have been created in Brazilian Amazon intending to safeguard as much of its biodiversity as possible. Despite these intentions, such megareserves were created predominantly focusing on terrestrial organisms and ecosystems. Here, we assessed the ability of the current Brazilian Amazon protected areas network to efficiently safeguard its stream-dwelling fish fauna. Ecological niche models were built for 138 stream fish species using MaxEnt software. We performed a gap analysis and spatial prioritization under three different Amazon protected areas scenarios: (1) strictly protected areas (SPAs) only; (2) SPA plus sustainable use areas (SPA + SUA); and (3) SPA + SUA plus indigenous territories (SPA + SUA + IT). The species were classified according to their distribution range size and required representation targets. Widespread species usually had lower area under the curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS) values, which would be expected for large and heterogeneous areas such as the Amazon. Only partial gap species were found, with 20% to 90% of required representation targets included in PAs, which was not enough for a complete protection. Most of the officially protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon do not correspond to areas with high direct conservation values for stream fishes, once the priority areas for these species conservation were outside the PAs, leaving a high portion of the regional vertebrate fauna inadequately protected. We conclude that fishes and other freshwater organisms and habitats should be explicitly included during systematic conservation planning in order to thoroughly protect the Brazilian Amazon biodiversity.

AB  - Target II of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets established in 2010 by the Convention on Biological Diversity aims to conserve at least 17% of terrestrial areas by 2020. Although global-scale conservation planning to achieve this target has already been attempted, conservation effectiveness strongly depends on region-specific natural and social factors, necessitating planning at the national and regional levels. We conducted complementarity analysis to achieve the target with regard to species distributions of 172 terrestrial birds in Japan, using in part the results of niche modeling, and identified candidate protected areas not currently included in existing protected areas. There was a large difference in landscape structure between existing and candidate protected areas due to the spatial bias of the existing protected areas; these areas were characterized by a high proportion of forest areas and low landscape heterogeneity, while candidate protected areas had a low proportion of forest areas and high landscape heterogeneity. As candidate areas were represented by mainly open lands, including agricultural fields, and were mixed to some degree with secondary forests, threatened species preferring agricultural fields or grasslands were well covered by candidate protected areas. Considering the extremely high cost of land in Japan and the infeasibility of strictly limiting human activities, we propose that facilitating the sustainable use of open lands is a promising approach to achieving Aichi Target 11 in Japan.

AB  - Aim Spatially-explicit trends in species richness and endemism on sandy shores are quantified to assess representation of beach ecosystems in existing reserve networks. Also, the relative importance of different drivers of species distributions are compared through species distribution modelling.
   Location The South African beaches are among the best-studied in the world, providing sufficient biological data for the analyses. There is also a well-established coastal protected-area network that putatively provides moderate protection to nearly all beach habitats.
   Methods Species distribution maps of beach-dependent vertebrates, macrofauna, microflora, and foredune vegetation were compiled from existing sources or modelled using standard techniques. While some data were available for the latter analyses, additional sampling was required to improve bioregional coverage. Each species' distribution was coded to a detailed map of the South African shoreline. Representation of habitats and species in various configurations of existing reserves was determined.
   Results Overall, 535 species have been recorded on the South African sandy shores, including 139 common species. Endemism is variable among taxonomic groups. Notably, two-thirds of the macrofauna are regional endemics, half of which are endemic to South Africa. For almost all of the common species, < 20 % of their distributions are protected in land-sea reserves. Protection of beach habitats is similarly poor; conservation targets were not met in all cases, and most habitat types are considered Poorly Protected.
   Main conclusions Sandy beach communities are considerably more diverse than they are generally acknowledged to be, and comprise a unique suite of biota. Given the species' narrow distributions and high degree of exposure to threats, many probably qualify as threatened/endangered. In spite of this, beaches are poorly represented in coastal reserve networks. To redress this issue, conservation planners need to account for beaches specifically, and to ensure they are represented in contiguous land-sea protected areas.

AB  - One key strategy to publicise the benefits of nature more effectively to people is to correlate indicators of human well-being with conservation needs. Turtles are important and publicly visible ecological indicator groups. We use continental turtles as flagship umbrella species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot to design a conservation strategy that incorporates taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) for improved cost-effective outcomes. We first analyse the effectiveness of the current arrangement of protected areas (PAs) in safeguarding species by calculating the mean percentage overlap of each species range and the PAs network. We create three conservation models that differ in the amount of TD, FD and PD preserved. Each model defines a distinct plan (and cost) of paying landowners to participate in set-aside programs to preserve local habitats. We also analyse the performance of indicator species in representing TD, FD and PD gains and economic costs induced by payments for ecosystem services. The results show that species of continental turtles are not well conserved in the PAs. The spatial distribution of TD is highly correlated with that of FD and PD in the biome, with high values in the central region, in the extreme North, and in the South of the Atlantic Forest, due to the coexistence of the evolutionary lineages. We suggest a program for conservation planning to protect a threatened biodiversity hotspot, the ecosystem functions provided by flagship umbrella species, and its associated ecological and evolutionary values. Our findings are providing a representation of ecological and evolutionary values of continental turtles with annual economic benefits from environmental management tools.

AB  - Urban sprawl has increased in Western Europe principally due to conversion of farmland areas, which has constrained remaining farmland to more intensive use. Urban densification aims to counteract urban sprawl; however, it threatens urban green spaces that act as sustainable alternative habitats for wildlife. In this study, we used the Common Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) as a model species to develop sustainable planning recommendations for urban green spaces. Using species distribution models (SDMs) in combinations with high-resolution predicting variables (2 x 2 m grid cell), we defined the suitable habitat of a Common Redstart territory in a moderately urbanized environment. We then predicted how the distribution would be affected under realistic scenarios of land-use modification (termed conservation scenario and threat scenario) in an effort to provide recommendations for urban green space planning. Tree canopy cover was the principal land-cover type in the SDMs that explained the current species distribution followed by impervious surface and short-cut lawn. In the conservation scenario where tree canopy coverage was increased we predicted an increase in optimum habitat for the Common Redstart from 7% to 27% of the study area. In contrast, under a threat scenario based on urban densification, we predicted a decrease in the optimum habitat to only 4% of the study area. The SDMs results were used to highlight the importance of the suitable areas that have a predicted potential to conserve and promote an interconnected urban green space networks to maintain urban biodiversity.

AB  - The big crested mastiff bat, Promops centralis, occurs in Central and South America, but knowledge of its ecology is limited due to its open space hunting strategy, making captures extremely challenging. Notwithstanding, members of the species produce echolocation calls that are easy to identify. After recording calls of P. centralis 1,500 km away from its known range in Brazil, we hypothesized that the distribution range of this species was probably greatly underestimated. To improve the accuracy of P. centralis' real distribution, we employed acoustic surveys throughout parts of Brazil, conducted after a bibliographic review to gather additional records, and used MaxEnt to model the species' potential distribution. We have found that P. centralis has a much wider distribution in South America than previously thought, adding more than 3.8 million km(2) to its former known area. We also describe an unusual vocalization pattern of P. centralis, with individuals emitting at least three very distinct but highly variable calls. This study shows that bioacoustic surveys and species distribution models can complement traditional methodologies in studying species that are difficult to capture, such as P. centralis, potentially contributing to more effective conservation and management plans.

AB  - Crab species are economically and ecologically important in coastal ecosystems, and their spatial distributions are pivotal for conservation and fisheries management. This study was focused on modelling the spatial distributions of three Portunidae crabs (Charybdis bimaculata, Charybdis japonica, and Portunus trituberculatus) in Haizhou Bay, China. We applied three analytical approaches (Generalized additive model (GAM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN)) to spring and fall bottom trawl survey data (2011, 20132016) to develop and compare species distribution models (SDMs). Model predictability was evaluated using cross-validation based on the observed species distribution. Results showed that sea bottom temperature (SBT), sea bottom salinity (SBS), and sediment type were the most important factors affecting crab distributions. The relative importance of candidate variables was not consistent among species, season, or model. In general, we found ANNs to have less stability than both RFs and GAMs. GAMs overall yielded the least complex response curve structure. C. japonica was more pronounced in southwestern portion of Haizhou Bay, and C. bimaculata tended to stay in offshore areas. P. trituberculatus was the least region-specific and exhibited substantial annual variations in abundance. The comparison of multiple SDMs was informative to understand species responses to environmental factors and predict species distributions. This study contributes to better understanding the environmental niches of crabs and demonstrates best practices for the application of SDMs for management and conservation planning.

AB  - Responses of hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) to climate change remain mostly unexplored. Here, for the first time, we investigate the impact of climate change on both presence/absence and abundances of hoverfly species. We used generalized linear models to analyse the relationships of climatic and soil variables with the occurrence and abundance of Cheilosia species on the Balkan Peninsula. Our results show that the ranges of all and the abundances of many species are projected to decrease in the future. Climatically suitable conditions for mountainous species are predicted to generally shift northwards. Species adapted to high mountains are projected to almost vanish from the Balkans and only regions of the Alps would remain suitable for them. We found climatic variables were more important in determining abundance than occurrence. Given that environmental factors differed in terms of their impact on abundance and occurrence, we highlight the importance of monitoring both parameters to ensure effective conservation. Considering the different projected responses of hoverflies to future climate change, as well as their value as pollinators and the increasing threats they currently face, knowledge on their responses to the major drivers of their life-histories is indispensable for proper management and conservation action. We reveal that nationally-designated protected areas are insufficient to conserve the species considered here, both currently and under projected climate change. We recommend implementation of an integrated conservation management plan that can provide a continuum of protected areas along the Dinaric mountain chain to facilitate movement of species to enhance species survival.

AB  - Bottom trawl survey data are commonly used as a sampling technique to assess the spatial distribution of commercial species. However, this sampling technique does not always correctly detect a species even when it is present, and this can create significant limitations when fitting species distribution models. In this study, we aim to test the relevance of a mixed methodological approach that combines presence-only and presence-absence distribution models. We illustrate this approach using bottom trawl survey data to model the spatial distributions of 27 commercially targeted marine species. We use an environmentally-and geographically-weighted method to simulate pseudo-absence data. The species distributions are modelled using regression kriging, a technique that explicitly incorporates spatial dependence into predictions. Model outputs are then used to identify areas that met the conservation targets for the deployment of artificial anti-trawling reefs. To achieve this, we propose the use of a fuzzy logic framework that accounts for the uncertainty associated with different model predictions. For each species, the predictive accuracy of the model is classified as 'high'. A better result is observed when a large number of occurrences are used to develop the model. The map resulting from the fuzzy overlay shows that three main areas have a high level of agreement with the conservation criteria. These results align with expert opinion, confirming the relevance of the proposed methodology in this study.

AB  - Identifying spatial patterns in species diversity represents an essential task to be accounted for when establishing conservation strategies or monitoring programs. Predicting patterns of species richness by a model-based approach has recently been recognised as a significant component of conservation planning. Finding those environmental predictors which are related to these patterns is crucial since they may represent surrogates of biodiversity, indicating in a fast and cheap way the spatial location of biodiversity hotspots and, consequently, where conservation efforts should be addressed. Predictive models based on classical multiple linear regression or generalised linear models crowded the recent ecological literature. However, very often, problems related with spatial autocorrelation in observed data were not adequately considered. Here, a spatially-explicit data-set on birds presence and distribution across the whole Tuscany region was analysed. Species richness was calculated within 1 9 1 km grid cells and 10 environmental predictors (e. g. altitude, habitat diversity and satellite-derived landscape heterogeneity indices) were included in the analysis. Integrating spatial components of variation with predictive ecological factors, i.e. using geostatistical models, a general model of bird species richness was developed and used to obtain predictive regional maps of bird diversity hotspots. A meaningful subset of environmental predictors, namely habitat productivity, habitat heterogeneity, combined with topographic and geographic information, were included in the final geostatistical model. Conservation strategies based on the predicted hotspots as well as directions for increasing sampling effort efficiency could be extrapolated by the proposed model.

AB  - For decades, the genus Pelomedusa has been thought of as containing only a single species that is widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and Madagascar. However, ten species and up to five candidate species have been recognized recently. For these taxa, ecological information is scarce and distribution ranges are often only incompletely known. In this study, ecological niche spaces were estimated for eight Pelomedusa species, using a maximum entropy algorithm and geographical, climatic, and topographic information. Using the obtained models and Schoener's D and Hellinger's I indices, areas of sympatry between species were estimated and candidate areas for possibly overlooked taxa were identified. Furthermore, differences in niche spaces between species were assessed. The ecological niche models revealed geographical spaces that match the predicted niche of the eight examined species. However, for P. subrufa sensu stricto, the distribution range of the introduced populations in Madagascar was not predicted. Our models, together with statistical analyses, indicate that the studied Pelomedusa species occupy different geographical spaces. Areas of sympatry with significant niche overlap were identified between some species pairs. Yet, Pelomedusa species are generally allopatrically or parapatrically distributed. A minimum of five candidate regions possibly harbouring unknown taxa were identified. Our results provide a better understanding of the distribution ranges of Pelomedusa species and, thus, can serve as a basis for conservation planning.

AB  - The conservation of poorly known species is difficult because of incomplete knowledge on their biology and distribution. We studied the contribution of two ecological niche modelling tools, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) and maximum entropy (Maxent), in assessing potential ranges and distributional connectivity among 12 of the least known African and Asian viverrids. The level of agreement between GARP and Maxent predictions was low when < 15 occurrences were available, probably indicating a minimum number below that necessary to obtain models with good predictive power. Unexpectedly, our results suggested that Maxent extrapolated more than GARP in the context of small sample sizes. Predictions were overlapped with current land use and location of protected areas to estimate the conservation status of each species. Our analyses yielded range predictions generally contradicting with extents of occurrence established by the IUCN. We evidenced a high level of disturbance within predicted distributions in West and East Africa, Sumatra, and South-East Asia, and identified within West African degraded lowlands four relatively preserved areas that might be of prime importance for the conservation of rainforest taxa. Knowing whether these species of viverrids may survive in degraded or alternative habitats is of crucial importance for further conservation planning. The level of coverage of species suitable ranges by existing and proposed IUCN reserves was low, and we recommend that the total surface of protected areas be substantially increased on both continents.

AB  - This article documents the conservation status of the herpetofauna in the Pacific lowlands and adjacent Balsas Basin and Chiapas Depression regions and the presents the results of modelling species spatial distributional patterns through GARP analysis, to identify hotspots of species richness, endemic and geographically restricted species in the study area. It also compares the distribution of these hotspots with the distribution of protected areas and intact seasonally tropical dry tropical forests, the dominant vegetation type in the study area and experiencing high deforestation rates. A total of 301 reptiles and amphibian species occur in the study area accounting for a third of the Mexican herpetofauna, and recording high levels of endemism and endangerment. Hotspots of species richness and endemism were located in coastal Jalisco, a considerable portion of the Colima state, as well as scattered areas in Michoacan, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. These areas should receive highest priority for protection. Unfortunately, there was a minimum correspondence when comparing the distribution of actually and proposed protected areas with hotspots identified. Fortunately, areas of high species richness, endemism and restricted species coincided with those where intact seasonally tropical dry tropical forests still exists. These areas should receive high priority in future plans for seasonally tropical dry tropical forests protected areas. it is hoped that this paper will call attention to the need for establishing a network of protected areas in the study area, as has been proposed by previous studies., (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - P>1. Protected area networks for river ecosystems must account for the highly connected nature of river habitats and the fact that conditions in distant locations can influence downstream habitats and biota. We used Marxan conservation planning software to address the unique constraints of reserve design in river ecosystems and structure a reserve network to overcome key challenges to freshwater conservation.
   2. The range limits of 63 fish species in Mesoamerica were predicted and used in Marxan to design a network of conservation focal areas that encompasses 15% of the range of each species in areas with low risk of environmental degradation. Upstream risk intensity was estimated by propagating landscape-based sources of stress downstream along the direction of flow in GIS. We constrained Marxan solutions to account for basin divides, and we defined critical management zones to include important habitats that contribute to species persistence and mitigate threats.
   3. The proposed reserve network encompassed 11% of the study area, half of which was contained within existing protected areas. Our exercise also identified important gaps in protection. Because terrestrial-based environmental risks were propagated through the river network and considered in the solution, focal areas were constrained to catchments with low levels of upstream human activity. Addition of critical management zones - riparian buffers and fish migration corridors - expanded the network area by one-fifth.
   4. Our application of Marxan allowed longitudinal connectivity and topographic barriers to species movement to be considered. Adding critical management zones expanded the size of the reserve network, but is crucial to the network's conservation efficacy. We call for an evaluation of the added management capacity needed to conserve critical management zones and suggest ways to further improve the reserve design process.

AB  - Identifying the geographic distribution of populations is a basic, yet crucial step in many fundamental and applied ecological projects, as it provides key information on which many subsequent analyses depend. However, this task is often costly and time consuming, especially where rare species are concerned and where most sampling designs generally prove inefficient. At the same time, rare species are those for which distribution data are most needed for their conservation to be effective. To enhance fieldwork sampling, model-based sampling (MBS) uses predictions from species distribution models: when looking for the species in areas of high habitat suitability, chances should be higher to find them. We thoroughly tested the efficiency of MBS by conducting an important survey in the Swiss Alps, assessing the detection rate of three rare and five common plant species. For each species, habitat suitability maps were produced following an ensemble modeling framework combining two spatial resolutions and two modeling techniques. We tested the efficiency of MBS and the accuracy of our models by sampling 240 sites in the field (30 sitesx8 species). Across all species, the MBS approach proved to be effective. In particular, the MBS design strictly led to the discovery of six sites of presence of one rare plant, increasing chances to find this species from 0 to 50%. For common species, MBS doubled the new population discovery rates as compared to random sampling. Habitat suitability maps coming from the combination of four individual modeling methods predicted well the species' distribution and more accurately than the individual models. As a conclusion, using MBS for fieldwork could efficiently help in increasing our knowledge of rare species distribution. More generally, we recommend using habitat suitability models to support conservation plans.

AB  - Anticipating species distributions in space and time is necessary for effective biodiversity conservation and for prioritising management interventions. This is especially true when considering invasive species. In such a case, anticipating their spread is important to effectively plan management actions. However, considering uncertainty in the output of species distribution models is critical for correctly interpreting results and avoiding inappropriate decision-making. In particular, when dealing with species inventories, and avoiding inappropriate decision-making. In particular, when dealing with species inventories, the bias resulting from sampling effort may lead to an over-or under-estimation of the local density of occurrences of a species. In this paper we propose an innovative method to i) map sampling effort bias using cartogram models and ii) explicitly consider such uncertainty in the modeling procedure under a Bayesian framework, which allows the integration of multilevel input data with prior information to improve the anticipation of species distributions.

AB  - Climate change will impact several ecosystems, and the resilience of the weakest links of the ecological networks may be decisive in maintaining the ecological structure. The assessment of tendencies in the distribution and resilience of endangered medicinal species against global change can be an excellent tool to predict and minimize future negative effects, even more so if we consider that these species may be useful to us. Spain is one of the richest countries in plant diversity along the Mediterranean basin, and many representatives of the Spanish flora are medicinal plants. Under scenarios of climate change, the distribution ranges of many of these species are likely to alter. In this paper we used ecological niche modeling to predict future changes in the distribution of 41 medicinal plants included in the 2013 assessment of threatened species in Spain. We generated climate -based niche models for each medicinal species and projected them for each decade from 2010 until 2080. Our results identified and prioritized the most vulnerable species and areas to future predicted changes. These results should be useful for conservation planning and especially for prioritizing areas for protection.

AB  - The impact of climate change on conservation planning is affected by the availability of data (especially in data-sparse countries) and socioeconomic impacts. We build models using MaxEnt for Egyptian medicinal plants as a model system, projecting them to different future times under two IPCC 4th assessment emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no dispersal. We compare the effect of two indices of socioeconomic activity [Human Influence Index (HII) and human population density/km(2)] as cost layers in spatial prioritization for conservation using zonation. We assess the efficacy of Egypt's network of Protected Areas (PAs) by comparing the predicted conservation value inside and outside each PA under the various scenarios. The results show that there are many locations in Egypt (the main cities, agricultural land, coastal areas) that are highly ranked for conservation before human socioeconomic impacts are included. The HII had a stronger impact than using human population density. The PA value excess (inside-outside) varied significantly with the type of cost and dispersal, but not with climate-change scenario or Zonation settings. We conclude that human socioeconomic impacts add new scope and insights for future conservation; and conservation planning without consideration of such impacts cannot be complete.

AB  - In Canadian boreal forests, bryophytes represent an essential component of biodiversity and play a significant role in ecosystem functioning. Despite their ecological importance and sensitivity to disturbances, bryophytes are overlooked in conservation strategies due to knowledge gaps on their distribution, which is known as the Wallacean shortfall. Rare species deserve priority attention in conservation as they are at a high risk of extinction. This study aims to elaborate predictive models of rare bryophyte species in Canadian boreal forests using remote sensing-derived predictors in an Ensemble of Small Models (ESMs) framework. We hypothesize that high ESMs-based prediction accuracy can be achieved for rare bryophyte species despite their low number of occurrences. We also assess if there is a spatial correspondence between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns. The study area is located in western Quebec and covers 72,292 km(2). We selected 52 bryophyte species with <30 occurrences from a presence-only database (214 species, 389 plots in total). ESMs were built from Random Forest and Maxent techniques using remote sensing-derived predictors related to topography and vegetation. Lee's L statistic was used to assess and map the spatial relationship between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns. ESMs yielded poor to excellent prediction accuracy (AUC > 0.5) for 73% of the modeled species, with AUC values > 0.8 for 19 species, which confirmed our hypothesis. In fact, ESMs provided better predictions for the rarest bryophytes. Likewise, our study revealed a spatial concordance between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns in different regions of the study area, which have important implications for conservation planning. This study demon-strates the potential of remote sensing for assessing and making predictions on inconspicuous and rare species across the landscape and lays the basis for the eventual inclusion of bryophytes into sustainable development planning.

AB  - Global biodiversity and land conservation initiatives rely on an accurate understanding of the spatial distribution of species populations and communities. Identifying the spatial habitat use of wildlife communities across land uses and levels of human modification provides the opportunity to produce more efficient and effectual conservation plans. Our goal was to model breeding bird community occupancy across a complete spectrum of human land use modification to determine the habitat characteristics that best maximized the conservation of bird diversity. We used repeatvisit point counts on private and public lands to record the detection/non-detection of breeding bird species across the land use gradient. We modeled multiple proportional land cover and landscape structure covariates and employed a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model to analyze the habitat use of each species and to estimate guild-level species richness dynamics across the study area. We detected a total of 70 breeding bird species and our model estimated a total of 78 species within the total metacommunity. We found that insectivorous species richness was lowest in urban and suburban areas (x = 7), but highest on multiple use working lands with low to moderate levels of human modification (x = 22), not in the fully preserved protected areas (x = 16). In contrast, the richness of the predominately human commensal omnivorous species was highest in urban and suburban areas (x = 10) and across much of the more human modified landscape and lowest in the preserved lands (x = 3). Moderately disturbed working lands, which primarily consisted of a mixture of rotating silvicultural tracts, agriculture, low density housing, and riparian corridors, supported the most species (x = 36) and were especially important for the occupancy of breeding neotropical insectivores. These findings highlight the potential conservation benefits for incorporating private working lands with multiple land uses and land covers into future conservation planning scenarios, both for their wildlife conservation potential and as buffers around traditional protected areas.

AB  - Monitoring and assessing marine biodiversity relies upon adequate and accurate knowledge of population and distribution patterns of ecologically important species. Cetaceans are recognised both as functionally important and as flagship species and have been the target of monitoring and conservation programs. The habitat specialist Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) is the second most common cetacean in the Persian Gulf. Mousa Bay in the northwestern Persian Gulf is an important, but highly industrialised habitat for this species. We developed a systematic and comprehensive distance sampling survey carried out from 2014 to 2016 to estimate abundance and population density of humpback dolphin in this bay. To evaluate distribution pattern of the species, eight environmental variables were measured and employed in a zero-inflated generalised additive model (ZINB GAM). With an estimated abundance of 92 animals (64-131, 95% CI) and density of 0.123 animal/km(2) (0.086-0.176, 95% CI), our results revealed Mousa Bay as one of the largest population of humpback dolphin in northern latitudes of its global range. Based on ZINB GAM findings, distance to coastlines, depth, EC, and chlorophyll a concentration significantly influence the distribution of the species. Our results highlighted that physiographic parameters and resource availability are the most important motivators of the species distribution in shallow nearshore waters. Biotic (e.g. water quality) factors due to strongly being affected by the variability of time and space ranked after physiographic variables. The high tendency of humpback dolphins to enter in highly developed foreshore of Mousa Bay raise the need for conservation-oriented studies to inform conservation planning. This study provides a basis for monitoring humpback dolphin and assessing ecosystem health of northern Persian Gulf.

AB  - Predicting spatial patterns in thermal tolerance and vulnerability of species under climate warming remains a challenge. Current knowledge is mainly from experiment-based thermal physiology of limited numbers of ectotherms, yet large-scale evaluations on plants remain elusive. Here, using distribution maps with spatial resolutions of 20 x 20 km for 5628 woody species in China, we propose a novel approach, i.e. thermal distribution curves, to describe species' realized thermal niches and then estimate their thermal tolerance and warming risks under projected climate warming in 2050s and 2070s. We find that species' vulnerability and potential local extinction risks within grid cells decrease with latitude and increase with aridity due to narrow thermal tolerance of species located at low latitudes and arid regions. Over 90% of species could still tolerate future warming in most areas, indicating relatively optimistic expectation of potential local extinctions. Our study presents a new framework to quantify climate warming impacts on a large number of species without sufficient physiological information and provides fundamental references for conservation planning under climate change.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement Crop wild relatives-wild species closely related to cultivated plants-are valuable genetic resources for crop improvement, but gaps in knowledge constrain their conservation and limit their further use. We develop new information on the distributions, potential breeding value, and conservation status of the 16 known wild relatives of cultivated pumpkins, squashes, zucchini, and gourds (Cucurbita L.). The taxa occur from the central USA to Central America, plus two South American species, with the greatest richness in central Mexico and the western borderlands between Mexico and the USA. We determine the majority of species are of medium priority for conservation, both with regard to collecting for ex situ maintenance, and for enhanced habitat protection.
   Summary
   Crop wild relatives are valuable genetic resources for crop improvement. Knowledge gaps, including with regard to taxonomy, distributions, and characterization for traits of interest constrain their use in plant breeding. These deficiencies also affect conservation planning, both with regard to in situ habitat protection, and further collection of novel diversity for ex situ maintenance. Here we model the potential ranges of all 16 known wild cucurbit taxa (Cucurbita L.), use ecogeographic information to infer their potential adaptations to abiotic stresses, and assess their ex situ and in situ conservation status. The taxa occur from the central USA to Central America, plus two South American species. Predicted taxon richness was highest in central Mexico and in the western borderlands between Mexico and the USA. We find substantial ecogeographic variation both across taxa and among populations within taxa, with regard to low temperatures, high and low precipitation, and other adaptations of potential interest for crop breeding. We categorize 13 of the taxa medium priority for further conservation as a combination of the ex situ and in situ assessments, two low priority, and one sufficiently conserved. Further action across the distributions of the taxa, with emphasis on taxonomic richness hotspots, is needed to comprehensively conserve wild Cucurbita populations.

AB  - In this review I focus on what we need to know to make decisions relevant to land-use planning. I discuss four questions: What information about the distribution of biodiversity is available to decision makers? What sort of information is required at a local scale? Can we use species-distribution modeling to compensate for the lack of empirical information at larger scales? Can we use surrogates based on remote sensing for all our decisions? To be effective, biodiversity information needs to be based on standardized sampling with data made available during the initial planning phases of infrastructure projects, which are now based only on engineering or social considerations and occur several decades before construction starts. The RAPELD method is now being used in many environmental-impact studies to generate standardized data, but there is presently no mechanism to include biodiversity information in the initial phases of decision making, and this has unfavorable consequences for economic development and the environment.

AB  - The Ocellated Lizard, Timon lepidus (Daudin 1802) occupies the Mediterranean regions of southwestern Europe (Portugal, Spain, France, and the extreme northwest of Italy). Over the last decades, a marked decline in its population has been observed, particularly on the northern edge of its distribution. As a result, it is currently considered a threatened species, especially in France and Italy. In France, a national action plan for its conservation has been put in place. In this study, ecological niche modelling (ENM) was carried out over the entire area of France in order to evaluate the species' potential distribution, more accurately define its ecological niche, guide future surveys, and inform land use planning so this species can be better taken into consideration. The modelling used data representing 2,757 observation points spread over the known range of the species, and 34 ecogeographical variables (climate, topography, and vegetation cover) were evaluated. After removing correlated variables, models were fitted with several combinations of variables using eight species distribution model (SDM) algorithms, and then their performance was assessed using three model accuracy metrics. Iterative trials changing the input variables were used to obtain the best model. The optimized model included nine determining variables. The results indicate the presence of this species is linked primarily to three climate variables: precipitation in the driest month, precipitation seasonality, and mean temperature in the driest quarter. The model was checked by a sample dataset that was not used to fit the model, and this validation dataset represented 25% of the overall field observations. Of the known occurrence locations kept aside to check the results, 94% fell within the presence area predicted by the modelled map with a presence probability greater than 0.7, and 90% fell within the area with a presence probability ranging from 0.8 to 1, which represents a very high predictive value. These results indicate that the models closely matched the observed distribution, suggesting a low impact of either geographical factors (barriers to dispersal), historical factors (dispersal process), or ecological factors (e.g., competition, trophic resources). The overlap between the predicted distribution and protected areas for this species reveals that less than 1% of the potential distribution area is protected by strong regulatory measures (e.g., national parks and natural reserves). The knowledge obtained in this study allows us to recommend some guidelines that would favor the conservation of this species.

AB  - Evaluation of spatial and non-spatial distribution is of great importance for protection of plant's genetic resources. Prunus scoparia, a wild almond species, is an important economically and ecologically food resource plant in Iran with specific characteristics such as self-compatibility, resistant to drought and fungus, bitterness as well as small nuts. This wild species can provide an enlarged gene pool and may be considered as a valuable germplasm source for breeding the cultivated almond. In this study, the conservation planning and genetic variation of 158 Prunus scoparia accessions was investigated with the aid of 36 SSR markers to reveal genetic distinctness and structure. The molecular markers studied showed quite high level of genetic diversity on the basis of N-a = 6.47, H-o = 0.603 and H-e = 0.737. The result of Neighbor net analysis was not in parallel with STRUCTURE data as classified samples into two and 12 main groups, respectively. On the other hand, the results of GENELAND analysis ensured the population classification and the genetic relatedness between populations from STRUCTURE analysis due to use of geographical data. All samples were grouped based on their geographical location. Moreover, utilization of GIS data accompanied by appropriate number of SSR markers could provide the possibility of prioritizing of distribution regions in natural and unnatural environments. The species distribution modeling would also help gain comprehensive information on conservation strategies of this wild almond species.

AB  - The Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus) is an endangered species with a globally declining population. Information on the current habitat distribution and potential suitable habitat for this ecologically important species will provide invaluable insight into conservation planning and the species' future status as climate changes. This is specifically important for areas where there are little or no reported data on the status of the Egyptian Vulture. We used 13 years nestsite records (n = 69) together with relevant environmental variables to understand the known distribution and predict potential habitat distribution of the Egyptian Vulture in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. A machine learning model, maximum entropy, was used to generate various model options, from which the best model was selected based on the Akaike information criterion (AICc) statistical indicators. The model showed reasonably good discriminative ability using both True Skill Statistics TSS = 0.722 and Area under the Curve (AUC) = 0.825 metrics. The Egyptian Vultures in Iraq mainly breed in territories at elevations between 1000 and 3300 m above sea level. This suggests that the species shows preference to areas distant from human settlements likely due to decreased disturbance and that the species may rely on alternative/complementary food sources (e.g. wild goat and boar). The total area of the study site is approximately 51,069 km(2), out of which around 25% (12,767 km(2)) is predicted as suitable breeding habitat for the Egyptian Vulture. The output of this study provides useful baseline information for conservation actions and plans.

AB  - Background: The knowledge of both potential distribution and habitat suitability is fundamental in spreading species to inform in advance management and conservation planning. After a severe decline in the past decades, the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) is now spreading its breeding range towards the northwest in Spain and Europe. Because of its key ecological function, anticipated spatial knowledge is required to inform appropriately both vulture and ecosystem management.
   Methodology/Findings: Here we used maximum entropy (Maxent) models to determine the habitat suitability of potential and current breeding distribution of the griffon vulture using presence-only data (N = 124 colonies) in north-western Spain. The most relevant ecological factors shaping this habitat suitability were also identified. The resulting model had a high predictive performance and was able to predict species' historical distribution. 7.5% (similar to 1,850 km(2)) of the study area resulted to be suitable breeding habitat, most of which (similar to 70%) is already occupied by the species. Cliff availability and livestock density, especially of sheep and goats, around 10 km of the colonies were the fundamental factors determining breeding habitat suitability for this species.
   Conclusions/Significance: Griffon vultures could still spread 50-60 km towards the west, increasing their breeding range in 1,782 km(2). According to our results, 7.22% of the area suitable for griffon vulture will be affected by wind farms, so our results could help to better plan wind farm locations. The approach here developed could be useful to inform management of reintroductions and recovery programmes currently being implemented for both the griffon vulture and other threatened vulture species.

Many Antipatharia are habitat for associates, have extreme longevity and some species can occur beyond 8500 m depth. As they are major constituents of coral gardens', which are Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs), knowledge of their distribution and environmental requirements is an important pre-requisite for informed conservation planning particularly where the expense and difficulty of deep-sea sampling prohibits comprehensive surveys.
   This study uses a global database of Antipatharia distribution data to perform habitat suitability modelling using the Maxent methodology to estimate the global extent of black coral habitat suitability. The model of habitat suitability is driven by temperature but there is notable influence from other variables of topography, surface productivity and oxygen levels.
   This model can be used to predict areas of suitable habitat, which can be useful for conservation planning. The global distribution of Antipatharia habitat suitability shows a marked contrast with the distribution of specimen observations, indicating that many potentially suitable areas have not been sampled, and that sampling effort has been disproportionate to shallow, accessible areas inside marine protected areas (MPAs). Although 25% of Antipatharia observations are located in MPAs, only 7-8% of predicted suitable habitat is protected, which is short of the Convention on Biological Diversity target to protect 10% of ocean habitats by 2020.

AB  - Very little empirical work has been done to assess the potential impacts of climate change upon terrestrial biodiversity within small islands, many of which contribute to global species diversity due to high levels of endemicity. This study illustrates projections of not only individual but also the 'collective' response of a group of high conservation value tree species to climate change within the Caribbean small island of Trinidad. The species distribution modelling algorithm MaxEnt was used to construct models of the realised present environmental space occupied by these species based on present day climate and other environmental factors. These models were then used to estimate present and future (2050; SRES A2) distributions of these species across Trinidad. Both present and future model output were incorporated to create change maps which illustrate projected expansions, contractions and areas of stable environmental space for each species. Individual change maps were combined to create a 'collective' change map portraying projected changes in the environmental space of this species group as a whole. Most individual species and the collective group response were projected to lose more than 50% of present environmental space, with the latter being limited to the southern edge of the island. Our results suggest that small islands may experience an eventual disappearance of endemics and other valuable species under SRES A2 conditions, which may serve to further depreciate global terrestrial species diversity. Application of this 'collective' response may be particularly useful for planning within the limited geographic spaces available for conservation within small islands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many cetacean species are at risk from anthropogenic disturbances including climate change, pollution, and habitat degradation. Identifying cetacean hotspots for conservation management is therefore required. Aotearoa-New Zealand waters are used by 53% of the world's cetacean species and are a global cetacean diversity hotspot. Using geographic predictions of cetacean taxa, we aimed to identify important areas within New Zealand waters using two methods: estimates of cetacean richness and a spatial prioritization analysis. For both methods, we investigated how varying levels of uncertainty in predictions of the taxa' occurrence layers would affect our interpretation of cetacean hotspots. Despite some marked spatial differences in distribution of important areas for cetacean diversity, both methods, across all uncertainty scenarios, highlighted six distinct deep offshore regions as important habitat. Generally, inshore areas had lower richness estimates than offshore areas, but these remain important for conservation for species with limited ranges (e.g., the endemic Maui and Hector's dolphins), and in some places had similar richness values to offshore hotspots. Furthermore, inshore hotspots had lower uncertainty in predicted taxa distribution and richness estimates. The use of two different uncertainty estimates allows the integration of distributional information from differing sources (different modeling methods with varying numbers of cetacean records) to be integrated in a robust and conservative way. Identification of cetacean hotspots with varying levels of uncertainty provides a robust and efficient step toward prioritizing areas for conservation management in a participatory process.

AB  - As climate and land-use changes threatens biodiversity, the identification of refugia areas for species becomes a crucial strategy in conservation planning. Here, we integrate climate change anomaly with a land-use change model both projected for 2050 to identify refugia areas for 103 bird species that occur in the Brazilian Cerrado. We found that 13% of the Cerrado may serve as refugia for the bird species. In contrast, nearly 35% of the biome might become areas of high risk for those species. Most species (74%) will held from 34% to 85% of their current geographic distribution in areas with less native vegetation, but with low climate anomaly. Apart from the protection of the refugia areas, we suggest restoration of native vegetation in regions that are likely to maintain climate conditions more adequate in the future. These areas should be prioritized to protect places with higher species richness and ease the establishment of corridors that would support climate-induced dispersal from high risk areas to suitable ones. Approaches that allow for the identification and future protection of refugia are fundamental to guarantee the conservation of biodiversity faced with climate change and rapid land-use changes that already taking place.

AB  - Given species inventories of all sites in a planning area, integer programming or heuristic algorithms can prioritize sites in terms of the site's complementary value, that is, the ability of the site to complement (add unrepresented species to) other sites prioritized for conservation. The utility of these procedures is limited because distributions of species are typically available only as coarse atlases or range maps, whereas conservation planners need to prioritize relatively small sites. If such coarse-resolution information can be used to identify small sites that efficiently represent species (i.e., downscaled), then such data can be useful for conservation planning. We develop and test a new type of surrogate for biodiversity, which we call downscaled complementarity. In this approach, complementarity values from large cells are downscaled to small cells, using statistical methods or simple map overlays. We illustrate our approach for birds in Spain by building models at coarse scale (50 x 50 km atlas of European birds, and global range maps of birds interpreted at the same 50 x 50 km grid size), using this model to predict complementary value for 10 x 10 km cells in Spain, and testing how well-prioritized cells represented bird distributions in an independent bird atlas of those 10 x 10 km cells. Downscaled complementarity was about 63-77% as effective as having full knowledge of the 10-km atlas data in its ability to improve on random selection of sites. Downscaled complementarity has relatively low data acquisition cost and meets representation goals well compared with other surrogates currently in use. Our study justifies additional tests to determine whether downscaled complementarity is an effective surrogate for other regions and taxa, and at spatial resolution finer than 10 9 10 km cells. Until such tests have been completed, we caution against assuming that any surrogate can reliably prioritize sites for species representation.

AB  - Ecological niche models (ENMs) are crucial tools for anticipating range shifts driven by climate change. As hypotheses of future biotic change, they can be difficult to test using independent data. The fossil record is the best way to assess the ability of ENMs to correctly predict range shifts because it provides empirical ranges under novel climate conditions. We tested the performance of ENMs using fossil distributions from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, approximate to 21 000 yr ago). We compared hindcast ENM LGM distribution hypotheses for five species of small mammals, drawn from the published literature, to the known LGM fossil record for those species and found a consistent southern prediction bias in the ENMs. This bias urges caution in interpreting future range predictions, and we suggest that the Pleistocene and Holocene fossil record should be used as an additional resource for calibrating niche modelling for conservation planning.

AB  - We conducted spring and autumn surveys of Caucasian black grouse Tetrao mlokosiewiczi throughout northeastern Turkey during 2004-2005. Birds were found at 45 locations, 29 of which were previously undocumented. The species appears to occur in four geographical units with differing degrees of connectivity and isolation, and is still under pressure from illegal hunting as well as habitat deterioration and fragmentation, principally as the result of road construction in mountain areas. A preliminary analysis of the degree of overlap between grouse populations and protected areas shows that the protected areas network should be reviewed. The data collected during the course of this survey are being used to develop a model for predicting the distribution of black grouse in northeastern Turkey and to prepare a National Species Action Plan. A detailed ecological study of the Caucasian black grouse is required to develop habitat management recommendations for the species.

AB  - Ongoing environmental changes may reduce the population size and geographic distribution of many ecologically sensitive species. Predicting where populations will (or will not) be likely to resist these changes is crucial for planning their protection. The blond titi monkey (Callicebus barbarabrownae) is listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature because of its small and declining population due to deforestation and hunting. The species is endemic to the Brazilian Caatinga dry forest, which has undergone extensive deforestation and climate-induced desertification. We address the extinction risk of this species in a spatially explicit context by predicting the geographic distribution of suitable areas that may permit the persistence of potentially viable populations over the next 50 years. We combined species distribution modeling with population viability analysis under more optimistic and pessimistic climate change scenarios and simulated forest loss, assessing how different populations will likely cope with these changes during the coming decades. Future models did not differ between the scenarios, but changes in the climatic suitability of the species' habitat predicted a reduction of one-third of the currently suitable area. Viable populations in large forest remnants represent only a quarter of all known populations, and they also face a decline in climatic suitability. Smaller populations may be extirpated, regardless of the level of forest recovery. This species' long-term persistence entails improving habitat quality and the connectivity of the large remnants to neighbor areas. Finally, the integration of spatial and temporal models is feasible and helpful to address threats and aid the conservation of primates.

AB  - Urbanization adversely impacts biodiversity by reducing the quantity and quality of natural habitat areas. Additionally, the quality of natural habitat depends on its bio-physical characteristics (e.g., natural cover, impervious surfaces, urban tree canopy) as well as the functional traits of species inhabiting them (e.g., breeding/foraging habitat requirements). To better plan conservation of regional biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is therefore critical to assess the relationship between the landscape and the response of key Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) of species. To identify different FTGs of 116 avian species in the urbanized landscape of the Toronto region (Canada), we conducted a Functional Trait Analysis (FTA) using RLQ-fourth corner analysis. We focused on four species traits (diet, foraging, nesting, and territoriality) to identify the FTGs and their association with natural cover and landscape characteristics (landcover types, patch quality, habitat connectivity). Then, to predict FTG presence in relation to the landscape characteristics, we performed a Habitat Suitability Analysis (HSA). From this analysis, we found 21 avian FTGs with different habitat suitability values that correspond to forested patches and wetlands. The HSA for tree canopy, forest insectivore, and ground-nesting birds (or FTGs) have higher suitability values within forest patches, while aerial insectivores have higher suitability values in older residential neighborhoods indicating the value of the urban tree canopy. This methodological approach shows that by mapping habitat suitability by FTG one can identify strategic conservation areas that target multiple species, shifting efforts from a single species to a community-based functional focus. Our study highlights the conservation value of remnant and/or restored habitat patches in near urban and urban landscapes that help to maximize the persistence of regional avian biodiversity.

AB  - Environmental factors that affect the distributions of wilderness character and the species richness of mammals, birds, flowering plants (angiosperms), and conifers and cycads (seed-bearing plants) were investigated at the global scale using national species richness data and a continuous wilderness quality grid. Principle Component Analysis and Multiple Regression were used to develop environmental characteristic models that are straight forward to interpret. High elevation and high latitude were key to the distribution of wilderness quality, conifers, and cycads. The most important determinants of species richness, however, were found to be low latitude and "good" climate (high precipitation and constant warm temperature). Understanding factors that influence presence of wilderness today will help plan for its protection on a large scale. Appreciating how the same factors affect the distribution of species richness will aid in conservation of biodiversity, particularly that in protected wilderness requiring pristine habitat.

AB  - Range shifts due to climate change may cause species to move out of protected areas. Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here, we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, and Western Europe) to examine the need for additional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species representation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future, under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario, and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action. According to our projections, costs may vary among regions and none of the three areas studied will fully meet all conservation targets, even under a moderate climate change scenario. This suggests that limiting climate change is an essential complement to adding protected areas for conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - Range maps of thousands of species, compiled and made freely available by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, are being increasingly applied to support spatial conservation planning. However, their coarse nature makes them prone to commission and omission errors, and they lack information on the variations in abundance within species' distributions, calling into question their value to inform decisions at the fine scales at which conservation often takes place. Here, we tested if species ranges can reliably be used to estimate the responsibility of sites for the global conservation of species. We defined specific responsibility' as the fraction of a species' population within a given site, considering it useful for prioritising species within sites; and defined overall responsibility' as the sum of specific responsibility across species within a site, assuming it informative of priorities among sites. Taking advantage of an exceptionally detailed dataset on the distribution and abundance of bird species at a near-continental scale - a level of information rarely available to local decision-makers - we created a benchmark against which we tested estimates of responsibility derived from range maps. We investigated approaches for improving these estimates by complementing range maps with plausibly available local data. We found that despite their coarse nature, range maps provided good estimates of sites' overall responsibility, but relatively poor estimates of specific responsibility. Estimates were improved by combining range maps with local species lists or local abundance data, easily available through local surveys on the sites of interest, or simulated expert knowledge. Our results suggest that combining range maps with local data is a promising route for improving the effectiveness of local conservation decisions at contributing to reducing global biodiversity losses. This is all the more urgent in hyper-diverse poorly-known regions where conservation-relevant decisions must proceed despite a paucity of biodiversity data.

AB  - Knowing where species occur is essential for conservation planning. In South Africa, regional climatic variation is subject to effects of oceanic current systems, which in turn, determine species diversity patterns. We hypothesize that regional climates and topography are important drivers of aquatic insect species richness, endemism, and assemblage composition, and expect strong assemblage-turnover boundaries to be concurrent with topographical features. We also expected that current conservation networks do not represent aquatic insect species richness and endemism. We used generalized linear mixed models and generalized dissimilarity models to determine drivers of South African dragonfly (Odonata) species richness and assemblage-turnover, as well as to investigate the extent of assemblage-turnover boundaries. We found that climate gradients were significant drivers, and found significant variation in assemblages between sub-regions. Turnover boundaries were gradual but concurrent with topographical features and/or areas with spatial changes in sub-regional climate. Modern-day climate and topography partially explained dragonfly diversity patterns, but other local factors and past geological events likely both contribute to current dragonfly diversity patterns. The existing conservation network in South Africa represents areas of high dragonfly species richness and endemism. We recommend additional conservation efforts in areas outside of protected areas with high species richness and endemism levels, but importantly also in areas with high assemblage-turnover rates to ensure protection of as many species as possible. We also propose further searches in areas with high endemism and high assemblage-turnover for possible discovery of unknown species, and further searches in under-represented areas to improve distribution data for known species.

AB  - The paper presents a mapping tool aiming to identify and minimise potential conflicts between onshore wind energy development and wildlife conservation in Lithuania. It merges current information on the distribution, conservation status and sensitivity of birds and bats to wind power with an integrated evaluation of wind resources (modelled wind speed), special planning status and technical perspectives of wind energy development. The paper includes assessment of the selected wildlife species which were described as sensitive to wind power (69 breeding and 43 migratory bird species and 17 bat species bats in the country). Used species level information allowed the precise identification of sensitive territories and might be used to mitigate negative wind farm effects using special measures based on species behavior. Finally, we delivered overlaps as possible conflicts among the most promising wind farm areas and the areas with high sensitivity in relation to bird and bat distribution. These overlaps point to the required attention and relevant decisions that are needed to ensure sustainable development of wind energy throughout the country. We suggest this tool for initial determination of appropriate areas for wind energy development in the country and as supplement to Environmental Impact Assessment.

AB  - We show how simple statistical analyses of systematically collected inventory data can be used to provide reliable information about the distribution and habitat associations of rare species. Using an existing design-based sampling grid on which epiphytic macrolichens had been inventoried in the Northwest Forest Plan area of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, we (1) estimate frequencies and standard errors for each of 25 lichen species having special management designation (i.e., Survey and Manage), (2) assess the probability that individual. species were associated with specific land allocation and forest stand age classifications, and (3) provide estimates of sample sizes necessary to ensure sufficient detections for these analyses. We conclude with a discussion of management and conservation information needs that extant data can satisfy and identify advantages and limitations of random vs. nonrandom sampling strategies. Combining design-assisted and model-assisted approaches can overcome some of the limitations of either single strategy.

AB  - Delineating a species range is challenging because many factors interact at multiple spatial scales to affect a species distribution. Species distribution models (SDM) can be used to identify factors most associated with a species presence and, therefore, potentially define a range edge. We evaluated the utility of two popular SDM approaches, maximum entropy models (e.g., MaxEnt) and generalized linear models (GLM), for determining the range edge for the threatened Blanding's Turtles, Emydoidea blandingii, in northeastern New York, USA. Using the mapping and analysis software ArcGIS, we constructed and validated SDMs using presence/absence records (GLM) and presence/background records (MaxEnt) with 11 environmental predictor variables. Because of the limits imposed by the low number of absences, we found that GLM was not as successful as MaxEnt at predicting habitat suitability for rare and cryptic species like E. blandingii. Our results also indicated that a distinct environmentally induced range edge is associated with factors related to elevation. Both GLM and MaxEnt models also projected the presence of suitable habitat outside of the current range, including locations with known disjunct populations. We conclude that a presence/background SDM approach such as MaxEnt is valid when accurate data on locational absences are lacking, as is typical for rare, cryptic species. Using SDM to understand factors that shape the range edge can aid in planning habitat conservation and management of threatened species such as E. blandingii.

AB  - Aim: Disentangling the relative importance of climatic and anthropogenic factors is crucial in conservation biology but problematic using short-term data only. Long-term (palaeobiological) data are thus increasingly being used to understand taxon history and to identify potential status and baseline (pre-anthropogenic) conditions, which in turn allows the optimization of species conservation plans. We combined species distribution models (SDMs) with current and palaeo-occurrences of Microtus cabrerae, a threatened Mediterranean rodent, to circumvent the limitations of the palaeorecord (e.g. spatio-temporal bias), to characterize this rodent's history (potential status and baseline conditions) since the Mid-Holocene (similar to 6,000 yr BP), and to determine the relative importance of climatic and anthropogenic factors in its decline.
   Location: Historic distributional range of M. cabrerae (Iberian Peninsula and SE France).
   Methods: We used generalized linear models (GLMs) to study the effects of four climatic (temperature and precipitation seasonality, minimum temperature, aridity) and four anthropogenic variables (human influence index, surface area of irrigated crops, rain-fed crops and pastures) on the species' current distribution. Then, we used an ensemble of SDMs to estimate its current and Mid-Holocene potential distributions based only on climate variables, and validated model projections against current and palaeo records. Finally, suitability maps were analysed to study the species' range dynamics during the Late Holocene.
   Results: Microtus cabrerae's current distribution is constrained by both climatic and anthropogenic variables. Temperature and precipitation seasonality-but not aridity or minimum temperature-play an important positive role in constraining its distribution, but agriculture is the main human activity that affects it negatively. Climatic changes during the Late Holocene probably led to an expansion of its distribution without fragmentating its range.
   Main conclusions: Contrary to previous hypotheses, under natural conditions, M. cabrerae should be in an expansive phase of its taxon cycle. Yet, its potential and current conservation status is negatively affected by agricultural habitat destruction, suggesting that conservation strategies should aim to control agricultural intensification.

AB  - Grasslands are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Spatial prioritization of high quality habitat in agricultural landscapes is needed to protect grassland biodiversity. Within this context, we focused on European ground squirrel, a keystone species in steppe and salt steppe ecosystems. Using historical data and habitat field mapping, this study evaluates species distribution and site occupancy along the southern margin of the species range (Serbia) and identifies priority conservation zones in an intensively used landscape. Using gap analysis to evaluate changes in distribution over time and land protection status of the occupied area, we found that the regional species range has been constricted by 70%, and that 43% of mapped areas were outside of conservation networks. We also used a landscape structure model and multivariate analysis to identify the effects of spatial heterogeneity on occupancy. After mapping potential conservation zones with a buffer radius of 4.6 km-the scale with significant effects on occupancy-we identified 19 potential agro-ecological zones that cover the full range of mapped species habitats. The proposed agro-ecological zones differ in percentage of occupancy, which was found to increase with the overall landscape heterogeneity. This study contributes to the ongoing effort to broaden the understanding of the ecology and conservation of the European ground squirrel and the grasslands they rely on. Conservation planning should be designed to protect grasslands occupied by ground squirrels, ensure that the agricultural matrix is permeable, and to sustain or enhance landscape heterogeneity.

AB  - Understanding patterns in freshwater mussel distributions and habitat use, particularly for imperiled species, is critical for their conservation. To aid in management of imperiled mussels, and to demonstrate the utility using both landscape-based and biotic predictors in assessing species habitat suitability, we modeled 11 imperiled mussels in rivers of Michigan, USA. Models were developed with MaxEnt using a combination of host fish richness, natural abiotic reach variables, and landscape-based natural and anthropogenic variables. Because potential host fishes are important biological determinants of mussel distributions, fluvial host fish distributions (n = 37) were modeled and integrated as a predictor in mussel models. Key predictors determining habitat suitability for mussels included host fish richness, a strong positive predictor for 8 of 11 mussel species, stream discharge, urban land use, and upstream dam density. Models predicted 853 to 10,138 stream km of suitable habitat (1.1 to 13.6% of the state's stream length) for the 11 mussel species, with 54 to 1,382 km (0.1 to 1.8%) being considered highly suitable habitat. Mapping of suitable habitats identified streams with available habitat for multiple listed species, allowing for more informed decisions in conservation planning and management of Michigan's listed freshwater mussels and their fish hosts.

AB  - Much of what is known about avian species-habitat relations has been derived from studies of birds at local scales. It is entirely unclear whether the relations observed at these scales translate to the larger landscape in a predictable linear fashion. We derived habitat models and mapped predicted abundances for three forest bird species of eastern North America using bird counts, environmental variables, and hierarchical models applied at three spatial scales. Our purpose was to understand habitat associations at multiple spatial scales and create predictive abundance maps for purposes of conservation planning at a landscape scale given the constraint that the variables used in this exercise were derived from local-level studies. Our models indicated a substantial influence of landscape context for all species, many of which were counter to reported associations at finer spatial extents. We found land cover composition provided the greatest contribution to the relative explained variance in counts for all three species; spatial structure was second in importance. No single spatial scale dominated any model, indicating that these species are responding to factors at multiple spatial scales. For purposes of conservation planning, areas of predicted high abundance should be investigated to evaluate the conservation potential of the landscape in their general vicinity. In addition, the models and spatial patterns of abundance among species suggest locations where conservation actions may benefit more than one species.

AB  - Recent extinction rates suggest that humans are now causing the sixth mass extinction, and the Mediterranean islands are at the forefront of many of the environmental issues involved. This study provides an alternative approach for investigating documented local plant extinctions that occurred in Sardinia (western Mediterranean) during the last half century. A total of 190 local extinctions of 62 plant species were used to investigate the independent effects of eight ecological and anthropogenic variables and to model the areas of potential extinctions where plant conservation efforts could be focused. If all analysed plant species were considered together, ecological factors explained local extinctions more than anthropogenic factors. The independent effects of each factor considerably varied among species of different lifeforms and altitude ranges. Accordingly, distribution models of local extinctions outscored areas that are potentially rich in plant species with conservation interest, but which are particularly affected by humans. This paper suggests a reproducible, operational framework for analysing which extinction factors may play important roles in similar contexts and where they might be relevant.

AB  - Aim The critically endangered Cross River gorilla is a patchily distributed taxon for which habitat selection has been modelled only at coarse spatial scales, using remotely sensed landscape data and large-scale species distribution maps. These coarse-scale models fail to explain why Cross River gorillas (CRG) display a highly fragmented distribution within what appears to be a large, continuous area of suitable habitat. This study aimed to refine our understanding of CRG habitat use to inform conservation planning both for the subspecies and for other fragmented species of conservation concern.
   Location Cross River gorillas occur only in a discontinuous distribution in the southern portion of the Cameroon-Nigeria border region, an area that represents one of Africa's biodiversity hotspots. This study was carried out in the Northern Mone-Mt. Oko region, part of the Mone/Mbulu forest system located in the Manyu division of the South-west Province of Cameroon.
   Methods We used resource selection functions to understand habitat use by CRG at multiple scales. Specifically, we employed generalized additive models at the scale of the annual subpopulation range and conditional logistic regression at the scale of individual movements.
   Results Cross River gorillas habitat selection is highly scale dependent. Localized measures of habitat quality strongly influenced selection at the subpopulation or landscape scale, while human activity and food availability were the best predictors of selection at finer scales.
   Main conclusions Understanding why CRG do not occur in seemingly suitable habitat is crucial for designating critical habitat both within and between CRG subpopulations. Our results indicate that conservation planning to maintain critical habitat and connectivity among CRG populations will require an integrative, multi-scale planning approach incorporating large-scale landscape characteristics, human use patterns and CRG food availability.

AB  - As marine systems are threatened by increasing human impacts, mechanisms to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services are needed. Protecting areas of conservation importance may serve as a proxy for maintaining these functions, while also facilitating efficient use and management of limited resources. Biodiversity hotspots have been used as surrogates for spatial conservation importance; however, as many protected areas have been established opportunistically and under differing criteria, it is unclear how well they actually protect hotspots. We evaluated how well the current protected area network and priority areas selected through previous systematic conservation planning exercises preserve biodiversity hotspots in the Gulf of California, Mexico. We also determined spatial congruence between biodiversity hotspots based on different criteria, which may determine their ability to be used as surrogates for each other. We focus on the Gulf of California because it is a megadiverse system where limited information regarding species diversity and distribution has constrained development of strategies for conservation and management. We developed a species occurrence database and identified biodiversity hotspots using four different criteria: species richness, rarity, endemism, and threatened species. We interpolated species occurrence, while accounting for heterogeneous sampling efforts. We then assessed overlap of hotspots with existing protected areas and priority areas, and between hotspots derived by distinct criteria. We gathered 286,533 occurrence records belonging to 12,105 unique species, including 6388 species identified as rare, 642 as endemic, and 386 as threatened. We found that biodiversity hotspots showed little spatial overlap with areas currently under protection and previously identified priority areas. Our results highlight the importance of distinct spatial areas of biodiversity and suggest that different ecological mechanisms sustain different aspects of diversity and multiple criteria should be used when defining conservation areas.

AB  - Habitat loss threatens large mammals worldwide, and their survival will depend on habitat in human-dominated landscapes. Conservation planners thus face the challenge to identify areas of least conflict with land use, yet broadscale species distribution models rarely incorporate real landscape patterns nor do they identify potential conservation conflicts. An excellent example of such conservation challenges is provided by European bison (Bison bonasus). Almost extinct by the early 20th century, bison can only survive in the wild if large metapopulations are established, but it is unclear where new herds can be reintroduced. Using European bison as an example we conducted a continental-scale habitat assessment based on real landscape patterns. Our specific aims here were to (1) map European bison habitat throughout the species' former range, (2) examine whether broadscale habitat suitability factors differ from previously reported fine-scale factors, and (3) assess where suitable habitat occurs in areas with low potential for conflict with land use. We assessed habitat suitability using herd range maps for all 36 free-ranging European bison herds as habitat use data. Habitat suitability maps were compared with maps of land cover, livestock density, agricultural constraints, and protected areas to assess potential conservation conflicts. Our models had high goodness of fit (AUC 0.941), and we found abundant potential bison habitat. European bison prefer mosaic-type landscapes, with a preference for broad-leaved and mixed forests. European bison metapopulations do not appear to be limited by habitat availability. However, most potential habitat occurred outside protected areas and has substantial potential for conservation conflicts. The most promising areas for establishing large bison metapopulations all occur in Eastern Europe (i.e., the Carpathians, the Belarus-Ukraine borderlands, and several regions in European Russia). The future of European bison and that of other large mammals in the wild thus clearly lies in Eastern Europe, because habitat there is most abundant and least fragmented, and because the potential for conflict with land use is lower. More generally we suggest that broadscale habitat assessments that incorporate land use can be powerful tools for conservation planning and will be key if large herbivore and carnivore conservation is to succeed in a human-dominated world.

AB  - Seagrass meadows provide important ecosystem services, but are among the least conserved marine ecosystems. The Southern bioregion of China has the nation's largest seagrass distribution. However, lack of information on the distribution of seagrasses and the threats they face pose a significant obstacle to their conservation and restoration. Accordingly, a framework for prioritizing conservation and restoration objectives was proposed in the present study. First, we modeled the suitable habitats with MaxEnt, random forest (RF), and ensemble models to obtain a reliable basis map of seagrass distribution. A potentially suitable area of approximately 3,536-4,852 km2 was mapped in the coastal sea of South China, with the greatest area occurring between 18 degrees N and 22 degrees N. The anthropogenic pressures on the seagrass habitat were then estimated using an integrated exposure index consisting of four indicators, namely, population density, fishery economy, aquaculture, and shipping. The results indicated 48% of the coastal seas were under intensive anthropogenic pressures, with a higher exposure in the north than the south. The current conservation status suggests that there is a large seagrass conservation gap. By coupling the two dimensions of habitat suitability and integrated exposure, priority sites for seagrass management in South China were identified for the first time. Our work will not only provide basic information for coastal ecosystem management, but also serve as a tool to support the conservation and restoration planning of seagrass, thus, ultimately promoting the sustainability of seagrasses habitats.

AB  - The Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus) is vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures and has undergone an extensive decline through much of its range in Southeast Asia. However, little is known about the changing distribution of Green Peafowl in China through historical periods. We described a 5000-6000 years distribution change of Green Peafowl in China by using historical archives. We examined the present distributions of Green Peafowl by using camera traps and transect surveys and predicted the suitable habitat to support future conservation planning for this species. Although Green Peafowl was once widely distributed across China, the species experienced a southward range retreat over the past 5000-6000 years and is now restricted to a small part of Yunnan. The results of prediction from maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) showed that the size of suitable habitat of Green Peafowl in Yunnan was 17,132 km(2). The suitable habitat concentrated in nine prefectures of Yunnan and Pu'er, Chuxiong, and Yuxi accounted for 48.64%, 27.39% and 15.83%, respectively. These results suggest that central Yunnan can cover most of the current larger and more contiguous populations of Green Peafowl in China and should be protected. Moreover, some areas in southern Yunnan, such as Xishuangbanna, can be a candidate for reestablishing populations, given that the species disappeared in this region less than 20 years ago and has a large remaining habitat.

AB  - Questions Species distribution models (SDMs) based on habitat suitability and niche quantification are powerful tools in vegetation science. Recent findings suggest that they could be applied at the landscape scale as vegetation conservation tools, but that some environmental dimensions (e.g., climate) need to be considered at larger scales. What is the importance of applying hierarchical SDMs combining information from different scales to ensure consistent local vegetation management decisions? Study Site Mainland Spain and Biosphere Reserve of Sierra del Rincon (central Spain). Methods We generated SDMs for five tree species at the regional scale (mainland Spain) using climatic variables plus presence/absence data from the Spanish National Forest Inventory; and at the landscape scale (Sierra del Rincon Biosphere Reserve) using local environmental variables plus locally gathered vegetation presence/absence data. Predictions of both regional and landscape models were combined at the landscape scale following two different hierarchical approaches. The four resulting predictions were compared with correlation coefficients and independently evaluated with the AUC statistic and data collected in the study area. Results The regional SDMs depict suitable climatic conditions for the tree species, while the landscape SDMs capture important local ecological drivers that influence habitat suitability at finer scales. Expectedly, the regional SDMs predict larger suitable areas than the landscape SDMs. The predictions from the hierarchical approaches are reliable and provide on average better results than non-hierarchical ones. Conclusions SDMs can be valuable tools for local plant conservation programs. We present examples of the applicability of a hierarchical modeling approach and conceptual and methodological solutions related to the use of these tools in local vegetation conservation programs. For example, we show that landscape SDMs could be used to determine the current distribution of endangered plant species, while a hierarchical approach would be better suited to define areas to re-vegetate within a local restoration program.

AB  - Anomochlooideae (Poaceae) represent the earliest-diverging extant lineage of grasses. One of the two genera is the monotypic Anomochloa, which is extremely rare and restricted to the Atlantic Forest of southern Bahia state in Brazil, where only two natural populations have been recorded to date. Knowledge of A. marantoidea is considered crucial to understanding evolutionary and diversification patterns in Poaceae. Despite this, knowledge of the biology and distribution of A. marantoidea remain incomplete, and thus the conservation of this poorly known species is problematic. We used niche modelling to estimate its current distribution and assess potential ranges in situ to explore new occurrences. In addition, genetic diversity and the factors that disrupt gene flow between populations of this species were estimated using molecular markers. Two new populations were documented; the modelled ecological niche indicates high climatic restriction, but also revealed suitable sites for the establishment of new populations. Genetic diversity is correlated to population size, and genetic structure analysis suggests recent fragmentation and low gene flow among the remaining populations, which exhibit high levels of inbreeding. These levels also indicate the capacity of A. marantoidea to respond favourably to selection and, thus, that a conservation plan could be designed to maintain the current genetic diversity.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) spearhead global conservation efforts, but it has been repeatedly demonstrated that narrowly distributed species are more likely to be unrepresented in PAs. This means that where local extinctions are more likely outside PAs, a positive feedback loop could render PAs largely ineffective in decelerating extinctions, even where PAs effectively abate threats. Here we empirically test the elements of this feedback loop using distribution data for 1,572 threatened plants in Japan. Narrowly distributed species were indeed less likely to overlap PAs than widespread species, and local extinction rates for unprotected populations over 15 years were 1.5 times higher than those inside PAs. A simulation model showed that new PAs will substantially reduce extinction risk for widespread species, but not for narrowly distributed species, unless they are placed very precisely in the landscape. Our results suggest that a representation-extinction feedback will limit the effectiveness of PAs in preventing extinctions unless PA placement is carefully targeted.

AB  - Modern intensive forestry worldwide is posing serious threats to old-growth forest specialist species. Cost-effective conservation can only be achieved when the ecology and distribution of species are well understood. The present distribution of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans), a vulnerable species in Finland (and Europe), is poorly known, and its ecology studied only locally. We conducted a nationwide survey of the species to assess its distribution and derived habitat variables from the National Forest Inventory dataset to study its habitat requirements. We performed separate logistic regression models of the species occurrence at two separate spatial scales, small (9 ha plot) and landscape (1 km radius) extent. At the small scale, occurrence increased with average forest age and volume of spruce trees. At the landscape scale, occurrence was positively related to cover of mature spruce/mixed forests, density of suitable habitat patches and, rather unexpectedly, agricultural fields. Occurrence of flying squirrel was generally higher in restricted regions of central-western Finland, where the forested landscape is more fragmented by agricultural fields, compared to the rest of the country. Our findings indicate that the species can make use of fragmented habitat mosaics including forests and the interface between forests and fields. Conserving spruce dominated mature stands in these landscape mosaics is a key to maintaining adequate habitat for the species. We conclude that conservation efforts should also be directed to the most highly man-modified landscapes, where the preservation of habitat patches of good quality for the species should be integrated within the forest management plans.

AB  - Measuring and characterizing the area utilized by a population or species is essential for assessment of conservation status and for effective allocation of habitat to ensure population persistence. Yet population-level range delineation is complicated by the variety of available techniques coupled with a lack of empirical methods to compare the relative value of these techniques. This study assesses the effect of model choice on resulting subpopulation range estimation for the critically endangered and patchily distributed Cross River gorilla, and evaluates the conservation conclusions that can be drawn from each model. Models considered range from basic traditional approaches (e.g. minimum convex polygon) to newer home range techniques such as local convex hull (LoCoH). Overlap analysis comparing sub-sampled to complete data sets are used to evaluate the robustness of various modeling techniques to data limitations. Likelihood cross validation criterion is employed to compare core range model performance. Results suggest that differing LoCoH models produce similar range estimates, are robust to data requirements, provide a good fit for core habitat estimation, and are best able to detect unused habitat within the subpopulation range. LoCoH methods may thus be useful for studies into habitat selection and factors limiting endangered species distributions. However, LoCoH models tend to over-fit data, and kernel methods may provide similar information about animal space use while supporting protection of larger swaths of critical habitat. Subpopulation range analyses for conservation/management planning should therefore explore multiple modeling techniques, and employ both qualitative and quantitative assessments to select the best models to inform decision making for species of conservation concern.

AB  - Designation of an effective marine protected area (MPA) requires substantial knowledge of the spatial use of the region by key species, particularly those of high mobility. Within the Ross Sea, Antarctica, the least altered marine ecosystem on Earth, unusually large and closely interacting populations of several marine bird and mammal species co-exist. Understanding how that is possible is important to maintaining the ecological integrity of the system, the major goal in designating the Ross Sea as an MPA. We report analyses of niche occupation, two-dimensional habitat use, and overlap for the majority (9) of mesopredator species in the Ross Sea considering three components: (1) diet, (2) vertical distribution and (3) horizontal distribution. For (1) and (2) we used information in the literature; for (3) we used maximum entropy modeling to project species' distributions from occurrence data from several ocean cruises and satellite telemetry, correlated with six environmental variables. Results identified and ranked areas of importance in a conservation prioritization framework. While diet overlapped intensively, some spatial partitioning existed in the vertical dimension (diving depth). Horizontal partitioning, however, was the key structuring factor, defined by three general patterns of environmental suitability: (1) continental shelf break, (2) shelf and slope, and (3) marginal ice zone of the pack ice surrounding the Ross Sea post-polynya. In aggregate, the nine mesopredators used the entire continental shelf and slope, allowing the large populations of these species to co-exist. Conservation prioritization analyses identified the outer shelf and slope and the deeper troughs in the Ross Sea shelf to be most important. Our results substantially improve understanding of these species' niche occupation and imply that a piecemeal approach to MPA designation in this system is not likely to be successful.

AB  - Reserve selections are often opportunistic rather than strategic and coordinated, and consequently, many reserves are ineffective to achieve their intended goals of conservation. Here, we assessed the conservation effectiveness of a reserve for the golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) with a niche-based approach. We assessed habitat usage of the monkeys in Shennongjia Nature Reserve (SNR) and attributes of 14 environmental variables that could potentially affect the monkeys' habitat use. Spatial distribution of potentially suitable habitat for the monkeys was then modeled with Maxent, a niche-based model, and conservation effectiveness of SNR was assessed by comparing the current boundary of the reserve with the spatial distribution of the modeled potential habitat and the current habitat area of the monkeys. Only 59% of the habitat area and 61% of the predicted potential habitat area were under the protection of SNR. To improve conservation effectiveness of SNR, we proposed that the current SNR be enlarged by 270km(2). The enlarged reserve would encompass 100% of the existing habitat area plus 89% of the predicted potential habitat area. Using the niche-based approach, we were able to integrate habitat usage data of the target species with that of remote sensing to identify areas potentially suitable as habitat for the species. This information can be used not only for improving conservation effectiveness of existing reserves but also for the effective planning and designing of new reserves.

AB  - Aim
   To examine the response of forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages and feeding guilds to patch characteristics of forest fragments in the context of island biogeography and metapopulation theories in an area that supports high levels of species diversity and endemism.
   Location
   Dune, riverine, sand and swamp forest fragments in southern Mozambique's Maputaland.
   Methods
   We recorded 20 forest-dependent and 69 generalist bird species at 220 survey points in 30 forest fragments that ranged in size from 5 to 7432 ha and that were 100 to 5100 m apart. We used linear regressions to relate the number of species to forest fragment size, isolation, perimeter, fractal dimension, shape and core area for frugivores, insectivores, granivores, nectarivores, carnivores and omnivores separately for forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages. We tested for modality in occupancy frequency distributions of species in forest fragments and used the binary matrix temperature calculator to determine whether the assemblages had a nested structure separately for forest-dependent and generalist bird species.
   Results
   The number of forest-dependent and generalist bird species categorized into the feeding guilds varied independently from forest patch parameter values. Occupancy models showed a random distribution for forest-dependent birds, and generalists had a unimodal distribution. Both the forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages had a non-nested structure. The presence of eight rare forest-dependent and four endemic bird species in 22 of the 30 fragments contributed to the non-nested structure of these bird assemblages.
   Main conclusions
   Fragmented forests did not induce the expected responses of the forest bird assemblages in that the number of species was not explained by patch characteristics, nor could we find evidence for metapopulation dynamics. Non-nestedness may be caused by the few rare and endemic species occupying forest fragments with a wide range of patch characteristics. Knowledge of the response of species to forest fragmentation can benefit conservation planning catering for rare and endemic species. Our study suggests that all forest fragments in the region may have to be included in a conservation network to complement existing landscape-based plans to protect the region.

AB  - The process of habitat loss and fragmentation is inevitable with increasing human activities, necessitating conservation for the areas with the highest priorities (i.e., biodiversity hotspots). This study aimed to predict the core habitats of the eight mustelid species (family: Mustelidae) in Iran and detect mustelid diversity hotspots based on the highest species richness of these species to compare them with available conservation areas (CAs). Accordingly, habitat suitability modeling was carried out for each mustelid species through an ensemble approach, and species richness and mustelid diversity hotspots were determined by overlaying the predicted core habitats. The results revealed that the highest richness of the mustelid species was six species for the overlaid map of the modeled core habitats. The main mustelid diversity hotspots were along the Alborz Mountains and the Hyrcanian forest of northern Iran. There were some other hotspots along the Zagros Mountains in western Iran. CAs protected less than half of mustelid diversity hotspots, which means that wildlife managers should take into consideration the conservation action plan for the mustelid species in Iran. Besides, it is necessary to expand available CAs or establish new-targeted CAs according to mustelid diversity hotspots.

AB  - Context. Species conservation assessments require information on distribution, habitat requirements and population demography and trends. Uncertain conservation assessments limit effective planning and may lead to poor management decisions. Top-order predators generally receive considerable attention from ecologists and conservation biologists, with the notable exception of large pythons and boas. They are typically elusive and have low population densities, posing challenges for ecological research and monitoring. Ecological and demographic data are lacking for most large snake species and are generally inadequate to properly assess conservation status or to evaluate their broader ecological roles. The Oenpelli python (Simalia oenpelliensis) is Australia's second-longest snake species, but remains one of the least-known of the world's pythons.
   Aims. We sought to use non-systematically collected data from multiple sources to evaluate Oenpelli python population trends and habitat associations, and to assess its conservation status.
   Methods. We identified a priori biases in data and evaluated their influences on environmental models and temporal variability in reporting patterns. We then used these findings to assess the conservation status of this species, identify knowledge gaps, and refine future survey and monitoring methods.
   Key results. Oenpelli python records were strongly associated with monsoon rainforest, sandstone outcrops and perennial streams, irrespective of detection biases. Total area of occupancy was estimated to be 19 252 km(2). Detection patterns were strongly seasonal and associated with periods of low rainfall and low moonlight, informing better-targeted survey and monitoring methods with improved sensitivity.
   Conclusions. Oenpelli pythons have a highly fragmented distribution owing to their strong association with monsoon rainforest. This habitat is likely to provide more food resources and refuge from high temperatures than are the surrounding savanna woodlands. Detection probability should improve by surveying Oenpelli pythons in September on moonless nights and following periods of high rainfall. Taking a precautionary approach, the Oenpelli python qualifies as Vulnerable under IUCN criteria, supporting its current Red List and Northern Territory Government status.
   Implications. Non-systematically collected data on poorly known species can be used to improve conservation assessments where there may otherwise be high uncertainty. The present study also highlighted the paucity of ecological knowledge of large iconic snake species globally.

AB  - Climate change is causing shifts in the distribution patterns of freshwater fish at various spatio-temporal scales. Tropical freshwater fish are vulnerable, especially in areas where a high impact of climate change is predicted; thus, there is an increasing need to predict these shifts to determine conservation and adaptation strategies. Ecological niche models offer a reliable way to predict the effects of climate change on species distribution. Potential shifts in the distribution of tropical fish were tested under two scenarios (4.5 - moderate and 8.5 - extreme) with three general circulation models for years 2050 and 2070 using maximum entropy software using as models two predatory species - the tropical gar Atractosteus tropicus and the giant cichlid Petenia splendida. The potential distribution of both species was associated with warm and humid-sub-humid conditions. Future projections showed a higher availability of suitable areas for both species resulting from the expansion of warmer conditions in the middle and upper basins of the Central American mountain range and centre of the Yucatan Peninsula. Ecological niche models of keystone or umbrella species such as A. tropicus and P. splendida could be useful to support conservation plans of protected areas. The potential distribution of both species covers areas of high suitability including six important biosphere reserves in Mexico, three protected areas in Guatemala and part of the Mesoamerican biological corridor. Despite the potential expansion of the present distribution range suggested by the models, it is important to consider the biological and ecological requirements of the species and the ecological implications of these potential shifts in distribution. Both scenarios could have several implications at genetic, population, and ecosystem levels.

AB  - Selecting optimal revegetation patterns and filtering priority areas can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of revegetation planning, particularly in areas with severe vegetation damage. However, few people include optimal revegetation patterns and priority restoration areas into revegetation plans. The Near-Nature restoration pays attention to "based on nature" ideas, guiding the degraded ecosystems to reorganize and achieving sustainable restoration through self-regulation. In this study, we conducted a field survey of the native vegetation communities in the Yanhe River catchment, and the data obtained were used to construct the potential distribution suitability of the habitat and screen the priority areas through the combination of MaxEnt and prioritizr models. We drew a heat map of species richness by simulating the potential distribution of 60 native species. The results showed that the potentially suitable habitats for forest cover were distributed in the southern part of the Yanhe River catchment; the potentially suitable habitats for herbaceous plant species were located in the center and the northwest parts of the study area; the potentially suitable habitats for shrub plant species in this area were larger than that of the forest, and herbaceous plants species were distributed in many zones of the study area. This study demonstrated that shrubs and herbaceous plant species in parts of the Loess Plateau should be considered as the pioneer plants of revegetation in future revegetation plans. Moreover, we also mapped the priority area of the Near-Nature restoration based on the richness of the potential native species. The procedure followed in this study could provide guidance for revegetation planning and manual management in the regions where vegetation damage occurs.

AB  - There is high-level political support for the use of green infrastructure (GI) across Europe, to maintain viable populations and to provide ecosystem services (ES). Even though GI is inherently a spatial concept, the modern tools for spatial planning have not been recognized, such as in the recent European Environment Agency (EEA) report. We outline a toolbox of methods useful for GI design that explicitly accounts for biodiversity and ES. Data on species occurrence, habitats, and environmental variables are increasingly available via open-access internet platforms. Such data can be synthesized by statistical species distribution modeling, producing maps of biodiversity features. These, together with maps of ES, can form the basis for GI design. We argue that spatial conservation prioritization (SCP) methods are effective tools for GI design, as the overall SCP goal is cost-effective allocation of conservation efforts. Corridors are currently promoted by the EEA as the means for implementing GI design, but they typically target the needs of only a subset of the regional species pool. SCP methods would help to ensure that GI provides a balanced solution for the requirements of many biodiversity features (e.g., species, habitat types) and ES simultaneously in a cost-effective manner. Such tools are necessary to make GI into an operational concept for combating biodiversity loss and promoting ES.

AB  - 1. Correlative species distribution models can be used to produce spatially explicit estimates of environmental suitability for organisms. This process can provide meaningful information for a range of purposes (e.g. estimating a species' current or future distribution, estimating dispersal limits, predicting occupancy for conservation planning) but, like all statistical exercises, is subject to numerous assumptions and can be influenced by several sources of potential bias.
   2. In this issue of Journal of Applied Ecology, we (Murray et al. 2011) employ a correlative species distribution model for infection with the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), cause of amphibian chytridiomycosis, to derive useful information for the immediate management and research of this pathogen in Australia. Also in this issue, Rohr, Halstead & Raffel (2011) comment on some of the potential limitations of our approach and the value of our results in practice.
   3.Synthesis and applications. Here we show that while a focus on mechanisms of dispersal and transmission among hosts, as advocated in both studies, is an important objective for modelling Bd distribution under climate change or at invasion fronts, correlative models can be of immediate value for their ability to generate a baseline hypothesis about the current potential distribution of this lethal pathogen and for efficiently identifying gaps in current knowledge. As demonstrated in our paper, this should help improve the immediate allocation of limited research and management resources for future surveillance efforts and proactive species conservation.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to update the distribution of the Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) in Portugal in order to determine regions of suitable environmental conditions and to assess potential occurrence areas, as a first step towards a conservation strategy for the species. Data on the distribution of the species was derived from barn owl pellet samples. Climatic, topographic and soil descriptors were selected and logistic regression was used to model the species distribution. The effort in data collection resulted in the enlargement of the previously known distribution of M. cabrerae. Two logistic models were developed, one environmental and one autologistic, integrating variation due to spatial autocorrelation. The results showed that the species are more likely to occur over the most central region of Portugal, extending its range to the north-eastern side and to the southwest. The preferred areas of occurrence are characterized by medium rainfall values (between 600 and 1200 mm), low to medium humidity values (lower than 85%) and acid to neutral soils (pH between 3 and 7). Species probability of occurrence is discussed in terms of paleontological data and geographical barriers. Potential distribution maps suggest a fragmentation of the overall national population and allowed the identification of three major areas of high probability of occurrence: northeast, center and southwest. As most of these areas are outside Classified Areas Network, models obtained may be regarded as valuable tools in conservation planning. (c) 2007 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

AB  - The present study used abundance and habitat variables to design High Conservation Value Forests for wildlife protection. We considered great apes (Gorilla gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes troglodytes) as model species, and we used nest surveys, dietary analysis and botanical inventories to evaluate whether the traditional methods that use abundance data alone were consistent with the survival of the species. We assumed that setting a local priority area for animal conservation can be made possible if at least one variable (abundance or habitat variables) is spatially clustered and that the final decision for a species may depend on the pattern of spatial association between abundance, nesting habitat and feeding habitat. We used Kernel Density Estimation to evaluate the spatial pattern of each biological variable. The results indicate that all three variables were spatially clustered for both gorillas and chimpanzees. The abundance variables of both animal species were spatially correlated to their preferred nesting habitat variables. But while the chimpanzee feeding habitat variable was spatially correlated to the abundance and nesting habitat variables, the same pattern was not observed for gorillas. We then proposed different methods to be considered to design local priority areas for the conservation of each great ape species. Alone, the abundance variable does not successfully represent the spatial distribution of major biological requirements for the survival of wildlife species; we, therefore, recommend the integration of the spatial distribution of their food resources to overcome the mismatch caused by the existence of a biological interaction between congeneric species.

AB  - Species distribution modelling has been widely employed to indicate probable areas of invasion and to guide management strategies. Drosophila nasuta is native to Asia and has invaded Africa, islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans and, more recently, the Americas. This species has been dispersing rapidly in the past decade, dominating the assemblage of drosophilids in numerous invaded territories, especially in protected areas. Here, we model the potential geographic distribution of D. nasuta for the present and two future scenarios. We also determine the environmental variables that most influence its distribution and investigate the risk of invasion in protected areas. Drosophila nasuta has the potential to expand its occurrence, especially on continents that have already been invaded. Variables related to greater rainfall were those that most influenced its distribution. The projections for the two future scenarios revealed a small increase in the distribution of the species compared to the projection for the present. The largest overlaps between the projected areas to be invaded by D. nasuta and territories in protected areas were found for Central and South America. The predictive maps delineated here can assist in the establishment of management plans directed at the conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - India has different bioclimatic zones and supports diverse aquatic habitats rich in biodiversity. For effective conservation of the endangered species in its habitat, it is essential to know the distribution of fish species in the environmental range, and for this, species distribution models are the efficient and innovative tools. The present study used the MaxEnt modeling technique for developing probability distribution models highlighting the distribution of fish species by analyzing the known occurrence records of Denison barb under genus Sahyadria (Sahyadria denisonii Day 1865 and Sahyadria chalakkudiensis (Menon et al., Rec Zool Surv India 97:61-63, 1999)) in relation to environmental variables typically incorporating seasonal and temporal variability. AUC of the models for Sahyadria species depicted good fitness. Both species were found sensitive to "solar radiation," "temperature seasonality," and "temperature annual range" and assessed as significant predictors. The sensitivity and distribution of both species to these environmental variables were found correlated with their breading and spawning seasons. " Precipitation" was determined as one of the significant climatic envelopes influencing the distribution of the species associated with river flow. The models showed the distribution of S. denisonii in the higher precipitation areas compared to S. chalakkudiensis. The probability distribution model with respect to the distribution of both species indicates a lineage barrier at Palghat Gap supporting the earlier studies. At the latitudinal scale, prediction of the suitable ecological habitat provides a detailed insight into the distribution of all genetic lineages of the genus Sahyadria. Evidently, the findings of this study can assist in determining ecological niches for endangered species of other areas and may aid in field surveys as well as developing conservation plans.

AB  - Species restricted to archipelagos are often range-restricted, dispersal limited, and persist as disjunct populations. These attributes can make island populations especially vulnerable to extinction from natural or anthropogenic processes. Ascertaining causes of habitat use, population impact, and range loss is fundamental to guiding effective conservation actions. The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) is an endangered, island-endemic species with a highly restricted range distribution limited to a small number of islands in Eastern Indonesia. Flores Island is the largest island (13,540 km(2)) within the species distribution. However, with relatively few and small-protected areas, alongside a much higher incidence of human-related habitat use, Komodo dragon habitat occupancy is suspected to decrease on Flores. Here over five years, we conducted systematic surveys to evaluate Komodo dragon habitat occupancy at 346 camera monitoring stations (CMS) distributed along the Flores coastline. We successfully detected Komodo dragons at 85 of the 346 CMS on Flores. The pattern of Komodo dragon site presence indicated their distribution was confined to three isolated and highly restricted habitat areas on the west, northwestern, and northern coastal regions of Flores. Ranking of competing models indicated that proximity to farms and villages had the strongest negative effects on Komodo dragon habitat occupancy. The current predicted Komodo dragon range distribution appeared to have undergone significant range area contraction (similar to 44%) at multiple coastal areas known to be occupied by the Komodo dragon detected in previous decades (i.e., 1970-2000). We attribute decreased Komodo dragon habitat use and range loss to multiple and cascading human activities. To address these threats, we advocate a range of land use planning and community conservation actions to avoid a potential Komodo dragon extirpation on the largest island habitat within their distribution.

AB  - The distribution of forests can be hindcast or forecast when robust data and validation proofs are available. Distribution consequences for temperate coniferous forests during the Quaternary and future climatic fluctuations are little understood in China. Temperate coniferous forests are subdivided into two types where Pinus, Keteleeria, Tsuga and Cupressus species characterize the warm forests while Abies, Picea, Larix and Juniperus species characterize the cold forests. Both forest types were investigated using 12,675 unique records in the MaxEnt model to infer distribution patterns during six time periods: the present time, mid-Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum, Last Interglacial and the near- and far-future (2050, 2070). The results showed that the mean temperature of the driest quarter, followed by the temperature annual range and the precipitation of the warmest quarter were the most important variables controlling forests distribution. Suitable areas capable of supporting the presence of warm coniferous forests were highly contracted during the Quaternary; meanwhile, the cold coniferous forests expanded westwards from the last glacial maximum through the mid-Holocene to the present. The predicted future distributions showed a significant range-shift of warm forests northeastwards in response to climate change while cold coniferous forests are expected to migrate towards the Tibetan Plateau. Under increased global warming, the bioclimatic variables of the past and future periods were used as ecological indicators for the identification of areas showing "climatic stability", and predicted to be refugia for coniferous forests and as good tools for conservation planning in Sichuan and the Hengduan-Tibetan migration corridor.

AB  - As anthropogenic degradation of biodiversity and ecosystems increases, so does the potential threat to the supply of ecosystem services, a key contribution of nature to people. Biodiversity has often been used in spatial conservation planning and has been regarded as one among multiple services delivered by ecosystems. Hence, biodiversity conservation planning should be integrated in a framework of prioritizing services in order to inform decision-making. Here, we propose a prioritization approach based on scenarios maximising both the provision of ecosystem services and the conservation of biodiversity hotspots. Different weighting scenarios for the alpha-diversity in four taxonomic groups and 10 mapped ecosystem services were used to simulate varying priorities of policymakers in a mountain region. Our results illustrate how increasing priorities to ecosystem services can be disadvantageous to biodiversity. Moreover, the analysis to identify priority areas that best compromise the conservation of alpha-diversity and ecosystem services are predominantly not located within the current protected area network. Our analyses stress the need for an appropriate weighting of biodiversity within decision making that seek to integrate multiple ecosystem services. Our study paves the way toward further integration of multiple biodiversity groups and components, ecosystem services and various socio-economic scenarios, ultimately fuelling the development of more informed, evidence-based spatial planning decisions for conservation.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are the primary tools currently available for assessing vulnerability to climatic change. Most past projections of the effects of climate change on species distribution have ignored biological interactions. We evaluated to what degree incorporating prey availability into climatic-based SDMs would change the predicted future distribution of the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) and the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor). We projected climate niches using (1) only the climatic variables; (2) both climatic and prey availability data. When we based inferences on models that did not account for prey availability, we predicted that the range of the Asiatic cheetah would contract by 42% between current and future under a low-emissions scenario, whereas the range of the Persian leopard would expand by 9%. Adding the effects of prey availability into the model did not affect predictions for the Asiatic cheetah (41% range contraction), but did alter predictions for the Persian leopard, whose range was expected to contract by 25%. Persian leopards are predicted to be less affected by climate change when the analysis considers climatic variables only, but when models are integrated with the prey data, large habitat losses are predicted. Our results show that there can be complex and large interactions between climate change and other limiting ecological resources which must be accounted for in SDMs. It is therefore important to integrate biotic interactions and the temporal dynamics of species distribution induced by climate change into conservation planning to optimally plan the spatial distribution of conservation areas.

AB  - Accurate mapping is a main challenge for endangered small-sized terrestrial species. Freely available spatio-temporal data at high resolution from multispectral satellite offer excellent opportunities for improving predictive distribution models of such species based on fine-scale habitat features, thus making it easier to achieve comprehensive biodiversity conservation goals. However, there are still few examples showing the utility of remote-sensing-based products in mapping microhabitat suitability for small species of conservation concern. Here, we address this issue using Sentinel-2 sensor-derived habitat variables, used in combination with more commonly used explanatory variables (e.g., topography), to predict the distribution of the endangered Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) in agrosilvopastorial systems. Based on vole surveys conducted in two different seasons over a similar to 176,000 ha landscape in Southern Portugal, we assessed the significance of each predictor in explaining Cabrera vole occurrence using the Boruta algorithm, a novel Random forest variant for dealing with high dimensionality of explanatory variables. Overall, results showed a strong contribution of Sentinel-2-derived variables for predicting microhabitat suitability of Cabrera voles. In particular, we found that photosynthetic activity (NDI45), specific spectral signal (SWIR1), and landscape heterogeneity (Rao's Q) were good proxies of Cabrera voles' microhabitat, mostly during temporally greener and wetter conditions. In addition to remote-sensing-based variables, the presence of road verges was also an important driver of voles' distribution, highlighting their potential role as refuges and/or corridors. Overall, our study supports the use of remote-sensing data to predict microhabitat suitability for endangered small-sized species in marginal areas that potentially hold most of the biodiversity found in human-dominated landscapes. We believe our approach can be widely applied to other species, for which detailed habitat mapping over large spatial extents is difficult to obtain using traditional descriptors. This would certainly contribute to improving conservation planning, thereby contributing to global conservation efforts in landscapes that are managed for multiple purposes.

AB  - One of the aims of the United Nations (UN) negotiations on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) is to develop a legal process for the establishment of area-based management tools, including marine protected areas, in ABNJ. Here we use a conservation planning algorithm to integrate 55 global data layers on ABNJ species diversity, habitat heterogeneity, benthic features, productivity, and fishing as a means for highlighting priority regions in ABNJ to be considered for spatial protection. We also include information on forecasted species distributions under climate change. We found that parameterizing the planning algorithm to protect at least 30% of these key ABNJ conservation features, while avoiding areas of high fishing effort, yielded a solution that highlights 52,545,634 km2 (23.7%) of ABNJ as high priority regions for protection. Instructing the planning model to avoid ABNJ areas with high fishing effort resulted in relatively minor shifts in the planning solution, when compared to a separate model that did not consider fishing effort. Integrating information on climate change had a similarly minor influence on the planning solution, suggesting that climate-informed ABNJ protected areas may be able to protect biodiversity now and in the future. This globally standardized, data-driven process for identifying priority ABNJ regions for protection serves as a valuable complement to other expert-driven processes underway to highlight ecologically or biologically significant ABNJ regions. Both the outputs and methods exhibited in this analysis can additively inform UN decision-making concerning establishment of ABNJ protected areas.

AB  - Understanding species-environment relationships is key to defining the spatial structure of species distributions and develop effective conservation plans. However, for many species, this baseline information does not exist. With reliable presence data, spatial models that predict geographic ranges and identify environmental processes regulating distribution are a cost-effective and rapid method to achieve this. Yet these spatial models are lacking for many rare and threatened species, particularly in tropical regions. The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) is a Neotropical forest raptor of conservation concern with a continental distribution across lowland tropical forests in Central and South America. Currently, the harpy eagle faces threats from habitat loss and persecution and is categorized as Near-Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Within a point process modeling (PPM) framework, we use presence-only occurrences with climatic and topographical predictors to estimate current and past distributions and define environmental requirements using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. The current PPM prediction had high calibration accuracy (Continuous Boyce Index = 0.838) and was robust to null expectations (pROC ratio = 1.407). Three predictors contributed 96% to the PPM prediction, with Climatic Moisture Index the most important (72.1%), followed by minimum temperature of the warmest month (15.6%) and Terrain Roughness Index (8.3%). Assessing distribution in environmental space confirmed the same predictors explaining distribution, along with precipitation in the wettest month. Our reclassified binary model estimated a current range size 11% smaller than the current IUCN range polygon. Paleoclimatic projections combined with the current model predicted stable climatic refugia in the central Amazon, Guyana, eastern Colombia, and Panama. We propose a data-driven geographic range to complement the current IUCN range estimate and that despite its continental distribution, this tropical forest raptor is highly specialized to specific environmental requirements.

AB  - Question: To establish a habitat classification based on functional group co-occurrence that may help the drawing up of conservation plans.
   Location: Riverine forest fragments in the Grand-duche de Luxembourg, Europe.
   Methods: Forest fragments were surveyed for their abundance of vascular plants. These were clustered into emergent groups according to 14 life-traits related to plant dispersal, establishment and persistence. Forest fragments were classified according to similar distribution of the identified emergent groups. Environmental factors were related to the emergent group richness in each forest type using generalized linear models.
   Results: Contrary to former species centred classifications, only two groups of forests, each with clearly different emergent group composition and conservation requirements, were detected: (1) swamp forests characterized by anemogamous perennials, annuals and hydrochorous perennials and (2) moist forests characterized by barochorous perennials, small geophytes and zoochorous phanerophytes. From a conservation point of view, priority should be given to large swamp forest with intact flooding regimes. This is in accordance with the high wind and water dispersal capacities of their typical emergent groups. For the moist forests, conservation priorities should be high forest connectivity and historical continuity since dispersal and establishment of their characteristic emergent groups are highly limited.
   Conclusions: The described methodology, situated at an intermediate integration level between the individual species and whole community descriptors, takes advantage of both conservation plans built for single species and the synthetic power of broad ecological measures.

AB  - As threats to biodiversity from environmental change increase, assessing priorities for mitigation action becomes increasingly important. However, there have been few attempts to schedule actions across broad spatial extents that explicitly account for dynamic ecological processes and threats. We combined a dynamic occupancy model with a decision analysis framework to spatially allocate multiple recovery actions to maximize species' probability of occupancy under threats posed by climate and land-use change. We used the koala Phascolarctos cinereus across the Australian state of New South Wales (810000km(2)) to illustrate this approach. We considered four actions implemented on a 10x10km(2) grid: reduce domestic dog attacks through dog control, reduce vehicle collisions through fencing highways, protect habitat through land acquisitions and restore Eucalyptus forest. We used the occupancy model to predict ecological responses to recovery actions and simulated annealing to identify spatio-temporal priorities for each action. We contrasted the results against priorities generated using a traditional static distribution model. To maximize the probability of koala occupancy in 50years' time, with an annual budget of up to AU$20million, investment priorities were located in the eastern part of koala's range, focusing on dog control with some investment in habitat protection and restoration. With higher budgets, investment priorities shifted towards habitat protection and restoration in the western part of the range. However, priorities based on the static distribution model, which had a lower predictive accuracy than the dynamic model, were different. Regardless of budget, priorities derived from the static model were predominantly located in the western part of koala's range, focusing on highway fencing with some investment in dog control.Synthesis and applications. Our approach for integrating spatio-temporal dynamics into conservation prioritization across broad spatial extents provides a significant advance on existing approaches based on static distribution models. The finding that the inferior static model produced different priorities to the dynamic model cautions against the use of static models for conservation planning in dynamic landscapes. Additionally, the substantial changes in priorities with budget indicate that conservation planning under dynamic landscape and climate change must carefully consider priority actions and locations relative to the conservation resources available.

TI  - Optimized Spatial Priorities for Biodiversity Conservation in China: A Systematic Conservation Planning Perspective
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - SCALE
AB  - By addressing several key features overlooked in previous studies, i.e. human disturbance, integration of ecosystem-and species-level conservation features, and principles of complementarity and representativeness, we present the first national-scale systematic conservation planning for China to determine the optimized spatial priorities for biodiversity conservation. We compiled a spatial database on the distributions of ecosystem-and species-level conservation features, and modeled a human disturbance index (HDI) by aggregating information using several socioeconomic proxies. We ran Marxan with two scenarios (HDI-ignored and HDI-considered) to investigate the effects of human disturbance, and explored the geographic patterns of the optimized spatial conservation priorities. Compared to when HDI was ignored, the HDI-considered scenario resulted in (1) a marked reduction (similar to 9%) in the total HDI score and a slight increase (similar to 7%) in the total area of the portfolio of priority units, (2) a significant increase (similar to 43%) in the total irreplaceable area and (3) more irreplaceable units being identified in almost all environmental zones and highly-disturbed provinces. Thus the inclusion of human disturbance is essential for cost-effective priority-setting. Attention should be targeted to the areas that are characterized as moderately-disturbed, <2,000 m in altitude, and/or intermediately-to extremely-rugged in terrain to identify potentially important regions for implementing cost-effective conservation. We delineated 23 primary large-scale priority areas that are significant for conserving China's biodiversity, but those isolated priority units in disturbed regions are in more urgent need of conservation actions so as to prevent immediate and severe biodiversity loss. This study presents a spatially optimized national-scale portfolio of conservation priorities - effectively representing the overall biodiversity of China while minimizing conflicts with economic development. Our results offer critical insights for current conservation and strategic land-use planning in China. The approach is transferable and easy to implement by end-users, and applicable for national- and local-scale systematic conservation prioritization practices.

AB  - Climate change has already impacted ecosystems and species and substantial impacts of climate change in the future are expected. Species distribution modeling is widely used to map the current potential distribution of species as well as to model the impact of future climate change on distribution of species. Mapping current distribution is useful for conservation planning and understanding the change in distribution impacted by climate change is important for mitigation of future biodiversity losses. However, the current distribution of Chinese caterpillar fungus, a flagship species of the Himalaya with very high economic value, is unknown. Nor do we know the potential changes in suitable habitat of Chinese caterpillar fungus caused by future climate change. We used MaxEnt modeling to predict current distribution and changes in the future distributions of Chinese caterpillar fungus in three future climate change trajectories based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs: RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 6.0) in three different time periods (2030, 2050, and 2070) using species occurrence points, bioclimatic variables, and altitude. About 6.02% (8,989 km(2)) area of the Nepal Himalaya is suitable for Chinese caterpillar fungus habitat. Our model showed that across all future climate change trajectories over three different time periods, the area of predicted suitable habitat of Chinese caterpillar fungus would expand, with 0.11-4.87% expansion over current suitable habitat. Depending upon the representative concentration pathways, we observed both increase and decrease in average elevation of the suitable habitat range of the species.

AB  - Deep-sea coral assemblages are key components of marine ecosystems that generate habitats for fish and invertebrate communities and act as marine biodiversity hot spots. Because of their life history traits, deep-sea corals are highly vulnerable to human impacts such as fishing. They are an indicator of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), therefore their conservation is essential to preserve marine biodiversity. In the Mediterranean Sea deep-sea coral habitats are associated with commercially important crustaceans, consequently their abundance has dramatically declined due to the effects of trawling. Marine spatial planning is required to ensure that the conservation of these habitats is achieved. Species distribution models were used to investigate the distribution of two critically endangered octocorals (Funiculina quadrangularis and Isidella elongata) in the central Mediterranean as a function of environmental and fisheries variables. Results show that both species exhibit species-specific habitat preferences and spatial patterns in response to environmental variables, but the impact of trawling on their distribution differed. In particular F. quadrangularis can overlap with fishing activities, whereas I. elongata occurs exclusively where fishing is low or absent. This study represents the first attempt to identify key areas for the protection of soft and compact mud VMEs in the central Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Modeling the niches and distributions of the species using machine learning technique has become one of the effective tools of conservation planning today. Analyzing how the main species of our country will be affected by climate change is of great importance for planning about these species. Quercus coccifera which is one of the important evergreen oak species in Turkey, is easily selected by goats and constitutes a high proportion of their diets.
   In this study, it is aimed to determine the potential distribution area of Quercus coccifera and how it will be affected by climate change. Bioclimate layers with a resolution of approximately 1 km(2) (30 arc seconds) obtained from the WorldClim database with the presence data of the species were cut within the specified limits and processed with the Maximum Entropy algorithm to determine the potential distribution area of the species in today's conditions.
   In addition, the potential distribution area in 2050 and 2070 was modeled according to the climate scenarios in RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 in order to determine how the distribution area of the species will be affected by climate change. According to the CCSM4 climate change scenario, it is seen that there are losses in potential distribution areas of the species in the future. The result of the study shows that the current and future spread areas of Quercus coccifera, which is spread in a very limited area, will gradually narrow.

AB  - Forest stands are the basic planning units of managed forest landscapes, and the structural composition of these units is important for conservation of biodiversity. We present a methodological approach for identification and mapping of important structural and environmental features of forest stands. Based on an analysis of habitats of red-listed species and a synthesis of results from research on spatial distribution of forest species, we developed a habitat inventory approach (Complementary Hotspot Inventory, CHI) that is currently used in forestry planning in Norway The CHI maps fine-scale hotspots for 12 habitat types that are further classified according to positions along main environmental gradients (productivity and humidity). Consisting of different substrates in different environments, these habitats to a large degree support different species assemblages. By incorporating both the hotspot and the complementary approach, the CHI produces data tuned for later conservation measures. The high spatial resolution of data facilitates the use of conservation measures at different spatial scales, from single-tree retention to forest reserves. A validation test of habitats identified by CHI showed that the density of red-listed species was four times that of randomly selected old forests. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Decision support tools that predict fish distribution over broad spatial scales are needed to assist in planning watershed management and endangered species recovery. We developed a geographical information system model with multivariate logistic regression to rank valley segments for probable occurrence of the endangered Topeka shiner (Notropis topeka) using stream condition variables (stream size, groundwater potential, channel slope, streamflow, network position) and land-cover variables (percent pasture, percent trees) in streams characteristic of the North American Great Plains. The stream condition and land-cover models correctly classified 89% and 68% of outcomes (i.e., presence or absence), respectively. Field tests of maps of predicted species distribution resulted in more species occurrences than expected in valley segments classified as high potential for presence and less than expected in low-potential valley segments. Gaps between high-priority segments and protected land parcels were found in all basins. In 37 basins with Topeka shiners, protected land coverage was <1% in 17 basins, 1-5% in 10 basins, and 5-21.8% in 10 basins. Conservation activities in gaps are long-term conservation measures, but maps of predicted species distribution have many immediate applications.

AB  - Seahorses (genus Hippocampus) are a group of threatened fish. Distribution maps present information for the conservation of biodiversity, correct management and protection of natural resources, and development of management plans. In addition, they are the basis for further studies in taxonomy, biogeography, ecology, and evolution. With the purpose of assessing the efficiency and performance of different methods for the modeling potential distribution of the four species of the genus Hippocampus in Mexico, georeferenced occurrence points were collected from 1970 to 2017, and four predictive models were used to determine their potential distribution. Each model was assessed with a ROC curve analysis and a Cohen's Kappa statistic. A Jacknife analysis was also conducted in the MaxEnt program to know the environmental variables that were more important in the model prediction. Results show that H. erectus and H. zosterae had a wide distribution in the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico; H. ingens shows a marked distribution along the coastal states of the Pacific Ocean while H. reidi has a more restricted distribution prediction in the Mexican Caribbean area. Bathymetry, distance to the coast, and chlorophyll concentration are the most determining factors in the probability of occurrence of the four species.

AB  - Dispersal is fundamental in determining biodiversity responses to rapid climate change, but recently acquired ecological and evolutionary knowledge is seldom accounted for in either predictive methods or conservation planning. We emphasise the accumulating evidence for direct and indirect impacts of climate change on dispersal. Additionally, evolutionary theory predicts increases in dispersal at expanding range margins, and this has been observed in a number of species. This multitude of ecological and evolutionary processes is likely to lead to complex responses of dispersal to climate change. As a result, improvement of models of species' range changes will require greater realism in the representation of dispersal. Placing dispersal at the heart of our thinking will facilitate development of conservation strategies that are resilient to climate change, including landscape management and assisted colonisation.

AB  - Simple Summary Urban landscapes, though a primary contributor to habitat fragmentation, have the potential to facilitate habitat connectivity for native pollinator species, especially with strategic green space planning. Citizen science data have been proven to be useful to address conservation issues in urban areas, especially where knowledge is lacking about species richness and habitat preferences. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul, with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities, and what parts of the city facilitated habitat connectivity. We found that the most suitable habitats for multiple families were located in public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. These results are directly applicable in order to better understand urban planning stakes for pollinators and wildlife in general and provide avenues for improvement to recreate functional greenways in a dense city like Seoul. The preservation and restoration of habitats and ecological connectivity inside cities is crucial to ensure wildlife can find suitable areas to forage, rest and reproduce, as well as to disperse, thereby allowing metapopulation functioning. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul and with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities. Using species distribution modeling and landscape graph approaches, we located the main habitats and corridors to reinforce connectivity for six pollinator families. Finally, we identified habitats and corridors where conservation actions should be prioritized. In total, 178 species belonging to 128 genera and 60 families were observed. Hymenopterans were the most recorded, followed by dipterans and lepidopterans. The most suitable habitats for pollinators were constituted of public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. In a dense city like Seoul, most of the conservation corridors are located in built-up areas. Innovative urban planning and architecture are therefore required as well as the setting-up of ecological management practices to lead to a more sustainable urbanism for pollinators and wildlife in general.

AB  - Changing climates are affecting biodiversity and natural systems, causing extinctions, range shifts, and phenological shifts. Efforts to forecast the spatial distribution and magnitude of these effects, however, have focused largely on direct effects of changing climates on species' distributional potential; recent work has considered secondary effects of warming climates via rising sea levels. Here, we present a first integration of the two dimensions of climate change effects on biodiversity, examining joint effects of marine intrusion and climate change on the distributional potential of seventy-six species of Mexican birds. The two phenomena are not related to one another-that is, a species seriously affected by one is not necessarily seriously affected by the other; however, the areas affected within species' distributions by the two phenomena tend to be complementary, compounding the negative effects. These results have implications for planning biodiversity conservation globally.

AB  - Testing the efficacy of downscaling in species distribution modelling: a comparison between MaxEnt and favourability function models.- Statistical downscaling is used to improve the knowledge of spatial distributions from broad-scale to fine-scale maps with higher potential for conservation planning. We assessed the effectiveness of downscaling in two commonly used species distribution models: Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and the favourability function (FF). We used atlas data (10 x 10 km) of the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, distribution in southern Spain to derive models at a 1 x 1 km resolution. Downscaled models were assessed using an independent dataset of the species' distribution at 1 x 1 km. The FF model showed better downscaling performance than MaxEnt, and the models that were based on linear combinations of environmental variables performed better than models allowing higher flexibility. The FF model minimized model overfitting compared to the MaxEnt.

AB  - If we were to describe all the species on Earth and determine their distributions, we would solve the popularly termed 'Linnean' and 'Wallacean' shortfalls in biodiversity conservation. Even so, we would still be hindered by a 'Darwinian shortfall', that is, the lack of relevant phylogenetic information for most organisms. Overall, there are too few comprehensive phylogenies, large uncertainties in the estimation of divergence times, and, most critically, unknown evolutionary models linking phylogenies to relevant ecological traits and life history variation. Here, we discuss these issues and offer suggestions for further research to support evolutionary-based conservation planning.

AB  - The bivalve Pisidium amnicum (Muller 1774) is a common species in several European freshwater ecosystems. However, few Iberian watersheds are colonized by this species, and the River Minho estuary is possibly the Iberian aquatic ecosystem with the larger population. In October 2004-2007, investigations on spatial and temporal variations in P. amnicum abundance and biomass were carried out at 16 sites along the River Minho tidal freshwater wetlands. Mean abundance and biomass per site ranged from 0 to 750 ind m2 and 0 to 7.42 g AFDW m2, respectively. A clear decrease in the spatial distribution, abundance, and biomass was observed during the 4-year assessment. Furthermore, a stepwise multiple regression model showed that organic matter and conductivity explained 50.2% of the variation in P. amnicum abundance (R 2s=0.502, F ([2, 15])=7.569, p=0.005). Ecological knowledge is essential to the implementation of future conservation plans for P. amnicum, and the results of this study are of paramount importance to identify habitats that should be protected in order to preserve this species and provide scientific reference that may be useful in the development of management and/or restoration plans.

AB  - Understanding the distribution and abundance of threatened species is crucial to elaborate effective management plans for wild populations; however, elusive species prove difficult to detect. To support conservation strategies for the Vulnerable Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the only freshwater sirenian, we analyzed presence/absence data with hierarchical models based on imperfect detection to assess T. inunguis occupancy in a Sustainable Development Reserve, Brazilian Central Amazon. In parallel, we compared the effectiveness of direct and indirect sampling methods to provide occupancy (psi) and detection (p) estimates. Combining both sampling methods' presence datasets provided higher accuracy estimates. The Amazonian manatee's detection probability had never been estimated before: surprisingly, it was high (p = 0.50, SD = 0.05) and positively related with macrophyte coverage. Results suggest that the studied communities resident impact is not affecting the manatee occupancy, with greatest probabilities closer to human settlements. The final occupancy estimate obtained (psi = 0.85, SD = 0.12) can be a baseline to Amazonian manatee long-term monitoring studies, and provide support for decision makers and local communities to establish effective protection zones for the species. Our approach highlights the potential of hierarchical models to understand the distribution not only of T. inunguis in different habitats, but also of other threatened Amazonian aquatic mammals.

AB  - Conservation planning relies on integrating existing knowledge, social-environmental contexts, and potential threats to identify gaps and opportunities for action. Here we present a case study on how priority areas for conservation can be determined using existing information on biodiversity occurrence and threats. Specifically, our goals are: (1) to model the ecological niche of twelve endemic snake species in the Dry Chaco Forest, (2) to quantify the impact of the deforestation rates on their distributions, (3) to propose high priority areas for conservation in order to improve the actual protected area system, and (4) to evaluate the influence of the human footprint on the optimization of selected priority areas. Our results demonstrate that Argentinian Dry Chaco represent, on average, similar to 74% of the distribution of endemic snake species and deforestation has reduced suitable areas of all snake species in the region. Further, the current protected areas are likely insufficient to conserve these species as only very low percentages (3.27%) of snakes' ranges occur within existing protected areas. Our models identified high priority areas in the north of the Chaco forest where continuous, well-conserved forest still exists. These high priority areas include transition zones within the foothill forest and areas that could connect patches of forest between the western and eastern Chaco forest. Our findings identify spatial priorities that minimize conflicts with human activities, a key issue for this biodiversity hotspot area. We argue that consultation with stakeholders and decision-makers are urgently needed in order to take concrete actions to protect the habitat, or we risk losing the best conservation opportunities to protect endemic snakes that inhabit the Argentinian Dry Chaco.

AB  - Global climate change affects the distributions of ectotherms and may be the cause of several conservation problems, such as great displacement of climatic suitable spaces for species and, consequently, important reductions of the extent of liveable places, threatening the existence of many of them. Species exposure (and hence vulnerability) to global climate change is linked to features of their climatic niches (such as the relative position of the inhabited localities of each species in the climatic space), and therefore to characteristics of their geographic ranges (such as the extent of the distributions or altitudinal range inhabited by the species). In order to analyze the pattern of response of Argentine reptiles to global climate change, we ran phylogenetic generalized least squares models using species exposure to global climate change as a response variable, and (i) niche properties (breadth and position of the species in the climate space) and (ii) general features of the distribution of species (maximum latitude, altitudinal range, maximum elevation, distributional range and proximity to the most important dispersal barrier) as predictors. Our results suggest that the best way to explain climate change exposure is by combining breadth and position of climatic niche of the species or combining geographic features that are indicators of both niche characteristics. Our best model shows that in our study area, species with the narrowest distributional ranges that also inhabit the highest elevations are the most exposed to the effects of global climate change. In this sense, reptile species from Yungas, Puna and Andes ecoregions could be especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. We believe that these types of models may represent an interesting tool for determining species and places particularly threatened by the effects of global climate change, which should be strongly considered in conservation planning.

AB  - The rusty-spotted cat Prionailurus rubiginosus is the smallest wildcat in the world, endemic to India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Although new occurrence records have recently been reported from different geographic localities in India and Nepal, there is still a lack of information on its biology and habitat use that are required for its conservation planning. Herein, we report results from systematic, long-term (2014-2018) camera trapping in Kanha Tiger Reserve, India, to evaluate the habitat use, suitability and activity pattern of the rusty-spotted cat and model its local distribution with habitat and anthropogenic covariates. Thick canopied forest and rugged terrain were found to be extensively used and preferred by the rusty-spotted cat. It was also recorded in the multiple-use buffer zone forests in close proximity to agriculture. The species is nocturnal and its activity seems to coincide with its major prey. The guiding philosophy of tiger reserves in India is to use the tiger as an umbrella species for biodiversity conservation, and often these reserves are intensively managed to enhance tiger and prey populations. This approach, however, may not cater to the requirements of other less charismatic sympatric species, and those of the rusty-spotted cat also need to be considered for its continued survival.

AB  - The narrow ecological niche and the vulnerability of the griffon vulture in terms of its habitat and trophic requirements make it a good model species for assessing the state of agro-pastoral systems. The environmental niche of the species was studied in Bulgaria using a set of 109 cases of griffon vulture presence observations in breeding habitat and a maximum-entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach. MaxEnt can generate a model based on relatively low number of presence locations and is therefore a powerful tool for modeling species distribution. We employed a set of bioclimatic and environmental variables to determine species' optimal distribution. According to our results, griffon vulture's optimal habitats included areas with a slope over 40(0), which are advantageous for the breeding of the species as they often outline rocky habitats. The griffon vulture environmental niche model underlined the significance of the open landscapes that are essential for the species' foraging, as well as territories with higher mean temperature, low precipitation and high density of livestock. The suitability threshold of the model equal to 0.0738 and we estimated that 0.69% (769 km(2)) of Bulgaria is optimal for the breeding of the species and that 2.8% (3085 km(2)) is of high suitability for the griffon vulture. The results of the current survey aim to provide an important background for the management and conservation of the griffon vulture in Bulgaria. Such estimates are essential whenever investment plans, conservation programs or other management interventions are considered in the territories neighbouring or/and within the range of the griffon vulture.

AB  - Species distribution models have been applied across a wide range of spatial scales to generate information for conservation planning. Understanding how well models transfer through space and time is important to promote effective species-habitat conservation. Here, we assess model transferability in coastal tidal marshes of the southeastern United States using count data of a widespread marsh bird: the Clapper Rail (Rallus crepitans). We developed species-habitat models at a state level in both South Carolina and Georgia, and then assessed how well top models from each state predicted abundance in the other state. Internally (locally) validated models performed well with reasonable fit (SC: R-2 = 0.35, GA: R-2 = 0.14), and high significance (P = 0.0005); however, both models performed poorly when predicting abundance from the other state (R-2 = 0.03 and 0.003). To assess the consequences of this lack of transferability, we applied the South Carolina-and Georgia-derived parameter estimates to habitat features in South Carolina and identified the top 25% of tidal marsh habitat that each model predicted within the state. There was minimal overlap between model habitat quality predictions (< 5%). Our results address the predictive power and uncertainties that arise from using habitat associations and climate models to predict species distributions or abundance in locations without training data. We discuss potential reasons model transferability was not successful and address the need for better regional datasets and the importance of intraspecific variability in response to environmental gradients.

AB  - Interactions between sympatric species may negatively affect a species' fitness, and complicate management of species assemblages in protected areas. An example of the need to quantify the strength and direction of the species interactions is giant panda conservation in newly established reserves. Although the habitat requirements of giant panda have been broadly studied, the degree of its interactions with sympatric large mammals remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically surveyed for species occurrence in the southwestern China during 2008-2013, to better understand the interactions between giant panda and four sympatric large mammal species. We constructed species-specific occupancy models based on camera-trapping data using both environmental and detection variables. We then used the important predictor variables for each species to construct pairwise species co-occurrence models following a Bayesian framework. Our analysis detected significant habitat overlap between giant panda and its sympatric species. However, there was no evidence of native species limiting the distribution of giant pandas despite their extensive use of the same forests. The only evidence for negative interactions was between the distributions of giant panda and domestic cattle within bamboo forest, the primary habitat of giant pandas. The co-occurrence model has value for any conservation planning that benefits from knowledge of inter-species interactions. Our study suggests that, in southwestern China, strict grazing control of domestic cattle in protected areas is warranted until the nature of its interactions with native large mammals can be determined.

AB  - Concern for climate change has not yet been integrated in protocols for reserve selection. However if climate changes as projected, there is a possibility that current reserve-selection methods might provide solutions that are inadequate to ensure species' long-term persistence within reserves. We assessed, for the first time, the ability of existing reserve-selection methods to secure species in a climate-change context. Six methods using a different combination of criteria (representation, suitability and reserve clustering) are compared. The assessment is carried out using European distributions of 1200 plant species and considering two extreme scenarios of response to climate change: no dispersal and universal dispersal. With our data, 6-11% of species modelled would be potentially lost from selected reserves in a 50-year period. Measured uncertainties varied in 6% being 1-3% attributed to dispersal assumptions and 2-5% to the choice of reserve-selection method. Suitability approaches to reserve selection performed best, while reserve clustering performed poorly. We also found that 5% of species modelled would lose their entire climatic envelope in the studied area; 2% of the species modelled would have nonoverlapping distributions; 93% of the species modelled would maintain varying levels of overlapping distributions. We conclude there are opportunities to minimize species' extinctions within reserves but new approaches are needed to account for impacts of climate change on species; especially for those projected to have temporally nonoverlapping distributions.

AB  - The criteria and categories of the IUCN red list can be applied to any taxonomic unit, including taxa below species level or non-formally described forms, but this is seldom practiced. Because conservation priorities largely focus on well-established taxa that deserve urgent action, cryptic species may be facing a critical situation. This could be the case for some Andean and trans-Andean populations of Pyrrhura parakeets in Colombia that have restricted and isolated geographic ranges, and whose conservation status has been overlooked because nominal species covering them are considered of "Least Concern". As part of research into the biogeographic history and biogeographic patterns of the genus Pyrrhura, we used MaxEnt modelling to make a first approach to the geographic distribution and conservation status of these populations, and to determine if they could be considered independent conservation units. As with other members of Pyrrhura, we found that their climatic niche was restricted to humid regions of the Andes and the Andean foothills, resulting in isolated and discontinuous distributions associated with the Tropical humid forest Zonobiome. Comparing our estimates of area of occupancy with the established thresholds for IUCN criterion B-2, the four subspecies studied could be considered threatened. The small geographic ranges, apparent vulnerability to forest fragmentation compared with other parrots, and extensive habitat loss experienced by the Andean and trans-Andean subspecies of P. melanura and P. picta allow us to conclude that they are valid conservation units. Although further research on these taxa is necessary, our results imply that they must be included as target populations in local and national policies for management plans and decision making, and urgent actions are needed for the subspecies of P. picta such as P. p. subandina and P. p. caeruleiceps.

AB  - A major threat to marine ecosystems is the establishment and proliferation of invasive alien species. This study addresses gaps in our knowledge regarding marine alien invertebrate species in the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve (KBR) and adjacent Betty's Bay Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the Western Cape of South Africa, together a potentially important area for south-coast marine conservation. Understanding the distribution and geographical expansion of these species is critical for conservation planning. A quantitative systematic survey of the intertidal rocky shore region was undertaken. The mytilid Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and the bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata were the only alien species recorded along the coastline, which included the MPA. The abundance of M. galloprovincialis was significantly higher outside the MPA, and the abundance of W. subtorquata was significantly higher inside the MPA. With only two alien species recorded, the Betty's Bay MPA and its surroundings support relatively few marine alien species with regards to rocky shore invertebrate biodiversity.
   Conservation implications: It is important that the Betty's Bay MPA and its adjacent coastline maintain its current status as an area with relatively few marine alien species. The conservation implications on management require routine surveys of this region to detect early introductions of any additional species.

AB  - Habitat Conservation Plans are a widely used strategy to balance development and preservation of species of concern and have been used in southern California, USA, to protect the coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica). Few data exist on gnatcatcher abundance and distribution, and existing data have problems with issues of closure (i.e., sampling occurs in a short enough time period such that abundance or distribution are not changing), detectability, and proper attention to probability-based sampling schemes. Thus, a habitat model has been relied upon in reserve design. California gnatcatchers are the flagship and umbrella species of many plans and we provide the first estimates that incorporate probabilistic sampling and test predictions from the habitat model. Probability of occurrence was 26% (S (E) over cap = 0.06); however, occupancy varied by modeled habitat quality with slopes <40%, warm, and wet sagebrush habitat having higher occupancy probabilities. Interpreting abundance and occupancy probabilities by vegetation type was complicated by error detected in Geographic Information System vegetation metadata files. The slope (1.08, S<(E)over cap> = 0.66), temperature (0.79, S (E) over cap = 0.70), and precipitation (-2.62, S (E) over cap 1.21) variables associated with habitat models were stronger influences on occupancy than was patch size (0.48, S (E) over cap 0.66). Previous models weight patch size equal to slope and climate. Our work demonstrates that probabilistic sampling can be carried out on a large scale and the results provide better information for managers to make decisions about their reserves.

AB  - Biodiversity and natural ecosystems are under pressure from a large range of drivers. In south eastern Australia these include periods of drought and occasional floods, increasing urbanisation pressures, changing land use patterns, altered fire frequency and regime, habitat loss and degradation, impacts of invasive species, etc. Detailed and reliable information about the spatial distribution of species provides critical information for effective conservation planning. In Victoria, Australia, this responsibility is held by the Department of Sustainability and Environment, which maintains and curates a database of site records for species: the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA). Although this database is comprehensive and contains many records for numerous species, the information is provided in point form. This point data can be useful for some planning and management tasks, but does not provide an adequate view of distribution for all management purposes. By integrating known occurrences of species with environmental GIS data layers using statistical or machine learning algorithms, it is possible to build models and to predict the likelihood that the species may occur at particular locations across large landscapes. We have used the VBA to build species distribution models (SDMs) for 523 vertebrate fauna species across the whole state, providing predictive 'maps' that are available for use in various conservation planning activities. In this paper, we introduce and discuss the methods we developed and implemented for producing these models.
   Modelling requires a number of steps: gathering species occurrence data, vetting or mining this data for useful records and winnowing out potentially misleading records, collating existing and / or developing new relevant environmental variables, selecting an appropriate modelling algorithm, training and evaluating models, mapping predictions to the whole state scale, and selecting a threshold to transform the continuous model result into binary (i.e. presence/absence) mapped outputs.
   All the occurrence data for the 523 fauna species were derived from the VBA. This database contains presence data for fauna species, but for the majority of survey techniques information on absences cannot be known or inferred. Twenty four explanatory variables were selected for use in developing models including 12 bioclimatic, terrain and soil radiometric (BTSR) variables, two coordinates (latitude and longitude), and 10 remotely sensed variables primarily derived from a time series of Landsat imagery. For each species, three versions of models (V1, V2 and V3 models) reflecting different constraint were built. V1 models used 12 BTSR variables; V2 models used 12 BTSR variables and two coordinates; and V3 models used all the 24 variables.
   Since true absence data was not available, pseudo-absences were created by filtering random points by a profile model based on Mahalanobis distance method. Using both pseudo-absences and the true presences data SDMs were developed with a machine learning algorithm, random forest, which was implemented in the statistical computing environment R. The models were evaluated using six accuracy measures, which have been demonstrated suitable for evaluating presence-only models. These metrics include AUL (area under the lift curve), MVDl (the maximum vertical distance from lift curve to the diagonal line), MPA (minimal predicted area with pre-specified true positive rate), VDl (vertical distance from lift curve to the diagonal line), Lift and Se (sensitivity). These measures can be used for both within-species and among-species model comparisons. A threshold was set for each model with a method based on maximising the sum of sensitivity and specificity to provide binary outputs or maps of species' distributions.

AB  - Analyses of animal species distribution in a neutral or minimally-interrupted habitat provide a baseline that is essential for assessment of population status, identification of key habitat, and conservation planning for habitat protection and restoration. In this study, we surveyed the occurrence of the Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) and corresponding habitat characteristics, including bathymetry, benthic slope and fish resources, in the newly established He-wang-miao reserve. Based on sightings from field surveys, the extent of occurrence of the finless porpoise was 9.532 km(2). General linear model analysis indicated the distribution of the finless porpoise was influenced by water depth and fish density. Habitat preference analysis illustrated a proxy to identify key habitat for the finless porpoise: moderate water depth (between 7 m and 12 m), flat benthic slope (lower than 2) and moderately-high fish density (0.6 ind/m(3) and 1.2 ind/m(3)). We proposed that this proxy has great potential for conservation planning to identify habitat conservation priorities in the Yangtze River and to guide management actions such as ex situ reserve selection and habitat restoration.

AB  - Climate change is having profound effects on the distributions of species globally. Trait-based assessments predict that specialist and range-restricted species are among those most likely to be at risk of extinction from such changes. Understanding individual species' responses to climate change is therefore critical for informing conservation planning. We use an established Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) protocol to describe the curious range-restriction of the globally threatened White-tailed Swallow (Hirundo megaensis) to a small area in southern Ethiopia. We find that, across a range of modelling approaches, the distribution of this species is well described by two climatic variables, maximum temperature and dry season precipitation. These same two variables have been previously found to limit the distribution of the unrelated but closely sympatric Ethiopian Bush-crow (Zavattariornis stresemanni). We project the future climatic suitability for both species under a range of climate scenarios and modelling approaches. Both species are at severe risk of extinction within the next half century, as the climate in 68-84% (for the swallow) and 90-100% (for the bush-crow) of their current ranges is predicted to become unsuitable. Intensive conservation measures, such as assisted migration and captive-breeding, may be the only options available to safeguard these two species. Their projected disappearance in the wild offers an opportunity to test the reliability of SDMs for predicting the fate of wild species. Monitoring future changes in the distribution and abundance of the bush-crow is particularly tractable because its nests are conspicuous and visible over large distances.

AB  - Consideration of the social values people assign to relatively undisturbed native ecosystems is critical for the success of science-based conservation plans. We used an interview process to identify and map social values assigned to 31 ecosystem services provided by natural areas in an agricultural landscape in southern Australia. We then modeled the spatial distribution of 12 components of ecological value commonly used in setting spatial conservation priorities. We used the analytical hierarchy process to weight these components and used multiattribute utility theory to combine them into a single spatial layer of ecological value. Social values assigned to natural areas were negatively correlated with ecological values overall, but were positively correlated with some components of ecological value. In terms of the spatial distribution of values, people valued protected areas, whereas those natural areas underrepresented in the reserve system were of higher ecological value. The habitats of threatened animal species were assigned both high ecological value and high social value. Only small areas were assigned both high ecological value and high social value in the study area, whereas large areas of high ecological value were of low social value, and vice versa. We used the assigned ecological and social values to identify different conservation strategies (e.g., information sharing, community engagement, incentive payments) that may be effective for specific areas. We suggest that consideration of both ecological and social values in selection of conservation strategies can enhance the success of science-based conservation planning.

AB  - The Indian Golden Gecko Calodactylodes aureus (Beddome 1870) is an endemic reptile species largely confined to the Eastern Ghats, India. To estimate its potential habitat suitability, species distribution modelling (SDM) was carried out based on occurrence data and climatic and topographic datasets. We used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model for predicting potential habitat suitability for C. aureus. The MaxEnt model predicted potential suitable habitat for C. aureus mainly in the northern and southern parts of Eastern Ghats spread across Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states. Majority of the suitable habitat areas identified by MaxEnt are outside the protected areas and experience high anthropogenic pressure. Slope and mean diurnal range in temperature were the strongest predictors of C. aureus habitat suitability in the Eastern Ghats. Our results can be effective tools in exploring new ways of understanding C. aureus ecology and biogeography, and for planning and future surveys, and prioritizing conservation activities.

AB  - Developing conservation strategies to restore populations of threatened species has been signaled as an important task by the Convention on Biological Diversity 2011-2020 targets. Species are being threatened not only by habitat loss and fragmentation but increasingly by climate change. As resources for conservation are often limited, and restoration is among the most expensive conservation strategies, developing approaches that help in the prioritization of areas for restoration efforts is a critical task. In this study, we propose a spatial multicriteria decision analysis (SMCDA) framework for identifying potential areas for plant species restoration initiatives that can explicitly take into account future climatic change. As a way to show how the framework can be applied, we took advantage of freely available niche modeling software and geospatial information to identify regional-scale priority areas for restoration of two threatened endemic tree species (i.e. Bielschmiedia miersii and Pouteria splendens) of the Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forest Hotspot. The SMCDA framework allowed us not only to identify priority areas for species restoration but also to analyze how different environmental conditions and land-use types may affect the selection of areas for species restoration. Our analysis suggests that the inclusion of climate change is a key factor to assess the potential areas for species restoration because species may respond differentially to future climatic conditions. This framework is conceived to be used as a complementary approach to available landscape-scale spatial conservation planning tools.

AB  - Successfully reintroduced species offer an exceptional opportunity to study the rules that govern population range expansion. We suggest that models that are based on knowledge of space-use patterns of reintroduced species can be used as projection models in the context of landscape planning. We illustrate this idea through a case study in which we used the population range-expansion patterns of Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) reintroduced in northern Israel, to explore potential impact of landscape development on species space-use patterns. In this approach we used an individual-based spatially explicit model that simulates species range expansion on a realistic landscape. We previously validated the model over the short-term (5 years) and apply it here for long-term, 50-year, projections using two scenarios: (1) current landscape conditions; and (2) the government's development plans for the region. Based on the long-term projections using the current landscape, we identified and mapped preferred deer habitat in which population activity centres were established. By applying the model to the government's development scenario for the region we examined the potential effect of landscape development on habitat availability and the future spatial distribution of the deer. By comparing the outputs from both scenarios threats to landscape connectivity could be identified. A map presenting key areas for landscape connectivity, important for the reintroduced species, can be used for long-term planning of local and regional development. Under the umbrella paradigm, protecting these areas may help to also conserve other species in the same ecosystem. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managers often rely on species surveys and distribution models to evaluate species occurrence and develop management and conservation plans. However, these tools are rarely used in concert. We used a three-step framework to evaluate the distribution of a declining and elusive freshwater amphibian species, the hellbender salamander (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis). We used the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm to develop a habitat suitability model to guide sampling, environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys to ground truth the habitat suitability model, and multi-level occupancy modeling to assess species presence, while accounting for eDNA detection errors. Our suitability model (AUC = 0.941, True Skill Statistic = 0.7, sensitivity and specificity = 0.86) identified the greatest amount of high and very highly suitable habitat in the Interior Plateau and Blue Ridge ecoregions of the study area. We used eDNA survey results (n = 284 sites) to evaluate model fit and detected the species at 65 sites. Detection probability (p) was 0.692 (95% CRI: 0.547, 0.818) at the site level and 0.674 (95% CRI: 0.621, 0.721) at the quantitative PCR level. Ecoregion was the primary covariate that explained occupancy, with greatest estimates in the Blue Ridge ecoregion 0.695 (95% CRI, 0.390, 0.925). Although the MaxEnt output was not significantly correlated with occupancy probability, we established a relationship between habitat quality and the number of eDNA detections. This study highlights the use of a multi-level framework to optimize sampling, assess model fit, account for imperfect detection, and evaluate the distribution of rare species that have limited occurrence data available.

AB  - Global climate is rapidly changing and, while many studies have investigated the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of woodland species in the wider European context, few have focused on the impacts of climate change on the distribution of woodland species in Ireland. This study evaluates the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of species characteristic of woodlands and assesses the implications for the conservation of woodlands in Ireland. Only some 2% of the land area of Ireland is covered in semi-natural woodlands, including communities which are conservation priorities such as bog woodland, alluvial forests and Taxus baccata (Yew) woods. We applied an ensemble of species distribution modelling techniques, using atlas data for 104 vascular plant, bryophyte, bird and butterfly species from Ireland, baseline climate data (1961-1990) and projected future climate data (HadCM3 GCM; 2031-2060), at a 10km(2) resolution. Of the 104 species, 44 modelled well in at least 6 of the 8 models. Under a scenario of unlimited dispersal, almost 50% of species which modelled well were projected to lose climate space, with the largest range contraction projected for the butterfly Aphantopus hyperantus (Ringlet; -47.7%). The remainder were projected to have increased climate space, with Thecla betulae (Brown hairstreak) and Frangula alnus (Alder buckthorn) having the largest projected increases of 886% and 532% of their current ranges. When a scenario of limited long-range dispersal was considered, all species were projected to lose some of their current range, from a decrease of 52.4% for Carex strigosa (thin-spiked wood-sedge) to a decrease of 10.9% for Saxifraga spathularis (St Patrick's cabbage). These results have significant implications for the future of woodlands in Ireland. Conservation management plans for these habitats need greater focus on potential climate change impacts in order to ensure these communities' long-term survival.

AB  - As landscape-scale conservation models grow in prominence, assessments of how wildlife utilise multiple-use landscapes are required to inform effective conservation and management planning. Such efforts should incorporate multi-species perspectives to maximise value for conservation, and should account for scale to accurately capture species-environment relationships. We show that the random forest machine learning algorithm can be used to model large-scale sign-based data in a multi-scale framework. We used this method to investigate scale-dependent habitat associations for 16 mammal species of high conservation importance across the southern Kavango Zambezi (KAZA) Transfrontier Conservation Area in Botswana and Zimbabwe. Our findings revealed substantial variation in factors shaping habitat use across species, and illustrate that different species often have divergent responses to the same environmental and anthropogenic factors, and differ in the scales at which they respond to them. For all variables across all species, scale optimisation most often selected our largest scale. Precipitation, soil nutrients, and vegetation appeared to be the most important factors determining mammal distributions, likely through their associations with food resources for herbivores and, in turn, prey availability for carnivores. Anthropogenic pressures also had an important influence, with many species selecting against areas with high cattle density. The variety of relationships with human density indicated that species vary in their tolerance of humans. We found a consistent positive relationship with areas under high protection, and negative relationship with unprotected and less-strictly protected areas. Policy implications. Through a novel application of random forest modelling to spoor data from 16 mammal species, this study highlights the importance of adopting a multi-scale, multi-species approach for decision-making processes that depend on understanding wildlife distributions and habitat associations, such as protected area and corridor prioritisation. The findings identify changing rainfall patterns and increasing livestock numbers as emerging trends that may impact wildlife distributions, both within sub-Saharan Africa and on a global scale. Wildlife management authorities should use modelling exercises and adaptive management to ensure that protected area networks remain fit for purpose under anticipated changes in rainfall under climate change, and explore initiatives that promote coexistence of wildlife and livestock.

AB  - As climate conditions continue to shift, species assemblages and composition within ecological communities may be reshuffled in unpredictable ways. Some habitat types may cease to exist while others may expand in size; protecting ecosystems and species in their current locations will become increasingly difficult. Threatened and endangered species are likely to be disproportionately affected by climate change because they are often habitat specialists and relatively rare. In the United States, the 1973 Endangered Species Act has prevented the extinction of many species. The identification and conservation of critical habitat is an important tool for species preservation. But how do we designate and preserve habitat for protected species when we are unsure about future habitat conditions? We address this question based upon the concept of managing for anticipated change, rather than focusing on the maintenance of existing conditions. We used an ecological niche modeling program (MaxEnt) to model current and future climatic niche for an endangered mammal endemic to southern California, USA; the Stephens' kangaroo rat (SKR, Dipodomys stephensi). Our results indicate that the climatic niche of SKR was governed primarily by precipitation during the dry season, precipitation seasonality, annual mean temperature, and mean summer temperature. Projecting current species-presence relationships to different scenarios predicted for the future revealed substantial loss in climatic niche with increased emission rates. Areas of future suitable climatic niche were evaluated in relation to land ownership and identified as potential reserves or translocation sites, which can aid in conservation planning for this species. Additionally, species vulnerability assessments and a climate-change analysis tool were utilized to demonstrate how overall understanding of climate change effects can be enhanced. Information presented here can serve as guiding principles for the inclusion of climate change considerations into management plans, and can better inform overall decision-making related to endangered species management.

AB  - Conservation managers and policy makers are often confronted with a challenging dilemma of devising suitable strategies to maintain agricultural productivity while conserving endemic species that at the early stages of becoming pests of agricultural crops. Identification of environmental factors conducive to species range expansion for forecasting species distribution patterns will play a central role in devising management strategies to minimize the conflict between the agricultural productivity and biodiversity conservation. Here, we present results of a study that predicts the distribution of Indrella ampulla, a snail endemic to the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, which is becoming a pest in cardamom (Ellettaria cardamomum) plantations. We determined the distribution patterns and niche overlap between I.ampulla and Ellettaria cardamomum using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) niche modeling techniques under current and future (2020-2080) climatic scenarios. The results showed that climatic (precipitation of coldest quarter and isothermality) and soil (cation exchange capacity of soil [CEC]) parameters are major factors that determine the distribution of I.ampulla in Western Ghats. The model predicted cardamom cultivation areas in southern Western Ghats are highly sensitive to invasion of I.ampulla under both present and future climatic conditions. While the land area in the central Western Ghats is predicted to become unsuitable for I.ampulla and Ellettaria cardamomum in future, we found 71% of the Western Ghats land area is suitable for Ellettaria cardamomum cultivation and 45% suitable for I.ampulla, with an overlap of 35% between two species. The resulting distribution maps are invaluable for policy makers and conservation managers to design and implement management strategies minimizing the conflicts to sustain agricultural productivity while maintaining biodiversity in the region.

AB  - The archives of species range polygons developed under comprehensive assessments of the conservation status of species, such as the IUCN's Global Assessments, are a significant resource in the analysis of biodiversity for conservation planning. Species range polygons obtained from these studies are known to exhibit omissions (because of knowledge gaps) and imprecision in their boundaries. In this work, we present a method to refine those species range polygons in order to create more realistic representations of species geographic ranges. Using range polygons of four species of mammals in South America and environmental variables at a 1 km resolution, combined with a set of GIS algorithms, a procedure was developed to map the confidence that sub-polygon elements belong to a logical species range. The confidence map is then used as a weight for a Mahalanobis typicality empirical modelling procedure to generate a map of species-weighted typicalities that is then thresholded to generate the refined species range map. Methods for variable selection and quality assessment of the refined range are also included in the procedure. Analysis using independent validation data shows the power of this methodology to redefine species ranges in a more biophysically reasonable way. The quality of the final-range map depends on the habitat suitability threshold used to define the species range. The report of quality assessment produced is useful for identifying not only the threshold that produces the highest match to the original expert range but also for flagging those ranges with higher discrepancies, facilitating the identification of ranges that need further revision.

AB  - Species ranges are seldom at equilibrium with climate, because several interacting factors determine distribution, including demographic processes, dispersal, land use, disturbance (e.g., fire), and biotic interactions. Conservation strategies in a changing climate therefore cannot be based only on predicted climate-driven range shifts. Here, we explore conservation and management options in a framework for prioritizing landscapes based on two 'axes of concern': landscape conservation capacity attributes (percentage of protected area, connectivity, and condition of the matrix) and vulnerability to climate change (climate change velocity and topographic variation). Nine other conservation actions are also presented, from understanding and predicting to planning and managing for climate change. We emphasize the need for adaptation and resilience in populations, ecosystems, and the conservation environment itself.

AB  - AimWe applied a multicomponent approach based on the decomposition of taxonomic (both presence-absence and abundance) and functional beta diversity to determine the influence of ecological factors in shaping spatial distribution diversity of coral reef fishes, and the implications for conservation decisions.
   LocationLagoons of ten atolls characterized by low human pressure but with contrasted geomorphology in the Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia.
   MethodsWe computed beta diversities and their partitioning components, both at local (inter-transect, from 200m to 10km) and large (among atolls, from 22 to 350km) spatial scales. Null models were applied to test whether the observed beta diversity differed from random expectation. Multiple generalized dissimilarity models were run to test which environmental factors were the best predictors of observed beta diversities.
   ResultsBeta diversity was indistinguishable from randomness at both spatial scales. Species remained generally interchangeable among transects within an atoll and to some extent among atolls. However, strong deviance explained by models showed that the number of species, the number of individuals and functional traits present in transects and atolls were determined by deterministic factors (i.e. environmental factors). Modelling each beta diversity component separately also revealed partial mismatch among atolls and among species and functional dissimilarities. The influence of environmental variables strongly varied among atolls, species and functional dissimilarities.
   Main conclusionsBy revealing the spatial scaling of ecological factors and partial congruence among species and functional diversity, assessment of beta diversity provides insight into conservation planning. Our results support the idea that conservation planning applied to protect taxonomic diversity cannot be fully extended to functional diversity. We have addressed the dilemma of which diversity component should be favoured in conservation strategies.

AB  - There is strong international agreement on the need for marine protected areas to reverse pervasive human impacts on the oceans' biodiversity. However, their implementation is often hampered both by legal difficulties in defining reserves in international waters and the patchy nature of data in many offshore waters. We demonstrate the use of recent advances in statistical learning and conservation prioritization to produce MPA scenarios with varying costs and benefits for New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone, based on the analyses of distributions of 96 demersal fish species. MPAs based on our most cost-effective scenario would deliver conservation benefits nearly 2.5 times greater than those from equivalent-sized areas recently implemented at the request of fishers, and at lower cost to them. Such results demonstrate the power of quantitative, knowledge-based prioritization approaches, which can be applied at high resolution and at oceanic scales.

AB  - Climate change effects on biodiversity are already manifested, and yet no predictive knowledge characterizes the likely nature of these effects. Previous studies suggested an influence of topography on these effects, a possibility tested herein. Bird species with distributions restricted to montane (26 species) and Great Plains (19 species) regions of central and western North America were modeled, and climate change effects on their distributions compared: in general, plains species were more heavily influenced by climate change, with drastic area reductions (mode 35% of distributional area lost under assumption of no dispersal) and dramatic spatial movements (0-400 km shift of range centroid under assumption of no dispersal) of appropriate habitats. These results suggest an important generality regarding climate change effects on biodiversity, and provide useful guidelines for conservation planning.

AB  - The Wild goat (Capra aegagrus) has had less attention and study than many other mammals, especially in Iraq. We collected comprehensive data about this species in Iraq, a total of 36 records, in order to build species distribution models using Maximum Entropy and seven environmental variables. The results confirm that suitable habitat is limited to the northeastern part of Iraq, especially the Zagros mountains of Kurdistan region/Iraq. Elevation most influenced the predicted distribution. Habitat suitability under different future climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for 2050 and 2070) is stable but expands compared with the current period. Areas of marginally and highly suitable decrease, while suitable habitat increases compared to the present. Habitat suitability inside existing Protected Areas was significantly higher than outside. Applying IUCN Red List criteria at the national scale, the species was classified as Endangered. The main short-term threat is, against which urgent action is needed to avoid future declines. We conclude that climate change is not likely to be a long-term threat to the Wild goat in Iraq, but urgent action to stop poaching is needed to sustain many Iraqi mammals, especially the Wild goat. Our applied approach can help understand and conserve other critical species in Iraq.

AB  - Nelsonia goldmani is an uncommon rodent, endemic to highland microhabitats in central Mexico. Few individuals have been reported in scarce localities after being discovered in 1903 resulting in a lack of knowledge about its geographic distribution and actual presence in its habitat; such situation makes this species of national interest priority for conservation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to summarize collecting records, confirm the presence of this species in the field and estimate its ecological niche. We searched specimens in biological collections, carried out an ecological niche modeling (ENM) analysis and looked for individuals of N. goldmani in the field over a 2-year period. Our results identified only 43 specimens in biological collections, whose collecting localities had not been reported previously. The ENM analysis showed that the environmental suitability areas for this species are restricted and isolated with an apparent lack of environmental connectivity. Regarding fieldwork, we collected only five individuals in two localities. The possible environmental specificity and the lack of sampling focused on specific microhabitats could explain the low detection of the species thus far. Further research is needed to plan conservation actions to protect its populations.

AB  - The loss of habitat and biodiversity worldwide has led to considerable resources being spent on conservation interventions. Prioritising these actions is challenging due to the complexity of the problem and because there can be multiple actors undertaking conservation actions, often with divergent or partially overlapping objectives. We explore this issue with a simulation study involving two agents sequentially purchasing land for the conservation of multiple species using three scenarios comprising either divergent or partially overlapping objectives between the agents. The first scenario investigates the situation where both agents are targeting different sets of threatened species. The second and third scenarios represent a case where a government agency attempts to implement a complementary conservation network representing 200 species, while a non-government organisation is focused on achieving additional protection for the ten rarest species. Simulated input data was generated using distributions taken from real data to model the cost of parcels, and the rarity and co-occurrence of species. We investigated three types of collaborative interactions between agents: acting in isolation, sharing information and pooling resources with the third option resulting in the agents combining their resources and effectively acting as a single entity. In each scenario we determine the cost savings when an agent moves from acting in isolation to either sharing information or pooling resources with the other agent. The model demonstrates how the value of collaboration can vary significantly in different situations. In most cases, collaborating would have associated costs and these costs need to be weighed against the potential benefits from collaboration. Our model demonstrates a method for determining the range of costs that would result in collaboration providing an efficient use of scarce conservation resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Strategic approaches to biodiversity conservation increasingly emphasise the restoration of ecological connectivity at landscape scales. However, understanding where these connecting elements should be placed in the landscape is critical if they are to provide both value for money and for biodiversity. For such planning to be effective, it is necessary to have information of the distributions of multiple taxa, however, this is of poor quality for many taxa. We show that sparse, non-systematically collected biological records can be modelled using readily available environmental variables to meaningfully predict potential biodiversity richness, including rare and threatened species, across a landscape. Using a large database of ad-hoc biological records (50 501 records of 502 species) we modelled the richness of wetland biodiversity across the Fens, a formerly extensive wetland, now agricultural landscape in eastern England. We used these models to predict those parts of the agricultural ditch network of greatest potential conservation value and compared this to current strategic network planning. Odonata distribution differed to that of other groups, indicating that single taxon groups may not be effective proxies for other priority biodiversity. Our results challenged previous assumptions that river channels should comprise the main connecting elements in the Fens region. Rather, areas of high ditch density close to a main river are likely to be of greater value and should be targeted for enhancement. This approach can be adopted elsewhere in order to improve the evidence-base for strategic networks plans, increasing their value for money. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Terrestrial mammal distribution models typically do not differentiate between sexes when making spatial predictions, which could have important conservation implications. As male carnivores are usually more risk tolerant and travel longer distances, male potential range should be larger and include more human-modified areas than female range. To evaluate if differences between females and males could influence their conservation planning, we quantified sex-specific suitable range for a recolonizing population of American black bears (Ursus americanus). Location We applied this method in Missouri, USA. Methods We collected telemetry data from 57 females and 43 male bears from 2010 to 2018. We used three machine-learning methods (generalized boosted regression, random forest and maximum entropy) to develop sex-specific distribution models, which were combined into a weighted average ensemble model and converted into a binary (presence/absence) model using an optimized threshold. We used 80% of individuals for each sex as training data, and 20% as evaluation data. Results All models had high predictive performance; the greatest uncertainty in model predictions corresponded with the periphery of the distributions, whereas there was high agreement in the core distribution. Male suitable range was 66% larger than female range, and males were predicted to occur in more human-modified areas and more likely to be present in developed land and agriculture. Main conclusions Distribution models based on data from both sexes, or that is male-biased, could overestimate the female (i.e., reproductive) range and potentially misrepresent the biologically relevant species distribution. This bias can potentially lead to misguided decisions and suboptimal use of resources. By improving models when sex-specific data are available, we can better focus resources in areas where there is reproductive potential, leading to more accurate assessments of species' conservation status and better identifying areas vital for species persistence.

AB  - Although many large mammals currently face significant threats that could lead to their extinction, resources for conservation are often scarce, resulting in the need to develop efficient plans to prioritize conservation actions. We combined several methods in spatial ecology to identify the distribution of the endangered Baird's tapir across its range from southern Mexico to northern Colombia. Twenty-eight habitat patches covering 23% of the study area were identified, harboring potentially 62% or more of the total population for this flagship species. Roughly half of the total area is under some form of protection, while most of the remaining habitat (similar to 70%) occurs in indigenous/local communities. The network with maximum connectivity created from these patches contains at least one complete break (in Mexico between Selva El Ocote and Selva Lacandona) even when considering the most generous dispersal scenario. The connectivity analysis also highlighted a probable break at the Panama Canal and high habitat fragmentation in Honduras. In light of these findings, we recommend the following actions to facilitate the conservation of Baird's tapir: 1) protect existing habitat by strengthening enforcement in areas already under protection, 2) work with indigenous territories to preserve and enforce their land rights, and help local communities maintain traditional practices; 3) re-establish connections between habitat patches that will allow for connectivity across the species' distribution; 4) conduct additional noninvasive surveys in patches with little or no species data; and 5) collect more telemetry and genetic data on the species to estimate home range size, dispersal capabilities, and meta-population structure.

AB  - This study uses species distribution modeling and physiological and functional traits to predict the impacts of climate change on native freshwater fish in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. We modelled future changes in taxonomic and functional diversity in 2050 and 2080 for two scenarios of carbon emissions, identifying areas of great interest for conservation. Climatic-environmental variables were used to model the range of 23 species of native fish under each scenario. The consensus model, followed by the physiological filter of lethal temperature was retained for interpretation. Our study predicts a severe negative impact of climate change on both taxonomic and functional components of ichthyofauna of the Murray-Darling Basin. There was a predicted marked contraction of species ranges under both scenarios. The predictions showed loss of climatically suitable areas, species and functional characters. There was a decrease in areas with high values of functional richness, dispersion and uniqueness. Some traits are predicted to be extirpated, especially in the most pessimistic scenario. The climatic refuges for fish fauna are predicted to be in the southern portion of the basin, in the upper Murray catchment. Incorporating future predictions about the distribution of ichthyofauna in conservation management planning will enhance resilience to climate change.

AB  - A key feature of life's diversity is that some species are common but many more are rare. Nonetheless, at global scales, we do not know what fraction of biodiversity consists of rare species. Here, we present the largest compilation of global plant diversity to quantify the fraction of Earth's plant biodiversity that are rare. A large fraction, similar to 36.5% of Earth's similar to 435,000 plant species, are exceedingly rare. Sampling biases and prominent models, such as neutral theory and the k-niche model, cannot account for the observed prevalence of rarity. Our results indicate that (i) climatically more stable regions have harbored rare species and hence a large fraction of Earth's plant species via reduced extinction risk but that (ii) climate change and human land use are now disproportionately impacting rare species. Estimates of global species abundance distributions have important implications for risk assessments and conservation planning in this era of rapid global change.

AB  - Native fish conservation areas (NFCAs) are watersheds where management emphasizes proactive conservation and restoration for long-term persistence of native fish assemblages while allowing for compatible uses. Native fish conservation areas are intended to complement traditional fisheries management approaches that are often reactive to population stressors and focused on single-species conservation efforts rather than complete assemblages. We identified potential NFCAs in the upper Snake River basin above Hells Canyon Dam using a process that ranked all subwatersheds (Hydrologic Unit Code 12) and used empirical data on distribution, abundance, and genetics for three native trout species (Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus, Columbia River Redband Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri, and Yellow-stone Cutthroat Trout O. clarkii bouvieri, including the fine-spotted form) and both known occurrences and modeled potential distributions of native nongame fishes. Rankings also incorporated drainage network connectivity and land-protection status (e.g., national park, wilderness). Clusters of high-ranking subwatersheds were identified as potential NFCAs that were then classified according to the presence of nongame fishes identified as species of greatest conservation need in state wildlife action plans. The Pacific Creek and Goose Creek watersheds ranked high in the upper basin (above Shoshone Falls), and Little Jacks Creek and Squaw Creek ranked high in the lower basin. We then contrasted characteristics of a select few potential NFCAs, discuss the practical implementation and benefits of NFCAs for both fishes and other aquatic species in the upper Snake River basin, examined how the NFCA approach could enhance existing conservation partnerships, and discuss how designating select watersheds as NFCAs can create higher public awareness of the value of native fishes and other aquatic species and their habitats.

AB  - Aim Species distribution models are an important conservation tool; however, performance can vary with factors including data inputs and modelling method. Model outputs are often under-evaluated for explanatory and predictive capacity. Our aim was to evaluate the capacity of existing data for seven small mammal species to provide useful inferences for management planning. Location Bathurst and Melville (collectively the Tiwi) Islands, Northern Territory, Australia. Methods We developed species distribution models (SDMs) with generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs) using survey data (351 sites) of small mammals, with two sets of environmental predictors: (a) field-study measurements and (b) available remotely sensed rasters. Predictive capacity of models was evaluated using percentage of deviance explained (%DE) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We used Marxan to evaluate the influence of different model and data types as input for identifying spatial priorities. Results Field-informed SDMs performed well across both modelling methods, with relatively high test AUC values (mean = 0.82, range = 0.64-0.97) and test %DE (mean = 22.5%, range = 3.5%-65.8%). Remotely sensed models performed relatively poorly, with lower test AUC values (mean = 0.7, range = 0.56-0.86) and lower test %DE (mean = 8.9%, range = 0.03%-24.9%). A notable exception was remotely sensed models for Melomys burtoni (AUC = 0.85 & 0.86, %DE = 23.3% & 24.9%, Bathurst and Melville respectively). Marxan site irreplaceability rankings demonstrated low to marginal agreement using field-informed and remotely sensed inputs (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.3), and similarly, using GLM and BRT model inputs (0.29). Main conclusions The occurrence of small mammals on the Tiwi Islands can be reasonably explained with field-informed variables, but not with remotely sensed alternatives. Different models lead to different conservation priorities. Our work emphasizes the importance of thoroughly testing SDMs prior to decision-making.

AB  - Global climate change is having marked influences on species distributions, phenology and ecosystem composition and raises questions as to the effectiveness of current conservation strategies. Conservation planning has only recently begun to adequately account for dynamic threats such as climate change. We propose a method to incorporate climate-dynamic environmental domains, identified using specific environmental correlates of floristic composition, into conservation strategies, using the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa as a case study. The environmental domains offer an approach to conservation that conserves diversity under current and future climates, recognising that the species constituting diversity may change through time. We mapped current locations of domains by identifying their positions in a multi-dimensional environmental space using a non-hierarchical iterative k-means clustering algorithm. Their future locations were explored using an ensemble of future climate scenarios. The HadCM2 and GFDL2.1 models represented the extreme ranges of the models. The magnitude of change in each environmental domain was calculated using Euclidean distances to determine areas of greatest and least stability for each future climate projection. Domains occurring in the savanna biome increase at the expense of domains occurring in the grassland biome, which has significant negative consequences for the species rich grasslands. The magnitude of change maps represents areas of changed climatic conditions or edaphic disjunctions. The HadCM2 model predicted the greatest overall magnitude of change across the province. Species with specific soil requirements may not be able to track changing climatic conditions. A vulnerability framework was developed that incorporated climatic stability and habitat intactness indices. The mean magnitude of change informed the potential speed of transition of domains between the vulnerability quadrants. The framework informs appropriate conservation actions to mitigate climate change impacts on biodiversity. The study explicitly links floristic pattern and climate variability and provides useful insights to facilitate conservation planning for climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conservation planners and land managers are often confronted with scale-associated challenges when assessing the relationship between land management objectives and species conservation. Conservation of individual species typically involves site-level analyses of habitat, whereas land management focuses on larger spatial extents. New models are needed to more explicitly integrate species-specific conservation with landscape or regional scales. We address this challenge with an example using the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), a forest raptor with circumpolar distribution that is the focus of intense debate regarding forest management on public lands in the southwestern USA. To address goshawk-specific habitat conservation across a management area of 22,800-km(2) in northern Arizona, we focused on the territory scale rather than individual nest sites. We compiled a 17-year database of 895 nest sites to estimate territory locations. We then estimated the likelihood of territory occurrence for the entire management area using multiple logistic regression within an expert-driven, spatially balanced, and information-theoretic framework. Our occurrence model incorporated forest structure variables that were derived from USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis plots and high-resolution satellite imagery. Results indicated that high canopy-bulk density, intermediate canopy-base heights, and low variation in tree density were strong predictors of territory occurrence. We used model-averaged parameter estimates for these variables to map and explore patterns of territory distribution across multiple land jurisdictions and ecological subregions. Our iterative modeling approach complements previous demographic studies in the region. It also provides a robust framework for integrating species conservation and landscape management in ongoing and future regional planning efforts.

AB  - To relate the recent Iberian lynx decline to changes in the distribution of the European rabbit after the haemorrhagic disease outbreak of 1989. As Iberian rabbits evolved in two geographically separated lineages, being the recent lynx range practically restricted to the southwestern lineage, we also test if differential range dynamics exists for these lineages, with the consequent implications for lynx conservation and reintroduction planning.
   The Iberian Peninsula.
   We modelled environmental favourability for the lynx based on its distribution before 1989, and for the rabbit using distribution data collected primarily after 1989, and validated them using independent abundance data. We compared both models and combined them in a lynx occurrence forecast. We correlated the prevalence of southwestern rabbit lineage with the environmental favourability for the rabbit.
   The environmental lynx model correlated with past lynx abundance data, but did not reflect its recent strong range contraction. The rabbit model correlated with recent rabbit abundance, but was negatively correlated with the environmental model for the lynx. The combination of both models forecasted lynx occurrence in a few separated nuclei, which encompass all recent lynx records. The prevalence of rabbit's southwestern lineage correlated negatively with favourability for the rabbit.
   The region to which the lynx became confined before 1989 is currently less favourable for rabbits, whereas more favourable areas remain outside lynx reach. This differential favourability correlates with rabbit phylogeographical structure, suggesting that the southwestern lineage is facing more unfavourable conditions or is less resilient to recent diseases. The loss of concordance between lynx distribution and the whole rabbit phylogeographical structure has prevented lynx persistence in northeastern rabbit lineage areas, which should be considered in lynx reintroduction planning. Similar conservation problems could affect other ecologically interacting species whose distributions' overlapping has sharply diminished.

AB  - Information about distribution and habitat use of organisms is crucial for conservation. Bird distribution within the breeding season has been usually considered static, but this assumption has been questioned. Within-season movements may allow birds to track changes in habitat quality or to adjust site choice between subsequent breeding attempts. Such movements are especially likely in temperate mountains, given the substantial environmental heterogeneity and changes occurring during bird breeding season. We investigated the within-season movements of breeding songbirds in the European Alps in spring-summer 2018, using repeated point counts and dynamic occupancy models. For all the four species for which we obtained sufficient data, changes in occupancy during the season strongly indicated the occurrence of within-season movements. Species occupancy changed during the season according to fine-scale vegetation/land-cover types, while microclimate (mean temperature) affected initial occupancy in two species. The overall occupancy rate increased throughout the season, suggesting the settlement of new individuals coming from outside the area. A static distribution cannot be assumed during the breeding season for songbirds breeding in temperate mountains. This needs to be considered when planning monitoring and conservation of Alpine birds, as within-season movements may affect the proportion of population/distribution interested by monitoring or conservation programs.

AB  - Quantifying the distribution of an endangered species in space and time is crucial for planning management and conservation actions. The giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) is an endangered South American mammal that is considered to be extinct in the Atlantic Forest biome. Historical records of P. brasiliensis were used to reconstruct its original distribution in the Atlantic Forest biome. Based on the historical records and ecological niche models, the original distribution and amount of habitat area lost for the species were estimated. The potential impacts of dams in planning reintroductions for the species were also assessed. Twenty-six records of P. brasiliensis made between 1769 and 1999 were found. Most of the records are concentrated in the Parana River basin. Only six records were based on voucher specimens and photographs. Areas in the southern (Parana state, Brazil) and central (Bahia and Minas Gerais states, Brazil) Atlantic Forest were recovered as highly suitable for the species, even after considering the negative impact of dams. The ecological niche models suggested that P. brasiliensis formerly occupied an area of 909,257 km(2) in the Atlantic Forest. The forested rivers, along the upper Parana basin, in northern Argentina and southern Brazil were the last refugia of the species. Pelt trade was probably a major factor in the species' disappearance, which is evidenced by the fact that Brazilian stakeholders, in Atlantic Forest sites, restricted giant otter hunting as early as 1948. The results show that historical records and ecological niche models can be effectively combined and may guide in-situ conservation actions by identifying potential areas for reintroductions.

AB  - Designating protected areas remains a core strategy in biodiversity conservation. Despite high endemism, montane forests across the island of Java are under-represented in Indonesia's protected area network. Here, we document the montane biodiversity of Gunung Slamet, an isolated volcano in Central Java, and provide evidence to support its increased protection. During September-December 2018, we surveyed multiple sites for birds, primates, terrestrial mammals, reptiles, amphibians and vegetation. Survey methods included transects, camera traps and targeted searches at six sites, at altitudes of 970-2,512 m. We used species distribution models for birds and mammals of conservation concern to identify priority areas for protection. We recorded 99 bird species (13 globally threatened), 15 mammals (five globally threatened) and 17 reptiles and amphibians (two endemic). Our species distribution models showed considerable cross-taxon congruence between important areas on Slamet's upper slopes, generally above 1,800 m. Particularly important were records of the endemic subspecies of the Endangered Javan laughingthrush Garrulax rufifrons slamatensis, not recorded in the wild since 1925, the Endangered Javan gibbon Hylobates moloch and Javan surili Presbytis comata, and the Vulnerable Javan lutung Trachypithecus auratus and Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas. Recent forest loss has been modest, at least 280 km(2) of continuous forest remain above 800 m, and our surveys show that forest habitats are in good condition. However, the mountain is widely used by trappers and hunters. Given its importance for biodiversity conservation, we discuss different options for improving the protection status of Gunung Slamet, including designation as a National Park or Essential Ecosystem.

AB  - Fuscopannaria leucosticta is a rare lichen that exhibits an apparent specificity for old wet forests in eastern Canada, and may, consequently, be sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance. Estimates of the current distribution and population size are highly uncertain. Effective conservation planning requires improving our understanding of both its current distribution and the factors that influence habitat suitability. We built a MaxEnt distribution model with interpolated climate data, depth to water table mapping, forest inventory data, and herbarium collection data for F. leucosticta in New Brunswick, Canada. We tested model performance via field verifications in high-probability areas with no record of previous surveys. We found F. leucosticta in 13 out of 22 previously unsurveyed locations with a predicted high probability of occurrence. Selected variables included the presence of cedar in the canopy and a lack of recent anthropogenic disturbance, as well as mean annual rainfall and degree days above 0 degrees C. These associations are likely a result of the lichen's low reproductive output and the thermal and hydration requirements of its cyanobacterial photobiont. Our study affirms several previous claims about habitat associations of the species, and provides focus for conservation efforts in the future.

AB  - The meadow viper Vipera ursinii includes four subspecies with five allopatric areas of distribution in Europe. It is currently considered one of the most threatened reptile species on the continent, mainly because of its patchy distribution and concurrent habitat loss. Taking advantage of a database composed of occurrence data from bibliographical sources and field observations, we present the first European-scale assessment of the historical knowledge and chronogeonemy of this species. In addition, we evaluate the habitat use and coverage of protected areas with regard to both actual occurrences and modelled potentially suitable areas. This was done for Vipera ursiniis.l. as well as for each of the four subspecies. Our results show different patterns of historical knowledge as well as different degrees of legal protection, depending on the country and subspecies considered. Furthermore, most of the occurrences arc from habitats which arc classified as vulnerable. A gap analysis reveals an inadequate protection status for modelled areas of potential suitability and a heterogeneous coverage of protected areas, again depending on the subspecies considered. Our findings assist towards a more focused conservation management of all V. ursinii subspecies in the next future, which could take place by connecting landscape-scale research with field studies to update management strategies of protected areas. For these latter, Europe-wide coordinated actions arc required to promote plans targeting the same conservation goals.

AB  - Establishment of protected areas to maintain biodiversity requires identification, prioritization and management of stressors that may undermine conservation goals. Nonindigenous species and climate change are critical ecosystem stressors that need greater attention in the context of spatial planning and management of protected areas. Risk of invasion into protected areas needs to be quantified under current and projected climate conditions in conjunction with prioritization of key vectors and vulnerable areas to enable development of effective management strategies. We assessed the likelihood of invasion across networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) to determine how invaded MPAs may compromise MPA networks by sharing nonindigenous species. We evaluated invasion risk in 83 MPAs along Canada's Pacific coast for eight nonindigenous species based on environmental suitability under current and future (average conditions from 2041 to 2070) climate conditions and association with shipping and boating pathways. We applied species distribution models and network analysis of vessel tracking data for 805 vessels in 2016 that connected MPAs. The probability of occurrence within MPAs and the proportion of MPA area that is suitable to the modelled species significantly increased under future climate conditions, with six species reaching over 90% predicted occurrence across MPAs and over 70% of suitable area within MPAs. Vessel traffic created four network clusters of 61 highly connected MPAs that spanned the coastline. Occupancy of over 90% of the MPAs within the clusters was predicted for most species. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a high likelihood of marine protected area (MPA) network invasion based on current and future environmental conditions and vectors of spread, and the potential for extensive nonindigenous species distributions within MPAs. Our approach highlights how interacting stressors can exacerbate MPA susceptibility to nonindigenous species, adding further challenges for protected area management. Management planning that invests in understanding connectivity and vector processes (human behaviours) is more likely to derive effective policies to stem the flow of nonindigenous species under both current and future conditions. In particular, biosecurity measures including vessel biofouling regulations and MPA- and MPA network-specific plans for prevention, monitoring and mitigation of nonindigenous species are needed.

AB  - The Western Central Atlantic (WCA) hosts a population of manta rays whose distribution and habitat preference is poorly understood. Addressing this lack of knowledge will be essential to aid the effective implementation of targeted conservation measures. Here, we use ensemble ecological niche modeling to predict the monthly distribution of manta rays in the WCA using multiple sources of species occurrence data, and consequently identify core areas, which represent suitable habitat in all months of the year. Models suggest a seasonal cycle of expansion and contraction of suitable habitat from coastal areas in spring-summer, to open ocean in autumn-winter. Core areas are concentrated along the coast of the USA, Mexico, and Venezuela. Only 24% of predicted suitable habitat is encompassed by the present regional network of MPAs, and is intersected by numerous, heavily trafficked shipping lanes. Manta rays are slow-growing animals that only produce a limited number of offspring; as such, this species is sensitive to even moderate increases in mortality rates. For this reason, the existing regional network of MPAs may offer them limited protection. As manta rays in the WCA are challenged by a complex landscape of threats and protective measures, future marine conservation planning in the region should explicitly address the conservation of manta rays, focusing on areas identified as key habitats for the species.

AB  - Understanding geographical biases in ecological research is important for conservation, planning, prioritisation and management. However, conservation efforts may be limited by data availability and poor understanding of the nature of potential spatial bias. We conduct the first continent-wide analysis of spatial bias associated with Australian terrestrial reptile ecological research. To evaluate potential research deficiencies, we used Maxent modelling to predict the distributions of 646 reptile studies published from 1972 to 2017. Based on existing distributions of 1631 individual reptile study locations, reptile species richness, proximity to universities, human footprint and location of protected areas, we found the strongest predictor of reptile research locations was proximity to universities (40.8%). This was followed by species richness (22.9%) and human footprint (20.1%), while protected areas were the weakest predictor (16.2%). These results highlight that research effort is driven largely by accessibility and we consequently identify potential target areas for future research that can be optimised to ensure adequate representation of reptile communities.

AB  - The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) lives in alpine ecosystems in Central Asia, where it could face intensive climate change and is thus a major conservation concern. We compiled a dataset of 406 GPS-located occurrences based on field surveys, literature, and the GBIF database. We used Random Forest to build different species distribution models with a maximum of 27 explanatory variables, including climatic, topographical, and human impact variables, to predict potential distribution for the snow leopard and make climate change projections. We estimated the potential range shifts of the snow leopard under two global climate models for different representative concentration pathways for 2050 and 2070. We found the distribution center of the snow leopard may move northwest by about 200 km and may move upward in elevation by about 100 m by 2070. Unlike previous studies on the range shifts of the snow leopard, we highlighted that upward rather than northward range shifts are the main pathways for the snow leopard in the changing climate, since the landform of their habitat allows an upward shift, whereas mountains and valleys would block northward movement. Conservation of the snow leopard should therefore prioritize protecting its current habitat over making movement corridors.

AB  - How climate constrains species' distributions through time and space is an important question in the context of conservation planning for climate change. Despite increasing awareness of the need to incorporate mechanism into species distribution models (SDMs), mechanistic modeling of endotherm distributions remains limited in this literature. Using the American pika (Ochotona princeps) as an example, we present a framework whereby mechanism can be incorporated into endotherm SDMs. Pika distribution has repeatedly been found to be constrained by warm temperatures, so we used Niche Mapper, a mechanistic heat-balance model, to convert macroclimate data to pika- specific surface activity time in summer across the western United States. We then explored the difference between using a macroclimate predictor (summer temperature) and using a mechanistic predictor (predicted surface activity time) in SDMs. Both approaches accurately predicted pika presences in current and past climate regimes. However, the activity models predicted 8-19% less habitat loss in response to annual temperature increases of similar to 3-5 degrees C predicted in the region by 2070, suggesting that pikas may be able to buffer some climate change effects through behavioral thermoregulation that can be captured by mechanistic modeling. Incorporating mechanism added value to the modeling by providing increased confidence in areas where different modeling approaches agreed and providing a range of outcomes in areas of disagreement. It also provided a more proximate variable relating animal distribution to climate, allowing investigations into how unique habitat characteristics and intraspecific phenotypic variation may allow pikas to exist in areas outside those predicted by generic SDMs. Only a small number of easily obtainable data are required to parameterize this mechanistic model for any endotherm, and its use can improve SDM predictions by explicitly modeling a widely applicable direct physiological effect: climate-imposed restrictions on activity. This more complete understanding is necessary to inform climate adaptation actions, management strategies, and conservation plans.

AB  - Marine classification schemes based on abiotic surrogates often inform regional marine conservation planning in lieu of detailed biological data. However, these schemes may poorly represent ecologically relevant biological patterns required for effective design and management strategies. We used a community-level modeling approach to characterize and delineate representative mesoscale (tens to thousands of kilometers) assemblages of demersal fish and benthic invertebrates in the Northwest Atlantic. Hierarchical clustering of species occurrence data from four regional annual multispecies trawl surveys revealed three to six groupings (predominant assemblage types) in each survey region, broadly associated with geomorphic and oceanographic features. Indicator analyses identified 3-34 emblematic taxa of each assemblage type. Random forest classifications accurately predicted assemblage distributions from environmental covariates (AUC > 0.95) and identified thermal limits (annual minimum and maximum bottom temperatures) as important predictors of distribution in each region. Using forecasted oceanographic conditions for the year 2075 and a regional classification model, we projected assemblage distributions in the southernmost bioregion (Scotian Shelf-Bay of Fundy) under a high emissions climate scenario (RCP 8.5). Range expansions to the northeast are projected for assemblages associated with warmer and shallower waters of the Western Scotian Shelf over the 21st century as thermal habitat on the relatively cooler Eastern Scotian Shelf becomes more favorable. Community-level modeling provides a biotic-informed approach for identifying broadscale ecological structure required for the design and management of ecologically coherent, representative, well-connected networks of Marine Protected Areas. When combined with oceanographic forecasts, this modeling approach provides a spatial tool for assessing sensitivity and resilience to climate change, which can improve conservation planning, monitoring, and adaptive management.

AB  - Many nature reserves are established to protect the habitat needs of particular endangered species of interest but their effectiveness for protecting other species is questionable. In this study, this effectiveness was evaluated in a nature reserve network located in the Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi Province, China. The network of reserves was established mainly for the conservation of the giant panda, a species considered as a surrogate for the conservation of many other endangered species in the region. The habitat suitability of nine protected species, including the giant panda, was modeled by using Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) and their spatial congruence was analyzed. Habitat suitability of these species was also overlapped with nature reserve boundaries and their management zones (i.e., core, buffer and experimental zones). Results show that in general the habitat of the giant panda constitutes a reasonable surrogate of the habitat of other protected species, and giant panda reserves protect a relatively high proportion of the habitat of other protected species. Therefore, giant panda habitat conservation also allows the conservation of the habitat of other protected species in the region. However, a large area of suitable habitat was excluded from the nature reserve network. In addition, four species exhibited a low proportion of highly suitable habitat inside the core zones of nature reserves. It suggests that a high proportion of suitable habitat of protected species not targeted for conservation is located in the experimental and buffer zones, thus, is being affected by human activities. To increase their conservation effectiveness, nature reserves and their management zones need to be re-examined in order to include suitable habitat of more endangered species. The procedures described in this study can be easily implemented for the conservation of many endangered species not only in China but in many other parts of the world.

AB  - Premise Populations of species with large spatial distributions are shaped by complex forces that differ throughout their ranges. To maintain the genetic diversity of species, genepool-based subsets of widespread species must be considered in conservation assessments. Methods The population genetics of the lichenized fungus Lobaria pulmonaria and its algal partner, Symbiochloris reticulata, were investigated using microsatellite markers to determine population structure, genetic diversity, and degree of congruency in eastern and western North America. Data loggers measuring temperature and humidity were deployed at selected populations in eastern North America to test for climatic adaptation. To better understand the role Pleistocene glaciations played in shaping population patterns, a North American, range-wide species distribution model was constructed and hindcast to 22,000 years before present and at 500-year time slices from then to the present. Results The presence of two gene pools with minimal admixture was supported, one in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and one in eastern North America. Western populations were significantly more genetically diverse than eastern populations. There was no evidence for climatic adaptation among eastern populations, though there was evidence for range-wide adaptation to evapotranspiration rates. Hindcast distribution models suggest that observed genetic diversity may be due to a drastic Pleistocene range restriction in eastern North America, whereas a substantial coastal refugial area is inferred in the west. Conclusions Taken together the results show different, complex population histories of L. pulmonaria in eastern and western North America, and suggest that conservation planning for each gene pool should be considered separately.

AB  - Southeast Asian forests are dominated by the tree family Dipterocarpaceae, whose abundance and diversity are key to maintaining the structure and function of tropical forests. Like most biodiversity, dipterocarps are threatened by deforestation and climate change, so it is crucial to understand the potential impacts of these threats on current and future dipterocarp distributions. We developed species distribution models (SDMs) for 19 species of dipterocarps in the Philippines, which were projected onto current and two 2070 representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate scenarios, RCP 4.5 and 8.5. Current land cover was incorporated as a post-hoc correction to restrict projections onto intact habitats. Land cover correction alone reduced current species distributions by a median 67%, and within protected areas by 37%. After land cover correction, climate change reduced distributions by a median 16% (RCP 4.5) and 27% (RCP 8.5) at the national level, with similar losses in protected areas. There was a detectable upward elevation shift of species distributions, consisting of suitable habitat losses below 300 m and gains above 600 m. Species-rich stable areas of continued habitat suitability (i.e., climate macrorefugia) fell largely outside current delineations of protected areas, indicating a need to improve protected area planning. This study highlights how SDMs can provide projections that can inform protected area planning in the tropics.

AB  - China is one of the most species-rich countries in the world, harboring many rare gymnosperms. Following recent human-led loss of forests, China is now experiencing increases in forest cover resulting from efforts of reforestation schemes. As anthropogenic activities have previously been found to interact with topography in shaping forest cover in China and considering the large human population and the ongoing population increase of the country, it is important to understand the role of anthropogenic pressures relative to environmental drivers for shaping species distributions here. Based on the well-established relationship between human population density and topography, we propose a hypothesis for explaining species distributions in a country dominated by human activities, predicting that species are more likely to occur in areas of steep topography under medium human population densities compared to low and high human population densities. Using species occurrence data from the Chinese Vascular Plant Distribution Database along with a common SDM method (maximum entropy modeling), we tested this hypothesis. Our results show that steep topography has the highest importance for predicting Chinese gymnosperm species occurrences in general, and threatened species specifically, in areas of medium human population densities. Consequently, these species are more often found in areas of steep terrain, supporting the proposed hypothesis. Results from this study highlight the need to include topographically heterogeneous habitats when planning new protected areas for species conservation.

AB  - The high rate of amphibian endemism and the severe habitat modification in the Caribbean islands make them an ideal place to test if the current protected areas network might protect this group. In this study, we model distribution and map species richness of the 40 amphibian species from eastern Cuba with the objectives of identify hotspots, detect gaps in species representation in protected areas, and select additional areas to fill these gaps. We used two modeling methods, Maxent and Habitat Suitability Models, to reach a consensus distribution map for each species, then calculate species richness by combining specific models and finally performed gap analyses for species and hotspots. Our results showed that the models were robust enough to predict species distributions and that most of the amphibian hotspots were represented in reserves, but 50 percent of the species were incompletely covered and Eleutherodactylus rivularis was totally uncovered by the protected areas. We identified 1441 additional km(2) (9.9% of the study area) that could be added to the current protected areas, allowing the representation of every species and all hotspots. Our results are relevant for the conservation planning in other Caribbean islands, since studies like this could contribute to fill the gaps in the existing protected areas and to design a future network. Both cases would benefit from modeling amphibian species distribution using available data, even if they are incomplete, rather than relying only in the protection of known or suspected hotspots.

AB  - Federal land management agencies and conservation organizations have begun incorporating climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVAs) as an important component in the management and conservation of landscapes. It is often a challenge to translate that knowledge into management plans and actions, even when research infers species risk. Predictive maps can improve current CCVAs and assist in quantifying and visualizing species climate change vulnerability across large areas. We assessed the climate change risk for Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) habitat at two spatial scales in Utah and Nevada. At the local scale, multiple species climate envelopes were evaluated with additional stressors (fire, conifer encroachment, invasive grass, and human impact) to create risk maps for mesic (Strawberry) and xeric (Sheeprock) sage-grouse landscapes in Utah. Both landscapes were predicted to be at risk, but Sheeprock was found to be at higher risk due to future climate change implications coupled with additional habitat-degrading stressors. By using models, we are able to integrate complex interactions, and visualize the distribution of risk across broad spatial scales, providing land managers and researchers a valuable tool for CCVA and action plans.

AB  - In this study we projected the effect of anthropogenic climate change in endemic and restricted-range Andean bird species that spread out from the center of Bolivia to southeastern Peru. We also analyzed the representation of these species in protected areas. The ensemble forecasts from niche-based models indicated that 91-100% of species may reduce their range size under full and no dispersal scenarios, including five species that are currently threatened. The large range reduction (average 63%) suggests these mountain species may be threatened by climate change. The strong effects due to range species losses are predicted in the humid mountain forests of Bolivia. The representation of bird species also decreased in protected areas. Partial gap species (94-86%) are expected to increase over the present (62%). This suggests climate change and other non-climate stressors should be incorporated in conservations plans for the long-term persistence of these species. This study anticipates the magnitude of shifts in the distribution of endemic birds, and represents in the study area the first exploration of the representation of rangerestricted Andean birds in protected areas under climate change.

AB  - Information and data on the distribution of wildlife species become important when strategizing the management and conservation of the species. Species distribution models have increasingly been used as a predictive tool in wildlife conservation planning and management. This research assessed the distribution of the sun bear and identified the relevant distribution descriptive variables in the Krau Wildlife Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA). Marginality and specialization factors showed that the sun bear habitat is very specific compared to the entire study area and its niche breadth was slightly narrow. Among all the habitat suitability algorithms available in Biomapper software package, median with the extreme optimum algorithm was found to have the best predictive capabilities by means of a continuous Boyce index. Results showed that sun bear can rarely be found in high altitudes, prefers lowland Dipterocarp, and avoids Mountain Ericaceous and Mixed Hill Dipterocarp forests. It also prefers to live nearby rivers, tends to avoid villages and prefers regions with fine silty-clay and loamy textures soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective conservation of fish species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) requires an understanding of species-habitat relationships and distributional trends. Thus, modeling the distribution of fish species across large spatial scales may be a valuable tool for conservation planning. Our goals were to evaluate the status of 10 fish SGCN in wadeable Iowa streams and to test the effectiveness of Iowa Aquatic Gap Analysis Project (IAGAP) species distribution models. We sampled fish assemblages from 86 wadeable stream segments in the Mississippi River drainage of Iowa during 2009 and 2010 to provide contemporary, independent fish species presence-absence data. The frequencies of occurrence in stream segments where species were historically documented varied from 0.0% for redfin shiner Lythrurus umbratilis to 100.0% for American brook lamprey Lampetra appendix, with a mean of 53.0%, suggesting that the status of Iowa fish SGCN is highly variable. Cohen's kappa values and other model performance measures were calculated by comparing field-collected presence-absence data with IAGAP model-predicted presences and absences for 12 fish SGCN. Kappa values varied from 0.00 to 0.50, with a mean of 0.15. The models only predicted the occurrences of banded darter Etheostoma zonale, southern redbelly dace Phoxinus erythrogaster, and longnose dace Rhinichthys cataractae more accurately than would be expected by chance. Overall, the accuracy of the twelve models was low, with a mean correct classification rate of 58.3%. Poor model performance probably reflects the difficulties associated with modeling the distribution of rare species and the inability of the large-scale habitat variables used in IAGAP models to explain the variation in fish species occurrences. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying the confidence in species distribution model predictions with an independent data set and the need for long-term monitoring to better understand the distributional trends and habitat associations of fish SGCN.

AB  - 1. Knowledge of global diversity patterns is important for research into the factors that shape them, and for systematic conservation planning. However, most species inventories are incomplete and biased towards conspicuous, charismatic, geographically widespread, and temperate species. These biases hamper attempts to gain a clear view of underlying diversity patterns, and compromise conservation plans that are based upon what is known.
   2. Here we investigate this problem using two methods to estimate species diversity in the parasitic wasp family Braconidae. The first quantifies the effect of taxonomic revisions on species numbers within genera to estimate the present level of underdescription. The second additionally considers the numbers of specimens referred to in descriptions and revisions.
   3. Modelling underdescription as a function of region and body size shows that research carried out thus far displays significant geographical and taxonomic biases.
   4. Correcting for these biases affects the distribution of inferred undiscovered diversity among braconid subfamilies and among regions, as well as the total diversity estimates for the family.
   5. The geographic distribution of levels of underdescription also has implications for latitudinal diversity gradients. Weak or non-existent gradients in some taxa may be caused simply by differences in the number of undescribed species between tropical and temperate regions.
   6. Such analyses can enlighten researchers as to where, taxonomically and geographically, research should be directed to economically improve species richness estimates. In the case of braconid wasps the greatest gains are to be made in Africa and southern America, and for the Braconinae and Microgastrinae.

AB  - Estimates of extinction risk for Amazonian plant and animal species are rare and not often incorporated into land-use policy and conservation planning. We overlay spatial distribution models with historical and projected deforestation to show that at least 36% and up to 57% of all Amazonian tree species are likely to qualify as globally threatened under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria. If confirmed, these results would increase the number of threatened plant species on Earth by 22%. We show that the trends observed in Amazonia apply to trees throughout the tropics, and we predict thatmost of the world's >40,000 tropical tree species now qualify as globally threatened. A gap analysis suggests that existing Amazonian protected areas and indigenous territories will protect viable populations of most threatened species if these areas suffer no further degradation, highlighting the key roles that protected areas, indigenous peoples, and improved governance can play in preventing large-scale extinctions in the tropics in this century.

AB  - Establishing protected areas, where human activities and land cover changes are restricted, is among the most widely used strategies for biodiversity conservation. This practice is based on the assumption that protected areas buffer species from processes that drive extinction. However, protected areas can maintain biodiversity in the face of climate change and subsequent shifts in distributions have been questioned. We evaluated the degree to which protected areas influenced colonization and extinction patterns of 97 avian species over 20 years in the northeastern United States. We fitted single-visit dynamic occupancy models to data from Breeding Bird Atlases to quantify the magnitude of the effect of drivers of local colonization and extinction (e.g., climate, land cover, and amount of protected area) in heterogeneous landscapes that varied in the amount of area under protection. Colonization and extinction probabilities improved as the amount of protected area increased, but these effects were conditional on landscape context and species characteristics. In this forest-dominated region, benefits of additional land protection were greatest when both forest cover in a grid square and amount of protected area in neighboring grid squares were low. Effects did not vary with species' migratory habit or conservation status. Increasing the amounts of land protection benefitted the range margins species but not the core range species. The greatest improvements in colonization and extinction rates accrued for forest birds relative to open-habitat or generalist species. Overall, protected areas stemmed extinction more than they promoted colonization. Our results indicate that land protection remains a viable conservation strategy despite changing habitat and climate, as protected areas both reduce the risk of local extinction and facilitate movement into new areas. Our findings suggest conservation in the face of climate change favors creation of new protected areas over enlarging existing ones as the optimal strategy to reduce extinction and provide stepping stones for the greatest number of species.

AB  - The gap between research and its implementation is an impediment to conservation of the environment. Translating science into actionable management and policy requires effective communication and collaboration among scientists, practitioners, and policy-makers. Ecologists routinely rely on spatial data to describe wildlife distributions; however, habitat definitions vary by species, and data sources often differ from those used by land managers. Finding commonalities in the language and data used to plan for industrial activities and wildlife conservation may help address the research-implementation gap for threatened species like woodland caribou. We built resource selection functions for caribou using Alberta Vegetation Index (AVI) habitat data, which is employed by the Alberta forest industry for landbase planning. Our goal was to bridge the research-implementation gap by providing the forest industry with tools to facilitate planning for caribou conservation within their jurisdiction. In contrast to previous studies that highlighted shortcomings in AVI data for predicting wildlife habitat use, we found that resource selection function models that combined AVI data with complementary covariates validated well to predict caribou habitat use. We suggest that by using a data source familiar to land managers, ecologists can facilitate the bridging of the research-implementation gap without compromising the quality of ecological modeling.

AB  - Sanjiangyuan, called the "Water tower of Asia", is critically important in the ecological services of water pro- vision and regulation and in biodiversity conservation. To strengthen protection in this eco-region, The Chinese government established the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve (SNNR) in 2001 and Sanjiangyuan National Park (SNP) in 2014. To assess the effectiveness of these two conservation practices, on the endangered plant species, we used an integrated method to identify the priority areas of the endangered plant species in the Sanjiangyuan Area which showed if some areas need more conservation efforts. After identifying the potential habitats of high-valued species in Sanjiangyuan with MaxENT, a model that combined the hotspots of en- dangered plant species richness (H), vegetation condition (V), soil condition (S), human disturbance (D) and climate change impact (C) was used to calculate ecosystem risk (ER) associated with each habitat. Projections of climate modeling show that the distribution of endangered plants in Sangjiangyuan will expand to the west and north with the warmer and wetter climate in the future. In both current and future scenarios, the habitats in the northeast of the SNNR are at the highest ecosystem risk and need to be protected strictly. However, most of the high ecosystem risk/conservation priority regions we identified - either current or predicted future status (in 2070 under RCP 2.6) were not protected by SNNR or SNP. Identified conservation gaps call for the well-targeted planning and delineated scientific interventions for protecting the key habitats of these endangered plant species. Conservation priority should be given to eastern Xinghai County and northeastern Tongde County in the east of SNNR, where the habitats are at high ecosystem risk and have high conservation priority.

AB  - Understanding and accurately modeling species distributions lies at the heart of many problems in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Multiple sources of data are increasingly available for modeling species distributions, such as data from citizen science programs, atlases, museums, and planned surveys. Yet reliably combining data sources can be challenging because data sources can vary considerably in their design, gradients covered, and potential sampling biases. We review, synthesize, and illustrate recent developments in combining multiple sources of data for species distribution modeling. We identify five ways in which multiple sources of data are typically combined for modeling species distributions. These approaches vary in their ability to accommodate sampling design, bias, and uncertainty when quantifying environmental relationships in species distribution models. Many of the challenges for combining data are solved through the prudent use of integrated species distribution models: models that simultaneously combine different data sources on species locations to quantify environmental relationships for explaining species distribution. We illustrate these approaches using planned survey data on 24 species of birds coupled with opportunistically collected eBird data in the southeastern United States. This example illustrates some of the benefits of data integration, such as increased precision in environmental relationships, greater predictive accuracy, and accounting for sample bias. Yet it also illustrates challenges of combining data sources with vastly different sampling methodologies and amounts of data. We provide one solution to this challenge through the use of weighted joint likelihoods. Weighted joint likelihoods provide a means to emphasize data sources based on different criteria (e.g., sample size), and we find that weighting improves predictions for all species considered. We conclude by providing practical guidance on combining multiple sources of data for modeling species distributions.

AB  - Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, with edible and medicinal values, is a key shrub species in south China's forest under story. It maintains ecological balance, soil and water conservation, and biodiversity in the widely degraded mountain ecosystems. The distribution and population of R. tomentosa have shrunk recently due to anthropogenic impacts. At present, wild communities of R. tomentosa are rare in China's low-altitude areas. A comprehensive understanding of its current and future spatial patterns vis-`a-vis changing climatic conditions can inform co-management for economic use and conservation. Based on 213 validated distribution records and nine selected environmental variables, the potential biogeographical range of R. tomentosa in China was predicted by Maxent and QGIS modeling under current and three future climate-change scenarios. The limiting factors for distribution were evaluated by Jackknife, per cent contribution and permutation importance. We found that the present actual biogeographical range was concentrated in tropical and south-subtropical China with some extensions to mid-subtropical east and southwest China, with the main occurrence in the core range of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces. The modeling results indicated temperature as the clinching determinant of distribution patterns, including the minimum temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of warmest quarter, and temperature seasonality. Moisture was a necessary but not critical secondary factor. Under future climate-change scenarios, habitats with excellent suitability index will expand and shift towards southwest China and high-altitude areas. The findings provide science-based evidence to adjust management and conservation plans in response to climate change protect and use R. tomentosa in suitability habitats.

AB  - The leopard Panthera pardus is widely distributed across Africa and Asia; however, there is a gap in its natural distribution in Southeast Asia, where it occurs on the mainland and on Java but not on the interjacent island of Sumatra. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain this distribution gap. Here, we complemented an existing dataset of 68 leopard mtDNA sequences from Africa and Asia with mtDNA sequences (NADH5+ ctrl, 724bp) from 19 Javan leopards, and hindcasted leopard distribution to the Pleistocene to gain further insights into the evolutionary history of the Javan leopard. Our data confirmed that Javan leopards are evolutionarily distinct from other Asian leopards, and that they have been present on Java since the Middle Pleistocene. Species distribution projections suggest that Java was likely colonized via a Malaya-Java land bridge that by-passed Sumatra, as suitable conditions for leopards during Pleistocene glacial periods were restricted to northern and western Sumatra. As fossil evidence supports the presence of leopards on Sumatra at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene, our projections are consistent with a scenario involving the extinction of leopards on Sumatra as a consequence of the Toba super volcanic eruption (similar to 74kya). The impact of this eruption was minor on Java, suggesting that leopards managed to survive here. Currently, only a few hundred leopards still live in the wild and only about 50 are managed in captivity. Therefore, this unique and distinctive subspecies requires urgent, concerted conservation efforts, integrating insitu and ex situ conservation management activities in a One Plan Approach to species conservation management.

AB  - Understanding the importance of climate in determining species distribution and how it might change as a function of spatial grain size is a vital issue for species distribution modeling (SDM), yet it is often not accounted for in models and has not been extensively addressed in under sampled areas in tropical forests. Using extensive field sampled vegetation plots data on species occurrences and current climate conditions we modeled 150 vascular plant species in the Okavango River Basin, to map their current projected suitable climate space at 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 km(2) pixel resolution. Relationships between the variable importance scores and variable identity and their interaction with predictor spatial grain were investigated using Generalized Linear Models and post-hoc analysis. We found variation in the relative influence of temperature and precipitation variables across the spatial grains. The importance of the determinants of species distribution may change between species but such changes are less determined by the predictor's spatial grain. Potential evapotranspiration consistently exhibited the greatest influence in determining species and richness distribution across fine to coarse spatial grains. We found that the spatial grain of predictors had no effect on the model predictive power and that varying predictor spatial grains had only negligible effects on the model performance measured by AUC and Kappa statistics. The spatial grains of the climatic predictors used showed no effect on species richness pattern either. Our results indicate that in areas with relatively low topographic variation, modeling at coarse spatial grain for conservation purposes can be acceptable. Moreover, we show that in tropical areas that have comparatively homogeneous climatic conditions along large spatial extents the variable importance is not influenced by predictor spatial grain. For projections of contemporary species suitable climate space in relatively flat and topographically homogeneous areas which often have a climatically homogenous landscape, more attention must be given to the identity of the selected predictor variables for modeling the species distributions than to their spatial grain size. We suggest that in species distribution modeling for conservation planning, assessment of the input datasets spatial grain should be informed and guided by knowledge of the landscape level topographic conditions, as protocol.

AB  - The reintroduction and recolonization of species extirpated from former ranges are key components of species conservation. Resource availability affects recolonization success and resulting distribution patterns, but top-down processes may also play a role through density-mediated or trait-mediated indirect effects that may exclude a species from otherwise suitable habitat. We predicted that the spatial distribution of recolonizing sea otters, Enhydra lutris, on the Canadian Pacific coastline was explained by resources as well as interspecific interactions - spatial segregation from pinnipeds, the preferred prey of killer whales Orcinus orca. We surveyed the summer occurrence of sea otters and pinnipeds on Vancouver Island, Canada. We quantified coastline density and bathymetry at multiple spatial scales as indices of habitat complexity and foraging habitat availability. We used generalized linear model selection to test hypotheses about sea otters' spatial relationship to resources and heterospecifics. Pinniped presence negatively predicted sea otter presence, even after accounting for complexity and foraging habitat. Sea otters may segregate from pinnipeds due to trait-mediated indirect effects of predation, leading us to hypothesize apparent competition between sea otters and pinnipeds. Research is needed to test this hypothesis; if true, refuge from apparent competitors may be a key component of recolonization habitat for sea otters. Species distribution models should quantify resource landscapes but also species-scapes: the spatial plane of species interactions that combines with resources to drive species distributions. Conservation plans based on recolonization models that include only resources may overestimate available habitat, carrying capacity, and recolonization success. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - AimConservation strategies must anticipate how climate change may alter the geographic distributions of limited food resources for highly specialized species. Here, we use bamboo as a case study to investigate climate change-induced changes in species diversity and discuss how to protect the critical food species for giant pandas.
   LocationGiant panda habitats.
   MethodsUsing a niche-based model and the most updated climate projections, we projected the current and future distribution of 16 bamboo species under no and universal dispersal assumptions. We then assessed the impact of climate change on bamboo forests and their alpha and beta diversities in the giant panda habitats and reserves.
   ResultsUnder both dispersal assumptions and three RCPs, six bamboo species are projected to vanish from panda habitats as climate change progresses, resulting in a great loss of the current bamboo forests. Although about half of the bamboo species may potentially colonize new climatically suitable areas under universal dispersal, the other species would experience significant habitat loss. Consequently, climate change would reduce both the alpha and beta diversity of bamboo species in panda habitats. Meanwhile, the proportion of single-species bamboo forests would significantly increase. The decline in bamboo forests and diversity would be most drastic in Qinling, Daxiangling and Qionglaishan Mountains, whereas those in the north-west of Minshan Mountains and Liangshan Mountains may increase.
   Main conclusionsClimate change-induced decline in bamboo habitats and species diversity would pose a severe challenge to the food availability of giant pandas. We posit that human-assisted adaptation and increasing bamboo species diversity are critical to ensuring food security of the giant panda in a changing climate. Our results indicate that conservation planning should not only incorporate species range shifts but also diversity patterns in communities under climate change.

AB  - Complementarity analysis based on overlaying large numbers of species distribution maps is increasingly being employed by conservationists to determine conservation priorities. This method is used because of its efficiency in representing selected species in a minimal number of areas, thus maximizing the number of conserved species in relation to area, As such analyses are mostly based on coarse spatial scales, it is essential to test the efficiency and accuracy of these methods, and to develop supplementary analyses that allow us to translate the result into identification of conservation sites of a manageable size. Here we test the effectiveness of a coarse-scale (continent-wide) analysis using a more detailed (nation-Wide) logical inductive model based on point records. We find that, although there are differences in the effectiveness at these scales, most of the areas identified by the fine-scale data are nested within those identified by the coarse approach. We also find that areas identified as important for birds fit well within the current national focal areas for conservation in Uganda.

AB  - Walker's Manihot, Manihot walkerae, is an endangered species endemic to south Texas and northeastern Mexico and is a Crop Wild Relative (CWR) of the international and economically important crop cassava (M. esculenta). Manihot walkerae is globally endangered (IUCN's Redlist, Texas list, USA); however, it is not recognized on the Mexican list of endangered species (NOM-059-SEMARNAT). We assessed the status of M. walkerae in Mexico and re-evaluated its global status. According to our analysis, M. walkerae should be considered an endangered species based on the IUCN's assessment method and a threatened species in Mexico based on the Mexican criteria. Our findings encourage the establishment of sound conservation plans for M. walkerae along the Texas-Mexico border.

AB  - Aim: Comprehensive, global information on species' occurrences is an essential biodiversity variable and central to a range of applications in ecology, evolution, biogeography and conservation. Expert range maps often represent a species' only available distributional information and play an increasing role in conservation assessments and macroecology. We provide global range maps for the native ranges of all extant mammal species harmonised to the taxonomy of the Mammal Diversity Database (MDD) mobilised from two sources, the Handbook of the Mammals of the World (HMW) and the Illustrated Checklist of the Mammals of the World (CMW).
   Location: Global.
   Taxon: All extant mammal species.
   Methods: Range maps were digitally interpreted, georeferenced, error-checked and subsequently taxonomically aligned between the HMW (6253 species), the CMW (6431 species) and the MDD taxonomies (6362 species).
   Results: Range maps can be evaluated and visualised in an online map browser at Map of Life (mol.org) and accessed for individual or batch download for non-commercial use.
   Main conclusion: Expert maps of species' global distributions are limited in their spatial detail and temporal specificity, but form a useful basis for broad-scale characterizations and model-based integration with other data. We provide georeferenced range maps for the native ranges of all extant mammal species as shapefiles, with species-level metadata and source information packaged together in geodatabase format. Across the three taxonomic sources our maps entail, there are 1784 taxonomic name differences compared to the maps currently available on the IUCN Red List website. The expert maps provided here are harmonised to the MDD taxonomic authority and linked to a community of online tools that will enable transparent future updates and version control.

AB  - Aim Holistic marine biodiversity conservation refers to ecosystem-based management through marine conservation planning (MCP), based on mapping habitat protection priority areas. In practice, MCP is frequently hindered by information gaps in biodiversity distributions, particularly on a marine ecoregion scale. Species distribution modelling (SDM) can help to resolve this gap and provide information essential for MCP scenarios. We constructed habitat configurations for three coastal marine megafauna animals using SDM, then based MCP scenarios on the projected habitat configurations and tested the use of marine megafauna animals as surrogates to protect major ecosystems.
   Location Gulf of Thailand, Southeast Asia.
   Methods A MaxEnt model was used to project likely habitats for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) and sea turtles in the Gulf of Thailand. MARXAN software was used to prioritize spatial configurations for habitat protection. The percentage of overlaps between MARXAN delineations and major biodiversity features in the Gulf of Thailand were calculated.
   Results Habitat configurations of humpback dolphins, Irrawaddy dolphins and sea turtles were projected throughout the coastal and estuarine waters along the Gulf of Thailand. MCP based on the habitat of three marine megafauna animals highlighted five critical habitats for the protection of major ecosystems in the Gulf of Thailand.
   Main conclusions Holistic MCP starts with mapping critical habitats for marine protected area (MPA) networks, balances MPA networks with maritime livelihood activities and alleviates conflicts between MPA management and local livelihood needs. A combination of SDM and MARXAN methods provides a cost-effective approach to delineate MPA networks. In this approach, surrogate selection and data preparation should consider niches representative of regional ecosystem features and avoid spatial sampling bias. In coastal and estuarine waters, marine megafauna such as coastal cetaceans and sea turtles may serve as efficient surrogates to protect major ecosystems.

AB  - P>1. Current national and international frameworks for assessing threats to species have not been developed in the context of climate change, and are not framed in a way that recognises new opportunities that arise from climate change.
   2. The framework presented here separates the threats and benefits of climate change for individual species. Threat is assessed by the level of climate-related decline within a species' recently occupied (e.g. pre-1970s) historical distribution, based on observed (e.g. repeat census) and/or projected changes (e.g. modelled bioclimate space). Benefits are assessed in terms of observed and/or projected increases outside the recently occupied historical range.
   3. Exacerbating factors (e.g. small population size, low dispersal capacity) that might increase levels of threat or limit expansion in response to climate change are taken into consideration within the framework. Protocols are also used to identify levels of confidence (and hence research and/or monitoring needs) in each species' assessment.
   4. Observed and projected changes are combined into single measures of expected decline and increase, together with associated measures of confidence. We weight risk classifications towards information that is most certain. Each species is then placed in one of six categories (high risk, medium risk, limited impact, equivalent risks & benefits, medium benefit, high benefit) reflecting whether climate change is expected (or has been observed) to cause net declines or increases in the region considered, based on the balance of benefits and threats.
   5. We illustrate the feasibility of using the framework by applying it to (i) all British butterflies (N = 58 species) and (ii) an additional sample of British species: 18 species of plants, bats, birds and beetles.
   6. Synthesis. Our framework assesses net declines and increases associated with climate change, for individual species. It could be applied at any scale (regional, continental or global distributions of species), and complements existing conservation assessment protocols such as red-listing. Using observed and projected population and/or range data, it is feasible to carry out systematic conservation status assessments that inform the development of monitoring, adaptation measures and conservation management planning for species that are responding to climate change.

AB  - Understanding the distribution and habitat preferences of amphibians is crucial to protecting their declining populations. It remains a challenge because most species are difficult to detect, enough data on their occurrence are needed, and the contribution of climatic and habitat factors is not well known. Various modeling approaches exist both to infer habitat preferences based on known locations, and to extrapolate species geographic distributions. We used presence-only data of three anuran species from original naturalist databases covering 34,750 km(2) in the western part of France, including 660 occurrences for the Common Midwife Toad (Afytes obstetricans), 1,910 for the Spined Toad (Bufo spinosus), and 975 for the Common Brown Frog (Rana temporaria). We compared two current modeling approaches, the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) to model their potential distributions by including high resolution climate variables, and habitat and landscape variables. For each species, both analyses allowed a refined understanding of the relationships between habitat factors and the species distribution. We showed that climate and natural grasslands are key factors in explaining the species distributions and that the surrounding environment of aquatic habitats is an important driver of amphibian presence. The two models gave different predictions of distributions, which may lead to different planning of conservation areas. Our study confirms the importance of using and comparing several models, and evidenced the importance of collecting field data at a regional scale.

AB  - The habitats and food resources required to support breeding and migrant birds dependent on North American prairie wetlands are threatened by impending climate change. The North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) hosts nearly 120 species of wetland-dependent birds representing 21 families. Strategic management requires knowledge of avian habitat requirements and assessment of species most vulnerable to future threats. We applied bioclimatic species distribution models (SDMs) to project range changes of 29 wetland-dependent bird species using ensemble modeling techniques, a large number of General Circulation Models (GCMs), and hydrological climate covariates. For the U.S. PPR, mean projected range change, expressed as a proportion of currently occupied range, was -0.31 (+/- 0.22 SD; range -0.75 to 0.16), and all but two species were projected to lose habitat. Species associated with deeper water were expected to experience smaller negative impacts of climate change. The magnitude of climate change impacts was somewhat lower in this study than earlier efforts most likely due to use of different focal species, varying methodologies, different modeling decisions, or alternative GCMs. Quantification of the projected species-specific impacts of climate change using species distribution modeling offers valuable information for vulnerability assessments within the conservation planning process.

AB  - The crocodile lizard, a globally endangered species with a restricted range in southern China and northern Vietnam, is an increasingly demanded species in the international pet trade. Poaching activities brought the species to the brink of extinction, while ongoing habitat destruction represents an additional peril to the species. Especially the Vietnamese population is extremely small with a preliminary estimation of less than 100 individuals. According to predictions of the species potential distribution, we conducted targeted field surveys to search for further populations in Vietnam in order to update the species' conservation status. We could prove the practical and efficient applicability of this theoretical model by the discovery of a new population from a predicted forest site near the international border between China and Vietnam. Based on monitoring of the Vietnamese population from 2010 to 2015 we further provide an overview about current population trends, which revealed dramatic local declines of more than 50% of effective population sizes and the species' extirpation at a third of all known sites. In addition, we predicted future scenarios of suitable habitats and compared these results with actual forest cover in order to define key habitats for effective conservation measures.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning is traditionally based on biological features, sometimes representing a single biodiversity component, such as top predators. However, few studies have tested the efficiency of traditional spatial prioritizations to capture the phylogenetic and functional diversity of entire faunas. Here, we evaluated (1) the congruence among spatial prioritization analyses based on taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity for mammals and birds occurring in Brazil; and (2) the congruence among outputs of spatial priorities for carnivores and birds of prey and priorities for conserving the phylogenetic and functional diversity of all mammal and bird species. Priority sites differed among taxonomic groups as well as among biodiversity aspects, with low congruence among them. Overall, both strategies - full group and top predators - were not efficient and have not captured even half of all variation in phylogenetic and functional diversity existing in the groups. @ 2014 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

AB  - In order to understand the main ecological factors that influence the distribution of mountain vegetation in Azores and to use it as a model for nature conservation, a study on Santa Barbara Mountain on Terceira Island was performed. A multivariate analysis was done on vegetation data and the abiotic factors governing the vegetation pattern are discussed. The major factors contributing to the observed vegetation patterns are wind exposure, soil water saturation and historical human impacts. The vegetation analysis showed that Azorean Mountain habitats have a high variation of vegetation structure as a result of the habitat heterogeneity and the extreme ecological conditions. Using the co-dominant plants as indicator species, eco-zones are distinguished, characterized by the combination of different ecological-human factors which contribute to the distribution of specific types of natural vegetation communities. The studies of vegetation distribution give important information about the relation between vegetation and landscape that is essential for conservation, restoration proposals and landscape planning. Azores terrestrial Natura 2000 sites are largely dominated by mountain vegetation, therefore this work provides essential background data for the management plans of these sites.

AB  - Little is known about the potentially disrupting effects of wind farms on the habitat connectivity of flying vertebrates at the landscape scale. We developed a regional-scale model to assess the wind farm impact on bat migration and commuting routes. The model was implemented for the bat Nyctalus leisleri in a region of central Italy currently undergoing considerable wind farm development. A Species Distribution Model (SDM) for N. leisleri was generated using the MaxEnt algorithm based on 47 presence records (reduced to 19 after the autocorrelation procedure) and 10 environmental variables derived from topographic and land cover maps. We used the SDM to create a map of connectivity using the software UNICOR to identify potential commuting corridors (PCCs). The incidence of each wind farm on bat flight corridors was assessed by overlaying the existing (380) and planned (195) turbine locations onto the PCCs. The SDM was statistically robust (AUC > 0.8). Most of the corridors were concentrated in the western part of the region, which hosts the largest suitable areas for the species; most of the existing (54 %) and planned (72 %) wind farms interfered with important corridors connecting the western and the eastern parts of the region. Our results provide key information on the impact of the wind farm industry on biodiversity on a regional scale. The novel approach adopted, based on SDM and connectivity analysis, could be easily extended to other flying vertebrates and landscapes and constitutes a promising planning tool necessary for harmonizing the development of renewable energy infrastructures with issues of biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Alaskan landscapes are changing due to climate change impacts. Maintaining or restoring landscape connectivity is a widely suggested climate change adaptation strategy because species are shifting their distributions to align with emerging conditions. Natural resource managers in Alaska have an opportunity to proactively design connected landscapes as infrastructure networks and economic development continue to increase in the state.
   We provide an example of strategic, multijurisdictional planning to maintain landscape connectivity at a large spatial scale.
   We use geodiversity to model climate-resilient landscape linkages between conservation lands within and adjacent to a 59-million-acre planning area.
   The resulting landscape linkage design consists of as little as 1% of the planning area, but can connect over 64 million acres of conservation land allowing the Bureau of Land Management to leverage the current land designations to maximize the conservation value of the entire landscape.
   Maintaining landscape connectivity is above and beyond the mandates and responsibilities of a single organization or land owner. Bridging institutions and partnerships, such as the Northwest Boreal Landscape Conservation Cooperative, can facilitate the coordination needed for this type of multi-jurisdictional planning effort. The opportunity to manage proactively, rather than waiting for system degradation and then responding reactively, should not be undervalued. The implementation of this work will serve as a model for other relatively intact systems and moreover showcases the potential of twenty-first century models of conservation and sustainability.

AB  - Aim Species distribution maps are essential for assessing extinction risk and guiding conservation efforts. However, most come sourced as expert-drawn range maps with known issues of accuracy or are developed with overly complex modelling procedures. Thus, data-driven alternatives that are accessible and reliable are a welcome addition to the spatial conservation toolkit. Here, we developed a geospatial workflow to refine the distribution of a species from its extent of occurrence (EOO) to area of habitat (AOH) within the species range map. The range maps are produced with an inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation procedure using presence and absence points derived from primary biodiversity data. Location The Americas (North, South, Central America and the Caribbean). Methods As a case study, we mapped the distribution of 723 resident forest birds in the Americas and assessed their performance in comparison with expert-drawn range maps. We evaluated differences in accuracy, spatial overlap, range map size and derived AOH. Results The geospatial workflow generated IDW range maps with a higher overall accuracy (87% versus 62%) and fewer errors of omission (<1%) and commission (14%) than the expert range maps (28% both errors). The spatial overlap between both datasets was low (35%), but the agreement increased in areas of high probability of occurrence (68%). We did not find significant differences in range size, but the AOH derived from the expert-drawn range maps was consistently smaller than the estimates from the IDW range maps. Main Conclusions Our geospatial workflow provides a straightforward approach to accurately map species ranges and the estimation of area of habitat (AOH) for conservation planning and decision-making. Conversely, procedures that refine expert-drawn range maps to obtain AOH risk producing biased estimates for local-scale applications.

AB  - A precise knowledge of the spatial distribution of taxa is essential for decision-making processes in land management and biodiversity conservation, both for present and under future global change scenarios. This is a key base for several scientific disciplines (e. g. macro-ecology, biogeography, evolutionary biology, spatial planning, or environmental impact assessment) that rely on species distribution maps. An atlas summarizing the distribution of European amphibians and reptiles with 50 x 50 km resolution maps based on ca. 85 000 grid records was published by the Societas Europaea Herpetologica (SEH) in 1997. Since then, more detailed species distribution maps covering large parts of Europe became available, while taxonomic progress has led to a plethora of taxonomic changes including new species descriptions. To account for these progresses, we compiled information from different data sources: published in books and websites, ongoing national atlases, personal data kindly provided to the SEH, the 1997 European Atlas, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Databases were homogenised, deleting all information except species names and coordinates, projected to the same coordinate system (WGS84) and transformed into a 50 x 50 km grid. The newly compiled database comprises more than 384 000 grid and locality records distributed across 40 countries. We calculated species richness maps as well as maps of Corrected Weighted Endemism and defined species distribution types (i.e. groups of species with similar distribution patterns) by hierarchical cluster analysis using Jaccard's index as association measure. Our analysis serves as a preliminary step towards an interactive, dynamic and online distributed database system (NA2RE system) of the current spatial distribution of European amphibians and reptiles. The NA2RE system will serve as well to monitor potential temporal changes in their distributions. Grid maps of all species are made available along with this paper as a tool for decision-making and conservation-related studies and actions. We also identify taxonomic and geographic gaps of knowledge that need to be filled, and we highlight the need to add temporal and altitudinal data for all records, to allow tracking potential species distribution changes as well as detailed modelling of the impacts of land use and climate change on European amphibians and reptiles.

AB  - To withstand the surge of species loss worldwide, (re)introduction of endangered plant species has become an increasingly common technique in conservation biology. Successful (re)introduction plans, however, require identifying sites that provide the optimal ecological conditions for the target species to thrive. In this study, we propose a two-step approach to identify appropriate (re)introduction sites. The first step involves modeling the niche and distribution of the species with bioclimatic and topographical predictors, both at continental and at national scales. The second step consists of refining these bioclimatic predictions by analyzing stationary ecological parameters, such as soil conditions, and relating them to population-level fitness values. We demonstrate this methodology using Swiss populations of the lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus L., Orchidaceae), for which conservation plans have existed for years but have generally been unfruitful. Our workflow identified sites for future (re)introductions based on the species requirements for mid-to-sunny light conditions and specific soil physico-chemical properties, such as basic to neutral pH and low soil organic matter content. Our findings show that by combining wide-scale bioclimatic modeling with fine scale field measurements it is possible to carefully identify the ecological requirements of a target species for successful (re)introductions.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are essential for safeguarding marine biodiversity. Various international and regional agreements require that nations designate sufficient marine areas under protection. Assessing the functionality and coherence of MPA networks is challenging, unless extensive data on species and habitats is available. We evaluated the efficiency of the Finnish MPA network by utilizing a unique dataset of similar to 140,000 samples, recently collected by the Finnish Inventory Programme for the Underwater Marine Environment, VELMU. Using the quantitative conservation planning and the spatial prioritization method Zonation, we identified sites of high biodiversity and developed a balanced ranking of marine conservation values. Only 27% of the ecologically most valuable features were covered by the current MPA network. Based on the analyses, a set of expansion sites were identified that efficiently complement the ecological and geographical gaps in the current MPA network. Increasing protected sea area by just one percent point, would double the mean conservation cover, and specifically increase the protection levels of habitat types based on IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, key species, threatened species and fish reproduction areas. We also discovered that a large part of ecologically valuable species, such as many brown and red algae, blue mussels and eelgrass, exist in the underwater parts of rocky islands and sandy shores. These areas do not belong to the present (Finnish) interpretation of the habitats (e.g., reefs and underwater sandbanks) listed in the EU Habitats Directive. Neglecting these environments may lead to lack of protection of functionally important biodiversity. We emphasize that, in addition to establishing MPAs, also ecosystembased marine spatial planning is needed to safeguard the integrity of marine biodiversity in the northern Baltic Sea. The spatial prioritization maps produced in this study are essentially environmental value maps which can also be used in impact avoidance, such as siting of wind energy and aquaculture, or in avoiding overfishing in the most valuable fish areas. Our approach and analytical procedure can be replicated in the Baltic Sea or elsewhere provided that sufficient data exist.

AB  - Species are predicted to shift their geographic range with climate change, which increases the need for good conservation planning and management practices. Not only may climate change increase the number of invasive species in parts of the world, it may also lead to some species becoming invasive under new, more preferable, climatic conditions. This study investigates whether climate change may enhance the spread of alien species by another alien species. I use the interaction between the alien slender-billed nutcracker and alien, potentially invasive, stone pines as a case-study and specifically aim to quantify to which extent the potential spread of stone pine species in Sweden in a warming climate is augmented by its dispersal agent: the slender-billed nutcracker. I found that accounting for the future climatic niche of the slender-billed nutcracker, and therefore for its potential presence, significantly augmented the increase of the predicted future range of the stone pines under climate change. This result does not only stress the importance of accounting for species interactions when assessing the impact of climate change on species' future geographic ranges, it also stresses the need for nature conservationists and managers to incorporate species interactions and climate change when designing appropriate plans with regard to invasive species. Although the implications of the predicted future spread of the slender-billed nutcracker might be limited, since the very similar thick-billed nutcracker is native to Sweden, the effects of the stone pines should not be neglected. They are currently classified as potentially invasive in parts of the Nordic region.

AB  - Gap analysis is a tool that allows conservationists to quantify the effectiveness of protected areas at representing species diversity, but the lack of distribution maps for invertebrates has precluded its application to the world's most diverse animal groups. Here, we overcome this limitation and conduct a gap analysis, using niche modelling, on the Pterostichini (Coleoptera: Carabidae) of New Zealand, one of the most diverse and most threatened tribes of ground beetles in the nation. Niche modelling uses data on abiotic parameters to model predicted species ranges based on records of their known distribution, and is a useful tool for conservation planning. This method is widely applicable where there is good taxonomical knowledge of the group in question and distribution records are available. We obtained sample localities from museum records for 67 species of Pterostichini, including 10 species listed as threatened, and modelled their spatial distributions based on climate, landforms and soil properties. Most species had small spatial distributions, with 48-75% of species having ranges of less than 100 000 ha. We found the areas with highest species richness fell largely outside of the protected area network, as did the distribution of most individual species, with just 20-25% of species having more than 30% of their range falling within a protected area. In terms of percent land area, New Zealand has one of the world's largest protected area networks, but the spatial distribution of that network affords little protection to this group of invertebrates. This analysis provides support for the creation of new reserves to increase the value and efficacy of the protected areas network.

AB  - Predictive modelling of species' distributions has been successfully applied in conservation ecology, but effective conservation requires predictive and accurate models. The combination of different scales to build habitat models might improve their predictive ability and hence their usefulness for conservation, but this approach has rarely been evaluated. We developed habitat-occupancy models combining scales from nest-site to landscape for a key population at the northwestern edge of the distribution of the globally endangered Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus). We used generalised linear models (GLM) and an information-theoretic approach to identify the best combination of scales and resolutions for explaining occurrence. Those models that combined nest-site and landscape scales improved the predictive ability compared with the scale-specific ones. The best combined model had a very high predictive ability when used against an independent dataset (92% correct classifications). Egyptian vultures preferred to nest in caves with vegetation at the entrance that were situated at the base of long cliffs, provided that these cliffs are embedded within low-lying, heterogeneous areas with little topographic irregularity and with little human disturbance. The density of sheep around the nest positively influenced Egyptian Vulture presence. Conservation of the studied population should focus on minimising human disturbance and on promoting sustainable development through conservation of traditional pastoralism. Our findings highlight the importance of developing region-specific multiscale models in order to design effective conservation strategies. The approach described here may be applied similarly in other Populations and species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The application of species distribution models (SDMs) in ecology and conservation biology is increasing and assuming an important role, mainly because they can be used to hindcast past and predict current and future species distributions. However, the accuracy of SDMs depends on the quality of the data and on appropriate theoretical frameworks. In this study, comprehensive data on the current distribution of the Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis) were used to i) determine the species' ecogeographical constraints, ii) hindcast a climatic model for the last glacial maximum (LGM), relating it to inferences derived from molecular studies, and iii) calibrate a model to assess the species future distribution trends (up to 2080). Our results showed that the climatic factor (in its pure effect and when it is combined with the land-cover factor) is the most important descriptor of the current distribution of the Iberian hare. In addition, the model's output was a reliable index of the local probability of species occurrence, which is a valuable tool to guide species management decisions and conservation planning. Climatic potential obtained for the LGM was combined with molecular data and the results suggest that several glacial refugia may have existed for the species within the major Iberian refugium. Finally, a high probability of occurrence of the Iberian hare in the current species range and a northward expansion were predicted for future. Given its current environmental envelope and evolutionary history, we discuss the macroecology of the Iberian hare and its sensitivity to climate change.

AB  - Aim Fire is a major driver of ecosystem structure and process, and shifts in fire regimes are implicated in the decline of many species. Shifting fire regimes have been documented around the world, and fire frequency and extent is predicted to increase in many areas because of changes in both climate and land management. Here, we evaluate how predicted increases in fire frequency are likely to impact on species distributions.
   Location The tropical savannas of northern Australia.
   Methods We developed distribution models for 44 bird species using the modelling algorithm Maxent. Our models incorporated bird locality records and environmental variables including climate, total fire frequency and the subset of fire frequency occurring late in the dry season. We investigated the effect of increasing total fire frequency and increasing fire late in the dry season, on species distributions by projecting species model algorithms onto scenarios of incrementally increased total fire frequency.
   Results The probability of presence for most species was higher when fire frequency late in the dry season was low. Species showed a mixed response to an overall increase in total fire frequency, with one-third predicted to increase in distribution. However, almost all species (98%) showed a decrease in predicted range with increased late-dry season fire, and species distribution area was generally negatively correlated with an increase in late-dry season fire.
   Main conclusions Our study highlighted the array of responses of species to increasing fire frequency and suggested that increased fire frequency late in the dry season is detrimental to most savanna-restricted bird species. The understanding of individual species' preferences for particular fire frequencies is important for informed conservation planning.

AB  - Knowledge of the environmental correlates of species' distributions is essential for understanding population dynamics, responses to environmental changes, biodiversity patterns, and the impacts of conservation plans. Here we examine how environment controls the distribution of the neotropical genus Montrichardia at regional and local spatial scales using species distribution models (SDMs) and logistic regression, respectively. Montrichardia is a genus of aquatic macrophytes with two species, Montrichardia linifera and Montrichardia arborescens, and is often an important component of flooded habitats. We find that for each species, altitude, precipitation and temperature of the driest month figure in the best performing SDMs as the most important factors controlling large-scale distributions, suggesting that the range limits of both species are climatically constrained by plant water-energy balance and cold intolerance. At small spatial scales, logistic regression models indicate the species partition types of aquatic habitat along local gradients of water pH, conductivity, and water transparency. In summary, a hierarchy of factors may control Montrichardia distribution from large to small spatial scales. While at large spatial scales, evolutionarily conserved climatic niches may control the range limits of the genus, at small spatial scales niche differentiation allows individual species to grow in environmentally distinct aquatic habitats.

AB  - Limited by the availability of data, conservation planners must use surrogates for biodiversity when selecting conservation areas. Although several methods have been proposed for selecting surrogates, no clear set of species attributes have been described that allow for the efficient a priori selection of surrogate groups. We used a database of 1449 species in two regions of the United States to (1) examine the consistency in the performance of simple taxonomic-based surrogates of biodiversity and (2) test five hypotheses proposed to explain surrogate performance. First, we compared the ability of sites selected to protect members of seven surrogate groups to protect non-surrogate species in the north-western United States and in the Middle-Atlantic region of the eastern United States. Then, in a separate analysis, we tested whether surrogate performance could be explained by (1) taxonomic diversity; (2) nested species distributions; (3) hotspots of biodiversity; (4) species range sizes; (5) environmental diversity. Our first analysis revealed little consistency in the performance of surrogates in the two different study regions. For example, butterflies provided protection for 76% of all other species in the north-western United States but only 56% of all other species in the eastern United States. Our second analysis revealed only weak associations between species characteristics and surrogate performance. Furthermore, these associations proved inadequate for selecting successful surrogates across study regions. Overall, our results suggest that in lieu of searching for optimal surrogate groups, research efforts will be better spent by developing alternative methods for assessing conservation value in areas where data on species distributions are limited.

AB  - The assessment of population vulnerability under climate change is crucial for planning conservation as well as for ensuring food security. Coffea canephora is, in its native habitat, an understorey tree that is mainly distributed in the lowland rainforests of tropical Africa. Also known as Robusta, its commercial value constitutes a significant revenue for many human populations in tropical countries. Comparing ecological and genomic vulnerabilities within the species' native range can provide valuable insights about habitat loss and the species' adaptive potential, allowing to identify genotypes that may act as a resource for varietal improvement. By applying species distribution models, we assessed ecological vulnerability as the decrease in climatic suitability under future climatic conditions from 492 occurrences. We then quantified genomic vulnerability (or risk of maladaptation) as the allelic composition change required to keep pace with predicted climate change. Genomic vulnerability was estimated from genomic environmental correlations throughout the native range. Suitable habitat was predicted to diminish to half its size by 2050, with populations near coastlines and around the Congo River being the most vulnerable. Whole-genome sequencing revealed 165 candidate SNPs associated with climatic adaptation in C. canephora, which were located in genes involved in plant response to biotic and abiotic stressors. Genomic vulnerability was higher for populations in West Africa and in the region at the border between DRC and Uganda. Despite an overall low correlation between genomic and ecological vulnerability at broad scale, these two components of vulnerability overlap spatially in ways that may become damaging. Genomic vulnerability was estimated to be 23% higher in populations where habitat will be lost in 2050 compared to regions where habitat will remain suitable. These results highlight how ecological and genomic vulnerabilities are relevant when planning on how to cope with climate change regarding an economically important species.

AB  - AimAdvancement in ecological methods predicting species distributions is a crucial precondition for deriving sound management actions. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models are a popular tool to predict species distributions, as they are considered able to cope well with sparse, irregularly sampled data and minor location errors. Although a fundamental assumption of MaxEnt is that the entire area of interest has been systematically sampled, in practice, MaxEnt models are usually built from occurrence records that are spatially biased towards better-surveyed areas. Two common, yet not compared, strategies to cope with uneven sampling effort are spatial filtering of occurrence data and background manipulation using environmental data with the same spatial bias as occurrence data. We tested these strategies using simulated data and a recently collated dataset on Malay civet Viverra tangalunga in Borneo.
   LocationBorneo, Southeast Asia.
   MethodsWe collated 504 occurrence records of Malay civets from Borneo of which 291 records were from 2001 to 2011 and used them in the MaxEnt analysis (baseline scenario) together with 25 environmental input variables. We simulated datasets for two virtual species (similar to a range-restricted highland and a lowland species) using the same number of records for model building. As occurrence records were biased towards north-eastern Borneo, we investigated the efficacy of spatial filtering versus background manipulation to reduce overprediction or underprediction in specific areas.
   ResultsSpatial filtering minimized omission errors (false negatives) and commission errors (false positives). We recommend that when sample size is insufficient to allow spatial filtering, manipulation of the background dataset is preferable to not correcting for sampling bias, although predictions were comparatively weak and commission errors increased.
   Main ConclusionsWe conclude that a substantial improvement in the quality of model predictions can be achieved if uneven sampling effort is taken into account, thereby improving the efficacy of species conservation planning.

AB  - Headwater species and peripheral populations that occupy habitat at the edge of a species range may hold an increased conservation value to managers due to their potential to maximize intraspecies diversity and species' adaptive capabilities in the context of rapid environmental change. The southern Appalachian Mountains are the southern extent of the geographic range of native Salvelinus fontinalis and naturalized Oncorhynchus mykiss and Salmo trutta in eastern North America. We predicted distributions of these peripheral, headwater wild trout populations at a fine scale to serve as a planning and management tool for resource managers to maximize resistance and resilience of these populations in the face of anthropogenic stressors. We developed correlative logistic regression models to predict occurrence of brook trout, rainbow trout, and brown trout for every interconfluence stream reach in the study area. A streamnetwork was generated to capture a more consistent representation of headwater streams. Each of the final models had four significant metrics in common: stream order, fragmentation, precipitation, and land cover. Strahler stream order was found to be the most influential variable in two of the three final models and the second most influential variable in the other model. Greater than 70% presence accuracy was achieved for all three models. The underrepresentation of headwater streams in commonly used hydrography datasets is an important consideration that warrants close examination when forecasting headwater species distributions and range estimates. Additionally, it appears that a relative watershed position metric (e.g., stream order) is an important surrogate variable (even when elevation is included) for biotic interactions across the landscape in areas where headwater species distributions are influenced by topographical gradients.

AB  - A large amount of data for inconspicuous taxa is stored in natural history collections; however, this information is often neglected for biodiversity patterns studies. Here, we evaluate the performance of direct interpolation of museum collections data, equivalent to the traditional approach used in bryophyte conservation planning, and stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) to produce reliable reconstructions of species richness patterns, given that differences between these methods have been insufficiently evaluated for inconspicuous taxa. Our objective was to contrast if species distribution models produce better inferences of diversity richness than simply selecting areas with the higher species numbers. As model species, we selected Iberian species of the genus Grimmia (Bryophyta), and we used four well-collected areas to compare and validate the following models: 1) four Maxent richness models, each generated without the data from one of the four areas, and a reference model created using all of the data and 2) four richness models obtained through direct spatial interpolation, each generated without the data from one area, and a reference model created with all of the data. The correlations between the partial and reference Maxent models were higher in all cases (0.45 to 0.99), whereas the correlations between the spatial interpolation models were negative and weak (-0.3 to -0.06). Our results demonstrate for the first time that S-SDMs offer a useful tool for identifying detailed richness patterns for inconspicuous taxa such as bryophytes and improving incomplete distributions by assessing the potential richness of under-surveyed areas, filling major gaps in the available data. In addition, the proposed strategy would enhance the value of the vast number of specimens housed in biological collections.

AB  - Effective conservation planning often requires difficult decisions when at-risk species inhabit economically valuable landscapes or if the needs of multiple threatened species do not align. In the agriculture-dominated landscape of eastern Ontario and southwestern Quebec, Canada, conflicting habitat requirements exist between threatened grassland birds benefiting from certain agriculture practices, and those of a diverse woodland bird community dependent on forest recovery. Using multi-scale species distribution models with data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), we assessed habitat suitability for 8 threatened grassland and forest specialists within this region. We also identified landscapes that jointly maximize occurrence of the 8 focal species and diversity of the full avian community. Influential habitat associations differed among species at the territory (200 m radius) and landscape level (1 km), highlighting the importance of considering multiple spatial scales. Species diversity was maximized when forest or grassland/pasture cover approached 40-50%, indicating a positive response to land cover heterogeneity. We identified species diversity hotspots near Lake Huron, as well as along the shore and southeast of the St. Lawrence River. These areas represent mosaic landscapes, balancing forest patches, wetland, grassland/pasture, and row crops such as corn, soybean, and cereals. Despite drastic landscape changes associated with agroecosystems, we demonstrate that targeted habitat protection and enhancement that prioritizes land cover diversity can maximize protection of bird communities with directly contrasting needs. We highlight multiple pathways to achieve this balance, including forest retention or separating row crops with hedgerows and wooded fence-lines, improving flexibility in conservation approaches.

AB  - Trade of non-native reptiles is an important and increasing driver of biodiversity loss and often compromises the standards required for protection. However, the growing interest in non-native reptiles as pets has posed serious concerns to wildlife managers and conservationists. Instituting effective policies regarding non-native reptiles requires a thorough understanding of the potential range of species in new environments. In this study, we used an ensemble of ten species distribution models to predict the potential distribution for 23 of the most commonly traded species of reptiles across the Middle East. We used ten modeling techniques implemented in the Biomod2 package and ensemble forecasts. Final models used thirty environmental variables, including climatic, topographic, and land cover/land use variables. Our results indicate that all Middle Eastern countries included suitable habitats for at least six species, except Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain, for which the models did not predict any suitable habitats. Our study showed that Lebanon, Palestine, Turkey, and Israel face the highest risk of biological invasion based on the area of suitable habitats for all studied species. Also, the results showed that turtles posed the highest risk of spreading in the Middle East. Information on which species pose a greater danger as invaders and the possible impacts of their introduction will be a valuable contribution to the development of conservation plans and policies.

AB  - Implementation of effective conservation planning relies on a robust understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of the target species. In the marine realm, this is even more challenging for species rarely seen at the sea surface due to their extreme diving behavior like the sperm whales. Our study aims at (a) investigating the seasonal movements, (b) predicting the potential distribution, and (c) assessing the diel vertical behavior of this species in the Mascarene Archipelago in the south-west Indian Ocean. Using 21 satellite tracks of sperm whales and eight environmental predictors, 14 supervised machine learning algorithms were tested and compared to predict the whales' potential distribution during the wet and dry season, separately. Fourteen of the whales remained in close proximity to Mauritius, while a migratory pattern was evidenced with a synchronized departure for eight females that headed towards Rodrigues Island. The best performing algorithm was the random forest, showing a strong affinity of the whales for sea surface height during the wet season and for bottom temperature during the dry season. A more dispersed distribution was predicted during the wet season, whereas a more restricted distribution to Mauritius and Reunion waters was found during the dry season, probably related to the breeding period. A diel pattern was observed in the diving behavior, likely following the vertical migration of squids. The results of our study fill a knowledge gap regarding seasonal movements and habitat affinities of this vulnerable species, for which a regional IUCN assessment is still missing in the Indian Ocean. Our findings also confirm the great potential of machine learning algorithms in conservation planning and provide highly reproductible tools to support dynamic ocean management.

AB  - Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) is one of the modelling techniques most recently applied to biodiversity conservation and it can be implemented with presence-only data through the generation of artificial absences (pseudo-absences). In this paper, three pseudo-absences generation techniques are compared, namely the generation of pseudo-absences within target-group background (TGB), testing both the weighted (WTGB) and unweighted (UTGB) scheme, and the generation at random (RDM), evaluating their performance and applicability in distribution modelling and species conservation. The choice of the target group fell on amphibians, because of their rapid decline worldwide and the frequent lack of guidelines for conservation strategies and regional-scale planning, which instead could be provided through an appropriate implementation of SDMs. Bufo bufo, Salamandrina perspicillata and Triturus camifex were considered as target species, in order to perform our analysis with species having different ecological and distributional characteristics. The study area is the "Gran Sasso-Monti della Laga" National Park, which hosts 15 Natura 2000 sites and represents one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in Europe. Our results show that the model calibration ameliorates when using the target-group based pseudo-absences compared to the random ones, especially when applying the WTGB. Contrarily, model discrimination did not significantly vary in a consistent way among the three approaches with respect to the tree target species. Both WTGB and RDM clearly isolate the highly contributing variables, supplying many relevant indications for species conservation actions. Moreover, the assessment of pairwise variable interactions and their three-dimensional visualization further increase the amount of useful information for protected areas' managers. Finally, we suggest the use of RDM as an admissible alternative when it is not possible to individuate a suitable set of species as a representative target-group from which the pseudo-absences can be generated.

AB  - Aim We address the unexplored question of whether the lack of information on intra-specific diversity inherent in species-level niche modelling might bias evaluation of the conservation requirements of species and phylogeographic lineages under changing climates. We test for directional biases that might arise due to these methodological differences in ways of assessing risks from climate change. Location The African continent. Methods We identified from peer-reviewed studies that used both nuclear and plastid markers the distribution of deep phylogeographic divisions within nine species of African mammals and their phylogeographic lineages. We fitted ecological niche models to describe currently suitable, occupied climates and to project the shift of suitable climate to two future time slices. We applied gap analysis to reveal potential changes in the protection of phylogeographic diversity owing to climatic shifts. Results We found that, within species, most phylogeographic lineages differ in the climates they experience and have substantial geographic separation. Models that do not distinguish these subspecific units often fail to identify potential risks of climate change to lineages. Modelled potential effects of climate change on the geographic extent of suitable climate vary in both direction and magnitude. Predictions of the persistence of suitable climate in current protected areas for the resident lineages differ on average by factor of 2 between species and lineage models. Main conclusions Our study develops an original synthetic approach by combining niche modelling, projected climate change, phylogeographic information and gap analysis. We clearly identify the potential benefits of using the new approach to evaluate risks to the conservation of intra-specific genetic diversity that are posed by climate change. Our results suggest that prudent conservation strategies need to incorporate potential differences in climate tolerance among lineages when planning conservation measures for species confronted with environmental change.

AB  - Modelling the spatial distribution of multi-habitat species is challenging since they show multi-dimensional environmental responses that may vary sharply through habitats. Hence, for these species, the achievement of realistic models useful in conservation planning may depend on the appropriate consideration of habitat information in model calibration. We aimed to evaluate the role of different types of habitat predictors, along with habitat-partitioning, to improve model inference, detect non-stationary responses across habitats and simulate the impact of sampling bias on spatial predictions. As a case study, we modelled the occurrence of the multi-habitat plant species bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) in the Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain), where it represents a basic trophic resource for threatened brown bear and capercaillie. We used MaxEnt to compare a baseline model approach calibrated with topo-climatic variables against three alternative approaches using explicit habitat information based on vegetation maps and remote sensing data. For each approach, we ran non-partitioned (all habitats together) and habitat-partitioned models (one per habitat) and evaluated model performance, overfitting and extrapolation. The highest performance was for habitat-partitioned models including habitat predictors. The lowest overfitting was for the baseline non-partitioned model, at the cost of achieving the highest predicted fractional area. The extrapolation success of habitat-partitioned models was low, with the highest performance for the baseline approach. Our results highlight that multi-habitat species responses are non-stationary across habitats, with habitat-biased data resulting in weak spatial predictions. When modelling the distribution of multi-habitat species at regional scale, we recommend using habitat-partitioned models including habitat predictors, either vegetation maps or remote sensing data, to improve the realism of spatial outputs and its applicability in regional conservation planning.

AB  - Although the European Pond Turtle (Emys orbicularis) attracts considerable conservation efforts across its distribution range, in Serbia, it is understudied and assessed as Data Deficient at the national level. We surveyed approximately 10% of the territory of Serbia and noted turtles at 76 separate 10 x 10 km MGRS squares, 43 of which were noted for the first time. Turtles were usually observed in oxbows, scattered small water bodies, canals and in water-filled and vegetated, abandoned gravel pits. Models with these accurate distribution data and set of climate, topographic and land cover variables are used to explain the turtle's ecological niche and predict where the species presence is to be expected in Serbia. In Vojvodina, turtles are limited to industrial, urban and semi-natural habitats not used for agriculture, while in the rest of Serbia it occurs in more natural habitats and small scale agriculture practice even seems to be preferred. Further studies are necessary for adequate management planning and effective protection of E. orbicularis in Serbia. More data on distribution need to be collected, especially in central and southern Serbia. Conservation efforts should focus to prevent illegal collection of turtles and destruction of their habitats i.e. should control illegal dumping places and overusing of agriculture machinery and chemicals.

AB  - We assessed the vulnerability of 208 endemic or endangered species in China to the effects of climate change, as a part of the project "Research on China's National Biodiversity and Climate Change Strategy and Action Plans". Based on the China Species Information System, we selected comprehensive species as analysis targets, covering taxa including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and plants. We applied nine species distribution models in BIOMOD (a package of R software) to estimate the current (1991-2010) ranges and predicted future (2081-2100) ranges of these species, using six climate variables based on Regional Climate Model version 3 (RegCM3) and A1B emission scenario. The model results showed that different taxa might show diverse potential range shifts over time. The range sizes of half of the species (104 species) would decrease, and those of another half would increase. We predicted that the future remaining ranges (intersection of current and future ranges/current ranges) of 135 species would be less than 50 % of their current range sizes. Species that are both endemic and critically endangered would lose more of their range than others. In summary, the most vulnerable species are currently found on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, in the Hengduan Mountain Range, and southern China. Future action plans dealing with climate change in China should be prepared with consideration for vulnerable species and their habitats.

AB  - Species can respond to climate change by tracking appropriate environmental conditions in space, resulting in a range shift. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) can help forecast such range shift responses. For few species, both correlative and mechanistic SDMs were built, but allis shad (Alosa alosa), an endangered anadromous fish species, is one of them. The main purpose of this study was to provide a framework for joint analyses of correlative and mechanistic SDMs projections in order to strengthen conservation measures for species of conservation concern. Guidelines for joint representation and subsequent interpretation of models outputs were defined and applied. The present joint analysis was based on the novel mechanistic model GR3D (Global Repositioning Dynamics of Diadromous fish Distribution) which was parameterized on allis shad and then used to predict its future distribution along the European Atlantic coast under different climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). We then used a correlative SDM for this species to forecast its distribution across the same geographic area and under the same climate change scenarios. First, projections from correlative and mechanistic models provided congruent trends in probability of habitat suitability and population dynamics. This agreement was preferentially interpreted as referring to the species vulnerability to climate change. Climate change could not be accordingly listed as a major threat for allis shad. The congruence in predicted range limits between SDMs projections was the next point of interest. The difference, when noticed, required to deepen our understanding of the niche modelled by each approach. In this respect, the relative position of the northern range limit between the two methods strongly suggested here that a key biological process related to intraspecific variability was potentially lacking in the mechanistic SDM. Based on our knowledge, we hypothesized that local adaptations to cold temperatures deserved more attention in terms of modelling, but further in conservation planning as well.

AB  - Understanding cetacean distribution is essential for conservation planning and decision-making, particularly in regions subject to rapid environmental changes. Nevertheless, information on their spatiotemporal distribution is commonly limited, especially from remote areas. Species distribution models (SDMs) are powerful tools, relating species occurrences to environmental variables to predict the species' potential distribution. This study aims at using presence-only SDMs (MaxEnt) to identify suitable habitats for fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) on their Nordic and Barents Seas feeding grounds. We used spatial-block cross-validation to tune MaxEnt parameters and evaluate model performance using spatially independent testing data. We considered spatial sampling bias correction using four methods. Important environmental variables were distance to shore and sea ice edge, variability of sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity, and depth. Suitable fin whale habitats were predicted along the west coast of Svalbard, between Svalbard and the eastern Norwegian Sea, coastal areas off Iceland and southern East Greenland, and along the Knipovich Ridge to Jan Mayen. Results support that presence-only SDMs are effective tools to predict cetacean habitat suitability, particularly in remote areas like the Arctic Ocean.

AB  - The expansion of protected areas is a critical component of strategies to promote the continued existence of biodiversity (i.e., life at all levels of biological organization) as climate changes, but scientific, social, and economic uncertainties associated with climate change are some of the major obstacles preventing such expansion. New models of climate change and species distribution and new methods of conservation planning now make it possible to explore the uncertainties associated with climate changes and species responses. Yet few reliable estimates of the costs of expanding protected areas and methods for determining these costs exist, largely because of the many (and uncertain) determinants of these costs. We developed a cost-accounting model to estimate the range in costs of various options for expanding protected areas and to explore the variables that drive these costs. Model development was informed by an existing plan to expand protected areas in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa to address species conservation under a scenario of climate change. The 50-year present value of total costs varied from US$260 million ($1077/ha) for an off-reserve option that involves agreements with landowners and no compensation of forgone production and associated revenue to $1020 million ($4228/ha) for an on-reserve option that involves land acquisition and protection. The costs of acquiring land or compensating landowners for forgone production and development opportunities were the major drivers of the total costs across all options because most of the area identified in the protected-area expansion plan consisted of urban and high-quality agricultural lands. Total costs were also affected by changes in protected area extent and discount rate. Model-generated outputs such as these may be useful for informing implementation strategies and the allocation of future efforts in monitoring, data collection, and model development.

AB  - Extrapolation of local abundance-environment relationships to broader scales provides species distribution models used for conservation planning. We investigated the importance of environmental heterogeneity and geographic distance on pteridophyte species spatial distribution on 38 plots of 250 x 2.5 m distributed over 90 km(2) in Central Amazon. Inclusion of canopy openness in our models increased the capacity of predicting community composition even under the narrow range of canopy openness found in our plots. Nevertheless, there was still a large amount of unexplained variance (55-65%). The response of the community to the light gradient was hierarchical and we did not find evidences of light partitioning. Most species were concentrated in low light plots but a few common and abundant occurred along the entire gradient. Soil properties were the major determinants of community composition. Contrary to similar studies, slope was not a good predictor of pteridophyte community composition, indicating that this relationship may be site-specific. There was no correlation between floristic distances and geographic distances. We concluded that mesoscale turnover is low, although locally environmental variation determines high turnover of species. Studies among different Amazonian physiognomies tend to find high levels of beta-diversity. However, coarse comparisons can not reveal subtle patterns that are relevant for biodiversity conservation planning. This study found some important changes on pteridophyte community within the same type of forest, mainly related to environmental heterogeneity, even in narrow ranges of environmental variation.

AB  - Species distribution modelling (SDM) can help conservation by providing information on the ecological requirements of species at risk. We developed habitat suitability models at multiple spatial scales for a threatened freshwater turtle, Emydoidea blandingii, in Ontario as a case study. We also explored the effect of background data selection and modelling algorithm selection on habitat suitability predictions. We used sighting records, high-resolution land cover data (25 m), and two SDM techniques: boosted regression trees; and maximum entropy modelling. The area under the receiver characteristic operating curve (AUC) for habitat suitability models tested on independent data ranged from 0.878 to 0.912 when using random background and from 0.727 to 0.741 with target-group background. E. blandingii habitat suitability was best predicted by air temperature, wetland area, open water area, road density, and cropland area. Habitat suitability increased with increasing air temperature and wetland area, and decreased with increasing cropland area. Low road density and open water increased habitat suitability, while high levels of either variable decreased habitat suitability. Robust habitat suitability maps for species at risk require using a multi-scale and multi-algorithm approach. If well used, SDM can offer insight on the habitat requirements of species at risk and help guide the development of management plans. Our results suggest that E. blandingii management plans should promote the protection of terrestrial habitat surrounding residential wetlands, halt the building of roads within and adjacent to currently occupied habitat, and identify movement corridors for isolated populations.

AB  - In this study, we propose the use of a favourability function to perform Gap Analysis. To exemplify this, we modelled the distribution of terrestrial mammal species in Andalusia (South of Spain) on the basis of their presence/absence on a grid of 10 km x 10 km UTM cells (n = 961). Using logistic regression and 30 variables related with the environment, space and human influence, we obtained probabilities of occurrence for each species in each cell. We computed a crisp favourability index considering the areas as favourable or unfavourable for a species if the probability of occurrence was higher or lower than the species prevalence, respectively. We also used a favourability function and fuzzy logic to level all species to the same threshold of favourability, which allowed to compare and to combine species distributions. Adding up the fuzzy favourability values for each species in each cell we obtained a fuzzy favourability index that we compared with species richness (sum of species in each cell) and with the crisp favourability index. We performed Gap Analysis by overlapping these results with the current reserve network of Andalusia. Gaps were grouped in fewer and bigger zones after applying the favourability indices. Considerations and recommendations for the use of the favourability function to select areas of conservation interest are discussed.

AB  - Climate change affects plant phenology, spatial distribution, and even extinction of vulnerable species. Dipterocarpus turbinatus, locally known as garjan, is a valuable but vulnerable native tree species of Bangladesh whose spatial distribution under future climate change scenarios is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of present and future climatic scenarios on spatiotemporal distribution of D. turbinatus. We used maximum entropy species distribution modeling to perform the present and future habitat suitability of garjan under different climate scenarios. The representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 were considered for bioclimatic variables from the Global Climate Model - Hadley Global Environment Model 2 Atmosphere-Ocean. The predictive accuracy of the model was more than 97% in both the training and test data. The prediction results suggest that compared to present areas (7624 km(2)) under moderate habitat class it will be 2755 km(2) and 1239 km(2), respectively, in 2050 and 2070 under RCP2.6 scenario and decreases more rapidly under RCP8.5 scenario. Besides, the prediction also indicates that the habitat of the species will shift toward the high altitudinal south-eastern corner of the country whereas local extinction might occur in the north-eastern part during 2070.

AB  - Lack of biodiversity data is a major impediment to prioritizing sites for species representation. Because comprehensive species data are not available in any planning area, planners often use surrogates (such as vegetation communities, or mapped occurrences of a well-inventoried taxon) to prioritize sites. We propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of predicted rarity-weighted richness (PRWR) as a surrogate in situations where species inventories may be available for a portion of the planning area. Use of PRWR as a surrogate involves several steps. First, rarity-weighted richness (RWR) is calculated from species inventories for a q% subset of sites. Then random forest models are used to model RWR as a function of freely available environmental variables for that q% subset. This function is then used to calculate PRWR for all sites (including those for which no species inventories are available), and PRWR is used to prioritize all sites. We tested PRWR on plant and bird datasets, using the species accumulation index to measure efficiency of PRWR. Sites with the highest PRWR represented species with median efficiency of 56% (range 32%-77% across six datasets) when q = 20%, and with median efficiency of 39% (range 20%-63%) when q = 10%. An efficiency of 56% means that selecting sites in order of PRWR rank was 56% as effective as having full knowledge of species distributions in PRWR's ability to improve on the number of species represented in the same number of randomly selected sites. Our results suggest that PRWR may be able to help prioritize sites to represent species if a planner has species inventories for 10%-20% of the sites in the planning area.

AB  - Genetic characterization of species using phylogeographic approaches represents a basic reference to understand their evolutionary history as well as to identify conservation priorities to protect areas of particular interest regarding evolutionary potential. Even in well-studied regions such information is lacking for the majority of species, including many endemic species with reduced distribution ranges. We investigate the phylogeographic pattern of the Iberian frog Rana iberica, an endemic amphibian restricted to Central and North-Western Iberian Peninsula. Using mitochondrial sequences, we reconstruct the phylogeographic history of the species to test the effect of Quaternary climate changes on the evolutionary diversification of lineages, that is, the differentiation of mitochondrial lineages and the formation of genetic diversity melting pots, and integrate phylogeographic evidence for future conservation planning. Our results indicate the existence of 3 main mitochondrial lineages differentiated during the Upper Pleistocene. Both historical demographic analyses and climatic niche modeling show a strong effect of glacial climate changes, suggesting recurrent range contractions and expansions. Under such circumstances, differentiation took place most likely by isolation in allopatric interglacial refugia. Secondary lineage admixture in northern Portugal generated a broad mixed zone with highest nucleotide diversity. Given its particular evolutionary potential, its reduced distribution and eventual threats under current climate change scenario, conservation priorities should focus on the isolated lineage from Sierra de Guadalupe.

AB  - Modelling and mapping habitat suitability of species in a given study area has become a popular method to assess biogeographical questions on the habitat requirements of species, and to study the effects of land use or climate change on species distributions. Beside purely academic aims, model projections are increasingly used for devising conservation and management strategies and they are an established tool in conservation planning. Species distribution models (SDMs) link geographic presence records of species with environmental conditions found at these locations, and extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of species throughout the study area. While the modelling framework is similar in the terrestrial, marine and freshwater realms, each realm comprises specific challenges for combining the spatial scale, the environmental data and the species records for building reliable models. In this paper, we focus on these key issues from a stream ecology perspective and highlight three critical challenges to be kept in mind when building SDMs in stream ecosystems: (1) the spatial configuration in terms of the hierarchical structure of catchments and dendritic stream networks; (2) obtaining relevant and spatially continuous environmental predictors along the stream network, sourcing from three interfaces (stream vs. atmosphere, catchment area, groundwater) and (3) species detectability and thus the challenge of obtaining freshwater species occurrence data along the stream network. To depict freshwater species distributions at the stream level in the best possible way, multi-scale models are recommended, which account for scale dependence, a stronger integration of various environmental data types and sources, and heterogeneous species data. While model projections have the potential to serve as reliable tools for conservation and management purposes, this is only true if these relevant factors are considered in the modelling framework.

AB  - Over the last decades agroforestry parklands in Burkina Faso have come under increasing demographic as well as climatic pressures, which are threatening indigenous tree species that contribute substantially to income generation and nutrition in rural households. Analyzing the threats as well as the species vulnerability to them is fundamental for priority setting in conservation planning. Guided by literature and local experts we selected 16 important food tree species (Acacia macrostachya, Acacia senegal, Adansonia digitata, Annona senegalensis, Balanites aegyptiaca, Bombax costatum, Boscia senegalensis, Detarium microcarpum, Lannea microcarpa, Parkia biglobosa, Sclerocarya birrea, Strychnos spinosa, Tamarindus indica, Vitellaria paradoxa, Ximenia americana, Ziziphus mauritiana) and six key threats to them (overexploitation, overgrazing, fire, cotton production, mining and climate change). We developed a species-specific and spatially explicit approach combining freely accessible datasets, species distribution models (SDMs), climate models and expert survey results to predict, at fine scale, where these threats are likely to have the greatest impact. We find that all species face serious threats throughout much of their distribution in Burkina Faso and that climate change is predicted to be the most prevalent threat in the long term, whereas overexploitation and cotton production are the most important short-term threats. Tree populations growing in areas designated as 'highly threatened' due to climate change should be used as seed sources for ex situ conservation and planting in areas where future climate is predicting suitable habitats. Assisted regeneration is suggested for populations in areas where suitable habitat under future climate conditions coincides with high threat levels due to short-term threats. In the case of Vitellaria paradoxa, we suggest collecting seed along the northern margins of its distribution and considering assisted regeneration in the central part where the current threat level is high due to overexploitation. In the same way, population-specific recommendations can be derived from the individual and combined threat maps of the other 15 food tree species. The approach can be easily transferred to other countries and can be used to analyze general and species specific threats at finer and more local as well as at broader (continental) scales in order to plan more selective and efficient conservation actions in time. The concept can be applied anywhere as long as appropriate spatial data are available as well as knowledgeable experts.

AB  - Climate change is expected to impact a large number of organisms in many ecosystems, including several threatened mammals. A better understanding of climate impacts on species can make conservation efforts more effective. The Himalayan ibex (Capra ibex sibirica) and blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) are economically important wild ungulates in northern Pakistan because they are sought-after hunting trophies. However, both species are threatened due to several human-induced factors, and these factors are expected to aggravate under changing climate in the High Himalayas. In this study, we investigated populations of ibex and blue sheep in the Pamir-Karakoram mountains in order to (i) update and validate their geographical distributions through empirical data; (ii) understand range shifts under climate change scenarios; and (iii) predict future habitats to aid long-term conservation planning. Presence records of target species were collected through camera trapping and sightings in the field. We constructed Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model on presence record and six key climatic variables to predict the current and future distributions of ibex and blue sheep. Two representative concentration pathways (4.5 and 8.5) and two-time projections (2050 and 2070) were used for future range predictions. Our results indicated that ca. 37% and 9% of the total study area (Gilgit-Baltistan) was suitable under current climatic conditions for Himalayan ibex and blue sheep, respectively. Annual mean precipitation was a key determinant of suitable habitat for both ungulate species. Under changing climate scenarios, both species will lose a significant part of their habitats, particularly in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges. The Pamir-Karakoram ranges will serve as climate refugia for both species. This area shall remain focus of future conservation efforts to protect Pakistan's mountain ungulates.

AB  - 1. Species distribution modelling is an important and well-established tool for conservation planning and resource management. Modelling techniques based on central estimates of species responses to environmental factors do not always provide ecologically meaningful estimates of species-environment relationships and are being increasingly questioned.
   2. Regression quantiles (RQ) can be used to model the upper bounds of species-environment relationships and thus estimate how the environment is limiting the distribution of a species. The resulting models tend to describe potential rather than actual patterns of species distributions.
   3. Model selection based on null hypothesis testing and backward elimination, followed by validation procedures, are proposed here as a general approach for constructing RQ limiting effect models for multiple species.
   4. This approach was applied successfully to 16 of the most abundant marine fish and cephalopods in the eastern English Channel. Most models were validated successfully and null hypothesis testing for model selection proved effective for RQ modelling.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Modelling the upper bounds of species-habitat relationships enables the detection of the effects of limiting factors on species' responses. Maps showing potential species distributions are also less likely to underestimate species responses' to the environment, and therefore have subsequent benefits for precautionary management.

AB  - The construction of roads is currently well spread in many parts of our world and impacts strongly on wildlife distribution. Some bird species avoid, while other prefer to be in the vicinity of these human structures. However, studies on roads effects on birds, in terms of strength or direction of these effects, are scarce. Therefore, in a study carried out in Central Italy we tested the responses of different bird species to roads at a local spatial scale, using generalized linear models (GLM). Analysis were conducted on a large dataset (more than 1400 sampled sites, mainly on rural environments).
   Both positive and negative effects of roads on birds were found for bird species of close or semi-close environments, while the negative effects of roads were negligible for bird species of open and semi-open environments. This fact suggest that roads can be a source of "functional heterogeneity" on semi-open environments, providing marginal habitats, hedgerows and residual vegetation typical of roadsides, offering breeding and feeding habitat for some bird species.
   The proposed methodology provide a useful explorative tool, in order to develop conservation policies to preserve the biodiversity, mainly in rural landscapes. The outputs of GLM can be used as inputs in ecological planning: direction and strength of the effects of roads on bird species are adequate to estimate the response of bird community, up front to the presence of new structures, or identifying which of them should be mitigated to reduce negative effects on the biodiversity.

AB  - Coral reefs are highly vulnerable habitats, threatened by climate change and local anthropogenic impacts. Management is imperative, and spatial prioritisation apportions the area of interest to inform investments of scarce conservation resources. Spatially delineated planning units used to make management decisions are typically large enough to contain significant natural variabilities, but the ecological significance of such variance is seldom considered in planning decisions. On coral reefs, the patchiness of habitat quality within planning units matters both ecologically and functionally. Here, we show that considering within-planning unit variance in spatial prioritisation influences the location and design of reserve networks. Studying Timor-Leste, we statistically model the average and variance in coral cover. We compare conservation priority areas for scenarios informed by coral cover and variance to a baseline scenario with the spatial prioritisation software Marxan. To further explain these differences, and to show the value of including coral variance as a metric in spatial prioritisation, we created a reserve quality score. We show that the similarity between reserve networks was only 57% for protection, and 44% for restoration objectives. For both objectives, the inclusion of cover variance improves the conservation benefit of management. This project has shown a novel way to target areas for restoration. These results demonstrate that not only is mean coral cover (and, by extension, reef condition) a key criterion in selecting marine conservation actions, but its variance must be considered in spatial conservation prioritisation to improve both the efficiency and benefit of management actions within marine reserve networks.

AB  - Area of Occupancy (AOO), is a measure of species geographical ranges commonly used for species red listing. In most cases, AOO is estimated using reported localities of species distributions at coarse grain resolution, providing measures subjected to uncertainties of data quality and spatial resolution. To illustrate the ability of fine-resolution species distribution models for obtaining new measures of species ranges and their impact in conservation planning, we estimate the potential AOO of an endangered species in alpine environments. We use field occurrences of relict Empetrum nigrum and maximum entropy modeling to assess whether different sampling (expert versus systematic surveys) may affect AOO estimates based on habitat suitability maps, and the differences between such measurements and traditional coarse-grid methods. Fine-scale models performed robustly and were not influenced by survey protocols, providing similar habitat suitability outputs with high spatial agreement. Model-based estimates of potential AOO were significantly smaller than AOO measures obtained from coarse-scale grids, even if the first were obtained from conservative thresholds based on the Minimal Predicted Area (MPA). As defined here, the potential AOO provides spatially-explicit measures of species ranges which are permanent in the time and scarcely affected by sampling bias. The overestimation of these measures may be reduced using higher thresholds of habitat suitability, but standard rules as the MPA permit comparable measures among species. We conclude that estimates of AOO based on fine-resolution distribution models are more robust tools for risk assessment than traditional systems, allowing a better understanding of species ranges at habitat level.

AB  - Statistical models such as the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) used to predict potential habitats or distributions of wild plants, here referred to as species distribution models (SDMs), are useful tools for large-scale and long-term impact assessments. There have been fewer studies that used SDMs to predict the impact of climate change on potential habitats of plants in Asia than in western countries. Although spatial data on plant species distributions and environmental factors such as climatic parameters are necessary for modeling, the species distribution data usually constrain such modeling studies. We built models predicting the potential habitats of four Abies species (A. mariesii, A. veitchii, A. homolepis, and A. firma) endemic to Japan using species distribution data comprising detailed location and elevation records extracted from the Phytosociological Releve Database (PRDB). We also created a model predicting the habitats of Abies nephrolepis, native to East Asia, using approximately 20-km mesh distribution data digitized from a map of its distribution in China. The potential habitat projections for the four Japanese Abies species at a ca. 1-km resolution under current and future climate conditions indicated that three species presently found at high elevations on mountains would lose large areas of habitat in Japan. The projection for A. nephrolepis at ca. 20-km resolution indicated that this species would gain more habitat area in the north but lose habitat in lowlands relative to its current distribution in northeastern China. Abies species occurring in non-habitats after climate change would decline gradually and be replaced by other plant species. Although a potential habitat projection of a plant on the East Asian continent can be performed by SDMs using low-resolution plant distribution data, SDMs based on more detailed distribution data covering the entire distribution of a species are necessary for practical conservation plans.

AB  - Knowledge of the extent and structure of genetic diversity and a species' ecological niche are integral to formulating management plans for the conservation of threatened species. This is particularly important for aquatic organisms, which are especially vulnerable to human-induced environmental degradation and experience rapid global decline. To develop a proper conservation strategy for a threatened aquatic plant, Ottelia acuminata (Hydrocharitaceae), we utilized species distribution modeling (SDM) to delimit its potentially suitable range, both under the current climate and the climate expected in the near future, and employed AFLP to analyze the extent and structure of genetic variation over its entire distribution range. The within-population genetic diversity (He=0.085) was lower than in the other species of Hydrocharitaceae studied using AFLP. The structuring of the genetic variation corresponded well to the distribution of previously described phenotypic varieties. There was 100% clustering of individuals according to their population origin suggesting a lack of inter-population gene flow. Based on the results of SDM and population genetic analysis we recommend (i) collecting seeds from all extant populations for seed banking through cryopreservation and the creation of living collections; (ii) reintroductions after restoration of once-occupied habitats utilizing plants of local origin, or, if the local variety has been extirpated, utilizing the most genetically similar population representing the same phenotypic variety; and (iii) experimental introduction of the species into lakes, ponds and small rivers in protected areas within the identified suitable range utilizing either a single population or a mix of populations belonging to the same genetic or phenotypic group.

AB  - Ocotea odorifera is an endangered tree species, threatened by the urbanization process that occurs in the region of Curitiba, Parana state, among other factors. Thus, the knowledge about their geographical distribution becomes necessary to plan protected areas that mitigate the effects caused by anthropic pressures on their populations. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a model of the potential geographic distribution of Ocotea odorifera and to verify the region of the municipality of Curitiba more relevant to its conservation. First, we georeferenced individuals of the species found in the municipality, while the model of potential distribution of the species was performed using the Maxent (R) algorithm, using meteorological and topological data as environmental variables. The Jackknife test indicated the most relevant variables to the model and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) indicated its accuracy. The potential distribution map was superimposed on a shapefile file containing the delimitation of 80 protected green areas with fragments of native vegetation. As a whole, 12 occurrence points of the species were located in seven sites. The map generated by Maxent indicated that the central-northern region of Curitiba presents the highest probability of Ocotea odorifera occurrence, corresponding to 19,550.30 ha. The model explained 96.3% of the species distribution in the study area. The relative contribution and the Jackknife test indicated that the most relevant variable to the model was pedology. In future plantings of the species, the pedology should be considered during its planning, as well as other specific characteristics of the soil at each site.

AB  - P>1. The abundance and distribution of a species are affected by processes which operate at multiple scales. Large-scale dynamics are increasingly recognized in conservation responses such as metapopulation management, transfrontier protected areas and softening the agricultural matrix. Landscape-scale monitoring is needed both to inform and judge their efficacy. In this Special Profile we address some of the challenges presented by monitoring at the landscape scale, how models of species distribution can be used to inform policy, and we discuss how monitoring at the global-scale could be approached.
   2. Collecting data over a large area is inherently costly, so methods which can provide robust information at low-cost are particularly valuable. We present two papers which test low-cost approaches against more data-hungry methods (indices of abundance vs. direct density estimates, and species distribution models built from presence-only vs. presence/absence data).
   3. Occupancy modelling is a useful approach for landscape-scale monitoring due to the relatively low-cost of collecting detection/non-detection data. We discuss challenges, such as non-random sampling locations and periodical unavailability for detection, in using detection/non-detection data for monitoring species distribution. Such data can also provide estimates of abundance and we show how existing models have been modified to allow the abundance of multiple species to be estimated simultaneously.
   4. Models of species distribution can be used to project likely future scenarios and thus inform conservation planning where distributions are likely to change because of climate change or changing disturbance patterns. We also discuss how an optimization framework can be used to make efficient management decisions for invasive species management in the light of imperfect information.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Monitoring is needed for many purposes including auditing past management decisions and informing future choices. Much monitoring data are collected at the site scale, although management authorities increasingly recognize landscape-scale dynamics. Recent global targets for conservation require monitoring which can report trends at the global-scale. Integrating data collected at a variety of scales to draw robust inference at the scale required is a challenge which deserves more attention from applied ecologists.

AB  - The simplest type of model describing animal habitats is a "cover-type model," in which a species is assumed to be present in certain vegetation types and absent in others. Ecologists and managers use these models to predict animal distributions for gap analysis and conservation planning. Critics, however, have suggested that the models are overly simplistic and inaccurate. We reviewed the use of cover-type models including assessing their error rates, diagnosing the problems with these models, and determining how they should best be used by managers. To determine models' accuracy rates, we conducted a meta-analysis of 35 studies in which cover-type models were tested against data on animal occurrences. Models had a mean accuracy rate of 0.71 +/- A 0.18 (SD). Rates of commission error averaged 0.20 +/- A 0.16, and omission errors averaged 0.09 +/- A 0.11. A review of the effects of errors in conservation planning suggests that the observed error rates were high enough to call into question any management decisions based on these models. Reasons for the high error rates of cover-type models include the fallibility of expert opinion, the fact that the models oversimplify how animals actually use habitats, and the dynamic nature of animal populations. Given the high rate of errors in cover-type models, any conclusions based on them should be taken with extreme caution. We suggest that these models are best used as coarse filters to identify locations for further study in the field.

AB  - Capsule: One of the southernmost populations of the Black Guillemot Cepphus grylle is currently endangered, and the risk may be exacerbated by climate change.
   Aims: We evaluated the future vulnerability of the Black Guillemot by predicting the impact of climate change on the geographic distribution of its breeding and foraging range in the Baltic Sea.
   Methods: We used MaxEnt, a species distribution modelling technique, to predict the current and future breeding grounds and foraging sites.
   Results: We found that although the foraging range is expected to increase in the southern Baltic Sea in future, these areas will no longer be suitable as breeding grounds due to a changing climate, creating a spatial mismatch.
   Conclusion: Our predictions indicate where threats to the species may be most severe and can be used to guide conservation planning. We advocate conservation measures which integrate potential future threats and focus on breeding sites across the current and future potential geographic range of the Black Guillemot.

AB  - Global assessment of conservation threats to several taxonomic groups are urgently needed for species living in regions of the world where field research is curtailed by logistic or economic constraints. For instance, it is now widely recognized that freshwater turtles represent one of the most endangered groups of vertebrates in the world. This situation has been particularly evident with Asian species. Although in Sub-Saharan Africa species are exposed to very similar threats (e.g., intense hunting for food and traditional medicine, habitat loss, collection for the pet trade, etc.), there is no comparable concern in the international conservation community simply because the African species are still too poorly known. Here, I propose a model for analyzing the threat levels to freshwater turtles of Sub-Saharan Africa and I test this model by taking into consideration a series of six risk variables of distribution and ecology. Each variable was categorized into five ranks (0-4) of increasing survival risk. The results, although preliminary, show a great sensitivity of most species. This strongly contrasts with the fact that apart from Malagasy endemics very few species are currently considered as threatened according to IUCN lists. There were clear differences among-families in the major threats. Softshell turtles are especially threatened because their large body size makes them a very good food source for native populations. The single podocnemidid species is also vulnerable, and is particularly sensitive to human hunting for domestic consumption. Concerning the Pelomedusidae, there are several species that are considered by the model as sensitive or highly sensitive to rarity. They are affected by a combination of threats (Extent of distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa, Habitat breadth, Habits, Likeliness of human direct/indirect persecution, and Habitat vulnerability). The conservation implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) have become important and essential tools in conservation and management. However, SDMs built with count data, referred to as species abundance models (SAMs), are still less commonly used to date, but increasingly receiving attention. Species occurrence and abundance do not frequently display similar patterns, and often they are not even well correlated. Therefore, only using information based on SDMs or SAMs leads to an insufficient or misleading conservation efforts. How to combine information from SDMs and SAMs and how to apply the combined information to achieve unified conservation remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce and propose a priority protection index (PI). The PI combines the prediction results of the occurrence and abundance models. As a case study, we used the best available presence and count records for an endangered farmland species, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda dybowskii), in Bohai Bay,'China.l We then applied the Random Forest algorithm (Salford Systems Ltd. Implementation) with eleven 1predictor variables to forecast the spatial occurrence as we las the abundance distribution. The results show that the occurrence model had a decent performance (ROC:(0.77) and the abundance model had a RMSE of 26.54. It is noteworthy that environmental variables influenced bustard occurrence and abundance differently. The area of farmland, and the distance to residential areas were the top important variables influencing bustard occurrence. While the distance to national roads and to expressways were the most important influencing abundance. In addition, the occurrence and abundance models displayed different spatial distribution patterns. The regions with a high index of occurrence were concentrated in the south-central part of the study area; and the abundance distribution showed high populations Species occurrence in the central and northwestern parts of the study area. However, combining occurrence and abundance indices to produce a priority protection index (PI) to be used for conservation could guide the protection of the areas with high occurrence and high abundance (e.g., in Strategic Conservation Planning). Due to the widespread use of SDMs and the easy subsequent employment of SAMs, these findings have a wide relevance and applicability than just those only based on SDMs or SAMs and tiladate the We promote and strongly encourage researchers to further test, apply priority protection inde) (PI) elsewhere to explore the generality of rid methods that are now readil available.

AB  - Effective assessments of the current status of biodiversity conservation are needed to support planning, policy and action, from local to global levels. Of particular use would be well documented, reproducible methods based on openly accessible data and tools. Such methods should provide an accurate estimate of the state of conservation of diversity, identifying gaps in current conservation systems, while providing a benchmark against which to measure success, including determining when conservation goals have been met. Here we introduce GapAnalysis, an open source R package developed to support the assessment of the state of conservation of taxa, both ex situ (in genebanks, botanic gardens and other repositories) and in situ (in protected natural areas). The eco-geographic variation maintained in conservation repositories and that present within protected natural areas is compared with the full extent of eco-geographic variation predicted within species' native ranges. Eco-geographic conservation gaps are identified, and taxa are then prioritized for further action. The package enables users to quickly determine conservation status, gaps and priorities for as few as one to as many as thousands of taxa, for any wild flora or fauna for which occurrence data and species distribution models are available. To demonstrate the use of GapAnalysis, we provide case studies for wild plant taxa in the genera Capsicum L. and Cucurbita L, with an accompanying online R tutorial for three of the Cucurbita species.

AB  - Dalbergia latifolia Roxb., commonly known as rosewood, is one of the highly valuable tropical timber species of Nepal. The tree species was widely distributed in the past, however, over exploitation of natural habitat, deforestation, forest conversion for agriculture, illegal logging and the invasion of alien species resulted in the classification of this species as vulnerable by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) category. So, the prediction of habitat suitability and potential distribution of the species is required to develop restoration mechanisms and conservation interventions. In this study, we modelled the suitable habitat of D. latifolia over the entire possible range of Nepal using a Maxent model. We compiled 23 environmental variables (19 bioclimatic, 3 topographic and a vegetative layer), however, only 12 least correlated variables along with 43 spatially representative presence locations were retained for model prediction. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the model's performance and a Jackknife procedure to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables. The model was statistically significant with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.969. The internal Jackknife test indicated that elevation was the most important variable for the model prediction with 71.3% contribution followed by mean temperature of driest quarter (9.8%). The most (>0.6) suitable habitat for the D. latifolia was 235 484 hectares with large sections of area in two provinces whereas, the western most provinces were not suitable for D. latifolia as per Maxent model. The information presented here can provide a framework for nature conservation planning, monitoring and habitat management of this rare and endangered species.

AB  - For biodiversity protection to play a persuasive role in land-use planning, conservationists must be able to offer objective systems for ranking which natural areas to protect or convert. Representing biodiversity in spatially explicit indices is challenging because it entails numerous judgments regarding what variables to measure, how to measure them, and how to combine them. Surprisingly few studies have explored this variation. Here, we explore how this variation affects which areas are selected for agricultural conversion by a land-use prioritization model designed to reduce the biodiversity losses associated with agricultural expansion in Zambia. We first explore the similarity between model recommendations generated by three recently published composite indices and a commonly used rarity-weighted species richness metric. We then explore four underlying sources of ecological and methodological variation within these and other approaches, including different terrestrial vertebrate taxonomic groups, different species-richness metrics, different mathematical methods for combining layers, and different spatial resolutions of inputs. The results generated using different biodiversity approaches show very low spatial agreement regarding which areas to convert to agriculture. There is little overlap in areas identified for conversion using previously published indices (mean Jaccard similarity, J(w), between 0.3 and 3.7%), different taxonomic groups (5.0% J(w) < 13.5%), or different measures of species richness (15.6% J(w) < 33.7%). Even with shared conservation goals, different methods for combining layers and different input spatial resolutions still produce meaningful, though smaller, differences among areas selected for conversion (40.9% J(w) < 67.5%). The choice of taxonomic group had the largest effect on conservation priorities, followed by the choice of species richness metric, the choice of combination method, and finally the choice of spatial resolution. These disagreements highlight the challenge of objectively representing biodiversity in land-use planning tools, and present a credibility challenge for conservation scientists seeking to inform policy making. Our results suggest an urgent need for a more consistent and transparent framework for designing the biodiversity indices used in land-use planning, which we propose here.

AB  - Ecological theory is essential to predict the effects of global changes such as habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity. Species-area relationships (SAR), metapopulation models (MEP) and species distribution models (SDM) are commonly used tools incorporating different ecological processes to explain biodiversity distribution and dynamics. Yet few studies have compared the outcomes of these disparate models and investigated their complementarity. Here we show that the processes underlying SAR (patch area), MEP (patch isolation) and SDM (environmental conditions) models can be compared with a common statistical framework. Our approach allows for species and community-level predictions under current and future landscape scenarios, facilitates multi-model comparison and provides the machinery for integrating multiple mechanisms into one model. We apply this framework to the distribution of eight focal vertebrate species in current and future projected landscapes where 10% of the landscape is lost to land-use change in southwestern, Quebec, Canada. Based on a model selection approach, we found that a model including patch area was the top ranked model for four of our focal species and models including patch isolation and environmental conditions were the top ranked models for two focal species each. Community-level predictions of models based on patch area, patch isolation and environmental conditions for both current and future landscapes showed high spatial overlap, however, patch area models always predicted a reduction of species richness per patch whereas both the patch isolation and environmental conditions models predicted an increase or decrease in species richness per patch following habitat loss and fragmentation. Our comparative tool will allow ecologists and conservation practitioners to relate structural uncertainty to key mechanisms underlying each model. Ultimately, this approach is one step in the direction of deriving robust predictions for the change and loss of biodiversity under global change, which is key for informing conservation plans.

AB  - The West Sahara-Sahel is a remote region where knowledge gaps on mammal distribution have hampered accurate local biodiversity assessments and the development of optimised conservation planning in the region. Using a geographical information system and ecological niche-based modelling tools, this study combines high resolution presence data from 22 mammals and environmental factors from the West Sahara-Sahel to identify suitable areas for mammal occurrence, biogeographic affinities among taxa, and local hotspots of species richness. The maximum entropy approach was used to relate environmental factors with mammal distributions and to predict suitable areas of species' occurrence. Biogeographic groups were defined based on the spatial similarities of predicted distributions. Ecological niches of analysed taxa were summarized through Principal Components Analyses based on topoclimatic and habitat variables. Distributions of most mammals were related with climate and/or habitat features, and some were associated with topography. Suitable areas were predicted mostly within known distributions of mammalian taxa. Low values of niche breadth were estimated for all taxa, indicating a tendency for specialization in the study area. Shared distributional ranges among taxa allowed the identification of five groups with different biogeographic affinities. Most groups occurred in the ecoregions North Saharan steppe and woodlands and Sahelian Acacia savanna, reflecting their availability and stressing the importance of these ecoregions for local mammal conservation. Predicted suitable areas were poorly represented in the current network of protected areas, especially in Mauritania. The southern Mauritanian mountains contained suitable habitat for most of the studies mammals, but are largely unprotected. The fine scale ecological niche-based models built with high resolution data can be used to identify key-areas for conservation and management, and could be applied to other remote regions and taxonomic groups worldwide.

AB  - How anticipated climate change might affect long-term outcomes of present-day agricultural conservation practices remains a key uncertainty that could benefit water quality and biodiversity conservation planning. To explore this issue, we forecasted how the stream fish communities in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) would respond to increasing amounts of agricultural conservation practice (ACP) implementation under two IPCC future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5: moderate reductions; RCP8.5: business-as-usual conditions) during 2020-2065. We used output from 19 General Circulation Models to drive linked agricultural land use (APEX), watershed hydrology (SWAT), and stream fish distribution (boosted regression tree) models, subsequently analyzing how projected changes in habitat would influence fish community composition and functional trait diversity. Our models predicted both positive and negative effects of climate change and ACP implementation on WLEB stream fishes. For most species, climate and ACPs influenced species in the same direction, with climate effects outweighing those of ACP implementation. Functional trait analysis helped clarify the varied responses among species, indicating that more extreme climate change would reduce available habitat for large-bodied, cool-water species with equilibrium life-histories, many of which also are of importance to recreational fishing (e.g., northern pike, smallmouth bass). By contrast, available habitat forwarm-water, benthic species with more periodic or opportunistic life-histories (e.g., northern hogsucker, greater redhorse, greenside darter) was predicted to increase. Further, ACP implementation was projected to hasten these shifts, suggesting that efforts to improve water quality could come with costs to other ecosystem services (e.g., recreational fishing opportunities). Collectively, our findings demonstrate the need to consider biological outcomes when developing strategies to mitigate water quality impairment and highlight the value of physical-biological modeling approaches to agricultural and biological conservation planning in a changing climate.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between the geographical distribution of taxa and their environmental conditions is a key concept in ecology and conservation. The use of ensemble modelling methods for species distribution modelling (SDM) have been promoted over single algorithms such as Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). Nevertheless, we suggest that in cases where data, technical support or computational power are limited, for example in developing countries, single algorithm methods produce robust and accurate distribution maps. We fit SDMs for 114 Egyptian medicinal plant species (nearly all native) with a total of 14,396 occurrence points. The predictive performances of eight single-algorithm methods (maxent, random forest (rf), support-vector machine (svm), maxlike, boosted regression trees (brt), classification and regression trees (cart), flexible discriminant analysis (fda) and generalised linear models (glm)) were compared to an ensemble modelling approach combining all eight algorithms. Predictions were based originally on the current climate, and then projected into the future time slice of 2050 based on four alternate climate change scenarios (A2a and B2a for CMIP3 and RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for CMIP5). Ensemble modelling, MaxEnt and rf achieved the highest predictive performances based on AUC and TSS, while svm and cart had the poorest performance. There is high similarity in habitat suitability between MaxEnt and ensemble predictive maps for both current and future emission scenarios, but lower similarity between rf and ensemble, or rf and MaxEnt. We conclude that single-algorithm modelling methods, particularly MaxEnt, are capable of producing distribution maps of comparable accuracy to ensemble methods. Furthermore, the ease of use, reduced computational time and simplicity of methods like MaxEnt provides support for their use in scenarios when the choice of modelling methods, knowledge or computational power is limited but the need for robust and accurate conservation predictions is urgent.

AB  - Aim Our aim was to uncover patterns of distribution of marine subtidal rocky reef communities across six taxonomic groups and decompose the relative roles of species loss and turnover in total community variation. Additionally, we propose an easily calculated index that can be used to highlight areas with unique species composition for conservation planning. We estimated the strengths of associations between environmental factors and species richness and rarity. Location Ilha Grande Bay, Brazil, covering about 150,000 ha harbouring different marine habitats. Methods We used the Marine Rapid Assessment Protocol at 42 sites to gather information on environmental variables and species in six subtidal marine groups. We determined "singular" sites as the regions harbouring higher numbers of rare species. Then, we estimated the roles of species loss and turnover on the observed total variation among sites. We used Generalized Linear Model to partition the relative importance of the selected environmental factors in driving variation in species richness and singularity. Results The singularity index and richness showed that the bay could be divided into three subregions for subtidal communities. Richness and rarity were structured at different spatial scales and associated with environmental variables related to water productivity and nutrients but varied among taxonomic groups. Community variation over space was largely associated with turnover of species. Main conclusions Higher singularity and richness on the western side of the bay and around the main island suggested that these regions should be conservation priorities, but high species turnover across the whole bay indicated that portions of the central channel should be included in conservation strategies. This draws attention to the importance of community variation rather than just species numbers in conservation and management planning. The high species turnover indicated that these rocky reefs have high beta diversity when compared to other studied biological systems.

AB  - This study aimed to use the applications of Ensemble Species Distribution Modelling (eSDM), Geographical Information Systems (GISs), and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for the design of a protected area (PA) for the critically endangered yellow-spotted mountain newt, Neurergus derjugini, by tracking and excluding the effects of climate and landscape changes in western Iran and northeastern Iraq. Potential recent and future distributions (2050 and 2070) were reconstructed by eSDM using eight algorithms with MRI-CGCM3 and CCSM4 models. The GIS-based MCDA siting procedure was followed inside habitats with high eSDM suitability by eliminating the main roads, cities, high village density, dams, poor vegetation, low stream density, agricultural lands and high ridge density. Then, within the remaining relevant areas, 10 polygons were created as "nominations" for PAs (NPAs). Finally, for 10 different NPAs, the suitability score was ranked based on ratings and weights (analytical hierarchy process) of the number of newt localities, NPA connectivity, NPA shape, NPA habitat suitability in 2070, NPA size, genetic diversity, village density and distance to nearest PAs, cities, and main roads. This research could serve as a modern realistic approach for environmental management to plan conservation areas using a cost-effective and affordable technique.

AB  - The need to incorporate habitat dynamics into spatial conservation prioritization is increasingly recognized but often limited by the lack of available temporal data. To overcome this limitation, model-assisted monitoring has been advocated and developed over the last decade. However, predictive modelling often relies on static habitat features or interpolated climate data, failing to consider other relevant ecological processes such as primary productivity and its dynamics. The importance of primary productivity relies on its key role in determining the availability of food resources via trophic cascades. This study aims to assess how the spatiotemporal variation in the habitat quality for top predators (using raptors as case study) can be affected by temporal fluctuations in primary productivity, and whether its incorporation into habitat modelling improves predictions in space and time. Through model predictions we then incorporate interannual habitat-quality dynamics into spatial conservation planning to identify priority areas for raptor conservation based on a new set of dynamic priority-area indices. Using raptor occurrence data from two surveys (2001 and 2014), we found high model performance and transferability for all species (AUC(2001) = 0.89 +/- 0.10 and Boyce's Index(2001) of 0.78 +/- 0.20; AUC(2014) = 0.89 +/- 0.12 and Boyce's Index(2014) of 0.87 +/- 0.06). Annual mean and minimum values of EVI (indicators of productivity and phenology, respectively) and elevation were the most important predictor variables for most raptor species. However, the standard deviation of EVI (an indicator of seasonality) was also found to be an important predictor for migratory species breeding in shrublands and croplands. Interannual model predictions showed a large interannual variation in habitat availability across species, partially associated with regional land-use changes. Interannual habitat-quality dynamics was translated into marked changes in the priority areas for raptor conservation -areas mostly associated with deciduous forest and water environments (rivers and dams) in our study area. Our results shed light on the role of intra- and interannual dynamics of primary productivity in driving habitat quality for top predators. They also confirm the potential of remotely sensed ecosystem functioning attributes to inform about habitat-quality dynamics in a cost-effective, standardized and repeatable way. Incorporating interannual dynamics of primary productivity in habitat modelling supports raptor conservation prioritization by informing about adequacy, stability and legacy of raptor conservation areas.

   Location Amazonia.
   Methods The impacts of expected global climate change on the potential and realized distributions of a representative sample of 69 individual Angiosperm species in Amazonia were simulated from 1990 to 2095. The climate trend followed the HADCM2GSa1 scenario, which assumes an annual 1% increase of atmospheric CO2 content with effects mitigated by sulphate forcing. Potential distributions of species in one-degree grid cells were modelled using a suitability index and rectilinear envelope based on bioclimate variables. Realized distributions were additionally limited by spatial contiguity with, and proximity to, known record sites. A size-structured population model was simulated for each cell in the realized distributions to allow for lags in response to climate change, but dispersal was not included.
   Results In the resulting simulations, 43% of all species became non-viable by 2095 because their potential distributions had changed drastically, but there was little change in the realized distributions of most species, owing to delays in population responses. Widely distributed species with high tolerance to environmental variation exhibited the least response to climate change, and species with narrow ranges and short generation times the greatest. Climate changed most in north-east Amazonia while the best remaining conditions for lowland moist forest species were in western Amazonia.
   Main conclusions To maintain the greatest resilience of Amazonian biodiversity to climate change as modelled by HADCM2GSa1, highest priority should be given to strengthening and extending protected areas in western Amazonia that encompass lowland and montane forests.

AB  - Phenology is a key feature in the description of species niches to capture seasonality in resource use and climate requirements. Species distribution models (SDMs) are widespread tools to evaluate a species' potential distribution and identify its large-scale habitat preferences. Despite its chief importance, data phenology is often neglected in SDM development. Non-migratory bats of temperate regions are good model species to test the effect of data seasonality on SDM outputs because of their different roosting preferences between hibernation and reproduction. We hypothesized that (1) the output of SDMs developed for six non-migratory European bat species will differ between hibernation and reproduction; (2) models built from datasets encompassing both ecological stages will perform better than seasonal models. We employed a dataset of 470 independent occurrences of bat hibernacula and 400 independent records of nursery roosts of selected species and for each species we developed separate winter, summer and mixed (i.e. generated from both winter and summer occurrences) models. Seasonal and mixed potential ranges differed from each other and the direction of this difference was species-specific. Mixed models outperformed seasonal models in representing species niches. Our work highlights the importance of considering data seasonality in the development of SDMs for bats as well as many other organisms, including non-migratory species, otherwise the analysis will lead to significant biases whose consequences for conservation planning and landscape management may be detrimental.

AB  - Rapid changes in climate and land use threaten the persistence of wildlife species. Understanding where species are likely to occur now and in the future can help identify areas that are resistant to change over time and guide conservation planning. We estimated changes in species distribution patterns and spatial resistance in five future scenarios for the New England region of the northeastern United States. We present scenario-specific distribution change maps for nine harvested wildlife species, identifying regions of increasing, decreasing, or stable habitat suitability within each scenario. Next, we isolated areas where species occurrence probability is high (p > 0.7) and resistant to change across all future scenarios. Resistance was also evaluated relative to current land protection to identify patterns in and out of Protected Areas (PAs). Generally, species distributions declined in area over the 50-year assessment period (2010-2060), with the greatest average declines occurring for moose (-40.9%) and wild turkey (-22.1%). Species resistance varied considerably across the region, with coyote demonstrating the highest average regional resistance (91.81% of the region) and moose demonstrating the lowest (0.76% of the region). At the state level, average focal species resistance was highest in Maine (the largest state) and lowest in Massachusetts. Many of the focal species showed high overlap in resistance and land protection. Coyote, white-tailed deer, and black bear had the highest probability of resistance, given protection, while moose and wild turkey had the highest probability of protection, given resistance. Overall, relatively small portions of New England-ranging between 0.25% and 21.12%-were both protected and resistant for the focal species. Our results provide estimates of resistance that can inform conservation planning for commonly harvested species that are important ecologically, economically, and culturally to the region. Expanding protected area coverage to include resistant areas may provide longer term benefits to these species.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is performed to limit potential impacts of development projects on species and ecosystem functions. However, the methods related to EIA actually pay little attention to the landscape-scale effects of development projects on biodiversity. In this study we proposed a methodological framework to more properly address the landscape-scale impacts of a new stadium project in Lyon (France) on two representative mammal species exemplary for the endemic fauna, the red squirrel and the Eurasian badger. Our approach combined species distribution model using Mutant and landscape functional connectivity model using Graphab at two spatial scales to assess habitat connectivity before and after development project implementation. The development project had a negative impact on landscape connectivity: overall habitat connectivity (PC index) decreased by -6.8% and -1.8% and the number of graph components increased by +60.0% and +17.6% for the red squirrel and the European badger respectively, because some links that formerly connected habitat patches were cut by the development project. Changes affecting landscape structure and composition emphasized the need to implement appropriate avoidance and reduction measures. Our methodology provides a useful tool both for EIA studies at each step of the way to support decision-making in landscape conservation planning. The method could be also developed in the design phase to compare the effectiveness of different avoidance or mitigation measures and resize them if necessary to maximize habitat connectivity.

AB  - Recognizing the location of climatically stable areas in the future is subjected to uncertainties from ecological niche models, climatic models, variation in species ranges responses, and from the climatic variation through time. Here, we proposed an approach based on hierarchical ANOVA to reduce uncertainties and to identify climatically stable areas, working with Cerrado tree species as a model organism. Ecological niche models were generated for 18 Cerrado tree species and their potential distributions were projected into past and future. Analyses of the sources of uncertainties in ensembles hindcasts/forecasts revealed that the time component was the most important source of variation, whereas the climatic models had the smallest effect. The species responses to climate changes do not showed marked differences within each time period. By comparing past and future predictions, a single continuous climatically stable area was identified, which should be considered as a potential improvement for spatial prioritization for conservation.

AB  - Each year an estimated US$20-30 million is spent by government and non-government organisations in efforts to conserve the Bomean orangutan. However, recent population analysis reveals that these efforts have been unable to reduce species decline. A major aim of the Indonesian National Action Plan for orangutan conservation is to "improve in-situ conservation as the principal activity ensuring the orangutan's survival in its native habitats". This paper summarises and examines current investment in conservation activities and provides recommendations on the strategic allocation of funds for future conservation. The cost data of major conservation initiatives, including orangutan rescue and rehabilitation, habitat protection, habitat restoration and community education, was collated from non-government agency annual reports and primary literature. A recent population density and distribution model, and reports documenting the effectiveness of conservation strategies for the species were then used to calculate population trends in the presence and absence of interventions. Using an open-access cost-effectiveness resource allocator tool, we investigate expenditure and program performance. We then provide recommendations on how to strategically allocate conservation funding to future programs to ensure maximum effectiveness.

AB  - 1. Natura 2000 network (N2000) and national protected areas (NPAs) are recognised as the most important core units' for biological conservation in Europe. 2. Species distribution models (SDMs) were developed to detect the potential distribution of the rare and threatened cerambycid beetle Rosalia alpinaL. in Europe, and the amount of suitable habitat within the N2000 network [special areas of conservation (SACs) and special protection areas (SPAs)], NPAs (e.g. national parks, regional parks, state reserves, natural monuments and protected landscapes) and the overall European protected area network (EPAN) (N2000+NPAs) was quantified. 3. According to this analysis, the suitable habitat for R. alpina in Europe amounts to c.754171km(2) and stretches across substantially uninterrupted areas from Portugal to Romania (west to east) and from Greece to Germany (south to north). The overlay between the existing system of conservation areas in Europe (N2000 and NPAs) and the binary map for R. alpina showed that only c. 42% of potential habitat is protected. SACs and SPAs protect c. 25% and 21% of potential habitat, respectively. However, because the two site types often spatially overlap, when taken together the entire N2000 network protects c. 31% of potential habitat. Instead, NPAs offer a degree of protection of c.29%. Overall, almost 60% of the area potentially suitable for the species is unprotected by the EPAN, an aspect that should be considered carefully when planning the conservation of this beetle at a large scale. 4. These results may also help to focus field surveys in selected areas where greater chances of success are encountered to save resources and increase survey effectiveness.

AB  - The significant shortfall in global marine protection targets is likely to continue to drive rapid growth in marine protected areas (MPAs). Systematic conservation planning to fill gaps in marine protection requires sufficient knowledge of both the distribution of biodiversity and the threats to species and ecosystems. Yet such data are lacking for much of the marine environment, creating significant challenges for planning effective marine protection. In the absence of habitat mapping data, critical environmental variables associated with species' distributions can be used to model the spatial distribution of different environments. Although this approach has been used in some jurisdictions to assist MPA planners, the increased availability and resolution of spatial data now provide an opportunity to improve assessments of MPA representation. Capitalizing on advances in spatial data, this study uses a range of biological and physical environmental attributes to model the distribution of Australian marine environments. Given many Australian MPAs were implemented without knowledge of the distribution of species and benthic habitats, this Bio-physical model is used to assess MPA coverage and equality of protection for Australian marine environments. Results of the Bio-physical model revealed that Australian MPAs overrepresent warm, offshore waters (such as the Coral Sea) and underrepresent temperate environments. Furthermore, the distribution of protection in Australian MPAs is heavily skewed, with no-take protection disproportionately targeting tropical environments, leaving major gaps in the protection of both temperate and nearshore habitats. Without comprehensive habitat mapping, the representativeness and adequacy of an MPA system cannot be accurately evaluated, nor can the required expansion of MPAs be planned effectively. In the interim, the biological and physical attributes chosen for this model provide useful proxies to assist in efforts to better target current and future protection based on the most up-to-date knowledge.

AB  - Climate change is causing many irreversible changes in the Himalayan ecosystems. In this study, an attempt was made to understand the ecological response of medicinal plant species to changing climate conditions in the Sikkim Himalaya, a part of the Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) approach was used to analyze the potential habitat distribution of 163 medicinal plant species in current and future climates (2050, 2070). An attempt was also made to identify the most suitable areas for conservation and test the effectiveness of the existing Protected Area (PA) network in conserving medicinal plant species in current and future climate scenarios through the Habitat Suitability and Overlap Analyses. SDM analyses revealed that the majority of the medicinal plant species are found in the tropical and sub-tropical regions in the Sikkim Himalaya (300-2000 m) at present. In future climates, however, most of the species are likely to show an upward and northward shift in their distributions. Maximum species-rich regions are likely to shift by 200 m and 400 m in 2050 and 2070, respectively. A total of 13-16% of medicinal plant species currently found in the region are likely to lose their existing potential habitats by 2050 and 2070. The results highlight that species that are restricted to specific localities and have a narrow elevational distribution are the most vulnerable species and likely to go extinct due to climate change in the Himalaya. Habitat suitability analyses indicated that elevations ranging from 860 to 2937 m serve as highly suitable habitats for medicinal plant species in Sikkim Himalaya. Consequently, these areas can be focused for conservation actions in order to mitigate the effect of climate change. The results of Overlap Analysis indicated that out of 8 PAs in Sikkim Himalaya, only 5 PAs are effective in the conservation of medicinal plant species in current and future climates. The boundaries of existing PAs need to be expanded in order to accommodate the upward shifts in the spatial distribution of species, especially in the case of those PAs that are located in the lower elevations or tropical regions. This study provides a novel integrated framework for use of ecological informatics in assessing the species vulnerability to climate change and planning conservation priorities.

AB  - Global biodiversity has already been altered by the climatic changes in various means like species migration, changes in habitat distribution, seasonality changes in phenology etc. In order to implement sustainable conservation or adaptation strategy, it is necessary to understand the impacts of climate change on both ecosystem and species level. Here we present an assessment on current and future habitat suitability distribution of Myristica dactyloides Gaertn. (MD), a medicinally and ecologically important tree species by using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model. The future predictions were done for the year 2050 and 2070 using the bioclimatic variables having 1 km spatial resolution from two different models of fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP5). This study was carried out in the Kolli hill, Eastern Ghats of India. The AUC values confirmed the accuracy of model prediction based on 22 occurrence points. Environmental variables' contributions were evaluated using jackknife test. The more influencing variables will be annual temperature, annual precipitation and precipitation of wettest month. Finally, this study found that there will be a significant reduction in the habitat suitability distribution of Myristica dactyloides in the year 2050 and 2070 in the study area. Hence with the performance of the model, this study found that MaxEnt could be an effective tool for species rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation planning in the light of climate change.

AB  - The design of conservation plans for the improvement of habitats of threatened species constitutes one of the most plausible possibilities of intervention in the structure and composition of the landscape of a large territory. In this work we focus on the Iberian lynx in order to establish potential ecological corridors using ecoinformatic tools from the GIS environment to improve connectivity between the existing natural spaces within the scope of its historical distribution. We processed 669 records of the presence of the lynx and six predictor variables linked to the habitat of the species. With this, corridors have been generated between natural areas. The determination of possible bottlenecks or dangerous areas (e.g., hitches on highways) allows for focusing efforts on their conservation. This type of approach seeks to improve efficiency in the design of measures aimed at expanding the territory's capacity to host its populations, improving both its viability and that of all the other species that are linked to it. The proposals for action on the specific areas defined by the models elaborated in this work would imply interventions on the land uses and existing vegetation types in order to improve connectivity throughout the territory and increase the resilience of its ecosystems.

AB  - Correlations between environmental factors and the distribution of amphibian and reptile species richness were investigated in a climate transition area, Peneda-Geres National Park (PNPG), in North-Western Portugal. Using presence-data at a local-scale (1 x 1 km), Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) identified a mixture of climatic (precipitation and number of days with fog), topographical (altitude and relief) and habitat factors (number of watercourses and water surfaces, the type of the largest water surface and tree diversity cover), as accurate predictors of species occurrence. Three factors were common for both taxonomic groups, and consistently presented a positive relation with species occurrence: precipitation, number of water surfaces, and tree diversity cover; suggesting a strong coincidence in the environmental correlates that influence amphibian and reptile species richness. Distribution patterns of observed and predicted species richness were compared using a Geographical Information System. Overall, three high species richness areas were predicted in common for both taxonomic groups and two additional areas for amphibians only. These areas matched with the observed species richness but suggested larger areas of high species richness. The location of the PNPG in a biogeographic crossroad, between Euro-Siberian and Mediterranean provinces, emphasised species richness of amphibians and reptiles and suggests a high priority conservation status for this protected area. Most of Central-Northern Portugal is located in a climatic transition area; therefore, increased species richness should be expected for other areas. Local scale studies for other protected areas should be planned as a framework for the development of multi-scale conservation planning by Portuguese authorities.

AB  - The worldwide biodiversity crisis is ongoing. To slow down, or even halt future species loss it is important to identify potential drivers of extinction risk. Species traits can help to understand the underlying process of extinction risk. In a comprehensive study on 464 carabid beetle species, we used ordinal logistic regression to analyze the relationship of species traits to extinction risk in Central Europe, taking phylogenetic relatedness into account. To consider varying trait responses in different habitat types, we also tested models for species groups associated with different habitat types (forest, open, riparian and wetland). Our results identified three traits of particular importance as predictors for high extinction risk: (1) high habitat specialization, (2) small distribution range size (which is not considered in the categorization of the German Red List), and (3) large body size. Furthermore, large macropterous species showed high extinction risk. Overall, species associated with mountainous, coastal and open habitats generally revealed a high risk of extinction, while most forest species showed a low extinction risk. However, forest species with predatory feeding behavior were threatened, as were wetland species that reproduce in autumn. Phylogenetic relatedness had no influence on how species traits predict carabid beetle extinction risk. In the light of these results, management and recovery plans for species which exhibit characteristic traits strongly associated with extinction risks, as well as the conservation and restoration of mountain, coastal and open habitats, have to be prioritized.

AB  - Wild palms contribute significantly to food security and local economy in tropical areas, and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In light of this importance, eight palm species were explored [Borassus aethiopum (L.) Mart, Eremospatha macrocarpa (G. Mann et H. Wendl.) H. Wendl., Laccosperma opacum (G. Mann et H. Wendl.) Drude, Hyphaene thebaica (L.) Mart, Phoenix reclinata Jacq., Raphia hookeri G. Mann et H. Wendl., R. sudanica A. Chev., and R. vinifera P. Beauv.] as targets for conservation, domestication, and cultivation in Benin. Cultivation potential was evaluated in a coarse-resolution, first-pass effort using ecological niche models to relate known occurrences of each species to vegetation indices (VEG), gross primary productivity (GPP), and soil characteristics (SOIL), and model outputs were related to human distribution and land-use patterns. Results showed that wild palms responded differentially to different suites of environmental factors: some species showed best model performance with VEG + GPP + SOIL, others with GPP + SOIL or VEG + GPP, or with a single factor. Two species had broad potential distributions across the country; others had potential areas in the north (2 species) or the south (4 species). Raphia hookeri and R. vinifera showed greatest overlap in terms of ecology and distribution, whereas L. opacum and R. sudanica had the lowest similarity. These models constitute initial steps toward a sustainable scheme for planning exploration of the possibility of cultivation of these species.

AB  - The persistence of species in reserves depends in large part on the persistence of functional ecological interactions. Despite their importance, however, ecological interactions have not yet been explicitly incorporated into conservation prioritization methods. We develop here a general method for incorporating consumer-resource interactions into spatial reserve design. This method protects spatial consumer-resource interactions by protecting areas that maintain the connectivity between the distribution of consumers and resources. We illustrate our method with a conservation planning case study of a mammalian predator, American marten (Martes americana), and its two primary prey species, Red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilus) and Deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). The conservation goal was to identify a reserve for marten that comprised 12% of a forest management unit in the boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. We compared reserves developed using analysis variants that utilized different levels of information about predator and prey habitat distributions, species-specific connectivity requirements, and interaction connectivity requirements. The inclusion of consumer-resource interactions in reserve-selection resulted in spatially aggregated reserves that maintained local habitat quality for the species. This spatial aggregation was not induced by applying a qualitative penalty for the boundary length of the reserve, but rather was a direct consequence of modelling the spatial needs of the interacting consumer and resources. Our method for maintaining connectivity between consumers and their resources within reserves can be applied even under the most extreme cases of either complete spatial overlap or complete spatial segregation of consumer-resource distributions. The method has been made available via public software. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effectiveness of conservation efforts ultimately depends on the recognition that decision making, and the systems that it is designed to affect, are inherently dynamic and characterized by multiple sources of uncertainty. To cope with these challenges, conservation planners are increasingly turning to the tools of decision analysis, especially dynamic optimization methods. Here we provide a general framework for optimal, dynamic conservation and then explore its capacity for coping with various sources and degrees of uncertainty. In broadest terms, the dynamic optimization problem in conservation is choosing among a set of decision options at periodic intervals so as to maximize some conservation objective over the planning horizon. Planners must account for immediate objective returns, as well as the effect of current decisions on future resource conditions and, thus, on future decisions. Undermining the effectiveness of such a planning process are uncertainties concerning extant resource conditions (partial observability), the immediate consequences of decision choices (partial controllability), the outcomes of uncontrolled, environmental drivers (environmental variation), and the processes structuring resource dynamics (structural uncertainty). Where outcomes from these sources of uncertainty can be described in terms of probability distributions, a focus on maximizing the expected objective return, while taking state-specific actions, is an effective mechanism for coping with uncertainty. When such probability distributions are unavailable or deemed unreliable, a focus on maximizing robustness is likely to be the preferred approach. Here the idea is to choose an action (or state-dependent policy) that achieves at least some minimum level of performance regardless of the (uncertain) outcomes. We provide some examples of how the dynamic optimization problem can be framed for problems involving management of habitat for an imperiled species, conservation of a critically endangered population through captive breeding, control of invasive species, construction of biodiversity reserves, design of landscapes to increase habitat connectivity, and resource exploitation. Although these decision making problems and their solutions present significant challenges, we suggest that a systematic and effective approach to dynamic decision making in conservation need not be an onerous undertaking. The requirements are shared with any systematic approach to decision making-a careful consideration of values, actions, and outcomes.

AB  - Distribution and connectivity of suitable habitat for species of conservation concern is critical for effective conservation planning. Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), an umbrella species for biodiversity conservation, is increasingly threatened because of habitat loss and fragmentation.
   We assessed the impact of drastic changes in forest management in the Carpathian Mountains, a major stronghold of capercaillie in Europe, on habitat distribution and connectivity.
   We used field data surveys with a forest disturbance dataset for 1985-2010 to map habitat suitability, and we used graph theory to analyse habitat connectivity.
   Climate, topography, forest proportion and fragmentation, and the distance to roads and settlements best identified capercaillie presence. Suitable habitat area was 7510 km(2) in 1985; by 2010, clear-cutting had reduced that area by 1110 km(2). More suitable habitat was lost inside protected areas (571 km(2)) than outside (413 km(2)). Habitat loss of 15 % reduced functional connectivity by 33 % since 1985.
   Forest management, particularly large-scale clear-cutting and salvage logging, have substantially diminished and fragmented suitable capercaillie habitat, regardless of the status of forest protection. Consequently, larger areas with suitable habitat are now isolated and many patches are too small to sustain viable populations. Given that protection of capercaillie habitat would benefit many other species, including old-growth specialists and large carnivores, conservation actions to halt the loss of capercaillie habitat is urgently needed. We recommend adopting policies to protect natural forests, limiting large-scale clear-cutting and salvage logging, implementing ecological forestry, and restricting road building to reduce forest fragmentation.

AB  - The loss, alteration and fragmentation of faunal habitat affects the ability of species to persist in the landscape. Effective management and reconstruction of habitat to enhance species persistence needs to be informed by organism-centric approaches to evaluating alternative habitat scenarios. Such approaches need to be founded on sound ecological theory, be capable of integrating knowledge of dynamic ecological processes with data on the distribution and quality of habitat in spatially complex landscapes, and yet be simple and efficient enough for broad application.
   We describe a new methodology - rapid evaluation of metapopulation persistence (REMP) - that integrates a cost-benefit approach to measuring landscape connectivity, using continuously variable (i.e. raster) habitat surfaces, with existing analytical techniques for determining the metapopulation capacity of a given landscape and for predicting occupancy patterns within this landscape. By adapting these existing techniques to work with raster data structures REMP is particularly well-suited to analysis of highly variegated landscapes. REMP produces results rapidly using best-available habitat suitability mapping and a limited set of parameters defining species movement abilities and habitat area requirements. These parameters can be estimated from expert knowledge when no empirical data are available. The approach has been successfully integrated into landscape scenario development and evaluation systems, supporting conservation planning for native fauna in NSW, Australia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus (Bonaparte) currently occupy approximately half of their historical distribution across western North America. Sage-grouse are a candidate for endangered species listing due to habitat and population fragmentation coupled with inadequate regulation to control development in critical areas. Conservation planning would benefit from accurate maps delineating required habitats and movement corridors. However, developing a species distribution model that incorporates the diversity of habitats used by sage-grouse across their widespread distribution has statistical and logistical challenges. We first identified the ecological minimums limiting sage-grouse, mapped similarity to the multivariate set of minimums, and delineated connectivity across a 920,000km2 region. We partitioned a Mahalanobis D2 model of habitat use into k separate additive components each representing independent combinations of species-habitat relationships to identify the ecological minimums required by sage-grouse. We constructed the model from abiotic, land cover, and anthropogenic variables measured at leks (breeding) and surrounding areas within 5km. We evaluated model partitions using a random subset of leks and historic locations and selected D2 (k=10) for mapping a habitat similarity index (HSI). Finally, we delineated connectivity by converting the mapped HSI to a resistance surface. Sage-grouse required sagebrush-dominated landscapes containing minimal levels of human land use. Sage-grouse used relatively arid regions characterized by shallow slopes, even terrain, and low amounts of forest, grassland, and agriculture in the surrounding landscape. Most populations were interconnected although several outlying populations were isolated because of distance or lack of habitat corridors for exchange. Land management agencies currently are revising land-use plans and designating critical habitat to conserve sage-grouse and avoid endangered species listing. Our results identifying attributes important for delineating habitats or modeling connectivity will facilitate conservation and management of landscapes important for supporting current and future sage-grouse populations.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the biggest threats to amphibian populations and anthropogenic climate change may exacerbate these. The response of Iran's amphibians to climate change is uncertain and yet making an accurate prediction of how the species will respond is critical for conservation. We assessed how expected future climate scenarios before the years 2050 and 2070 might influence the geographic distribution and habitat connectivity of the Lorestan Mountain Newt (Neurergus kaiseri). We examined presence data (2010-2018) of the species according to environmental and anthropogenic factors, and created an ensemble model of habitat suitability based on eight species distribution models (SDMs). Then, we used the concept of circuit theory to estimate potential linkages between the habitat patches. We applied the ensemble calibrated models and quantified spatial connectivity to assess the influence of climate change on the species range for the years 2050 and 2070 under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of three general circulation models (GCMs). Models using current climate predicted that 6.8% of the 267,609 km(2 )study area has suitable conditions for the species, but only about 7% of these climatically suitable landscapes are covered by conservation areas. Temperature and precipitation-related climatic variables made the largest contribution to the distribution model. Under projected climate conditions, we found a decline of 56-98% of the suitable habitat and predicted a potential for distributional shifts towards higher elevations by 2050 and 2070. Although there is relatively good connectivity between many habitat patches today, models predict that suitable areas available to the newt will become increasingly fragmented under projected climate change scenarios. Our findings support the hypothesis that projected climatic shifts will negatively influence suitable habitats of amphibians and likely cause upward shifts in elevation in range of some species. Identifying potentially suitable habitats and important linkages between habitat patches under different climate scenarios are crucial steps in conservation planning for the Lorestan Mountain Newt.

AB  - Population viability analysis (PVA) has been used for three decades to assess threats and evaluate conservation options for wildlife populations. What has been learned from PVA on in situ populations are valuable lessons also for assessing and managing viability and sustainability of ex situ populations. The dynamics of individual populations are unpredictable, due to limited knowledge about important factors, variability in the environment, and the probabilistic nature of demographic events. PVA considers such uncertainty within simulations that generate the distribution of likely fates for a population; management of ex situ populations should also take into consideration the uncertainty in our data and in the trajectories of populations. The processes affecting wildlife populations interact, with feedbacks often leading to amplified threats to viability; projections of ex situ populations should include such feedbacks to allow for management that foresees and responds to the cumulative and synergistic threats. PVA is useful for evaluating conservation options only if the goals for each population and measures of success are first clearly identified; similarly, for ex situ populations to contribute maximally to species conservation, the purposes for the population and definitions of sustainability in terms of acceptable risk must be documented. PVA requires a lot of data, knowledge of many processes affecting the populations, modeling expertize, and understanding of management goals and constraints. Therefore, to be useful in guiding conservation it must be a collaborative, trans-disciplinary, and social process. PVA can help integrate management of in situ and ex situ populations within comprehensive species conservation plans.

AB  - Aim One of the limitations to using species' distribution atlases in conservation planning is their coarse resolution relative to the needs of local planners. In this study, a simple approach to downscale original species atlas distributions to a finer resolution is outlined. If such a procedure yielded accurate downscaled predictions, then it could be an aid to using available distribution atlases in real-world local conservation decisions.
   Location Europe.
   Methods An iterative procedure based on generalized additive modelling is used to downscale original European 50 x 50 km distributions of 2189 plant and terrestrial vertebrate species to c. 10 x 10 km grid resolution. Models are trained on 70% of the original data and evaluated on the remaining 30%, using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) procedure. Fitted models are then interpolated to a finer resolution. A British dataset comprising distributions of 81 passerine-bird species in a 10 x 10 km grid is used as a test bed to assess the accuracy of the downscaled predictions. European-wide, downscaled predictions are further evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce: (1) spatial patterns of coincidence in species richness scores among different groups; and (2) spatial patterns of coincidence in richness, rarity and complementarity hotspots.
   Results There was a generally good agreement between downscaled and observed fine-resolution distributions for passerine species in Britain (median Jaccard similarity = 70%; lower quartile = 36%; upper quartile = 88%). In contrast, the correlation between downscaled and observed passerine species richness was relatively low (rho = 0.31) indicating a pattern of error propagation through the process of overlaying downscaled distributions for many species. It was also found that measures of model accuracy in fitting original data (ROC) were a poor predictor of models' ability to interpolate distributions at fine resolutions (rho = -0.10). Although European hotspots were not fully coincident between observed and modelled coarse-resolution data, or between modelled coarse resolution and modelled downscaled data, there was evidence that downscaled distributions were able to maintain original cross-taxon coincidence of species-richness scores, at least for terrestrial vertebrate groups. Downscaled distributions were also able to uncover important environmental gradients otherwise blurred by coarse-resolution data.
   Main conclusions Despite uncertainties, downscaling procedures may prove useful to identify reserves that are more meaningfully related to local patterns of environmental variation. Potential errors arising from the presence of false positives may be reduced if downscaled-distribution records projected to occur outside the range of original coarse-resolution data are excluded. However, the usefulness of this procedure may be limited to data-rich regions. If downscaling procedures are applied to data-poor regions, then there is a need to undertake further research to understand the structure of error in models. In particular, it would be important to investigate which species are poorly modelled, where and why. Without such an assessment it is difficult to support unsupervised use of downscaled data in most real-world situations.

AB  - Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) is one of the most emblematic mammals of Mesoamerica, but like other large-bodied animals, it is facing an increasing risk of extinction due primarily to habitat loss. Mexico's ortion of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC-M) is located in one of the main strongholds for Bairds tapir. To assess the MBC-M's effectiveness for tapir conservation, we estimated the distribution of the species' potential habitat by applying 2 modelling approaches (random forest and Maxent) to a set of uncorrelated environmental variables and a 157-point presence dataset. We calculated the extent of tapir habitat in within the MBC-M and modelled new corridors and conservation areas, which we compared to the MBC-M. Moreover, we assessed deforestation patterns in the region. Twenty-seven percent of highly suitable tapir habitat occurred in protected areas, 15% in corridors and 58.3% was outside the MBC-M and associated reserves. The spatial configuration of the MBC-M was partially concordant with the modelled set of conservation areas and corridors. The main dissimilarity was that the modelled corridors traversed forests in Belize and Guatemala to connect conservation areas. Analyses of deforestation since 1993 and human population density in the vicinity of the MBC-M indicated that future conservation efforts should give particular attention to the Montes Azules-El Triunfo Corridor due to greater habitat threat. The MBC-M has a great potential to play a prominent role in the conservation of tapir habitat but there is an urgent need to implement management plans that reinforce and complement this conservation initiative.

AB  - Climate change is reaching several tipping points, likely resulting in habitat shifts at a global scale. Such changes could have serious consequences for migratory species. For instance, climatic changes may impact the distribution of breeding and non-breeding ranges, resulting in longer migration distances for some species. The flycatchers (Tyrannidae) are the largest family of birds in New World. They are small insectivorous birds with different distributions and migratory strategies, including both tropical and temperate species. Here, we aim to map the climatically suitable ranges for Tyrannidae in the future, compare them to their present ranges, and quantify the changes in range size and in migratory distance. We show different impacts on species that breed in the northern vs. southern hemisphere. Furthermore, results suggest that tropical and temperate species would suffer from different stressors. Neotropical austral migrant species would lose part of their breeding ranges, while Nearctic-Neotropical species would need to fly longer distances to reach the same climatic conditions of their current breeding ranges. Because past climate shifts have shaped the evolution of bird migration, these insights are also key for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the evolution and regulation of bird migration, and for conservation planning.

AB  - Livestock husbandry exerts major pressures on wildlife across the world. Large carnivores are particularly at risk because they are often killed by pastoralists as a preventive or precautionary response to livestock depredation. Minimizing the overlap between pastures and carnivore habitat can thus be a conservation strategy, but it remains often unclear which pastures should be targeted to maximize conservation benefits given a limited budget. We addressed this question for the last viable population of the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) in northeastern Iran. By combining species distribution modeling with a spatial prioritization framework, we aimed to identify where grazing right buyouts should take place to reduce cheetah killing by herders and their dogs. We assessed the Asiatic cheetah habitat using species distribution models, highlighting large, contiguous areas that overlap with livestock pastures (5792 km(2), equaling 72% of the total predicted suitable habitat). Subsequently, we used data on the number and distribution of livestock (similar to 47,000 animals in 80 pastures) and applied a spatial prioritization method to identify pastures for grazing right buyouts for a range of budget scenarios (US$100,000-600,000). Pastures selected had a high level of irreplaceability and were generally stable across budget scenarios. Our results provide a novel approach to minimize encounter rates between cheetah and livestock, and thus the mortality risk, for one of the world's most endangered felids and highlight the potential of spatial prioritization as a tool to devise urgent conservation actions.

AB  - The maned sloth Bradypus torquatus (Pilosa, Bradypodidae) is endemic to a small area in the Atlantic Forest of coastal Brazil. It has been listed as a threatened species because of its restricted geographic range, habitat loss and fragmentation, and declining populations. The major objectives of this study were to estimate its potential geographic distribution, the climatic conditions across its distributional range, and to identify suitable areas and potential species strongholds. We developed a model of habitat suitability for the maned sloth using two methods, Maxent and Mahalanobis Distance, based on 42 occurrence points. We evaluated environmental variable importance and the predictive ability of the generated distribution models. Our results suggest that the species distribution could be strongly influenced by environmental factors, mainly temperature seasonality. The modeled distribution of the maned sloth included known areas of occurrence in the Atlantic Forest (Sergipe, Bahia, Espirito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro), but did not match the observed distributional gaps in northern Rio de Janeiro, northern Espirito Santo or southern Bahia. Rather, the model showed that these areas are climatically suitable for the maned sloth, and thus suggests that factors other than climate might be responsible for the absence of species. Suitable areas for maned sloth were located mainly in the mountainous region of central Rio de Janeiro throughout Espirito Santo and to the coastal region of southern Bahia. We indicate 17 stronghold areas and recommended survey areas for the maned sloth. In addition, we highlight specific areas for conservation, including the current network protected areas. Our results can be applied for novel surveys and discovery of unknown populations, and help the selection of priority areas for management and conservation planning, especially of rare and relatively cryptic species directed associated with forested habitats.

AB  - Responses of biodiversity to changes in both land cover and climate are recognized [1] but still poorly understood [2]. This poses significant challenges for spatial planning as species could shift, contract, expand, or maintain their range inside or outside protected areas [2-4]. We examine this problem in Borneo, a global biodiversity. hotspot [5], using spatial prioritization analyses that maximize species conservation under multiple environmental-change forecasts. Climate projections indicate that 11%-36% of Bornean mammal species will lose >= 30% of their habitat by 2080, and suitable ecological conditions will shift upslope for 23%-46%. Deforestation exacerbates this process, increasing the proportion of species facing comparable habitat loss to 30%-49%, a 2-fold increase on historical trends. Accommodating these distributional, changes will require conserving land outside existing protected areas, but this may be less than anticipated from models incorporating deforestation alone because some species will colonize high-elevation reserves. Our results demonstrate the increasing importance of upland reserves and that relatively small additions (16,000-28,000 km(2)) to the current conservation estate could provide substantial benefits to biodiversity facing changes to land cover and climate. On Borneo, much of this land is under forestry jurisdiction, warranting targeted conservation partnerships to safeguard biodiversity in an era of global change.

AB  - Fundulus jenkinsi (Saltmarsh Topminnow) is listed as "at risk" by the USFWS and as a Tier 2 conservation priority in Mississippi, in part, because of marsh-habitat loss due to storms, urbanization, and its specialized habitat requirements and limited geographic distribution. To provide additional quantitative data for conservation planning, our objectives were to (1) determine the distribution and abundance of Saltmarsh Topminnow within coastal Mississippi, (2) characterize its habitat requirements, and (3) organize and present all Saltmarsh Topminnow data records (non-vouchered and museum records and those from this study) for use in the development of management/conservation plans. We collected 497 fish and associated habitat data from 27 February to 1 August 2009. PCA produced 3 meaningful components: (1) a landscape-position axis (32.40% of the total variance), (2) a seasonal/spatial axis of species occurrence (18.99%), and (3) a geomorphic bank-slope axis (18.78%). Ninety-six percent of all fish (representing 78.8% of collection effort) were captured in water with salinity <13 psu. We compiled 831 geo-referenced occurrences with collection dates ranging from 1891 to 2015. To better quantify and conserve the closely-linked habitat requirements of this species within a reduced salinity range, additional sampling should be focused in undersampled areas between Lake Borgne, LA, to west of Galveston Bay, TX.

AB  - It is vital to understand the distribution area of a threatened plant species for its better conservation and management planning. Satyrium nepalense (family: Orchidaceae) is a threatened terrestrial orchid species with valuable medicinal and nutritional properties. The survival of S. nepalense in wild conditions has been challenged by increasing global surface temperature. Hence, understanding the impact of climate change on its potential distribution is crucial to conserve and restore this species. In present study, Maxent species distribution modeling algorithm was used to simulate the current distribution of S. nepalense in India and predict the possible range shift in projected future climate scenarios. A set of 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim database were used to predict the potential suitable habitats in current climatic condition and four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) scenarios by integrating five General Circulation Models (GCMs) for future distribution modeling of species for the years 2050 and 2070. Furthermore, change analysis was performed to identify the suitable habitat in current and future climate for delineating range expansion (gain), contraction (loss), and stable (no change) habitats of species. The Maxent model predicted that similar to 2.38% of the geographical area in India is presently climatically suitable for S. nepalense. The key bioclimatic variables affecting the distribution of studied species were the mean temperature of warmest quarter, mean temperature of wettest quarter, precipitation of warmest quarter, and temperature seasonality. Under future climate change scenarios, the total suitable habitat of S. nepalense will increase slightly in the Himalayan region and likely to migrate towards northward, but in the Western Ghats region, the suitable areas will be lost severely. The net habitat loss under four RCP scenarios was estimated from 26 to 39% for the year 2050, which could further increase from 47 to 60% by the year 2070. The finding of the predictive Maxent modeling approach indicates that warming climates could significantly affect the potential habitats of S. nepalense and hence suitable conservation measures need to be taken to protect this threatened orchid species in wild conditions.

AB  - The Hyrcanian climate in the northern parts of Iran has warmed over the past 50years, but the impacts on plant species are unknown. As the longest-lived tree in the Hyrcanian forest, English yew, Taxus baccata L., is a rare and endangered species in the forests along the Iranian coasts of the Caspian Sea, which is likely affected by climate change. This paper explores the current and future distribution of this species, using four species distribution models. In order to project the effect of climate change on the distribution of English yew by 2050 and 2070, output from the HadGEM2-ES climate model was used for two RCPs scenarios (2.6 and 8.5). The results showed a good accuracy of all the models for the distribution of this species with a mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.92. Using ensemble forecasting as an algorithm for reducing the uncertainty in species distribution modeling shows that the suitable habitats for this species is about 6000km(2) for the current climate conditions in the study area. Range size analysis indicates that in 2050, in the most optimistic scenario (RCP 2.6), only 17% of the habitats will retain their suitability, while in the most pessimistic scenario (RCP 8.5), this amount will decrease to 2%. In 2070, in the most optimistic scenario, only 10% of the currently suitable habitats will retain their suitability, while in the RCP 8.5, no stable suitable habitats will be left. It is strongly recommended that the impacts of climate change on English yew should be considered in the management decisions and conservation plans in the Hyrcanian forests.

AB  - The Neotropical region currently harbors 8 recognized species of small cats, including the margay (Leopardus wiedii) and jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi). These similar-sized species have broad geographic distributions and commonly occur in sympatry. We constructed species occurrence databases and used the maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling approach to develop models of habitat suitability for each of these species. We identified the environmental predictors with the highest importance for species occurrence and evaluated how they influence habitat suitability for both wild cats. Variables related to temperature and precipitation were good predictors of species occurrence, with both cats responding similarly to them. However, margay showed higher variation in habitat suitability depending on local climatic predictors. The estimated models indicated high niche similarity (>76%) between these cats, but despite this we identified different areas with the most favorable conditions for each species' occurrence. Approximately 50% and 72% of the entire suitable area were estimated as being moderately to highly suitable for margay and jaguarundi, respectively, with the margay model comprising a higher proportion of forest environments in comparison to that of the jaguarundi. These findings will be relevant in the context of conservation planning when indicating the priority areas for their long-term preservation.

AB  - Predictive maps of biodiversity patterns are pivotal to marine conservation and marine spatial planning alike, yet mapping of biodiversity indicators at the community-level is neither straightforward nor well-tested empirically. Two principle approaches exist. A direct approach involves calculation of indices for each sample, followed by interpolation to estimate values at unsampled locations. An indirect approach first interpolates individual species distributions and then determines indices based on the stacked distribution maps. We compared the appropriateness of both approaches to provide management-relevant information by mapping the distribution of demersal fish biodiversity in the German North Sea Exclusive Economic Zone using species richness, Hill's N-1 and a novel traits-based community sensitivity to fishing index (CSI). To substitute zero-inflated species with up to 95% zeros in the sample data, we applied each species' mean abundance value as a flat surface. Spatial patterns between indicators varied, but certain hot-and cold-spots were revealed, which, under current legislation, might suggest that the present level of biodiversity protection is insufficient. Despite both approaches generating similar main patterns, the direct approach predicted a narrower range of index values and only depicted the most dominant patterns. Contrary to that the indirect approach better reproduced the variability in the data, along with additional information on species distributions and a theoretical advantage pertaining to sampling issues. Although the choice over the mapping approach is context dependent, for our study area featuring a community with relatively few species, we consider the indirect approach to provide the more reliable information for implementing marine environmental legislation.

AB  - Seeking more precise knowledge of avian endemism on the east slope of the Andes in Peru and Bolivia, one of the most diverse faunal regions on Earth, we used distribution models based on locality records and 10-12 uncorrelated environmental variables to map the distributions of 115 species. Both maximum-entropy and deductive models reveal three areas of endemism, broadly supporting previous assessments of endemism in the region but showing much more detail. Regions such as the southwestern Cordillera de Vilcabamba and the Rio Mapacho-Yavero valley in Cusco, Peru, and the Cordillera de Apolobamba in western Bolivia support a greater richness of endemic species than has been recognized, a result likely attributable to the ability of predictive models to partially control for biases in survey effort. National-level protected areas cover >= 1,000 km(2) of the ranges, or four-fifths of the ranges of species with distributions < 1,000 km(2), of 77% of the endemic species. However, an analysis of summed irreplaceability, which emphasizes the locations of the most narrowly distributed endemics, showed that only 18% of these critical areas are currently protected. The fine-scale maps of endemic areas are suitable for regional and local-scale conservation planning, activities that can fill current gaps in protection of many species.

AB  - Sound conservation plans for islands require understanding the processes underlying to the patterns of species richness and composition. Larger islands are often the targets of conservation assuming that the island area mainly determines species richness, and that species composition is nested across islands. However, in small-island these patterns could be altered because of stochastic processes, and species assemblages could be disharmonious. In addition, human impact could further modify the distribution pattern and diversity. Here we use the case of seven islands from the coastal system of Coquimbo as a model to address the role of environmental variables and human impacts on species richness and assembly rules of plants, birds, and mammals. We hypothesize (a) the existence of a small-island effect, and the prevalence of habitat diversity and anthropogenic impacts as main drivers of species richness, and (b) the existence of disharmonious assemblages, characterized by a low degree of nestedness and random patterns of species co-occurrence. Our results showed that (a) species richness is mainly correlated with habitat diversity, and only weakly related to island area supporting the 'small-island effect' and (b) species composition is highly structured, but that such structure may be the result of anthropogenic activities. Nestedness was observed in plants and landbirds, while co-occurrence patterns were only detected in plants. Assemblages in small-islands departed from the nestedness pattern and maintain rare species. Currently, only three of the seven islands are protected by national regulations, excluding the smaller ones that are subjected to human disturbance and invasive mammals. Our study suggests that it necessary to include all the islands in a major protected area to preserve both richness and species composition of a number of representative islands of the Humboldt current systems. We showed that conservation plans solely based on island area might not be robust.

AB  - How populations from different regions within the distribution of a species contribute to the adaptive potential and survival of that species has important implications for formulating conservation actions. We test assumptions of concepts on geographic population structure (e.g. central-marginal concept and 'rear edge versus leading edge' model) that could be used to inform conservation of plant species under climatic changes. We analyze a comprehensive dataset of demographic traits (e.g. population size, flowering, delta C-13 of plant leaves) of up to 32 sites of Himantoglossum hircinum (L) Spreng. (Orchidaceae) located within six sub-regions of its European distribution range. Soil and climate parameters are employed as environmental predictors of variation in measured population traits. Climate is the main driver of demographic variability overriding central-marginal gradients that might be present. Warming of the climate at high latitudes paves the way for northward range expansion of species. Populations at the north and north-eastern range peripheries partly show exponential population growth and high genetic diversity and are likely to be the source of immigrants for colonization of newly suitable habitats as the climate continues to change. In recent times, populations at the southern range periphery have suffered from intensification of land use and decreasing rainfall, but in the case of Southern Italy are important because they contain genetically unique traits. Populations at both, 'leading' and 'rear', edges ought to be at the focus of conservation planning. Different conservation strategies are proposed at opposing species borders taking into account spatial variation in population needs on a geographic scale, projected population response to expected environmental changes and genetic characteristics.

AB  - Distribution models are commonly used to generalise across species distributions, to project future potential range changes, and to identify potential areas for species reintroductions and recovery plans. Building several models that incorporate different potential causal factors is a useful way of formalising alternative hypotheses. We developed a series of models to test hypotheses about the factors influencing the distribution of a species of conservation importance - the hen harrier Circus cyaneus.
   A climate-based model using continental distribution data was consistent with the continental distribution and observational studies in Britain. According to the climate-model the parts of Britain occupied by the hen harrier are the least climatically suitable.
   Habitat-based models using detailed distribution data from seven Scottish areas explained the recent British distribution well, with birds largely confined to heather dominated areas. These patterns were inconsistent with historical data on the species' distribution, its habitat use in other parts of its range and with the climate-based model.
   Our burn intensity index of gamekeeper activity was highly correlated with climatic suitability within the best 25% of 10 km squares by modelled habitat suitability, negatively associated with the productivity data and associated with a decrease in abundances between 1998 and 2004. Gamekeeper activity may be keeping hen harriers out of the most climatically suitable areas with habitat similar to that which they currently occupy within Britain and or keeping the population numbers too low and isolated for the natural re-expansion of the species into parts of the range where it was historically extirpated.

AB  - Prunus africana is a fast-growing, evergreen canopy tree with several medicinal, household, and agroforestry uses, as well as ecological value for over 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This species is under immense pressure from human activity, compounding its vulnerability to the effects of climate change. Predicting suitable habitats for P. africana under changing climate is essential for conservation monitoring and planning. This study intends to predict the impact of climate change on the suitable habitats for the vulnerable P. africana in Tanzania. We used maximum entropy modeling to predict future habitat distribution based on the representative concentration pathways scenario 4.5 and 8.5 for the mid-century 2050 and late-century 2070. Species occurrence records and environmental variables were used as a dependent variable and predictor variables respectively. The model performance was excellent with the area under curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS) values of 0.96 and 0.85 respectively. The mean annual temperature (51.7%) and terrain ruggedness. index (31.6%) are the most important variables in predicting the current and future habitat distribution for P. africana. Our results show a decrease in suitable habitats for P. africana under all future representative concentration pathways scenario when compared with current distributions. These results have policy implications for over 22 countries of sub-Saharan Africa that are facing problems associated with the sustainability of this species. Institutional, policy, and conservation management approaches are proposed to support sustainable practices in favor of P. africana.

AB  - Climate change is raising challenging concerns for systematic conservation planning. Are methods based on the current spatial patterns of biodiversity effective given long-term climate change? Some conservation scientists argue that planning should focus on protecting the abiotic diversity in the landscape, which drives patterns of biological diversity, rather than focusing on the distribution of focal species, which shift in response to climate change. Climate is one important abiotic driver of biodiversity patterns, as different climates host different biological communities and genetic pools. We propose conservation networks that capture the full range of climatic diversity in a region will improve the resilience of biotic communities to climate change compared to networks that do not. In this study we used historical and future hydro-climate projections from the high resolution Basin Characterization Model to explore the utility of directly targeting climatic diversity in planning. Using the spatial planning tool, Marxan, we designed conservation networks to capture the diversity of climate types, at the regional and sub-regional scale, and compared them to networks we designed to capture the diversity of vegetation types. By focusing on the Conservation Lands Network (CLN) of the San Francisco Bay Area as a real-world case study, we compared the potential resilience of networks by examining two factors: the range of climate space captured, and climatic stability to 18 future climates, reflecting different emission scenarios and global climate models. We found that the climate-based network planned at the sub-regional scale captured a greater range of climate space and showed higher climatic stability than the vegetation and regional based-networks. At the same time, differences among network scenarios are small relative to the variance in climate stability across global climate models. Across different projected futures, topographically heterogeneous areas consistently show greater climate stability than homogenous areas. The analysis suggests that utilizing high-resolution climate and hydrological data in conservation planning improves the likely resilience of biodiversity to climate change. We used these analyses to suggest new conservation priorities for the San Francisco Bay Area.

AB  - Conservation planning for at-risk species requires understanding of where species are likely to occur, how many individuals are likely to be supported on a given landscape, and the ability to monitor those changes through time.
   We developed a distribution model for northern spotted owls that incorporates both habitat suitability and probability of territory occupancy while accounting for interspecies competition.
   We developed range-wide habitat suitability maps for two time periods (1993 and 2012) for northern spotted owls that accounted for regional differences in habitat use and home range size. We used these maps for a long-term demographic monitoring study area to assess habitat change and estimate the number of potential territories based on available habitat for both time periods. We adjusted the number of potential territories using known occupancy rates to estimate owl densities for both time periods. We evaluated our range-wide habitat suitability model using independent survey data.
   Our range-wide habitat maps predicted areas suitable for territorial spotted owl presence well. On the demographic study area, the amount of habitat declined 19.7% between 1993 and 2012, while our estimate of the habitat-based carrying capacity declined from 150 to 146 territories. Estimated number of occupied territories declined from 94 to 57.
   Conservation and recovery of at-risk species depends on understanding how habitat changes over time in response to factors such as wildfire, climate change, biological invasions, and interspecies competition, and how these changes influence species distribution. We demonstrate a model-based approach that provides an effective planning tool.

FX  - Funding for monitoring spotted owl populations was primarily provided by USDA Forest Service and USDI Bureau of Land Management as agreed upon under the Northwest Forest Plan. This study was facilitated by over two decades of spotted owl monitoring data that were collected through a large group effort focused on monitoring the effectiveness of the NWFP. Our work would not have been possible without the continued hard work of many dedicated biologists who annually collect the spotted owl data used to train and test our habitat models. We thank the state (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Department of Forestry) and federal (USDA Forest Service, USDI Bureau of Land Management, USDI National Parks Service) agencies for providing spotted owl data to evaluate our models. J. Reid facilitated and graciously responded to questions regarding spotted owl data for the Tyee study area.

AB  - Conservation translocations of threatened species are being widely used to mitigate human impacts. However, their effects are surrounded by some controversy since these actions have often failed to meet planned objectives. Despite the limited number of published studies, existing evidence indicates that a main constraint for the long-term success of translocation actions is the selection of suitable receptor sites. In this study, we present a methodological approach to identify suitable receptor sites that combines the use of species distribution models (SDMs) and in situ field validation trials. This method was successfully applied to translocate a population of Critically Endangered Narcissus cavanillesii, which was going to be destroyed by the construction of the Alqueva dam (Portugal), the largest dam in Europe. The results of the SDM developed for the target species were biologically validated through in situ germination trials in sites with contrasting species suitability values. The population translocated to the site selected with this approach has experienced a stable demographic trend for more than ten years and established new mature plants outside the translocated patches. This methodology, which has proven to be a fast and reliable approach for the selection of appropriate receptor sites for conservation translocations, could be useful in other studies.

AB  - Chilgoza pine is an economically and ecologically important evergreen coniferous tree species of the dry and rocky temperate zone, and a native of south Asia. This species is rated as near threatened (NT) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This study hypothesized that climatic, soil and topographic variations strongly influence the distribution pattern and potential habitat suitability prediction of Chilgoza pine. Accordingly, this study was aimed to document the potential habitat suitability variations of Chilgoza pine under varying environmental scenarios by using 37 different environmental variables. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm in MaxEnt software was used to forecast the potential habitat suitability under current and future (i.e., 2050s and 2070s) climate change scenarios (i.e., Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs): 245 and 585). A total of 238 species occurrence records were collected from Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, and employed to build the predictive distribution model. The results showed that normalized difference vegetation index, mean temperature of coldest quarter, isothermality, precipitation of driest month and volumetric fraction of the coarse soil fragments (>2 mm) were the leading predictors of species presence prediction. High accuracy values (>0.9) of predicted distribution models were recorded, and remarkable shrinkage of potentially suitable habitat of Chilgoza pine was followed by Afghanistan, India and China. The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species was about 84,938 km(2), and the area of occupancy (AOO) was about 888 km(2), with 54 major sub-populations. This study concluded that, as the total predicted suitable habitat under current climate scenario (138,782 km(2)) is reasonably higher than the existing EOO, this might represent a case of continuous range contraction. Hence, the outcomes of this research can be used to build the future conservation and management plans accordingly for this economically valuable species in the region.

AB  - We examined the cost of conserving species as climate changes. We used a Maxent species distribution model to predict the ranges from 2000 to 2080 of 74 plant species endemic to the forests of Madagascar under 3 climate scenarios. We set a conservation target of achieving 10,000 ha of forest cover for each species and calculated the cost of achieving this target under each scenario. We interviewed managers of projects to restore native forests and conducted a literature review to obtain the net present cost per hectare of management actions to maintain or establish forest cover. For each species, we added hectares of land from lowest to highest cost per additional year of forest cover until the conservation target was achieved throughout the time period. Climate change was predicted to reduce the size of species ranges, the overlap between species ranges and existing or planned protected areas, and the overlap between species ranges and existing forest. As a result, climate change increased the cost of achieving the conservation target by necessitating successively more costly management actions: additional management within existing protected areas (US$060/ha); avoidance of forest degradation (i.e., loss of biomass) in community-managed areas ($160576/ha); avoidance of deforestation in unprotected areas ($2521069/ha); and establishment of forest on nonforested land within protected areas ($8022710/ha), in community-managed areas ($9623226/ha), and in unprotected areas ($10543719/ha). Our results suggest that although forest restoration may be required for the conservation of some species as climate changes, it is more cost-effective to maintain existing forest wherever possible.

AB  - Biodiversity action plans outline targets to meet current declines in populations of threatened species. The creation or restoration of suitable habitat is fundamental to meeting these targets. Sites were identified for conservation management prescriptions using associative modelling techniques through the framework of a Geographical Information System (GIS) for three species of bird. An environmental model was developed from habitat survey data using multilevel modelling. A geostatistical indicator kriging model was developed from presence absence distribution records. Both models were combined following Bayesian decision rules to produce a refined data map layer of probability values of occurrence. Habitat suitability threshold values were assigned to these probability maps to identify those sites of high suitability. These sites were then overlaid to identify those that were shared by all three focal species. It is these sites that were finally identified as those to conserve using the existing management prescriptions of the Upper Thames Tributaries Environmentally Sensitive Area as a potential funding mechanism.

AB  - Anthropogenic developments in marine coastal zones potentially overlap with areas of conservation interest, including important areas for birds. Ideally, spatial patterns of species abundance should be considered at ecologically relevant spatial resolutions (high resolutions) to inform spatial planning and environmental assessments. Most planning so far, however, has relied on coarse-resolution distribution maps from atlas projects or models often based on limited datasets (few surveys), and relationships with environmental variables have rarely been taken into account, leaving many studies and recommendations vulnerable to criticism. We therefore combined the strengths of a detailed database of spatially explicit aerial and ship surveys with high-resolution environmental predictors and species distribution models to predict detailed density patterns for 3 sea duck species, as part of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) in the southern Baltic Sea. We also compared the results from 2 different survey platforms to assess potential differences. We related survey data for Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima), Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis), and Common Scoters (Melanitta nigra) to topographic variables, food resources, and anthropogenic pressures using 2-step generalized additive models accounting for zero inflation, nonnormality, and nonlinearity. We accurately predicted distribution patterns (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.79-0.84) and abundances (Spearman's correlation: 0.36-0.62) at a resolution of 750 m. However, abundance predictions based on aerial survey data differed in magnitude in comparison with predictions from ship survey data, particularly for the frequently diving Long-tailed Duck. We suggest that the main source of the differing abundance estimates was differences in the input data collected using different survey platforms, rather than the modeling approach. A correction factor for birds missed during surveys due to diving activity would therefore increase the accuracy of abundance estimates. Our results show that it is possible to fit ecologically interpretable relationships between species and environmental variables, allowing for the creation of high-resolution predictions useful for management and conservation.

AB  - Background: Determining the distribution of species and of suitable habitats is a fundamental part of conservation planning. We used slope and ruggedness of the terrain, forest type and distance to the nearest village to construct habitat suitability maps for three mountain ungulates (barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), Himalayan goral (Naemorhedus goral) and Himalayan serow (Capricornis thar)) in the midhills of western Nepal. We used locations of sightings and signs of presence of these mountain ungulates collected during surveys along transect to derive a suitability value for each variable using Jacob's index. A multiplication approach was used to combine environmental variables and produce a habitat suitability map for each of the three species. An independent dataset was used to evaluate the maps using Boyce's index. This approach provides an overview of the probable distributions of the species in question.
   Results: We predict that of the total area studied, 57% is suitable for M. muntjak, 67% for N. goral and 41% for C. thar. Although there are suitable habitats for all three species throughout the study area, the availability of high-quality habitats for these species varied considerably.
   Conclusions: Suitable habitats for N. goral and C. thar were fragmented and mostly confined to the southern and northern parts of the study area. This study provides important baseline information for conservation biologists concerned with maintaining biodiversity in the midhills of Nepal.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used in conservation planning, but their utility can be improved by assessing the relationships between environmental and species response variables. We constructed SDMs for 30 stream fishes of Maryland, USA, using watershed attributes as environmental variables and presence/absence as species responses. SDMs showed substantial agreement between observed and predicted values for 17 species. Most important variables were natural attributes (e.g., ecoregion, watershed area, latitude/longitude); land cover (e.g., %impervious, %row crop) was important for three species. Focused analyses on four representative species (central stoneroller, creek chub, largemouth bass, and white sucker) showed the probability of presence of each species increased non-linearly with watershed area. For these species, SDMs built to predict absent, low, and high densities were similar to presence/absence predictions but provided probable locations of high densities (e.g., probability of high-density creek chub decreased rapidly with watershed area). We applied SDMs to predict suitability of watersheds within the study area for each species. Maps of suitability and the environmental and species response relationships can help develop better management plans.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDM) are increasingly used to understand the factors that regulate variation in biodiversity patterns and to help plan conservation strategies. However, these models are rarely validated with independently collected data and it is unclear whether SDM performance is maintained across distinct habitats and for species with different functional traits. Highly mobile species, such as bees, can be particularly challenging to model. Here, we use independent sets of occurrence data collected systematically in several agricultural habitats to test how the predictive performance of SDMs for wild bee species depends on species traits, habitat type, and sampling technique. We used a species distribution modeling approach parametrized for the Netherlands, with presence records from 1990 to 2010 for 193 Dutch wild bees. For each species, we built a Maxent model based on 13 climate and landscape variables. We tested the predictive performance of the SDMs with independent datasets collected from orchards and arable fields across the Netherlands from 2010 to 2013, using transect surveys or pan traps. Model predictive performance depended on species traits and habitat type. Occurrence of bee species specialized in habitat and diet was better predicted than generalist bees. Predictions of habitat suitability were also more precise for habitats that are temporally more stable (orchards) than for habitats that suffer regular alterations (arable), particularly for small, solitary bees. As a conservation tool, SDMs are best suited to modeling rarer, specialist species than more generalist and will work best in long-term stable habitats. The variability of complex, short-term habitats is difficult to capture in such models and historical land use generally has low thematic resolution. To improve SDMs' usefulness, models require explanatory variables and collection data that include detailed landscape characteristics, for example, variability of crops and flower availability. Additionally, testing SDMs with field surveys should involve multiple collection techniques.

AB  - Background: Humans threat the populations of tree species by overexploitation, deforestation, land use change, and climate change. We present a novel threat assessment at intraspecific level to support the conservation of genetic resources of 80 socioeconomically viable tree species in South America. In this assessment, we evaluate the threat status of Ecogeographic Range Segments (ERSs). ERSs are groups of populations of a specific species in a certain ecological zone of a particular grid cell of a species' geographic occupancy.
   Methods: We used species location records to determine the species distributions and species-specific ERSs. We distinguished eight threat situations to assess the risk of extirpation of the ERSs of all 80 species. These threat situations were determined by large or little tree cover, low or high human pressure, and low or high climate change impact. Available layers of tree cover and threats were used to determine the levels of fragmentation and direct human pressure. Maxent niche modelling with two Global Circulation Models helped determining climate change impact by the 2050s.
   Results: When all 80 species are considered, in total, 59% of the ERSs are threatened by little tree cover or high human pressure. When climate change is also considered, then 71-73% of the ERSs are threatened. When an increased risk of extirpation of populations outside protected areas is considered, then 84-86% of the ERSs are threatened. Seven species warrant special attention because all their ERSs are threatened across their whole distribution in South America: Balfourondendron riedelianum, Cariniana legalis, Dalbergia nigra, Handroanthus pulcherrimus, Pachira quintana, Prosopis flexuosa, and Prosopis pallida.
   Conclusions: Our results confirm the urgency to set up a regional action plan for the conservation of tree genetic resources in South America. With this threat assessment, we aim to support governments and organizations who are taking up this task.

AB  - We present a novel system of drifting pelagic baited stereo-video cameras that operate in deep-water, topographically complex environments typically considered inaccessible for sampling. The instruments are portable, semi-autonomous and inexpensive, allowing the recording of high-definition video footage in near-real time and over broad stretches of ocean space. We illustrate their benefits and potential as non-extractive monitoring tools for offshore marine reserves with a pilot study conducted within the newly established Perth Canyon Commonwealth Marine Reserve, southwestern Australia (32 degrees S, 115 degrees E). Using occupancy and maximum entropy models, we predict the distribution of midwater fishes and sharks and show that their most suitable habitat encompasses a wider fraction of the canyon head than is covered by park boundaries. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates that drifting pelagic stereo-video cameras can serve as appropriate field platforms for the construction of species distribution models with implications for ocean zoning and conservation planning efforts.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) play an important role in the conservation of valuable forest resources, and an increasing number of areas are being designated as PAs worldwide. However, climate change could drive endangered forest plants out of PAs, and impact the function of PAs to conserve endangered forest plants. Hence, it is necessary for conservation biologists to put forward a simple method to evaluate the ability of PAs to conserve endangered forest plants. Here, we studied 61 endangered forest plants from three ecoregions in China. We applied species distribution modeling to project suitable habitats of endangered forest plants, and used geographical information system to compute whether PAs could support the conservation of endangered forest plants. With climate change caused by increasing gas concentration, the overall ability of PAs to support the conservation of endangered forest plants will likely decrease compared to the conservation needs of ecoregions. We found that PAs have varying abilities to conserve endangered forest plants in different ecoregions. For temperate broadleaf mixed forests and tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, we found that climate change will decrease the PAs' ability to support the conservation of endangered forest plants effectively in the existing forest landscape. In contrast, we found that temperate conifer forests will likely remain effective. Using this information, we proposed the conservation plans for different ecoregions under climate change. For PAs with limited ability to support the conservation of endangered forest plants in an ecoregion, we recommend expanding the areas of forests and PAs based on the suitable habitats of the endangered forest plants. For PAs with stable ability to support the conservation of endangered forest plants in an ecoregion, we recommend expanding the conservation areas in PAs.

AB  - Aim Some threatened species are now recovering after a period of serious decline. Understanding and predicting the spatio-temporal recolonization of these species in a heterogeneous landscape are important for their conservation planning. We aimed to predict the range expansion of the endangered Asian crested ibis Nipponia nippon as it recovers from near-extinction to guide its in situ conservation and plan possible reintroductions.
   Location Central China.
   Methods We used a presence-only ecological niche model to predict breeding habitat suitability and a newly developed, spatially explicit and individual-based dynamic modelling platform to simulate range expansion. We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of uncertainty in demographic and dispersal parameters on the simulation of range dynamics. The impact of human-induced mortality risk was also investigated.
   Results Predictions showed that the Asian crested ibis population and the range extent would continue to increase over the next 50 years, and the species would recolonize parts of its historical range. However, the majority of the population would still be restricted to a relatively small region, and some potential suitable regions might not be recolonized for decades by natural dispersal. Moreover, the simulated range dynamics were sensitive to life history trait parameters, among which adult survival probability and the proportion of long-distance dispersal events showed the strongest effects. High human-induced mortality risks had a significant negative effect on population growth and range expansion.
   Main conclusions This study demonstrates how hybrid modelling can inform conservation management of threatened species as they recolonize former habitat. The findings enable prioritization of management efforts, highlight the need for long-term monitoring of the key life history parameters and provide evidence to guide the selection of potential reintroduction sites for the long-term survival and recovery of target species.

AB  - Climate-change scenarios project significant temperature changes for most of South America. We studied the potential impacts of predicted climate-driven change on the distribution and conservation of 26 broad-range birds from South America Cerrado biome (a savanna that also encompass tracts of grasslands and forests). We used 12 temperature or precipitation-related bioclimatic variables, nine niche modeling techniques, three general circulation models, and two climate scenarios (for 2030, 2065, 2099) for each species to model distribution ranges. To reach a consensus scenario, we used an ensemble-forecasting approach to obtain an average distribution for each species at each time interval. We estimated the range extent and shift of each species. Changes in range size varied across species and according to habitat dependency; future predicted range extent was negatively correlated with current predicted range extent in all scenarios. Evolution of range size under full or null dispersal scenarios varied among species from a 5% increase to an 80% decrease. The mean expected range shifts under null and full-dispersal scenarios were 175 and 200 km, respectively (range 15-399 km), and the shift was usually toward southeastern Brazil. We predicted larger range contractions and longer range shifts for forest-and grassland-dependent species than for savanna-dependent birds. A negative correlation between current range extent and predicted range loss revealed that geographically restricted species may face stronger threat and become even rarer. The predicted southeasterly direction of range changes is cause for concern because ranges are predicted to shift to the most developed and populated region of Brazil. Also, southeastern Brazil is the least likely region to contain significant dispersal corridors, to allow expansion of Cerrado vegetation types, or to accommodate creation of new reserves.

AB  - Knowledge about biodiversity remains inadequate because most species living on Earth were still not formally described (the Linnean shortfall) and because geographical distributions of most species are poorly understood and usually contain many gaps (the Wallacean shortfall). In this paper, we developed models to infer the size and placement of geographical ranges of hypothetical non-described species, based on the range size frequency distribution of anurans recently described in the Cerrado Biome, on the level of knowledge (number of inventories) and on surrogates for habitat suitability. The rationale for these models is as follow: (1) the range size frequency distribution of these species should be similar to the range-restricted species, which have been most recently described in the Cerrado Biome; (2) the probability of new discoveries will increase in areas with low biodiversity knowledge, mainly in suitable areas, and (3) assuming range continuity, new species should occupy adjacent cells only if the level of knowledge is low enough to allow the existence of undiscovered species. We ran a model based on the number of inventories only, and two models combining effects of number of inventories and two different estimates of habitat suitability, for a total of 100 replicates each. Finally, we performed a complementary analysis using simulated annealing to solve the set-covering problem for each simulation (i.e. finding the smallest number of cells so that all species are represented at least once), using extents of occurrence of 160 species (131 real anuran species plus 29 new simulated species). The revised reserve system that included information about unknown or poorly sampled taxa significantly shifted northwards, when compared to a system based on currently known species. This main result can be explained by the paucity of biodiversity data in this part of the biome, associated with its relatively high habitat suitability. As a precautionary measure, weighted by the inferred distribution data, the prioritization of a system of reserves in the north part of the biome appears to be defensible.

AB  - Vultures comprise the most endangered avian foraging guild (obligate scavengers) and their loss from ecosystems can trigger trophic cascades, mesopredator release, and human rabies epidemics, indicating their keystone species status. Vultures' extremely large home ranges, which often cross international borders of countries that have differing laws and capacity for wildlife conservation, makes conserving them challenging. However, satellite-tracking data can be used to identify habitat preferences and critical sites to target conservation actions. We tracked 16 Egyptian Vultures, Neophron percnopterus, in the Middle East and East Africa. We used dynamic Brownian bridge movement models to calculate home ranges and core-use areas, and we analyzed habitat use in a resource selection framework. Combined summer and winter ranges (99% utilization distributions) of all birds covered 209,800 and 274,300 km(2), respectively. However, the core-use areas (50% utilization distributions) in the summer and winter ranges, accounted for only 0.4-1.1% of this area (900 and 3100 km(2), respectively). These core-use areas are where the home ranges of multiple individuals overlapped and/or where individuals spent a lot of time, such as feeding and roosting sites, and are places where conservation actions could focus. Resource selection models predicted Egyptian Vulture occurrence throughout little-studied parts of the species' range in the Middle East and East Africa, and revealed strong selection for proximity to highways, power distribution lines, and towns. While providing roosts (e.g. power pylons) and food (e.g. garbage dumps), anthropogenic features may also function as ecological traps by increasing exposure to electrocution and dietary toxins.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of climate change, landscape composition, topographic attributes, and anthropogenic disturbance on wildlife distribution is critical to selecting prior conservation areas and to executing successful management plans. Habitat suitability mapping aims to predict species' ecological niches and ranges using these factors as predictors. There has been no study of the potentially suitable habitat for the data-deficient Djaffa Mountains Guereza and the factors affecting its distribution in the Ahmar Mountains. The objective of this study was to predict the habitat suitability and distribution models of Djaffa Mountains Guereza in eastern Ethiopian highland under different climate change scenarios using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model. We used 47 occurrence datasets assembled between 2020 and 2021 and 10 ecological predictor variables processed in geographical information systems and R software. We found that 133,604.52 ha (1.77%) of the 753, 0749.39 ha study area is suitable habitat for the Djaffa Mountains Guereza, of which 18,326.12 (13.33%) ha were highly suitable, whereas the remaining area was moderately suitable. Our models also showed that precipitation of the wettest quarter had the highest contribution to predicting the habitat suitability (65.90%), followed by land cover (17.40%). Habitat suitability was directly related to precipitation seasonality and the precipitation of the wettest quarter, while it is indirectly related to temperature seasonality and the temperature mean diurnal range. The models showed the overall gain in the suitable habitat of Djaffa Mountains Guereza under all future climate scenarios, however, the projected habitat distribution show fragmentation. Our habitat suitability and distribution models provide critical information for the conservation and management of Djaffa Mountains Guereza by recommending stocking of the fragmented forests, assessment of conservation challenges, and mitigations of climate change. A comprehensive population assessment throughout their restricted distribution is also crucial to understand conservation status and population size.

AB  - P>1. Identifying those areas suitable for recolonization by threatened species is essential to support efficient conservation policies. Habitat suitability models (HSM) predict species' potential distributions, but the quality of their predictions should be carefully assessed when the species-environment equilibrium assumption is violated.
   2. We studied the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra, whose numbers are recovering in southern Italy. To produce widely applicable results, we chose standard HSM procedures and looked for the models' capacities in predicting the suitability of a recolonization area. We used two fieldwork datasets: presence-only data, used in the Ecological Niche Factor Analyses (ENFA), and presence-absence data, used in a Generalized Linear Model (GLM). In addition to cross-validation, we independently evaluated the models with data from a recolonization event, providing presences on a previously unoccupied river.
   3. Three of the models successfully predicted the suitability of the recolonization area, but the GLM built with data before the recolonization disagreed with these predictions, missing the recolonized river's suitability and badly describing the otter's niche. Our results highlighted three points of relevance to modelling practices: (1) absences may prevent the models from correctly identifying areas suitable for a species spread; (2) the selection of variables may lead to randomness in the predictions; and (3) the Area Under Curve (AUC), a commonly used validation index, was not well suited to the evaluation of model quality, whereas the Boyce Index (CBI), based on presence data only, better highlighted the models' fit to the recolonization observations.
   4. For species with unstable spatial distributions, presence-only models may work better than presence-absence methods in making reliable predictions of suitable areas for expansion. An iterative modelling process, using new occurrences from each step of the species spread, may also help in progressively reducing errors.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Conservation plans depend on reliable models of the species' suitable habitats. In non-equilibrium situations, such as the case for threatened or invasive species, models could be affected negatively by the inclusion of absence data when predicting the areas of potential expansion. Presence-only methods will here provide a better basis for productive conservation management practices.

AB  - Biodiversity is multidimensional and different mechanisms can influence different dimensions. The spatial distribution of these dimensions can help in conservation decisions through the location of complementary areas with high diversity. We analyzed congruence in spatial patterns of species richness and functional diversity of cricetid rodents in the state of Oaxaca, southern Mexico, at different scales, and environmental variables related. Potential distribution models were produced for 49 species of cricetids in Maxent and superimposed to obtain potential communities in cells of 25, 50,100, 200 and 400 km(2). We estimated species richness (SR) and functional diversity (SES. FD) eliminating the species richness effect through null models. The patterns and spatial congruence of species richness and functional diversity are described. The relationships between the environmental variables (elevation, temperature, precipitation, net primary productivity and potential evapotranspiration) and the SR and SES. FD were explored using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The highest species richness was found in mountainous ecosystems while the highest functional diversity was in tropical forests, revealing a spatial incongruence among these components of biodiversity (r = -0.14, p = 0.42; Pearson correlation). The locations of the cells of low congruence varied according to spatial resolution. In univariate models, elevation was the variable that best explained species richness (R-2 = 0.77). No single variable explained the functional diversity; however, the models that included multiple environmental variables partially explained both the high and low functional diversity. The different patterns suggest that different historic, ecological and environmental processes could be responsible for the community structure of cricetid rodents in Oaxaca. These results indicate that one great challenge to be met to achieve more effective planning for biological conservation is to integrate knowledge regarding the spatial distribution of different dimensions of biodiversity.

AB  - Understanding the key drivers that influence the potential distribution of herbivore species in changing landscapes has been at the centre of enquiry in wildlife science for many decades. This knowledge is particularly important for keystone species like the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) whose population is declining even in conservation areas. The Sebungwe Region is part of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area and supports ~4,000 elephants. The Sebungwe Region has lost an estimated 76% of its elephant population over the years. This study aimed to determine how the elephant distribution in the Sebungwe Region was affected by human settlement and whether the patches for elephant distribution were large enough for elephant habitation. The prediction of the potential distribution of the elephant was based on presence-only data modelled through an ensemble algorithm that combined several candidate models to enhance predictive ability. We observed that human settlement drives the potential distribution of elephants in the Sebungwe Region (test AUC = 0.95), and patches from the model were on average <1.5 km(2). Our results provide initial insights into the key habitat factors that drive distribution of elephants in the Sebungwe landscape. Future conservation of the elephant could benefit from our study through systematic planning of settlements, which might help minimise human interaction with wildlife.

KW  - MODELS
AB  - Human-induced climate change is increasingly recognized as a fundamental driver of biological processes and patterns. Historic climate change is known to have caused shifts in the geographic ranges of many taxa and future climate change is expected to result in even greater redistributions of species. As a result, predicting the impact of climate change on future patterns of biodiversity will greatly aid conservation planning. Using the North American Breeding Bird Survey and Audubon Christmas Bird Count, two of the most comprehensive continental datasets of vertebrates in the world, and correlative distribution modeling, we assessed geographic range shifts for 588 North American bird species during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons under a range of future emission scenarios (SRES A2, A1B, B2) through the end of the century. Here we show that 314 species (53%) are projected to lose more than half of their current geographic range across three scenarios of climate change through the end of the century. For 126 species, loss occurs without concomitant range expansion; whereas for 188 species, loss is coupled with potential to colonize new replacement range. We found no strong associations between projected climate sensitivities and existing conservation prioritizations. Moreover, species responses were not clearly associated with habitat affinities, migration strategies, or climate change scenarios. Our results demonstrate the need to include climate sensitivity into current conservation planning and to develop adaptive management strategies that accommodate shrinking and shifting geographic ranges. The persistence of many North American birds will depend on their ability to colonize climatically suitable areas outside of current ranges and management actions that target climate adaptation.

AB  - Effective conservation of freshwater biodiversity requires accounting for connectivity and the propagation of threats along river networks. With this in mind, the selection of areas to conserve freshwater biodiversity is challenging when rivers cross multiple jurisdictional boundaries. We used systematic conservation planning to identify priority conservation areas for freshwater fish conservation in Hungary (Central Europe). We evaluated the importance of transboundary rivers to achieve conservation goals by systematically deleting some rivers from the prioritization procedure in Marxan and assessing the trade-offs between complexity of conservation recommendations (e.g., conservation areas located exclusively within Hungary vs. transboundary) and cost (area required). We found that including the segments of the largest transboundary rivers (i.e. Danube, Tisza) in the area selection procedure yielded smaller total area compared with the scenarios which considered only smaller national and transboundary rivers. However, analyses which did not consider these large river segments still showed that fish diversity in Hungary can be effectively protected within the country's borders in a relatively small total area (less than 20 % of the country's size). Since the protection of large river segments is an unfeasible task, we suggest that transboundary cooperation should focus on the protection of highland riverine habitats (especially Drava and Ipoly Rivers) and their valuable fish fauna, in addition to the protection of smaller national rivers and streams. Our approach highlights the necessity of examining different options for selecting priority areas for conservation in countries where transboundary river systems form the major part of water resources.

AB  - Predictive distribution models generally use data from multiple individuals each associated with a unique observation location, coupled with environmental parameters, to define the overall suitable area where the species could occur. Whether the use of multiple locations from few individuals is similarly efficient to model species distribution is not yet known. If so, the method could bring valuable inputs to identify priority conservation areas for rare or elusive species, especially those large vertebrates tracked with telemetry. Satellite tracking of long-distance migrants often produces numerous locations of surveyed individuals across their wintering ranges. We examined such wintering tracks to test if the wintering locations obtained from few tracked individuals could be useful to model the full species wintering range, using habitat suitability models. We aimed at predicting the wintering distribution of West European Black Storks Ciconia nigra. We used tracks of 9 storks, retaining one location per winter day per individual for a total of 972 different locations. Combined with bioclimatic and land cover data in habitat suitability modelling within an ensemble forecast framework, we obtained a probabilistic distribution which largely matched the previously reported wintering range of the species in western and central Africa. Using tracks of the six individuals with more than 100 locations each, we obtained a distribution range closely matching the nine-bird range. A range similar to the nine-bird range could be predicted by models using data from less numerous individuals and by considering a lower threshold value. Habitat suitability models using wintering record locations of satellite-tracked migrant birds can therefore help to get a better picture of the wintering distribution range, and hence provide more accurate information for conservation planning on African wintering grounds.

AB  - The Great Western Woodlands in S. W. Australia is the largest remaining expanse of temperate woodland on the continent and globally, providing habitat for a significance number of bird species. Conservation planning needs information about bird distributions and habitat resource requirements. Using published information, bird habitat functional groups were identified based upon species that use similar vegetation-based resources. Data from four satellite-borne sensors were analysed to model the distribution of a subset of the key vegetation variables. These results were then used to predict the potential distribution of the functional groups. Field validation suggests ongoing advances in satellite data will enhance the model's accuracy.

AB  - Japan's only native crayfish species Cambaroides japonicus has been declining dramatically in the past few decades. For the purpose of conservation planning, twenty-two coastal streams were surveyed to investigate summer distributions of crayfish in relation to stream and riparian environment. Classification and regression trees were used to predict the occurrence and abundance of crayfish. The classification tree model with stream variables as predictors showed that crayfish would occur in swift or high gradient streams (correct classification rate = 91%). Within those streams, however, crayfish only inhabited depositional microhabitats, in which the areas are limited in availability. Crayfish were not found in gentle, low gradient streams containing abundant depositional microhabitats. This paradoxical distribution pattern was attributed to availability of boulder substrates in swift or high gradient streams. The regression tree model indicated that crayfish abundance was determined primarily by the percentage of boulder substrates and the presence of fish (observed vs. predicted r = 0.64).
   The classification tree model using only riparian variables indicated that the total woody plant (mainly broadleaf species) density followed by the percentage of early successional species such as alder and willow determined the splits of the tree model (correct classification rate = 95%). A leaf processing experiment on 10 riparian plant species suggested that crayfish preferred high nitrogen (or low C/N) leaves.
   These results suggest that swift or high gradient fishless streams associated with abundant cover in dense broadleaf forest serve conservation areas for this endangered crayfish, and that consideration of riparian composition may facilitate conservation efforts.

AB  - The status of the arboreal squirrels of Mexico was analyzed as a model taxon to elucidate the urgent need that exists worldwide to allocate more funding and research effort to less charismatic species. To accomplish this, we surveyed the literature to review their diversity and present distribution, state of scientific knowledge, and conservation status. We also examined diversity patterns and threats to their persistence. There are currently 14 recognized species, of which four are endemic to the country, with the states of Chiapas and San Luis Potosi possessing the greatest diversity. Presently, seven species are federally listed under some category of risk in Mexico. Our survey yielded only 37 peer-reviewed publications, revealing that a critical dearth of information still exists on the arboreal squirrels of Mexico. We found that states with a greater diversity of arboreal squirrels also have a higher annual wood production, possibly posing a serious threat to their persistence. A common threat to all species is habitat loss caused by deforestation with annual rates >1.0% in the country. Like other less charismatic species in the world, information from local populations is needed to establish suitable regional plans to conserve species facing specific anthropogenic threats.

AB  - Several species worldwide show rapid range retraction due to habitat degradation, and some of them have restricted distribution and specific resource needs. Such cases deserve particular attention and need urgent conservation actions to avoid extinction, and one way is to facilitate colonisation of new habitats by resource supplementation. Here, we investigate the changes in range distribution, during the last decade (2007-2016), of an endangered endemic damselfly, Calopteryx exul Selys, and assess the importance of its favourite host-plant (Potamogeton nodosus) in colonisation and population dynamics in the last existing population of Algeria. We first used dynamic occupancy models to assess range distribution dynamics and we found that both occupancy and colonisation probabilities of the species were positively dependent on the occurrence of P. nodosus. There was also evidence that extinction probability increased with habitat disturbance but decreased with the occurrence of P. nodosus. Our experimental restoration showed that the augmentation of patches of P. nodosus increased the total number of individuals, the number of reproductive events and philopatry. Our study highlights the importance of insect-plant relationship in the establishment of effective restoration plans because of their implication in colonisation and extinction processes and population dynamics. Since most insect species from different orders and ecosystems are ecologically dependent on plants, our restoration approach may benefit a large range of threatened species and improve their conservation status.

AB  - Transferability of species distribution models is crucial for supporting biological conservation and management planning in the face of climate changes; however, there is a lack of understanding in how to achieve transference spatially and temporally, especially in a multispecies circumstance. This study evaluated the roles of model complexity and time scope in temporal transferability for multispecies distribution modelling. We collected data of multispecies distribution from a seven-year marine survey in coastal Yellow Sea, China, and used the data to evaluate the predictive performances of an array of multi-species distribution models (constrained linear ordination, constrained additive ordination, hierarchical models of species communities, multivariate random forests, multivariate tree boosting model, and multivariate artificial neural network), characterized by different structures, levels of complexity and time spans with 36 models and 50 scenarios. Our study showed that model transference was proper for some species but limited at the community level in general, and no specific modelling algorithm (regression models/machine-learning) or level of model complexity was found to be superior. Instead, model structure, features of target species, and time scope contributed substantially and influenced transferability in a contingent way. Temporal transferability tended to increase with the length of training periods and decay with the time gaps of prediction, whereas the magnitude varied among modelling algorithms. In addition, prolonging the time series of survey programs alone may have limited effectiveness on community-level transferability. This study contributes to the understanding of temporal transferability of multi-species distribution models and inform their applications in biological conservation and management from a temporal perspective.

AB  - Marxan is the most common decision-support tool used to inform the design of protected-area systems. The original version of Marxan does not consider risk and uncertainty associated with threatening processes affecting protected areas, including uncertainty about the location and condition of species' populations and habitats now and in the future. We described and examined the functionality of a modified version of Marxan, Marxan with Probability. This software explicitly considers 4 types of uncertainty: probability that a feature exists in a particular place (estimated based on species distribution models or spatially explicit population models); probability that features in a site will be lost in the future due to a threatening process, such as climate change, natural catastrophes, and uncontrolled human interventions; probability that a feature will exist in the future due to natural successional processes, such as a fire or flood; and probability the feature exists but has been degraded by threatening processes, such as overfishing or pollution, and thus cannot contribute to conservation goals. We summarized the results of 5 studies that illustrate how each type of uncertainty can be used to inform protected area design. If there were uncertainty in species or habitat distribution, users could maximize the chance that these features were represented by including uncertainty using Marxan with Probability. Similarly, if threatening processes were considered, users minimized the chance that species or habitats were lost or degraded by using Marxan with Probability. Marxan with Probability opens up substantial new avenues for systematic conservation planning research and application by agencies.

AB  - In North Africa, and especially in the Sahara Desert, biodiversity is poorly known. Of the five widespread canid species present, one is Data Deficient, three are considered widespread although habitat selection could limit their area of occupancy, and distribution maps available are coarse for conservation planning. This study identifies biogeographic patterns in North-African Canids through the combination of high resolution presence data with 16 environmental factors. Predictive models trained in north-west Africa are projected to all North Africa. Canids exhibited distinct biogeographical affinities. GIS tools and Maximum Entropy models identify a mixture of climatic and habitat factors as main predictors of species occurrence. Suitable habitats for North-African Canids are mostly fragmented: probable occurrence was identified for Canis aureus in Saharan peripheral regions and mountains, for Vulpes pallida in a narrow band along the Sahel and in southern Saharan mountains, for Vulpes rueppellii throughout the Sahara, for Vulpes vulpes in northern Africa until the Sahara northern limit, and for Vulpes zerda in almost all Sahara. Areas of potential sympatry between species with similar niches and parapatric ranges are identified along relatively narrow bands. The small pixel size of projections allows the identification of suitable refuges for species otherwise absent in the driest Saharan habitats, providing framework data for the definition of the global conservation status of V. pallida, and conservation strategies for the guild. The biological value of Saharan mountains is emphasised as they constitute isolated suitable areas. Ecological-niche based models should be developed for other endangered Saharan vertebrates.

AB  - Recovery planning for species listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has been hampered by a lack of consistency and transparency, which can be improved by implementing a standardized approach for evaluating species status and developing measurable recovery criteria. However, managers lack an assessment method that integrates threat abatement and can be used when demographic data are limited. To help meet these needs, we demonstrated an approach for evaluating species status based on habitat configuration data. We applied 3 established persistence measures (patch occupancy, metapopulation capacity, and proportion of population lost) to compare 2 conservation strategies (critical habitat designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service's Carbonate Habitat Management Strategy) and 2 threat scenarios (maximum limestone mining, removal of all habitat in areas with mining claims; minimum mining, removal of habitat only in areas with existing operations and high-quality ore) against a baseline of existing habitat for 3 federally listed plant species. Protecting all area within the designated critical habitat maintained a similar level (83.9-99.9%) of species persistence as the baseline, whereas maximum mining greatly reduced persistence (0.51-38.4% maintained). The 3 persistence measures provided complementary insights reflecting different aspects of habitat availability (total area, number of patches, patch size, and connectivity). These measures can be used to link recovery criteria developed following the 3 R principles (representation, redundancy, and resilience) to the resulting improvements in species viability. By focusing on amount and distribution of habitat, our method provides a means of assessing the status of data-poor species to inform decision making under the Endangered Species Act.

AB  - Understanding large-scale patterns of beta- and alpha diversity is essential for ecoregional conservation planning. Using the 110,000 km(2) shallow basin of the Beni savannas of northeastern Bolivia, we examined the spatial patterns of biological diversity of four taxonomic groups (bats, palms, reptiles, and amphibians). Since the Beni savannas are shaped by cycles of drought and flood, and farming, which, together with topography, create a mosaic of sub-ecoregions from Amazonian forests to aquatic vegetation, we hypothesize that this landscape heterogeneity results in a high turnover in species composition across sub-ecoregions. We compiled species lists for each taxon and modeled the potential distribution of each species using the algorithm MaxEnt. For those species whose modeled potential distribution produced incongruous results, we built presence-absence maps. Using the potential distribution maps, we estimated the lists of species for each sub-ecoregion. In order to establish present similarities in species composition between sub-ecoregions, we constructed dendrograms using cluster analysis of presence-absence matrices. The sub-ecoregions associated with the Moxos (southern part of the Beni savannas) were richer than the sub-ecoregions composing the Beni Cerrado (northern part of the Beni savannas). Centers of species richness were detected in the savanna-type sub-ecoregions (bats and reptiles) or associated with the Varzea forests (palms and amphibians). A south-north gradient in the pattern of distribution of four taxonomic groups was also recorded. The results suggest that the patterns of biological diversity partially respond to the mosaic arrangement of the landscape. Future exercises on conservation planning will point to total target areas about 5,000 kmA(2). This area seems to be sufficient to contain the biological richness of the region at least for the taxa analyzed.

AB  - To develop appropriate spatial conservation planning for individual species, it is important to understand their habitat requirements and in particular to identify areas where critical life-history process such as breeding, weaning or feeding take place. The process of defining critical habitat often ignores behavioural aspects of animal distribution, which for highly migratory species like baleen whales whose feeding and breeding grounds are clearly demarcated and widely separated is not a problem. However, for other species like the endangered 'Eastern North Pacific southern resident' killer whale stock, critical life-history processes occur in the same waters. This killer whale stock lives in a topographically complex region (many islands) off the west coast of Canada/USA, which makes accurate mapping of densities or behaviours difficult using traditional generalised additive models. We present results on the spatial distribution of southern resident killer whale feeding grounds in 2006, using a binomial, complex region spatial smoothing model within a generalised estimating equation framework, which allows for both complex topography and correlated residuals. The model performs well and suggests a region to the south of San Juan Island as an area with a high probability of feeding, which could not have been as accurately established from a more traditional presence-absence model. We also calculate estimates of precision, which other studies did not include, enabling more informed management decisions for spatial conservation planning. A vignette containing the code along with an R workspace and function file is provided to allow the user to fit the models presented in this paper.

AB  - Savalia savaglia is an ecosystem engineer listed as Near-Threatened by the IUCN, even though effective management and proper monitoring efforts to assess its distribution is still lacking. The record of large, longestablished colonies can indicate the occurrence of areas with limited human local pressure. These areas may be considered as proxies for the creation of baselines of reference useful to design restoration strategies. The aim of this work was to update the distribution of S. savaglia Mediterranean populations to develop an Ecological Niche Model, highlighting potential areas for future monitoring programs. Occurrence data were collected and harmonized into a single dataset using the scientific literature and validated observations to feed a presence-only MaxEnt model, obtaining a basin-level potential distribution of the species. The results of our study can support decision-makers in marine spatial planning measures including the preservation of mesophotic environments and prioritizing areas for conservation.

AB  - Management of the marine environment is often hampered by a lack of comprehensive spatial information on the distribution of diversity and the bio-physical processes structuring regional ecosystems. This is particularly true in temperate reef systems beyond depths easily accessible to divers. Yet these systems harbor a diversity of sessile life that provide essential ecosystem services, sustain fisheries and, as with shallower ecosystems, are also increasingly vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts and environmental change. Here we use cutting-edge tools (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and ship-borne acoustics) and analytical approaches (predictive modelling) to quantify and map these highly productive ecosystems. We find the occurrence of key temperate-reef biota can be explained and predicted using standard (depth) and novel (texture) surrogates derived from multibeam acoustic data, and geographic surrogates. This suggests that combinations of fine-scale processes, such as light limitation and habitat complexity, and broad-scale processes, such as regional currents and exposure regimes, are important in structuring these diverse deep-reef communities. While some dominant habitat forming biota, including canopy algae, were widely distributed, others, including gorgonians and sea whips, exhibited patchy and restricted distributions across the reef system. In addition to providing the first quantitative and full coverage maps of reef diversity for this area, our modelling revealed that offshore reefs represented a regional diversity hotspot that is of high ecological and conservation value. Regional reef systems should not, therefore, be considered homogenous units in conservation planning and management. Full-coverage maps of the predicted distribution of biota (and associated uncertainty) are likely to be increasingly valuable, not only for conservation planning, but in the ongoing management and monitoring of these less-accessible ecosystems.

AB  - The aim of this work was to characterize the anuran communities of the Santa Fe Islands National Park. There were 9 campaigns from September 2018 to March 2019 and 3 collecting methods were used: pitfall traps, surveys for tadpoles, and active nocturnal searches. Sample efficiency was analyzed by means of species accumulation curves using 4 estimators: ACE, ICE, Jackknife 1 and Chao 2. To determine the model of species abundance distribution, goodness-of-fit tests chi(2) were performed. The richness, true diversity and the evenness of the communities were calculated. There were 14 species of anurans recorded, 9 of which constitute new records for the park. Sampling efficiency exceeded 94% in all estimators. The most abundant species were: Leptodactylus latrans, Elachistocleis bicolor, Dendropsophus nanus, Boana punctata, Boana pulchella and Lysapsus limellum. The data was fitted to the normal logarithmic distribution model. The total true diversity was D = 7.94 while evenness was J = 0.79. The true diversity found was lower than what was recorded in Pre-Delta National Park, a temperate wetland of similar characteristics. These contributions are useful to start action plans for the conservation of amphibians in the area.

AB  - Freshwater fish are recognized to be endangered worldwide, but wide gaps in species distribution knowledge limit the implementation of effective conservation plans. The BioFresh project aims to produce the widest synthesis at the national level. The aim of this research is assessing the comprehensiveness and representativeness of information included in the Italian synthesis, composed of 10000 sampling sites and 50000 fish presence records. The assessment was produced at the secondary river basin (SRB) level in two distinct periods, past (1984-1999) and recent (2000-2014), comparing different statistical models of frequency counts of species detected within each SRB. The results highlighted a poor overall knowledge of the Italian fish distribution for both periods. In the all-species dataset, only 11.8 % and 11.1 % of the SRBs were found to have been sufficiently explored in the past and recent periods, respectively. In the native species dataset, these percentages increased to 16 % and 24.7 % respectively, which suggests the presence of background noise in the richness estimates produced by exotic species. Although the information available is far from exhaustive, the BioFresh project, in which data collected over a wide time span are georeferenced and freely available, represents the first synthesis for future research aimed at the management and conservation of the Italian fish fauna.

AB  - Categorization of species under different threat classes is a pre-requisite for planning, management and monitoring of any species conservation programme. However, data availability, particularly at the population level, has been a major bottleneck in the correct categorization of threatened species. Till date, threat assessments have been mostly based on expert opinion and/or herbarium records. The availability of primary data on distribution of species and their population attributes is limited in India because of inadequate field survey, which has been ascribed to resource constraints and inaccessibility. In this study, we demonstrate that ecological niche modelling (ENM) can be an economical and effective tool to guide surveys overcoming the above two constraints leading to the discovery of new populations of threatened species. Such data lead to improved threat assessment and more accurate categorization. We selected 14 threatened plants comprising 5 trees (Acer hookeri Miq., Bhesa robusta (Roxb.) Ding Hou, Gynocardia odorata Roxb., Ilex venulosa Hook. f. and Lagerstroemia minu-ticarpa Debb. ex P.C. Kanjilal), 8 herbs (Angelica glauca Edgew., Aquilegia nivalis Falc. ex Jackson, Artemisia amygdalina DC., Begonia satrapis C.B. Clarke, Corydalis cashmeriana Royle, Dactylorhiza hatagirea (D. Don) Soo, Podophyllum hexandrum Royle, and Rheum australe D. Don), and 1 pteridophyte (Angiopteris evecta (Forst.) Hoffm.) having distribution range in North East India, Eastern and Western Himalaya, and Jammu and Kashmir. The study was carried out between 2012 and 2016. ENM-based survey led to the discovery and characterization of 348 new populations. The data so obtained helped in assigning conservation status to 10 species, which earlier were never classified due to data deficiency. Using the new population and distribution data of the remaining four species, only one was confirmed regarding its existing status and two species were classified as 'Critically endangered' instead of the present classification as 'Endangered'. The fourth species was classified as 'Critically endangered' against the earlier category of 'Least concerned'.

AB  - We investigated habitat drivers of occurrence of five common forest bird species (Erithacus rubecula, Phylloscopus collybita, Sylvia atricapilla, Periparus ater, Fringilla coelebs) at the uppermargin of their range in the Alps. Our work aimed to i) identify methods to analyse species-habitat relationships at the margin of species distribution, ii) provide recommendations for conservation and management in this changing environment. We recorded species occurrence at 149 points in Trento province (Italy; 1,365-2,200 m a.s.l.), and related occurrence to elevation and cover of habitats in a 100-m radius. We estimated factors affecting occurrence by single-species and multi-response MARS models. We also evaluated factors driving the overall species richness at point counts by means of a glmmPQL approach. Multi-response models performed well (in general they performed better than single-species models) and suggested important effects of elevation (negative), conifer forest (not significant for P. collybita, positive up to a threshold for other species) and wood pasture (not significant for S. atricapilla, positive for other species). Conifer forest, wood pastures, shrubland and elevation affected the number of species at point counts (positive effect for all variables except for elevation). Multi-responsemodels may help elucidate ecological relationships for 'rare' species, including common species at the margin of their range. Wood pasture promoted the occurrence of common forest species and the number of species, even if scarcely represented, and thus could deserve more consideration in conservation and management planning, given that several species are of high conservation concern.
