AB  - Even though information on global biodiversity trends becomes increasingly available, large taxonomic and spatial data gaps persist at the scale relevant to planning conservation interventions. This is because data collectors are hesitant to share data with global repositories due to workload, lack of incentives, and perceived risk of losing intellectual property rights. In contrast, due to greater conceptual and methodological proximity, taxon-specific database initiatives can provide more direct benefits to data collectors through research collaborations and shared authorship. The IUCNSSC Ape Populations, Environments and Surveys (A.P.E.S.) database was created in 2005 as a repository for data on great apes and other primate taxa. It aims to acquire field survey data and make different types of data accessible, and provide up-to-date species status information. To support the current update of the conservation action plan for western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) we compiled field surveys for this taxon from IUCN SSC A.P.E.S., 75% of which were unpublished. We used spatial modeling to infer total population size, range-wide density distribution, population connectivity and landscape-scale metrics. We estimated a total abundance of 52 800 (95% CI 17 577-96 564) western chimpanzees, of which only 17% occurred in national parks. We also found that 10% of chimpanzees live within 25 km of four multi-national 'development corridors' currently planned for West Africa. These large infrastructure projects aim to promote economic integration and agriculture expansion, but are likely to cause further habitat loss and reduce population connectivity. We close by demonstrating the wealth of conservation-relevant information derivable from a taxon-specific database like IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. and propose that a network of many more such databases could be created to provide the essential information to conservation that can neither be supplied by one-off projects nor by global repositories, and thus are highly complementary to existing initiatives.

AB  - Spatial transfers of species distribution models (SDMs) are often applied in the study of land use and climate-change effects, spread of invasive species and conservation planning. However, model transferability and risk of error are rarely evaluated prior to predicting species distribution to different regions. We aim to assess spatial transferability of SDMs for stream fish and to evaluate the effect of model types and habitat heterogeneity on transferability. We developed SDMs for 21 fish species and made predictions of occurrence of these species among five pairs of river catchments (i.e. model transfers). Forty eight transfers were made for each of three modelling approaches (Lasso-regularised logistic regression (LLR), boosted regression trees (BRT) and MaxEnt) after incorporating spatial autocorrelation. In addition to internal and external evaluation of discrimination power, we assessed the cross-catchment consistency of variable selections, fish-habitat relationships and predicted probabilities of species presences. Approximately half of 144 spatial transfers of SDMs had moderate to high discrimination power. Discrimination power was low for the rest of the models. Incorporating spatial autocorrelation could not improve discrimination power in the model transfers. Friedman test showed that BRT did not differ significantly from LLR but it outperformed MaxEnt in terms of AUC in the model transfers. BRT and LLR models tended to have high overall accuracy and specificity, whereas MaxEnt tended to have high sensitivity in the model transfers. The degree of model transferability varied among species, and was asymmetric when reciprocal transfers were made between paired catchments. Ranks of variable importance in BRT models differed among catchments for most species. Temperature, base flow index, altitude and habitat condition index were more often ranked as the most important predictors in the five study river catchments, although the functional forms of their effects on fish presence were sometimes inconsistent between paired catchments. Compared to published transferability of some terrestrial taxa SDMs, spatial transferability of stream-fish distribution models was limited, reflecting the natural barriers to dispersal among catchments, and the necessity of evaluating model transferability in conservation applications (e.g. evaluation of climate- or landscape-change effects, invasive species risk assessments and species reintroduction planning). We suggest the following strategies to enhance spatial transferability: (i) match the range and location of the habitat predictors between the model region and prediction region, or alternatively choose a model training region with a large extent and a wide range of environmental gradients; (ii) use presence-absence models such as BRT and LLR and (iii) include habitat features with a sound ecological basis such as temperature and hydrology.

AB  - Aim The management and restoration of ecological processes mediated by biotic interactions is now broadly advocated and may be achieved by targeting restoration towards key agents. Although theoretically examined, a practical approach to incorporating the physiology and energetics of insects into restoration planning is poorly articulated. I aimed to provide a case study using the thermal biology and energetics of beetles to identify the distribution of habitat suitability in a large restoration landscape. Location South-west Western Australia. Methods I modelled the thermal performance of metabolic rates of thirteenPhyllococerus purpurascens,and twentyColpochila"species 2," measured repeatedly at seven temperatures between five and 40 degrees C using flow-through respirometry. Thermal constraints were used to inform a species distribution model of each species at extremely high spatiotemporal resolution, projecting the physiological state of each species for every hour at 5 '' resolution across a 152-km(2)restoration landscape in south-western Australia to estimate the habitat suitability for beetles. Results Both species' metabolic rates increased exponentially to a critical point, followed by rapid decline, but the thermal tolerance thresholds were different for each species. Both had strikingly high-thermal tolerance relative to their nocturnal habits and local climatic conditions. The models of beetle prevalence estimated both species to be active and able to access the entire project area for all of the austral spring, summer and autumn. Main conclusions The results reported here suggest ubiquitous habitat suitability for flower beetles in disturbed landscapes. Incorporation of similar mechanistic models for other species at high resolution offers potential insight into habitat suitability for a broad range of ectotherms.

AB  - In systematic conservation planning, species distribution data for all sites in a planning area are used to prioritize each site in terms of the site's importance toward meeting the goal of species representation. But comprehensive species data are not available in most planning areas and would be expensive to acquire. As a shortcut, ecologists use surrogates, such as occurrences of birds or another well-surveyed taxon, or land types defined from remotely sensed data, in the hope that sites that represent the surrogates also represent biodiversity. Unfortunately, surrogates have not performed reliably. We propose a new type of surrogate, predicted importance, that can be developed from species data for a q% subset of sites. With species data from this subset of sites, importance can be modeled as a function of abiotic variables available at no charge for all terrestrial areas on Earth. Predicted importance can then be used as a surrogate to prioritize all sites. We tested this surrogate with 8 sets of species data. For each data set, we used a q% subset of sites to model importance as a function of abiotic variables, used the resulting function to predict importance for all sites, and evaluated the number of species in the sites with highest predicted importance. Sites with the highest predicted importance represented species efficiently for all data sets when q = 25% and for 7 of 8 data sets when q = 20%. Predicted importance requires less survey effort than direct selection for species representation and meets representation goals well compared with other surrogates currently in use. This less expensive surrogate may be useful in those areas of the world that need it most, namely tropical regions with the highest biodiversity, greatest biodiversity loss, most severe lack of inventory data, and poorly developed protected area networks.

AB  - The development of species distribution models (SDMs) can help conservation efforts by generating potential distributions and identifying areas of high environmental suitability for protection. Our study presents a distribution and habitat map for lowland tapir in South America. We also describe the potential habitat suitability of various geographical regions and habitat loss, inside and outside of protected areas network. Two different SDM approaches, MAXENT and ENFA, produced relative different Habitat Suitability Maps for the lowland tapir. While MAXENT was efficient at identifying areas as suitable or unsuitable, it was less efficient (when compared to the results by ENFA) at identifying the gradient of habitat suitability. MAXENT is a more multifaceted technique that establishes more complex relationships between dependent and independent variables. Our results demonstrate that for at least one species, the lowland tapir, the use of a simple consensual approach (average of ENFA and MAXENT models outputs) better reflected its current distribution patterns. The Brazilian ecoregions have the highest habitat loss for the tapir. Cerrado and Atlantic Forest account for nearly half (48.19%) of the total area lost. The Amazon region contains the largest area under protection, and the most extensive remaining habitat for the tapir, but also showed high levels of habitat loss outside protected areas, which increases the importance of support for proper management.

AB  - Sites where edaphic endemic plants have evolved exist in isolated, often small patches throughout the Great Basin. Gypsophytes, plants that live on gypsum soil outcrops, are one group of edaphic endemic plants about which information on localities and habitat requirements is needed. An opportunity to provide some protection to gypsophyte species in White River Valley, Nevada, arose with the revision of Ely BLM's Resource Management Plan. Field surveys to gather locality data were performed in 2005 and 2007, and 1840 new localities were identified. Species distribution modeling can be a useful tool for delineating areas for special management to benefit species of concern. Species distribution model inputs included gypsophyte localities, elevation, slope, aspect, and remotely sensed data on probability of gypsum springmound occurrence. Model outputs were refined using field surveys, and four sites with gypsum springmounds with BLM sensitive-status gypsophytes for Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) status were proposed. These four sites have since been designated, and provide some degree of protection to gypsophytes, though the scattered, isolated nature of gypsum springmounds and other edaphic endemic plant habitats highlights the importance of the use of rare plant locality point data, as well as remotely sensed data and field surveys by land management agency staff in carrying out National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning for projects that have the potential to harm rare plant populations.
   "On the alkaline flats by the lower waters of the White River, where the deep, somewhat sandy, alluvial soil is overlaid with a dazzling rime of mineral salts, [F. gypsicola] occurs in abundance over a small area, and the heavy, depressed tufts of pale, grass-like foliage, which erupt towards midsummer into innumerable slender panicles of blossom, form a striking feature of the sparse but highly interesting saline flora."

AB  - Aim The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is an endangered cetacean found throughout Southeast Asia. The main threat to this species is human encroachment, led by entanglement in fishing gear. Information on this data-poor species' ecology and habitat use is needed to effectively inform spatial management.
   Location We investigated the habitat of a previously unstudied group of Irrawaddy dolphins in the eastern Gulf of Thailand, between the villages of Laem Klat and Khlong Yai, in Trat Province. This location is important as government groups plan to establish a marine protected area.
   Methods We carried out boat-based visual line transect surveys with concurrent oceanographic measurements and used hurdle models to evaluate this species' patterns of habitat use in this area.
   Results Depth most strongly predicted dolphin presence, while temperature was a strong predictor of group size. The highest probability of dolphin presence occurred at around 10.0 m with an optimal depth range of 7.50 to 13.05 m. The greatest number of dolphins was predicted at 24.93 degrees C with an optimal range between 24.93 and 25.31 degrees C. Dolphins are most likely to occur in two primary locations, one large region in the center of the study area (11(o)54 ' 18 '' N to 11(o)59 ' 23 '' N) and a smaller region in the south (11(o)47 ' 28 '' N to 11(o)49 ' 59 '' N). Protections for this population will likely have the greatest chance of success in these two areas.
   Main Conclusions The results of this work can inform management strategies within the immediate study area by highlighting areas of high habitat use that should be considered for marine spatial planning measures, such as the creation of marine protected areas. Species distribution models for this species in Thailand can also assist conservation planning in other parts of the species' range by expanding our understanding of habitat preferences.

AB  - Conservation managers and policy makers require models that can rank the impacts of multiple, interacting threats on biodiversity so that actions can be prioritized. An integrated modelling framework was used to predict the viability of plant populations for five species in southern California's Mediterranean-type ecosystem. The framework integrates forecasts of land-use change from an urban growth model with projections of future climatically-suitable habitat from climate and species distribution models, which are linked to a stochastic population model. The population model incorporates the effects of disturbance regimes and management actions on population viability. This framework: (1) ranks threats by their relative and cumulative impacts on population viability, such as land-use change, climate change, altered disturbance regimes or invasive species, and (2) ranks management responses in terms of their effectiveness for land protection, assisted dispersal, fire management and invasive species control. Too-frequent fire was often the top threat for the species studied, thus fire reduction was ranked the most important management option. Projected changes in suitable habitat as a result of climate change were generally large, but varied across species and climate scenarios; urban development could exacerbate loss of suitable habitat.

AB  - Advances in technology have allowed ecologists to employ remote observations of individual organism's spatial location. These data are used to model species distributions and habitat associations, which inform conservation efforts and management plans. These data are not without error. To illustrate the consequences of not considering measurement error, I introduce measurement error to a habitat selection model, using three different distributions. I show how measurement error can confound inferences made about a hypothetical organism's true habitat selection. By simulating different initial strengths of selection I show the introduction of measurement error results in the largest reduction in habitat selection strength (from truth) for very selective individuals (habitat specialists). Not surprisingly, the inclusion of error in very weakly selective individuals (habitat generalists) can result in a switching from true selection to observed avoidance. Researchers need to be aware that, first, there is measurement error in remotely observed data, and second, a tradeoff occurs between measurement error and landscape fragmentation. Landscapes with a high degree of fragmentation require spatially accurate (low measurement error) data in order to make reliable estimates of habitat selection or species distribution. The results of this study are discussed in light of the conservation of species threatened by habitat fragmentation and the management suggestions arising from selection studies.

AB  - Integration of unexpected discoveries about charismatic species can disrupt their well-established recovery plans, particularly when this requires coordinate actions among the different governments responsible. The Critically Endangered Coronopus navasii (Brassicaceae) was considered a restricted endemism to a few Mediterranean temporary ponds in a high mountain range of Southeast Spain, until a new group of populations were discovered 500 km North in 2006. Ten years after this finding, its management has not been accommodated due to limited information of the new populations and administrative inertia. In this study, DNA sequences and species distribution models are used to analyse the origin of the C. navasii disjunction as a preliminary step to reassess its recovery plan. Molecular results placed the disjunction during Miocene-Pleistocene (6.30-0.49 Mya, plastid DNA; 1.45-0.03 Mya, ribosomal DNA), which discards a putative human-mediated origin. In fact, the haplotype network and the low gene flow estimated between disjunct areas suggest long-term isolation. Dispersal is the most likely explanation for the disjunction as interpreted from the highly fragmented distribution projected to the past. Particularly, a northward dispersal from Southeast is proposed since C. navasii haplotype network is connected to the sister-group through the southern haplotype. Although the reassessment of C. navasii conservation status is more optimistic under the new extent of occurrence, its long-term survival may be compromised due to the: (1) natural fragmentation and rarity of the species habitat, (2) genetic isolation between the two disjunct areas, and (3) northward shift of suitable areas under future climate change scenarios. Several ex-situ and in-situ conservation measures are proposed for integrating Central East Spanish populations into the on-going recovery plan, which still only contemplates Southeast populations and therefore does not preserve the genetic structure and diversity of the species.

AB  - Conservation of bird populations is increasingly focused on landscapes. We combined data collected in 2005-2011 from 16,250 North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) survey points with local and remotely sensed environmental data to model the distribution of 7 grassland bird species in the Northern Great Plains of the United States. We analyzed data at the survey point level, which is consistent with the scale of conservation treatments that we apply, and avoided information loss caused by pooling data at the BBS route level. By accounting for observer effects, nesting of survey points within routes, and sequence of survey points, we accommodated BBS survey design, refined estimates of important habitat predictors, improved model fit, and reduced or eliminated positive spatial autocorrelation in model residuals. The predictive power of models was greatly increased by including variables that characterized annual and long-term precipitation, as well as local land cover attributes not available from satellite-derived land cover data. Occurrence models from survey-point-level BBS data and environmental data with high thematic resolution were able to describe habitat relationships that are often associated with fine-grained, local studies, but across broad spatial extents and at scales relevant to local conservation actions. Predicted occurrence was strongly correlated with observed numbers, suggesting that occurrence models may be useful indicators of density. Relationships derived from models allowed us to develop spatially explicit decision support tools, which can be used to target areas for conservation treatments and to assess the conservation actions of multiple conservation programs and joint ventures (e.g., Prairie Pothole, Rainwater Basin, and Northern Great Plains joint ventures) in the U.S. Northern Great Plains.

AB  - Human development is increasing pressure on North America's mainly intact boreal forest. We outline the need for a comprehensive synthesis of existing data and for effective scientific tools to support conservation of this biome and of the birds that depend on it. To illustrate how broad collaborations can address these needs, we introduce and report on the Boreal Avian Modelling Project. This is a new partnership involving universities, government, private, and nongovernment groups that was created to develop spatially explicit, predictive models of boreal bird habitat associations across Canada. This initiative is designed to improve our understanding of the influence of environmental factors and human activities on boreal bird species, leading to spatially explicit predictive models of the distribution of avian populations. The intended applications of these models are land use planning and avian conservation across the nearctic boreal forest. In this essay, we present a description of the extensive collection of point count survey data assembled by the Project, and the library of spatial covariates used for modeling. We show how it is possible to account for a number of nuisance variables related to differences in survey protocol among source data sets and make some preliminary suggestions as to how future surveys could be standardized. We present a distance-sampling approach used to convert standardized point count data to density estimates, which we illustrate by providing habitat-specific densities and total population estimates for one species in a part of western Canada. We also illustrate the use of Classification and Regression Trees to develop species niche models from the standardized data. We conclude with a discussion of the need for a monitoring program for boreal birds in Canada, the role of predictive statistical models in developing such a program, and how monitoring could be related to boreal bird conservation through adaptive management.

AB  - We modelled the potential habitat of a threatened species D. fissum subsp. sordidum, an endemic hemicryptophyte with a disjunct distribution in the Iberian Peninsula. Maxent was used to predict the subspecies habitat suitability by relating field sample-based distributional information with environmental and topographic variables. Our results suggest that the model performed well, predicting with high accuracy the current distribution of the species. The variables that most contributed to the model were Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter (MTWtQ), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (PWmQ), Temperature Annual Range (TAR) and Slope (Slo). These variables are biological significant for the taxon, as they have decisive influence in the critical stages of germination and fruiting. The current and potential distributional areas identified by the model fall mainly in regions with some degree of environmental protection, with some exceptions. A recovery plan for the species should be considered. Species Distribution Modelling cannot substitute long-term monitoring programmes, yet it is a useful tool for identifying appropriate areas of taxon occurrence, and thus allow for efficient use of the economic and human resources.

AB  - Creative approaches to identifying umbrella species hold promise for devising effective surrogates of ecological communities or ecosystems. However, mechanistic niche models that predict range or habitat overlap among species may yet lack development. We reviewed literature on taxon-centered Bayesian belief network (BBN) models to explore a novel approach to identify umbrella taxa identifying taxonomic groups that share the largest proportion of habitat requirements (i.e., states of important habitat variables) with other wetland-dependent taxa. We reviewed and compiled published literature to provide a comprehensive and reproducible account of the current understanding of habitat requirements for freshwater, wetland-dependent taxa using BBNs. We found that wetland birds had the highest degree of shared habitat requirements with other taxa, and consequently may be suitable umbrella taxa in freshwater wetlands. Comparing habitat requirements using a BBN approach to build species distribution models, this review also identified taxa that may not benefit from conservation actions targeted at umbrella taxa by identifying taxa with unique habitat requirements not shared with umbrellas. Using a standard node set that accurately and comprehensively represents the ecosystem in question, BBNs could be designed to improve identification of umbrella taxa. In wetlands, expert knowledge about hydrology, geomorphology and soils could add important information regarding physical landscape characteristics relevant to species. Thus, a systems-oriented framework may improve overarching inferences from BBNs and subsequent utility to conservation planning and management.

AB  - Climate change has the potential to severely threaten the plant species in the forests of northeastern China. The field surveys performed for this study spanned 4 years and identified the endangered species present in the forests of northeastern China. We conducted a detailed investigation of 2,884 study plots and selected 29 nationally protected plant species (sample sizes >= 5), namely, threatened species for further analysis. We modelled and mapped the potential distributions of these 29 threatened species, and found that threatened species richness hotspots are currently distributed in the eastern and northeastern areas of the studied region and will move geographically. This study focused on the strategy for protecting threatened forest species richness by analysing the change trend of species richness and planning of priority protection areas due to climate change.

AB  - Here, we used the maximum entropy (MAXENT) method to predict habitat distribution of the Persian squirrel in oak forests of Kurdistan Province, western Iran. We used 70 points with known occurrence of the species and 17 environmental variables (climatic variables represented annual trends in temperature and precipitation, seasonality and extreme or limiting environmental factors) to map the species distribution. The MAXENT model showed high performance. Using a 0.5 logistic probability threshold, the models suggested about 16,783.5 ha of the study area to have high suitability for the Persian squirrel. These areas were thus estimated as "good" habitats. Amongst the environmental variables, land cover had the greatest role in the Persian squirrel's distribution. Precipitation and temperature were the two major climatic factors that affected the Persian squirrel's distribution. Gap analysis showed that many parts of the species habitat have remained unprotected what can threaten the survival of the studied species in the region. These findings can be used to develop conservation management plans and boost the network of protected areas in the region.

AB  - Estimating and planning for the impacts of climate change on the biodiversity of protected areas is a major challenge for conservation managers. When these areas are topographically heterogenous and contain species' entire ranges, this challenge is exacerbated because the coarse spatial scales of Global Circulation Model projections provide limited information for within-park management. South Africa's Table Mountain National Park, home to three endemic amphibian species in just similar to 24,500 hectares, provides a case study for identifying conservation needs under climate change. Selecting the park's herpetofauna as pilot taxa, we identified life history and demographic characteristics believed to make species more sensitive and less able to adapt to climate change. We organized these into assessment frameworks and, through a combination of literature review and expert elicitation, reviewed and used them to assess climate change vulnerability of 18 amphibian and 41 reptile species. The assessment highlighted that 73% and 67% of the park's reptile and amphibian species, respectively, had at least one high-sensitivity and low-adaptive capacity trait. Using ordinal and additive scoring methods, we identified the species most vulnerable to climate change and highlight the park areas containing their highest concentrations. These areas will be used to inform landscape-scale management priorities and park use zones. The current IUCN Red List assessments for these species do not incorporate climate change vulnerability. Considering some species appear to be threatened by climate change, their conservation needs might be underestimated. Identifying the most vulnerable species and the mechanisms underpinning their vulnerability can guide the identification and prioritization of conservation needs, while the highlighted knowledge gaps inform priorities for monitoring and research. While comprehensive climate change adaptation planning for Table Mountain National Park requires additional assessment of other taxonomic groups, this trait-based assessment example highlights a viable tool for assessing climate change vulnerability in protected areas.

KW  - SPECIES DISTRIBUTION
AB  - Western Tragopan (Tragopanmelanocephalus) is a beautiful pheasant species and is endemic to western Himalayas. It has large distribution range but different populations are fragmented within the western Himalayan moist temperate forests. Its distribution in Pakistan is restricted to some parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJ&K). This species is globally ` vulnerable' since its fragmented small populations are declining dueto continuing forest loss and habitat destruction throughout its range. This study was carried out to model the potential distribution and habitat of Western Tragopanin Neelam and Muzaffarabad districts of AJ&K by incorporating the physical, biological and climatic variables into MaxEnt model. Land cover data, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope, aspect, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), temperature, precipitation, topographic and sighting datasets were processed in Geographic Information System (GIS) to produce meaningful predictor variables, subsequently used in the MaxEnt software. The results showed that 11,112 ha area (2% of the total study area) is highly suitable for Western Tragopan, 30,248 ha area (5.3%) moderately suitable while 525,445 ha (92.7%) area is unsuitable. Jackknife test evaluated the importance of predictor variables and DEM, precipitation and land cover were found to be the most important variables for this study. The study evaluated the species-habitat relationship within the study area and can be helpful in the management and in-situ conservation planning of the species in its distribution range.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems and the species that rely on them are one of the most urgent habitat conservation concerns in North America. Fundamental to any landscape conservation efforts is the identification of priority habitats to help target management efforts. Many avian species associated with prairie ecosystems have experienced population declines along with continued loss of prairie habitats. Additionally, given the long history of research in avian systems and the close grassland associations of some species, birds are excellent candidate taxa for the identification of priority habitats and can provide an informed starting point for multispecies assessments. We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (1997-2014) to develop species distribution models for 15 grassland bird species across the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada. Model performance varied widely across species. Ten species demonstrated good model performance (average Boyce Index > 0.64 across 5-fold cross validation). We used these 10 species to assess the influence of habitat covariates on the relative probability of occurrence, to compare the spatial scales of selection, and to generate multispecies habitat priority maps. Of the nine habitat covariates considered, most species predictably demonstrated positive associations with grassland habitats and avoidance of areas of high tree and shrub cover. Two covariates representing wetland abundance were also frequently included in the top models. The area covered by wetlands (w.area) was present in the top model for 5 of 10 species with a consistently estimated negative coefficient. However, a covariate, which represented the number of wetland basins (w.basins), was present in the top model for 8 of 10 species with an estimated positive coefficient for all but 1 species, representing a preference for more heterogeneous wetland landscapes. The larger spatial scales we considered tended to have greater explanatory power than smaller spatial scales and were thus more prevalent in the top models. The multispecies priority habitat maps that we produced can be used for future assessments of potential habitat management actions. Our work provides a critical foundation for the incorporation of grassland bird conservation goals into on-going landscape-planning initiatives in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada.

AB  - We examined factors possibly, responsible for a nested distributional pattern of resident butterflies in the Toquima Range, a mountain range in the Great Basin of western North America. In related analyses, Poisson-based modeling indicated that species richness is better explained as a function of elevation and local topographic heterogeneity, than by, area per se. Therefore, we explored whether area, elevation, and topographic heterogeneity, affected relative degree of nestedness. Elevation and topographic heterogeneity, not only explained a significant percentage of the total deviance in species richness but also may be responsible for generating nested species distributions. The species-presence matrix ordered by, the elevation-heterogeneity model was significantly, more nested than the matrix ordered by, area. The matrix ordered by the elevation-heterogeneity, model also was significantly, more nested than matrices ordered by, three other environmental variables that did not explain significant variance in species richness, indicating that the model is unlikely, to be an artifact The influence of area on distribution patterns may be relatively slight because it was not significantly, correlated with species richness or topographic heterogeneity, in this system. Elevation covaried with both species richness and area, but the former correlation was positive and the latter was negative. Our results suggest that faunal richness and compositional patterns are related to independent variables that can be measured extensively-through satellite or airborne telemetry-thus reducing dependence on labor-intensive measurements of habitat. Because nestedness analyses may help reveal causes, or at least correlates, of species composition, we believe they, are a promising tool for conservation planning.

AB  - Aim: Landscape management and conservation planning require maps of vegetation composition and structure over large regions. Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used for individual species, but projects mapping multiple species are rarer. We compare maps of plant community composition assembled by stacking results from many SDMs with multivariate maps constructed using nearest-neighbor imputation.
   Location: Western Cascades ecoregion, Oregon and California, USA.
   Methods: We mapped distributions and abundances of 28 tree species over 4,007,110 ha at 30-m resolution using three approaches: SDMs using machine learning (random forest) to yield: (1) binary (RF_Bin); (2) basal area (abundance; RF_Abund) predictions; and (3) multi-species basal area predictions using a nearest-neighbor imputation variant based on random forest (RF_NN). We evaluated accuracy of binary predictions for all models, compared area mapped with plot-based areal estimates, assessed species abundance at two spatial scales and evaluated communities for species richness, problematic compositional errors and overall community composition.
   Results: RF_Bin yielded the strongest binary predictions (median True Skill Statistics; RF_Bin: 0.57, RF_NN: 0.38, RF_Abund: 0.27). Plot-scale predictions of abundance were poor for RF_Abund and RF_NN (median Agreement Coefficient (AC): -1.77 and -2.28), but strong when summarized over 50-km radius tessellated hexagons (median AC for both: 0.79). RF_Abund's strength with abundance and weakness with binary predictions stems from predicting small values instead of zeros. The number of zero value predictions from RF_NN was closest to counts of zeros in the plot data. Correspondingly, RF_NN's map-based species area estimates closely matched plot-based area estimates. RF_NN also performed best for community-level accuracy metrics.
   Conclusions: RF_NN was the best technique for building a broad-scale map of diversity and composition because the modelling framework maintained inter-species relationships from the input plot data. Re-assembling communities from single variable maps often yielded unrealistic communities. Although RF_NN rarely excelled at single species predictions of presence or abundance, it was often adequate to many (but not all) applications in both dimensions. We discuss our results in the context of map utility for applications in the fields of ecology, conservation and natural resource management planning. We highlight how RF_NN is well-suited for mapping current but not future vegetation.

AB  - Eriocaulon buergerianum Kornicke. (Eriocaulaceae) is one of the most common and least expensive herbal medicines for eye disease. This species is facing potential threats from climate change. Insufficient biogeographic knowledge of this plant species can hinder its effective management for long-term population survival. We integrated ecological niche modelling (Biomod2) with 70 records of E.buergerianum and eight environmental variables to estimate changes in distribution over time. A core area Zonation algorithm was introduced to identify conservation priority areas. Our results indicate that the range of E.buergerianum will likely decrease in the future: the overall range change on average is -44.3621.56% (-3.70% to -77.73%); values of range loss and range gain are 45.79 +/- 20.30% (9.29-78.19%) and 1.43 +/- 1.53% (0.18-5.59%), respectively. According to conservation priority analysis, the mandatory reserve (top 5%), negotiable reserve (0.95-0.9) and partial reserve (0.9-0.8) areas are 19,799, 19,799 and 39,597km(2), respectively. The areas identified as conservation priority are located in the southeast, especially in northern Taiwan and the Wuyi Mountains. Based on these results, we suggest a re-evaluation of the threatened status of this species, with a potential upgrade to the vulnerable (VU) category. To overcome the adverse conditions faced by populations of E.buergerianum in China, we propose a multi-faceted conservation strategy involving more complete resource assessment, a monitoring system, medical research focused on revealing medicinal components or substitutes, and a regional development plan that considers both wildlife and socio-economic issues.

AB  - Setting conservation priorities is an important step when resources are finite. Indeveloping countries such as Iraq, information about aquatic habitats is quite limited and prioritizing such habitats for conservation requires a multidisciplinary approach to utilize available types of data efficiently. We divided aquatic ecosystems of the Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq into 76 planning units. Next, we compiled mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly (Insecta: Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT)) data for 33 of them; these units were ranked for EPT conservation using a combination of indices. We selected the subset of units with the highest priority for EPT conservation and considered them to represent samples of healthy aquatic habitats in the region; we used these units, along with various landscape predictor variables, in correlative distribution modeling for healthy aquatic habitats across the entire region. Our approach resulted in identifying one lake and 23 riverine units as healthy aquatic habitats of conservation priority in the region. Our research shows that in developing countries where knowledge about aquatic habitats and species is minimal, conservation studies can still be conducted using water quality bioindicators along with a combination of conservation indices and spatial modeling.

AB  - Rapid global change has increased interest in developing ways to identify suitable refugia for species of conservation concern. Correlative and mechanistic species distribution models (SDMs) represent two approaches to generate spatially-explicit estimates of climate vulnerability. Correlative SDMs generate distributions using statistical associations between environmental variables and species presence data. In contrast, mechanistic SDMs use physiological traits and tolerances to identify areas that meet the conditions required for growth, survival and reproduction. Correlative approaches assume modeled environmental variables influence species distributions directly or indirectly; however, the mechanisms underlying these associations are rarely verified empirically. We compared habitat suitability predictions between a correlative-only SDM, a mechanistic SDM and a correlative framework that incorporated mechanistic layers ('hybrid models'). Our comparison focused on green salamanders Aneides aeneus, a priority amphibian threatened by climate change throughout their disjunct range. We developed mechanistic SDMs using experiments to measure the thermal sensitivity of resistance to water loss (r(i)) and metabolism. Under current climate conditions, correlative-only, hybrid and mechanistic SDMs predicted similar overlap in habitat suitability; however, mechanistic SDMs predicted habitat suitability to extend into regions without green salamanders but known to harbor many lungless salamanders. Under future warming scenarios, habitat suitability depended on climate scenario and SDM type. Correlative and hybrid models predicted a 42% reduction or 260% increase in area considered to be suitable depending on the climate scenario. In mechanistic SDMs, energetically suitable habitat declined with both climate scenarios and was driven by the thermal sensitivity of r(i). Our study indicates that correlative-only and hybrid approaches produce similar predictions of habitat suitability; however, discrepancies can arise for species that do not occupy their entire fundamental niche, which may hold consequences of conservation planning of threatened species.

AB  - Modelling dolphin distribution is key for understanding their ecology and for their conservation and management. Information on the distribution and preferred habitats of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins Tursiops sp. is lacking, particularly in metropolitan areas where the species is under threat from anthropogenic activities. Here, we used boat-based surveys and an ensemble modelling approach that combined results from 6 modelling techniques (generalised additive models, generalised boosted models, classification tree analysis, flexible discriminant analysis, random forest and maximum entropy) to identify areas of high probability of southern Australian bottlenose dolphin occurrence along the metropolitan coast of Adelaide, South Australia. We used kernel density estimation to identify core and representative areas according to behaviour and investigated the importance and potential ecological function of areas of high dolphin occurrence. The ensemble predictions of dolphin distribution performed better than the corresponding single models. Results indicate that depth, benthic habitat type and slope influenced dolphin occurrence along Adelaide's coast. Dolphins favoured shallow nearshore areas and temperate reefs in summer, shallow nearshore areas in autumn and deep waters further offshore in winter. In comparison to other observed behaviours, core feeding areas overlapped considerably with areas of high probability of dolphin occurrence. Thus, we suggest that prey availability is an important driver influencing the seasonal variation in dolphin distribution along Adelaide's metropolitan coast. Our predictions identify priority areas for dolphin conservation and for the implementation of boating and fishing regulations. Continued monitoring is needed to assess potential changes in preferred habitat under increasing anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Simple Summary Reintroductions are important tools to achieve the long-term conservation of endangered species; however, these projects are dangerous for translocated animals. Reintroduced animals face novel habitats where food availability and secure resting sites are unknown, and in this context, such animals likely engage in long exploratory movements. Furthermore, reintroductions can be dangerous for domestic and wild animals inhabiting the reintroduction site due to the potential risk of catching diseases carried by reintroduced animals. Our study aimed to evaluate the spatial behavior of reintroduced Corsican red deer in central-eastern Sardinia and, on the basis of the obtained results, build a species distribution model to forecast the expansion of reintroduced deer and plan future reintroduction projects. Furthermore, we evaluated the sanitary risk for domestic animals (sheep) linked to Bluetongue virus potentially carried by deer. Our results highlighted the great habitat suitability of central-eastern Sardinia for Corsican red deer. However, deer are healthy carriers of Bluetongue virus, as confirmed by health analyses we performed on captured animals in the source areas. Particular attention in reintroduction planning is needed to avoid any negative impacts on domestic or wild animals of conservation measures. The Corsican red deer is an endangered subspecies that needs artificial translocation projects to gain its complete recovery with the formation of viable, interconnected populations. Between 2007 and 2017, we performed two reintroduction projects in four sites in central-eastern Sardinia via tracking 32 deer by means of GPS/GSM radiotelemetry. On the basis of the obtained results, we built a species distribution model (SDM) using MaxEnt software, selecting 200 random points from the merged deer core areas as presence data. Furthermore, to evaluate the sanitary risk linked to artificial translocations, we analyzed deer positivity to Bluetongue virus (BTV) in the founder populations. The SDM showed a high deer capability to colonize central-eastern Sardinia, but it also showed the possibility of spreading BTV to domestic sheep because sanitary analyses confirmed the virus' presence in the founder populations. Our main conclusion was that reintroductions are effective tools for the long-term conservation of the Corsican red deer, as long as sanitary risks are minimized by means of sanitary monitoring of translocated deer.

AB  - In this study, scenario development based on changes in key socioeconomic drivers (namely, the prices of conventional food products, rural development policies and agro-environmental regulations) was used together with resource-based habitat suitability models to develop plausible visions of future pathways of agricultural land use and evaluate their potential consequences on conservation of target species. Analyses focused on three steppe bird species in a protected Natura 2000 area, located in the Iberian Peninsula. Our results showed that changes in land use composition under different scenarios can have important effects on habitat suitability, but that the size of those effects would vary depending on species-specific requirements and spatial distribution of land use changes. Positive effects of some new crops in the study area (grain legumes and aromatic plants) on studied species were suggested by our analyses. A positive effect of aggregation of land use changes was also found for two of the studied species. Scenario building and forecasting using transferable inter-disciplinary knowledge can therefore improve our capability to anticipate future changes and provide timely advice towards long-term conservation planning in agricultural systems.

AB  - Freshwater organisms are facing threats from various natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Using data sampled on a nationwide scale from streams in South Korea, we identified the crucial environmental factors influencing the distribution and abundance of freshwater gastropods. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling and the random forest model to evaluate the relationships between environmental factors and gastropod assemblages. Among the 30 recorded species, two invasive gastropod species (Pomacea canaliculataandPhysa acuta) have enlarged their distribution (10.4% and 57.3% frequency of occurrence, respectively), and were found to be widespread in streams and rivers. Our results revealed that the most influential factor in the distribution of gastropod assemblages was the ratio of cobble (%) in the substrate composition, although meteorological and physiographical factors were also important. However, the main environmental factors influencing species distribution varied among species according to habitat preference and environmental tolerance. Additionally, anthropogenic disturbance caused a decrease in the distribution of endemic species and an increase in the spatial distribution of invasive species. Finally, the results of the present study provide baseline information for planning successful strategies to maintain and conserve gastropod diversity when facing anthropogenic disturbance, as well as understanding the factors associated with the establishment of invasive species.

AB  - Understanding the pattern of species distribution and the underlying mechanism is essential for conservation planning. Several climatic variables determine the species diversity, and the dependency of species on climate motivates ecologists and bio-geographers to explain the richness patterns along with elevation and environmental correlates. We used interpolated elevational distribution data to examine the relative importance of climatic variables in determining the species richness pattern of 26 species of gymnosperms in the longest elevation gradients in the world. Thirteen environmental variables were divided into three predictors set representing each hypothesis model (energy-water, physical-tolerance, and climatic-seasonality); to explain the species richness pattern of gymnosperms along the elevational gradient. We performed generalized linear models and variation partitioning to evaluate the relevant role of environmental variables on species richness patterns. Our findings showed that the gymnosperms' richness formed a hump-shaped distribution pattern. The individual effect of energy-water predictor set was identified as the primary determinant of species richness. While, the joint effects of energy-water and physical-tolerance predictors have explained highest variations in gymnosperm distribution. The multiple environmental indicators are essential drivers of species distribution and have direct implications in understanding the effect of climate change on the species richness pattern.

AB  - Climate change poses a major threat to the survival of alpine mammals living in fragmented habitats with poor dispersal abilities. Among these important prey species, pikas are considered especially vulnerable to rising temperatures that would impede their surface activity and dispersal. We investigated how climatic regimes influence the niche of the Royle's pika (Ochotona roylei), and which climatic drivers and change trajectories may threaten the species' future sustenance, thereby prioritizing areas for future conservation of this species across its distribution range. We used Royle's pika presence locations in the MaxEnt framework, along with biologically relevant climatic and topographical variables, to model the present (2010) and the future (2050, 2070) climatic niche under different future scenarios projected by CCSM4 climatic models. Subsequently, we estimated the climatic niche loss across the elevation gradient, longitudinal gradient, and both inside and outside protected areas for all countries within the species' range. Niche suitability of the Royle's pika was substantially determined by precipitation of the coldest quarter (~snow cover) and wettest quarter (~monsoon rainfall). As these parameters are known to be vulnerable to global climatic change, our projection revealed significant loss (102 km(2)/year) in the species niche availability across all future scenarios, particularly in non-protected low-elevation regions. By identifying areas where species survival may be threatened, we confirmed that the distribution of Royle's pika, an important prey species, might be reduced by climate change. Our findings can aid in conservation planning strategies for this species and other alpine fauna and contribute to ongoing efforts to monitor change in the Himalaya.

AB  - Monitoring and species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used to support conservation planning but are rarely projected at a very high resolution for conservation management. In this study, we compared the population distribution and size of five invasive plant species along an 18 km alluvial system in Switzerland, over a period of 11 years. Exhaustive inventories of past (2001) to current (2012) populations showed a massive increase in invaded areas over the eleven years. Impatiens glandulifera and Reynoutria japonica were the species with the largest increases in population number and size. The ecological preferences of each species were then modelled at 1 m resolution, using environmental variables expressing topography, disturbances, dispersal, soil texture and light availability. SDMs successfully depicted the niches at very high resolution. Some of the important predictors (e.g., canopy density, distance to river) would have been unhelpful at a coarser resolution. From these very-high-resolution models, we predicted the potential distribution and abundance of species and derived two indices indicating the amount of habitat still available for future species colonisation, crucial information for management. Large, empty areas were predicted to be suitable for each species, suggesting that the observed increase in population size may continue in the future. The two proposed range-filling indices and abundance models may be used efficiently in future studies at very fine resolution to prioritise eradication efforts in previously invaded areas and controls in areas at high risk of invasion. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the efficiency of SDMs to predict invasions at such a fine resolution.

AB  - Astragalus edulis (Fabaceae) is an endangered annual plant species from the western Mediterranean region. It occurs in the Iberian Peninsula (SE), Morocco (two main locations in the NE and SW), and the easternmost Canary Islands (Lanzarote and Fuerteventura). After a thorough study assessing genetic diversity and phylogeographic patterns, and a proposal of a management plan to preserve the genetic diversity across the entire area of the species, it is about time to go further in the species conservation. It is necessary to recognize genetically impoverished populations to be able to successfully reinforce populations and find realistic places for translocations. For this, Nei's genetic diversity values were calculated for the three geographic areas and for their populations. Diversity values were further evaluated to calculate the optimal contribution for the populations within each area to maximize the genetic pool. To evaluate whether the optimum habitat for the species is expected to grow or decrease under a climate change scenario, the optimal model of current climatic suitability of A. edulis was projected into the IPCC (2070_RCP8.5) future scenario. The different geographical areas showed similar genetic diversity values. The populations that contribute to maximize the genetic pool in each geographic area were similar, but not equal, to those proposed in previous studies. The future potential habitat for the species shows a significant range decline, which will affect translocation efforts.

AB  - Developing resource management strategies in the face of climate change is complicated by the considerable uncertainty associated with projections of climate and its impacts and by the complex interactions between social and ecological variables. The broad, interconnected nature of this challenge has resulted in calls for analytical frameworks that integrate research tools and can support natural resource management decision making in the face of uncertainty and complex interactions. We respond to this call by first reviewing three methods that have proven useful for climate change research, but whose application and development have been largely isolated: species distribution modeling, scenario planning, and simulation modeling. Species distribution models provide data-driven estimates of the future distributions of species of interest, but they face several limitations and their output alone is not sufficient to guide complex decisions for how best to manage resources given social and economic considerations along with dynamic and uncertain future conditions. Researchers and managers are increasingly exploring potential futures of social-ecological systems through scenario planning, but this process often lacks quantitative response modeling and validation procedures. Simulation models are well placed to provide added rigor to scenario planning because of their ability to reproduce complex system dynamics, but the scenarios and management options explored in simulations are often not developed by stakeholders, and there is not a clear consensus on how to include climate model outputs. We see these strengths and weaknesses as complementarities and offer an analytical framework for integrating these three tools. We then describe the ways in which this framework can help shift climate change research from useful to usable.

AB  - AimOur aim was to determine the role of environmental variables in explaining occurrence and abundance patterns of bumblebee (Bombus) species in a mountain region. We also used a historical dataset to compare historical and recent habitat suitability predictions for forecasting variations in species' responses to regional climate warming.
   LocationThe Cantabrian Range (Iberian Peninsula, south-western Europe).
   MethodsDuring 2007-09 we sampled bumblebees in 37 localities and developed generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict species' occurrence and abundance in relation to environmental variables. We extracted independent variables at different spatial scales for each locality, based on topoclimatic (slope, temperature and rainfall patterns) and land-cover (habitat configuration and composition) variables. We also used historical (1988-89) bumblebee data (23 localities) to both calibrate recent distribution models and determine the current environmental factors underlying the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming (0.8 degrees C) over two decades.
   ResultsOccurrence and abundance patterns of species were best predicted by models combining topoclimatic and land-cover variables. Our findings revealed three groups of species, distinguished on the basis of the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming: one comprising six species with climate-based tracking behaviour, a second with three species tracking suitable landscape composition and configuration regardless of climatic conditions, and a third comprising one species showing no apparent tracking behaviour.
   Main conclusionsTopoclimate and land cover determined the occurrence and abundance patterns of bumblebee species in mountainous landscapes, even at fine spatial extents. Both environmental variables, however, differentially influenced bumblebees, thereby providing relevant clues for determining the current environmental factors underlying species' distributions and their susceptibility to changing environmental conditions. Our findings therefore suggest that determining habitat suitability can be used as a baseline approach for understanding species-specific responses to climate warming and for developing vulnerability assessments for conservation-focused management planning.

AB  - The various human-induced threats imposed on nature have recently triggered the study of species' distributions. We developed potential suitability models using two algorithms for a threatened African mahogany, Entandrophragma angolense, in three East African countries; Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The effect of features selection and modelling algorithm selection on potential suitability predictions was explored. Occurrence records and high-resolution environmental data were used. The two species distribution modelling techniques were genetic algorithm rule for prediction; and maximum entropy modelling. With Maxent, the area under the receiver characteristic operating curve (AUC) for potential distribution models tested on independent data ranged from 0.942 to 0.972 when using automatic features and from 0.974 to 0.666 with target or specific features. With GARP, AUC for potential distribution models ranged from 0.591 to 0.736 with all rule types and from 0.388 to 0.805 for specific rule types (Tables 1 and 2). The area under the E. angolense potential suitability was best predicted by soil, rainfall and aspect using GARP. Potential suitability increased with increasing aspect and decreased with increasing slope. Low rainfall and elevation increased potential suitability, while high levels of either variable decreased potential suitability. Potential suitability maps for vulnerable species require using a multi-algorithm, fine scale data approach and incorporation of environmental variables like soil, slope, land use and elevation. Species distribution models can offer insight on the distribution requirements of vulnerable species and help guide the development of management plans. Results of this study suggest that E. angolense management plans should promote the protection of terrestrial forests surrounding water bodies including Mabira forest in Uganda.

AB  - The development of major linear infrastructures contributes to landscape fragmentation and impacts natural habitats and biodiversity in various ways. To anticipate and minimize such impacts, landscape planning needs to be capable of effective strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and of supporting environmental impact assessment (EIA) decisions. To this end, species distribution models (SDMs) are an effective way of making predictive maps of the presence of a given species. In this paper, we propose to combine SDMs and graph-based representation of landscape networks to integrate the potential long-distance effect of infrastructures on species distribution. A diachronic approach, comparing distribution before and after the linear infrastructure is constructed, leads to the design of a species distribution assessment (SDA), taking into account population isolation. The SDA makes it possible (1) to estimate the local variation in probability of presence and (2) to characterize the impact of the infrastructure in terms of global variation in presence and of distance of disturbance. The method is illustrated by assessing the impact of the construction of a high-speed railway line on the distribution of several virtual species in Franche-Comte (France). The study shows the capacity of the SDA to characterize the impact of a linear infrastructure either as a research concern or as a spatial planning challenge. SDAs could be helpful in deciding among several scenarios for linear infrastructure routes or for the location of mitigation measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The whale shark is a globally endangered species that is distributed in tropical and warm temperate waters. This study modeled the present-day and future habitat suitability of this species in the Sunda tectonic plate region in Southeast Asia to identify changes and highlight potential areas for conservation. Presence data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature were combined with six environment variables to model habitat suitability under three climate change scenarios. The present-day model results showed that most areas of high suitability matched the occurrence data. The future models generated revealed a small decrease in habitat suitability on the Sunda plate. In all of the three future models, two areas of high suitability were predicted: the central islands of the Philippines and southern Thailand. Areas of high suitability remained the same in the parts of the Gulf of Thailand, southern Indonesia, and the central islands of the Philippines. Based on this information, suggestions on how to protect the environment in these areas were made, including a regional assessment of the whale shark status and implementing a species recovery plan in Southeast Asia.

AB  - Several biodiversity features can be linked to landscape heterogeneity, that, in turn, can be informative for management and conservation purposes. Usually, the more the landscape is complex the more the biodiversity increases. Biodiversity indicators can be a useful tool to assess biodiversity status, in function of landscape heterogeneity. In this study, we developed a biodiversity indicator, based on Shannon diversity index and built from distribution maps of protected species. With such an approach, we seek to evaluate the feasibility of using a combination of target species as a surrogate for assessing the status of the whole bird community. Our approach was spread over multiple spatial scales, to determine which was the most informative. We selected four species protected by European regulation and generated a presence-absence map from species distribution modelling. We, therefore, used the FRAGSTATS biodiversity metric to calculate Shannon index for the overlapped presence-absence maps, at two spatial scales (500 m and 1000 m). Then, the relationships with the whole community was assessed through generalised least square models, at the spatial scale of 4 ha, 9 ha and 25 ha. Results showed that the higher rate of variability of community was explained by the biodiversity indicator at 1000 m scale. Indeed, the more informative spatial scale for the whole bird community was 9 ha. In addition, a pattern emerged about the relationships between biodiversity indicator and community richness, that is worth of further research. Our study demonstrates that the usefulness of surrogate species for biodiversity and community assessment can become clear only at a certain spatial scales. Indeed, they can be highly predictive of the whole community, and highly informative for conservation planning. Moreover, their use can optimize biodiversity monitoring and conservation, focusing on a small number of noteworthy species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global climate is rapidly changing and while many studies have investigated the potential impacts of this on the distribution of montane plant species and communities, few have focused on those with oceanic montane affinities. In Europe, highly sensitive bryophyte species reach their optimum occurrence, highest diversity and abundance in the northwest hyperoceanic regions, while a number of montane vascular plant species occur here at the edge of their range. This study evaluates the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of these species and assesses the implications for EU Habitats Directive-protected oceanic montane plant communities. We applied an ensemble of species distribution modelling techniques, using atlas data of 30 vascular plant and bryophyte species, to calculate range changes under projected future climate change. The future effectiveness of the protected area network to conserve these species was evaluated using gap analysis. We found that the majority of these montane species are projected to lose suitable climate space, primarily at lower altitudes, or that areas of suitable climate will principally shift northwards. In particular, rare oceanic montane bryophytes have poor dispersal capacity and are likely to be especially vulnerable to contractions in their current climate space. Significantly different projected range change responses were found between 1) oceanic montane bryophytes and vascular plants; 2) species belonging to different montane plant communities; 3) species categorised according to different biomes and eastern limit classifications. The inclusion of topographical variables in addition to climate, significantly improved the statistical and spatial performance of models. The current protected area network is projected to become less effective, especially for specialised arctic-montane species, posing a challenge to conserving oceanic montane plant communities. Conservation management plans need significantly greater focus on potential climate change impacts, including models with higher-resolution species distribution and environmental data, to aid these communities' long-term survival.

AB  - Climate and land-use change are the most severe threats to biodiversity; their effects are often intermingled, also with those of landscape/habitat management. Birds of mountain grassland are declining throughout Europe. Disentangling climate effects from those of land-cover and management on their occurrence is essential to identify distribution drivers, potential impacts of climate/land-use changes, and effective conservation strategies. We investigated the occurrence of water pipit (elevation specialist), skylark and red-backed shrike (elevation generalists) in Central Apennines, Italy (750-2130 m ash), using point counts. Topographic/climatic, land-cover and management line-scale variables were considered as potential occurrence predictors in Generalized Linear Models. For all species, combining different types of predictors led to the most accurate models, but the relative importance of single-groups varied: land cover was the most important for skylark, climate/topography for water pipit, all three groups had similar support for red-backed shrike. Skylark was positively affected by solar radiation and grassland cover, and negatively by bare ground, hedgerows, rocks, shrubland, ski-pistes and buildings, confirming sensitivity to anthropic alteration of semi-natural grassland. Water pipit was favoured by grazing and negatively impacted by shrubland and average temperature (most important predictor). Red-backed shrike was affected negatively by broadleaved forest and grazing occurrence, quadratically by isolated shrubs and positively by grassland cover. Climate was a fundamental determinant of water pipit occurrence, but not for the other species. Land-cover was important for all species and also management factors were invariably included in models. Climate, habitat and management factors differently contributed to occurrence declining species. Conservation strategies need to embrace landscape planning to preserve grassland extents/mosaics, identify climate refugia for water pipit and implement dedicated management (preventing new skipistes over areas suitable for birds and carefully planning grazing). It should be feasible to combine local, sustainable economies with biodiversity conservation into landscape planning for Central Apennines. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim The study examined the potential for change in biome representation within Canada's national park system under multiple climate change scenarios and subsequent potential vulnerabilities in Parks Canada policy and planning frameworks.
   Location The study was conducted for Canada's 39 national parks.
   Methods The vegetation change scenarios were based on modelling results from the BIOME3 and MAPSS equilibrium process-based global vegetation models (GVM), run with multiple doubled-CO2 climate change scenarios. The six vegetation distribution scenarios were calculated at 0.5degrees latitude-longitude resolution and the boundaries of 39 national parks superimposed in a geographic information system (GIS). Park management plans and other planning documents were also reviewed as part of the analysis.
   Results The proportional distribution of biomes in Canada's national park system was very similar (within 3% of area for each biome) using BIOME3 and MAPSS under the current climate. Regardless of the GVM and climate change scenario used, the modelling results suggest the potential for substantial change in the biome representation in Canada's national park system. In five of six vegetation scenarios, a novel biome type appeared in more than half of the national parks and greater than 50% of all vegetation grid boxes changed biome type. The proportional representation of tundra and taiga/tundra in the national park system declined in each of the vegetation scenarios, while more southerly biomes (temperate forests and savanna/woodland) increased (in some scenarios doubling to quadrupling). Results for boreal forest varied among the climate change scenarios. A range of potential vulnerabilities in existing policy and planning frameworks were identified, including the national park system plan, individual park objectives, and fire and exotic species management plans.
   Conclusions Climate change represents an unprecedented challenge to Parks Canada and its ability to achieve its conservation mandate as presently legislated. Research is needed not only on ecosystem responses to climate change, but also on the capacity of conservation systems and agencies to adapt to climate change.

AB  - Aim: Species distribution models built with geographically restricted data often fail to capture the full range of conditions experienced by species across their entire distribution area. Using such models to predict distribution shifts under future environmental change may, therefore, produce biased projections. However, restricted-scale models have the potential to include a larger sample of taxa for which distribution data are available and to provide finer-resolution projections that are better applied to conservation planning than the forecasts of broad-scale models. We examine the circumstances under which the projected shifts in species richness patterns derived from restricted-scale and broad-scale models are most likely to be similar.
   Location: Europe.
   Methods: The distribution of butterflies in Finland, Belgium/Netherlands and Spain was modelled based on restricted-scale (local) and broad-scale (continental) distribution and climate data. Both types of models were projected under future climate change scenarios to assess potential changes in species richness.
   Results: In Finland, species richness was projected to increase strongly based on restricted-scale models and to decrease slightly with broad-scale models. In Belgium/Netherlands, restricted-scale models projected a larger decrease in richness than broad-scale models. In Spain, both models projected a slight decrease in richness. We obtained similar projections based on restricted-scale and broad-scale models only in Spain because the climatic conditions available here covered the warm part of the distributions of butterflies better than in Finland and Belgium/Netherlands.
   Main conclusions: Restricted-scale models that fail to capture the warm part of species distributions produce biased estimates of future changes in species richness when projected under climatic conditions with no modern analogue in the study area. We recommend the use of distribution data beyond the boundaries of the study area to capture the part of the species response curves reflecting the climatic conditions that will prevail within that area in the future.

AB  - To assist the Oregon State Board of Forestry in evaluating policy alternatives for the Northwest Oregon State Forests Management Plan and Western Oregon State Forests Habitat Conservation Plan, a 125,000 parcel, 20 period harvest scheduling model was developed to compare alternative options. The Oregon Department of Forestry's proposed plan was based on structure-based management. Under this alternative the forest would be brought to specified spatial distribution of stand types within the earliest time while providing non-declining harvest flow, consideration of threatened and endangered species, net present value, and the Oregon Forest Practices rules. A simulated annealing heuristic using a multiple goal objective function was used to develop the harvest schedule.

AB  - Species that persist on a shifting mosaic of successional habitat offer particular challenges to conservation, to monitoring methods, and to population dynamic modelling. The conservation of the heath fritillary butterfly (Melitaea athalia) in woodland in England, for example, depends on the creation of woodland clearings by coppicing (rotational cutting). We have developed a simulation model to assist in the conservation of such populations, called MANAGE. We have parameterised the model for the M. athalia population in the Blean Woods in Kent, and used it to answer several management questions. We find that: (1) simulations predict that the observed rates of coppicing will not be enough to meet existing conservation (Biodiversity Action Plan) targets, except when the most generous modelling assumptions are made; (2) the greatest uncertainty in the model outcome arises from uncertainty in the colonisation parameters; (3) in the worst case scenario (using the most pessimistic model assumptions), a population would require 2.3% of the Blean Woods to be coppiced each year, which is around double the currently-observed rate; (4) the four management units of the Blean where coppicing is practised are not independent metapopulations- they support each other; and (5) to sustain a population in a smaller landscape would require less coppicing overall, but more as a percentage of the landscape. This modelling approach may prove useful in the development of conservation management plans for other species that inhabit successional habitats. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large, citizen-science species databases are powerful resources for predictive species distribution modeling (SDM), yet they are often subject to sampling bias. Many methods have been proposed to correct for this, but there exists little consensus as to which is most effective, not least because the true value of model predictions is hard to evaluate without extensive independent field sampling. We present here a nationwide, independent field validation of distribution models of ancient and veteran trees, a group of organisms of high conservation importance, built using a large and internationally unique citizen-science database: the Ancient Tree Inventory (ATI). This validation exercise presents an opportunity to test the performance of different methods of correcting for sampling bias, in the search for the best possible prediction of ancient and veteran tree distributions in England. We fitted a variety of distribution models of ancient and veteran tree records in England in relation to environmental predictors and applied different bias correction methods, including spatial filtering, background manipulation, the use of bias files, and, finally, zero-inflated (ZI) regression models, a new method with great potential to investigate and remove sampling bias in species data. We then collected new independent field data through systematic surveys of 52 randomly selected 1-km(2) grid squares across England to obtain abundance estimates of ancient and veteran trees. Calibration of the distribution models against the field data suggests that there are around eight to 10 times as many ancient and veteran trees present in England than the records currently suggest, with estimates ranging from 1.7 to 2.1 million trees compared to the 200,000 currently recorded in the ATI. The most successful bias correction method was systematic sampling of occurrence records, although the ZI models also performed well, significantly predicting field observations and highlighting both likely causes of undersampling and areas of the country in which many unrecorded trees are likely to be found. Our findings provide the first robust nationwide estimate of ancient and veteran tree abundance and demonstrate the enormous potential for distribution modeling based on citizen-science data combined with independent field validation to inform conservation planning.

AB  - The ongoing decline of large marine vertebrates must be urgently mitigated, particularly under increasing levels of climate change and other anthropogenic pressures. However, characterizing the connectivity among populations remains one of the greatest challenges for the effective conservation of an increasing number of endangered species. Achieving conservation targets requires an understanding of which seascape features influence dispersal and subsequent genetic structure. This is particularly challenging for adult-disperser species, and when distribution-wide sampling is difficult. Here, we developed a two-step modelling framework to investigate how seascape features drive the genetic connectivity of marine species without larval dispersal, to better guide the design of marine protected area networks and corridors. We applied this framework to the endangered grey reef shark, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, a reef-associated shark distributed across the tropical Indo-Pacific. In the first step, we developed a seascape genomic approach based on isolation-by-resistance models involving circuit theory applied to 515 shark samples, genotyped for 4991 nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We show that deep oceanic areas act as strong barriers to dispersal, while proximity to habitat facilitates dispersal. In the second step, we predicted the resulting genetic differentiation across the entire distribution range of the species, providing both local and global-scale conservation units for future management guidance. We found that grey reef shark populations are more fragmented than expected for such a mobile species, raising concerns about the resilience of isolated populations under high anthropogenic pressures. We recommend the use of this framework to identify barriers to gene flow and to help in the delineation of conservation units at different scales, together with its integration across multiple species when considering marine spatial planning.

AB  - Aim Using survey data for North American birds, we assess how well historical patterns of species richness are explained by stacked species distribution models and macroecological models. We then describe the degree to which projections of future species richness differ, employing both modelling approaches across multiple emissions scenarios.
   Location USA and Canada.
   Methods We use Audubon Christmas Bird Count and North American Breeding Bird Survey data to estimate current and future species richness of birds using two distinct approaches. In the first, we model richness by stacking predictions from individual species distribution models. In the second, we model richness directly, ignoring the contributions of specific taxa to richness estimates.
   Results The two modelling approaches show similar accuracies when validated with historical observations, particularly winter observations, and result in similar patterns of richness when projected onto current and future climate spaces. Patterns of projected change in species richness differed markedly between winter and summer seasons regardless of modelling approach. Our models suggest that bird species richness in winter will increase or remain stable across much of North America. In contrast, species richness in summer is projected to decrease over much of North America, except part of northern Canada, suggesting that climate may constrain many breeding bird species and communities in the future.
   Main conclusions Stacked species distribution models and macroecological models produce similar estimates of current and future species richness for each of two seasons despite being built on different concepts of community assembly. Our results suggest that, although the mechanisms that shape geographical variation in biodiversity remain uncertain, these limitations do not impede our ability to predict patterns of species richness at broad scales. Congruence of species richness projections across modelling approaches is encouraging for conservation planning efforts that focus on retaining biodiversity into the future.

AB  - Varanus griseus caspius (desert monitor) is a predator included appendix I of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species; therefore, it is crucial to plan for its conservation. In this study, the suitable habitats of the desert monitor, Varanus griseus caspius, were evaluated in Iran, considering 10 environmental factors, for three periods of time: mid-Holocene, current, and years 2041-2060. Three individual models were produced to create an ensemble model: Generalized Boosting Model (GBM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), and Random Forests (RF). Next, highly suitable areas in current and future periods were compared to the boundaries of conservation areas (CA). Among the different models projected, the ensemble model performed the best. The results indicated that so far, the distribution range of the species has shifted profoundly and will continue to grow in the future, while some currently suitable CAs will turn into unsuitable habitats for the species. We suggest further studies focus on redefining and broadening the CAs borders. Also, studying the species connectivity in current and potential future habitats can help to protect the species.

AB  - Global declines in biodiversity highlight the need to effectively monitor the density and distribution of threatened species. In recent years, molecular survey methods detecting DNA released by target-species into their environment (eDNA) have been rapidly on the rise. Despite providing new, cost-effective tools for conservation, eDNA-based methods are prone to errors. Best field and laboratory practices can mitigate some, but the risks of errors cannot be eliminated and need to be accounted for. Here, we synthesize recent advances in data processing tools that increase the reliability of interpretations drawn from eDNA data. We review advances in occupancy models to consider spatial data-structures and simultaneously assess rates of false positive and negative results. Further, we introduce process-based models and the integration of metabarcoding data as complementing approaches to increase the reliability of target-species assessments. These tools will be most effective when capitalizing on multi-source data sets collating eDNA with classical survey and citizen-science approaches, paving the way for more robust decision-making processes in conservation planning.

AB  - In southern African waters, information about species distribution and habitat preferences of many cetacean species is limited, despite the recent economic growth that may affect them. We determined the relative importance of eight environmental variables (bathymetry, distance to shore, slope, chlorophyll-a, salinity, eastwards sea water velocity, northwards sea water velocity and sea surface temperature) as drivers of seasonal habitat preferences of Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera brydei), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Using presence only data from multiple sources, we constructed predictive species distribution models (SDMs) consisting of ensembles of seven algorithms for these species during both summer and winter. Predicted distribution for all cetaceans was high in southern Africa and, in particular, within the South African Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Predictive models indicated a more pronounced seasonal variation for humpback, sperm and southern right whales than for Bryde's whales. Southern right whales occurred closer to shore during winter, humpback whales were more likely to occur along the east coast in winter and the west coast in summer, and sperm whales were more concentrated off the shelf in winter. Our study shows that ensemble models using historical, incidental and scientific data, in conjunction with modern environmental variables, can provide baseline knowledge on important environmental drivers of cetacean distribution for conservation purposes. Results of this study can further be used to help develop marine spatial plans and identify important marine mammal areas.

AB  - There is pressing need to anticipate the impacts of climate change on species and their functional contributions to ecosystem processes. Our objective is to evaluate the potential bee response to climate change considering (1) response traits-body size, nest site, and sociality; (2) contributions to ecosystem services (effect trait)-crop pollination; and (3) bees' size of current occurrence area. We analyzed 216 species occurring at the Carajas National Forest (Eastern Amazon, Para, Brazil), using two different algorithms and geographically explicit data. We modeled the current occurrence area of bees and projected their range shift under future climate change scenarios through species distribution modeling. We then tested the relationship of potential loss of occurrence area with bee traits and current occurrence area. Our projections show that 95% of bee species will face a decline in their total occurrence area, and only 15 to 4% will find climatically suitable habitats in Carajas. The results indicate an overall reduction in suitable areas for all traits analyzed. Bees presenting medium and restricted geographic distributions, as well as vital crop pollinators, will experience significantly higher losses in occurrence area. The potentially remaining species will be the wide-range habitat generalists, and the decline in crop-pollinator species will probably pose negative impact on pollination service. The north of Para presented the greatest future climatic suitability and can be considered for conservation purposes. These findings emphasize the detrimental effects on biodiversity and agricultural production by climate change and provide data to support conservation planning.

AB  - The consequences of global climate change can already be seen in many physical and biological systems and these effects could change the distribution of suitable areas for a wide variety of organisms to the middle of this century. We analyzed the current habitat use and we projected the suitable area of present conditions into the geographical space of future scenarios (2050), to assess and quantify whether future climate change would affect the distribution and size of suitable environments in two Pristidactylus lizard species. Comparing the habitat use and future forecasts of the two studied species, P. achalensis showed a more restricted use of available resource units (RUs) and a moderate reduction of the potential future area. On the contrary, P. nigroiugulus uses more available RUs and has a considerable area decrease for both future scenarios. These results suggest that both species have a moderately different trend towards reducing available area of suitable habitats, the persistent localities for both 2050 CO2 concentration models, and in the available RUs used. We discussed the relation between size and use of the current habitat, changes in future projections along with the protected areas from present-future and the usefulness of these results in conservation plans. This work illustrates how ectothermic organisms might have to face major changes in their availability suitable areas as a consequence of the effect of future climate change.

AB  - Climate change is threatening global ecosystems through its impact on the survival of individual species and their ecological functions(1,2). Despite the important role of understorey plants in forest ecosystems(3-5), climate impact assessments on understorey plants and their role in supporting wildlife habitat are scarce in the literature. Here we assess climate-change impacts on understorey bamboo species with an emphasis on their ecological function as a food resource for endangered giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). An ensemble of bamboo distribution projections associated with multiple climate-change projections and bamboo dispersal scenarios indicates a substantial reduction in the distributional ranges of three dominant bamboo species in the Qinling Mountains, China during the twenty-first century. As these three species comprise almost the entire diet of the panda population in the region, the projected changes in bamboo distribution suggest a potential shortage of food for this population, unless alternative food sources become available. Although the projections were developed under unavoidable simplifying assumptions and uncertainties, they indicate potential challenges for panda conservation and underscore the importance of incorporating interspecific interactions into climate-change impact assessments and associated conservation planning.

AB  - Climate change is threatening species and habitats. Altitudinal shifts uphill and negative population trends are commonly observed in altitude-related taxa. The bumblebee Bombus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758) has a disjoint distribution restricted to Fennoscandia and the Alps, and is considered threatened. We studied the ecology and distribution of B. alpinus in the Alps, where the endemic subspecies Bombus alpinus helleri Dalla Torre 1882 is found, as a case-model because of its rarity, habitat, and mutual dependence with the ecosystem for pollination and resources. We developed species distribution models including both climatic and habitat variables to obtain the surface suitable for this subspecies and quantified its protected portion. Our analyses indicate that this bumblebee is restricted to the upper altitudes and has a narrow niche mainly related to the presence of glaciers, the cool temperature, a low temperature variation, and a specific range of precipitation. A strong altitudinal shift is also taking place probably due to climate change. After years of no changes in altitudinal distribution, its lowest altitudinal limit has moved up 479 m since the year 1984, while its upper altitudinal limit has remained unchanged. Over half of the suitable area in the Alps is included within protected areas, but conservation has not been planned yet. However, rare species with narrow niche, such as B. alpinus, are highly threatened by climate change. Potential short-term mitigation actions are discussed, including exchange of males between locations and integral protection of prairies in the vicinity of glaciers.

AB  - AimInterest in species distribution models (SDMs) and related niche studies has increased dramatically in recent years, with several books and reviews being prepared since 2000. The earliest SDM studies are dealt with only briefly even in the books. Consequently, many researchers are unaware of when the first SDM software package (bioclim) was developed and how a broad range of applications using the package was explored within the first 8years following its release. The purpose of this study is to clarify these early developments and initial applications, as well as to highlight bioclim's continuing relevance to current studies.
   LocationMainly Australia and New Zealand, but also some global applications.
   MethodsWe outline the development of the bioclim package, early applications (1984-1991) and its current relevance.
   Resultsbioclim was the first SDM package to be widely used. Early applications explored many of the possible uses of SDMs in conservation biogeography, such as quantifying the environmental niche of species, identifying areas where a species might be invasive, assisting conservation planning and assessing the likely impacts of climate change on species distributions.
   Main conclusionsUnderstanding this pioneering work is worthwhile as bioclim was for many years one of the leading SDM packages and remains widely used. Climate interpolation methods developed for bioclim were used to create the WorldClim database, the most common source of climate data for SDM studies, and bioclim variables are used in about 76% of recent published MaxEnt analyses of terrestrial ecosystems. Also, some of the bioclim studies from the late 1980s, such as measuring niche (both realized and fundamental) and assessing possible impacts of climate change, are still highly relevant to key conservation biogeography issues.

AB  - Delimiting species can be challenging, but is a key step for the critical examination of evolutionary history and for prioritizing conservation efforts. Because systematic relationships are often determined iteratively using tests based on taxonomy, such methods can fail to detect cryptic variation and result in biased conclusions. Conversely, discovery-based approaches provide a powerful way to define operational taxonomic units and test species boundaries. We compare both approaches (taxonomy-based delimitation - TBD and discovery-based delimitation - DBD) within North American jumping mice (Zapodinae) using broad sampling, multilocus analyses, and ecological tests. This group diversified through the dynamic glacial-interglacial periods of the Quaternary and phylogeographic tests reveal 28 lineages that correspond poorly with current taxonomy (4 species, 32 nominal subspecies). However, neither the 4-species or 28-lineage hypotheses are optimal for species-level classification. Rather, information theoretic approaches (Bayes Factors) indicate a 15-species hypothesis is best for characterizing genetic variation in this group, with subsequent iterative pairwise ecological tests failing to confirm four species pairs. Taken together, evolutionary and ecological tests capture divergence among 11 putative species that, if upheld by additional tests, will lead to taxonomic revision and reevaluation of conservation plans.

AB  - The spatial distribution of many public lands in the western U.S. is an artifact of 19th century land-disposal policies. While this legacy is sometimes an impediment to conservation, it may also provide novel opportu-nities to spatially reorganize public conservation lands within realistic budget constraints. Here we seek to understand the conservation potential of strategically rearranging inaccessible ( "stranded ") public land in Montana, US. We use conservation reserve network design and consider coarse-and fine-filter conservation features-land cover types and predicted habitat for 12 umbrella species, respectively-and incorporate habitat connectivity corridors into one reserve design scenario. All conservation reserve network designs are constrained by a budget equal to the current value of stranded public land parcels and seek to meet or exceed the extent of conservation currently provided by stranded parcels with respect to land cover type and predicted species habitat. We find that each conservation reserve simulation expands the total protected area in Montana within the realistic budget constraint. Two maximum coverage scenarios, which exhaust the budget, result in reserve designs that substantially exceed coarse-and fine-filter conservation targets. All reserve designs provide land-scape connectivity benefits. Our results illustrate notable and practical opportunities to develop conservation reserve networks in the western US that account for landscape connectivity and that benefit both private landowners and biodiversity conservation efforts through land trades and acquisitions.

AB  - Rates of biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia are among the highest in the world, and the Indo-Burma and South-Central China Biodiversity Hotspots rank among the world's most threatened. Developing robust multi-species conservation models is critical for stemming biodiversity loss both here and globally. We used a large and geographically extensive remote-camera survey and multi-scale, multivariate optimization species distribution modelling to investigate the factors driving biodiversity across these two adjoining biodiversity hotspots. Four major findings emerged from the work. (i) We identified clear spatial patterns of species richness, with two main biodiverse centres in the Thai-Malay Peninsula and in the mountainous region of Southwest China. (ii) Carnivores in particular, and large ungulates to a lesser degree, were the strongest indicators of species richness. (iii) Climate had the largest effect on biodiversity, followed by protected status and human footprint. (iv) Gap analysis between the biodiversity model and the current system of protected areas revealed that the majority of areas supporting the highest predicted biodiversity are not protected. Our results highlighted several key locations that should be prioritized for expanding the protected area network to maximize conservation effectiveness. We demonstrated the importance of switching from single-species to multi-species approaches to highlight areas of high priority for biodiversity conservation. In addition, since these areas mostly occur over multiple countries, we also advocate for a paradigmatic focus on transboundary conservation planning.

AB  - Rising global temperatures are causing a poleward shift in species distribution. Range shift velocities are higher in the marine environment, with observed rates of 30-130 km per decade. Both protected and exploited species will be at risk if marine species management policies are not structured to anticipate these range shifts. The 2017 mass mortality event of the North Atlantic right whale showcases the detrimental impact of unanticipated climate-mediated behavior in a species protected by geographically and seasonally fixed policies. Based on the results of a demographic capture-recapture model, right whales may face extinction in fewer than 30 years unless protective policies are expanded to cover their shifting distribution. Increased support of long-term monitoring programs paired with environmental modeling research is critical to developing more proactive conservation management strategies and preventing further ecological crises.

AB  - The conservation status of wild Arachis spp. is not well characterized for its maintenance and possible future exploitation for the improvement of cultivated peanut, Arachis hypogaea L. Our objectives were to use 2175 georeferenced observations of wild peanut (Arachis spp.) to assess the conservation. status of the genus and to prioritize biologically and geographically future conservation actions. Species distribution predictions were made on the basis of 36 climate variables, and these data were synthesized with land-use data to map the potential distribution of each species, and hence the species richness of the whole genus, excluding A. hypogea. hotspots of species richness were found in Mato Grosso around Cuiaba and Campo Grande in Brazil and around the Serra Geral de Goias, northeast of Brasilia. The current state of in situ conservation areas poorly represents wild peanut, with only 48 of the 2175 observations from National Parks. Several species were identified as being under threat of extinction. These included A. archeri Krapov. & W.C. Gregory, A. setinervosa Krapov. &. W.C. Gregory, A. marginata Gardner, A. hatschbachii Krapov. & W.C. Gregory, A. appressipila Krapov. & W.C. Gregory, A. villosa Benth., A. cryptopotamica Krapov. & W.C. Gregory, A. helodes Martins ex Krapov. & Rigoni, A. magna W.C. Gregory & C.E. Simpson, and A. gracilis Krapov. & W.C. Gregory (identification based on highly restricted ranges and land-use pressures); and A. ipaensis Krapov. & W.C. Gregory, A. cruziana Krapov., W.C. Gregory & C.E.

Gregory, and A. monticola Krapov. & Rigoni (identification based on insufficient observations and land-use pressures). It is suggested that ex situ conservation efforts should focus on the area around Pedro Gomes (300 km southeast of Cuiaba), 170 km south along the planned road from Cuiaba to Corumba, and around San Jose de Chiquitos in Bolivia, where some of the species adapted to lower temperatures may be found.

AB  - This paper describes the use of a spatially explicit population model (SEPM) to investigate the effects of different forest management strategies on a red squirrel conservation area. The study was based in woodland managed by Forest Enterprise, which manages 75 000 ha of woodlands in Northumberland, Co. Durham, Tyne and Wear, and east Cumbria. The forests contain the largest remaining red squirrel populations in northern England and the area of the study, Kidland Forest, is one of five key areas or refuges where red squirrel conservation is a priority. The SEPM integrates expert knowledge on red and grey squirrels, based on 10 years of fieldwork in the area and information from the scientific literature. We investigated the current tree species composition, distribution and proposed felling plans as well as the future restocking for Kidland Forest, an area of 2050 ha of predominantly conifer species. The assessment also included a proposed planting of 15 ha of oak and its likely consequences on grey squirrel population viability. These results were then applied to develop a forest design plan to ensure red squirrel persistence over the next rotation. Results indicated that red squirrels were at risk of extinction due to a drastic reduction in the availability of suitable habitats through clear-felling. Furthermore the proposed planting of 15 ha of oak could lead to a substantial grey squirrel population at Kidland once the trees matured and assuming that grey squirrels colonize the area. The felling profile was therefore revised, allocating a proportion of the tree crop on more wind-firm sites to long-term retentions. The approach adopted at Kidland illustrates how geographical information systems, expert knowledge on the threatened species and spatially explicit models can be integrated to assist forest managers in assessing the suitability of a site for red squirrel conservation.

AB  - Understanding the influence of anthropogenic disturbances on species' habitat use and distribution is critical to conservation managers in planning effective conservation strategies and mitigating the impact of development. Few studies have focused on the Himalayan red panda (Ailurus fulgens) in Bhutan. This study aimed to assess the habitat requirements and threats to this endangered species in the Khamaed subdistrict of the Jigme Dorji National Park, Bhutan. We employed a transect walk and plot-sampling survey design across two seasons, that is, winter and spring. In total, we surveyed 84 x 50 m radius circular plots along 51 km of existing trails within a 25.4 km(2)study area. At 500 m intervals, we established plots at random distances and direction from the trail. We recorded direct sightings (n = 2) and indirect signs (n = 14), such as droppings and footprints as evidence of red panda presence within an altitudinal range of 2,414-3,618 m. We also noted 21 tree and 12 understory species within plots with red panda evidence; the dominant tree species was the Himalayan hemlock (Tsuga dumosa) and the Asian barberry (Berberis asiatica) as an understory species. Red panda presence showed a significant positive association with distance to water sources and fir forests. Plant disturbance and infrastructure, such as power transmission lines, were identified as prominent anthropogenic threats in the study area. Based on our findings, we recommend the development and implementation of local forest management plans, livestock intensification programs, and strict application of environmental impact assessment regulations to promote the conservation of the red panda in the region.

AB  - Species-specific models of landscape capability (LC) can inform landscape conservation design. Landscape capability is "the ability of the landscape to provide the environment [aEuro broken vertical bar] and the local resources [aEuro broken vertical bar] needed for survival and reproduction [aEuro broken vertical bar] in sufficient quantity, quality and accessibility to meet the life history requirements of individuals and local populations." Landscape capability incorporates species' life histories, ecologies, and distributions to model habitat for current and future landscapes and climates as a proactive strategy for conservation planning.
   We tested the ability of a set of LC models to explain variation in point occupancy and abundance for seven bird species representative of spruce-fir, mixed conifer-hardwood, and riparian and wooded wetland macrohabitats.
   We compiled point count data sets used for biological inventory, species monitoring, and field studies across the northeastern United States to create an independent validation data set. Our validation explicitly accounted for underestimation in validation data using joint distance and time removal sampling.
   Blackpoll warbler (Setophaga striata), wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and Louisiana (Parkesia motacilla) and northern waterthrush (P. noveboracensis) models were validated as predicting variation in abundance, although this varied from not biologically meaningful (1%) to strongly meaningful (59%). We verified all seven species models [including ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), blackburnian (Setophaga fusca) and cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea)], as all were positively related to occupancy data.
   LC models represent a useful tool for conservation planning owing to their predictive ability over a regional extent. As improved remote-sensed data become available, LC layers are updated, which will improve predictions.

AB  - Amazonia is one of the most diverse biomes worldwide, and, as well as luxuriant forest, it includes mountain areas which, despite their small surface area, display fascinating endemism. In these regions, the specificity of edaphic factors is mirrored by a highly specialised, isolated flora adapted to survive adverse conditions. The Serra dos Carajas in the Brazilian state of Para is one of world's largest iron ore reserves. Known locally as canga, this ironstone formation occupies an area of 115.9 km(2), and supports campo rupestre of canga vegetation on outcrops that are mostly in the Floresta Nacional de Carajas (FLONA of Carajas) and Parque Nacional dos Campos Ferruginosos (PNCF). The recent publication of the Flora of the cangas of Carajas lists 856 species of seed plants and 186 species of ferns and lycophytes. This project assessed the canga endemic species growing in the region, and further expeditions guided by SDM were carried out in order to ascertain their distribution outisde the area. Departing from an initial list of 58 putative endemics, the final list comprises 38 species of vascular plants (c. 4% of the local flora). These are distributed in 31 genera and 22 families, including three monotypic genera: Carajasia (Rubiaceae), Monogereion and Parapiqueria (Asteraceae). From these, 24 are classified as Rare Species for Brazil and seven as Highly Restricted Endemic (EEO < 100 km(2)). An illustrated account is provided, as well as further SDM to detect other possible areas of distribution based on the studied species. The knowledge generated is aimed at directing appropriate conservation plans for the area.

AB  - Protecting critical habitats of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin,Sousa chinensis, is a hot topic of discussion for marine biodiversity conservation in China and many Southeast Asian countries. In practice, sound habitat protection action (HPA) planning often suffers from information gaps in macroscopic habitat configurations and changes in the habitat conditions of humpback dolphins. Recent publications in the journalAquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems(AQC) have served to advance humpback dolphin conservation in Chinese waters by resolving such habitat configurations and indicating significant changes in distribution patterns and habitat characteristics under intense coastal anthropogenic activity. We highlight an integrative research framework to investigate habitat configuration and long-term habitat changes when planning a holistic HPA programme for humpback dolphins. When constructing habitat configuration baselines, field surveys should be designed and conducted in a systematic manner to ensure survey efforts cover diverse environments equally, in either a spatially stratified or gridded pattern, to minimize potential spatial sampling biases. Long-term habitat changes can be revealed by comparing satellite images from different decades. Changes in habitat preferences and habitat characteristics can be explored through questionnaire surveys on local ecological knowledge, associating historical occurrences with coastline features and projecting historical habitat configuration by species distribution modelling exercises. A lack of good communication and sharing of information between research and management sectors can still be an obstacle to the implementation of sound conservation practices, however, even though there is robust scientific evidence to fill knowledge gaps in distribution and habitat baselines. We have addressed the need to establish a mechanism to improve and streamline information sharing between research teams, management sectors, and stakeholder groups.

AB  - While many scientific assessments have been recommending general strategies for biodiversity conservation under climate change, translation of these recommendations into specific actions and practice has been limited. Focusing on two biomes, rainforest and wetlands in biodiverse South East Queensland, Australia, we demonstrate how general principles can be translated into specific actions for stakeholders and responsible agencies. We synthesize research that is contextualizing protection of refugia and habitat connectivity, establishing baseline data sets to detect change and developing strategic conservation planning scenarios to adjust reserve boundaries or situate new reserves. This has been achieved by coupling spatial information on biological assets (i.e. ecosystems and species) with future climate scenarios and process models to anticipate movement of critical habitats. Conservation planning software is also being used to prioritize investment to meet specific objectives. This approach is enabling us to identify at-risk biological assets, opportunities to ameliorate threats and obstacles to delivering regional adaptation actions. A larger total reserved area is needed, with proactive planning to capture areas further inland and along watercourses. Major obstacles include conflict between urbanization and priorities for habitat conservation and the need for greater levels of investment for monitoring programmes and to protect landward shifted wetlands on private land.

AB  - Climate change is one of the major threats to global amphibian diversity, and consequently, the species distribution is expected to shift considerably in the future. Therefore, predicting such shifts is important to guide conservation and management plans. Here, we used eight independent environmental variables and four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) to model the current and future habitat suitability of the Korean clawed salamander (Onychodactylus koreanus) and then defined the dispersal limits of the species using cost distance analysis. The current habitat suitability model generated using the maximum entropy algorithm was highly consistent with the known distribution of the species and had good predictive performance. Projections onto years 2050 and 2070 predicted a drastic decrease of habitat suitability across all RCPs, with up to 90.1% decrease of suitable area and 98.0% decrease of optimal area predicted from binary presence grids. The models also predicted a northeastward shift of habitat suitability toward high-elevation areas and a persistence of suitability along the central ridge of the Baekdudaegan Range. This area is likely to become a climatic refugium for the species in the future, and it should be considered as an area of conservation priority. Therefore, we urge further ecological studies and population monitoring to be conducted across the range of O. koreanus. The vulnerability to rapid climate change is also shared by other congeneric species, and assessing the impacts of climate change on these other species is needed to better conserve this unique lineage of salamanders.

AB  - Both paleoclimatic change and anthropogenic habitat destruction can have adverse effects on species demography and, in turn, could lead a species towards being endangered and rare. Understanding the relative importance of these natural and anthropogenic factors driving species endangerment and rarity is thus crucial for effective conservation planning but remains elusive. Here, we examine the phylogeography and demographic history of an endangered conifer species in China, Torreya jackii Chun, and assess the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic factors that might have put the species in its endangered state. We collected tissue samples from all the 13 extant wild populations, and analyzed the genetic variation using eight nuclear microsatellites and four chloroplast and one mitochondrial DNA fragments. We found low genetic and nucleotide diversities, which could explain the absence of spatial and phylogeographic structure. Using a hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation technique, we identified the demographic scenario that best fits the genetic data and found that effective population size was low at least 200 000 years ago but expanded after the last glacial maximum (LGM). The paleoclimatic niche model revealed a profound effect of precipitation on the distribution of T. jackii and predicted that the current distribution areas were suitable during the LGM. Despite the post-LGM expansion, the best-supported scenario showed a dramatic population collapse during the past 300 years, when anthropogenic disturbances also increased dramatically. Overall, our study sheds light on how historical factors and human impacts jointly threaten the persistence of a species, and these aspects should be duly considered in species conservation planning.

AB  - We modelled the distributions of two toads (Bufo bufo and Epidalea calamita) in the Iberian Peninsula using the favourability function, which makes predictions directly comparable for different species and allows fuzzy logic operations to relate different models. The fuzzy intersection between individual models, representing favourability for the presence of both species simultaneously, was compared with another favourability model built on the presences shared by both species. The fuzzy union between individual models, representing favourability for the presence of any of the two species, was compared with another favourability model based on the presences of either or both of them. The fuzzy intersections between favourability for each species and the complementary of favourability for the other (corresponding to the logical operation "A and not B") were compared with models of exclusive presence of one species versus the exclusive presence of the other. The results of modelling combined species data were highly similar to those of fuzzy logic operations between individual models, proving fuzzy logic and the favourability function valuable for comparative distribution modelling. We highlight several advantages of fuzzy logic over other forms of combining distribution models, including the possibility to combine multiple species models for management and conservation planning.

AB  - This analysis presents a conservation planning framework for decisions under uncertainty and applies it to the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. Uncertainty arises from variable distributional shifts of species' ranges due to climate change. The planning framework consists of a two-stage optimization model that selects a nominal conservation area network in the first stage and evaluates its performance under the climate scenarios in the second stage. The model is applied to eleven at-risk species in Alaska including the threatened Spectacled Eider and Steller's Eider sea ducks and the polar bear. The 109th United States Congress and 2008 federal budget proposed opening for oil and gas development the "1002 Area" of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which intersects the Plain. This analysis finds that, if Arctic Alaska experiences 1.5 degrees C of warming by 2040 (as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's A2 scenario), then potential habitat will decrease significantly for eight of these at-risk species, including the polar bear. This analysis also shows that there is synergism between oil and gas development and climate change. For instance, climate change accompanied by no development of the 1002 Area results in an increase of potential habitat for Steller's Eider. However, if development accompanies climate change, then there is a 20% decrease in that area. Further, this analysis quantifies the tradeoff between development and maintenance of suitable habitat for at-risk species. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Limestone karsts on tropical land masses are considered de facto habitat islands due to their isolation from one another by non-calcareous substrata; this spatial configuration limits gene flow and induces high levels of species endemism. Apart from their biological importance, karsts are also highly valued for the ecosystem services and resources they provide if left intact. Unfortunately, conservation planning for karsts has generally lacked scientific basis. Ideally, factors affecting the richness and distribution of karst-endemic taxa should be incorporated into quantitative guidelines for karst reserve selection. Using land snail data from 43 different karstic towers in Malaysia, we: (1) identified biogeographical factors (i.e., area, isolation, surrounding soil type and geological age) hypothesized to influence endemic richness; and (2) investigated how species distributions varied among karsts in different regions. Generalized linear mixed-effect models revealed the relatively important effects of surrounding soil type and karst area on land snail endemism; the most parsimonious model contributed to 63.6% of the Akaike's Information Criterion weight and explained over 18% of the deviance in karst-endemic richness (of which 10.0% was explained by surrounding soil type). Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling indicated that karsts in different regions of Malaysia had distinct malacofaunas. Therefore, conservation planners should take into account karst size, surrounding soil type and the influence of geographic barriers to maximize the protection of land snails and possibly other karst-endemic taxa, which are increasingly threatened by quarrying throughout Southeast Asia.

AB  - Species distribution modelling is increasingly used in ecological studies and is particularly useful in conservation planning. Models are, however, typically created with a coarse resolution, although conservation planning often requires a high resolution. In this study we created high resolution models and explored central aspects of the modelling procedure; transferability and predictive performance of the models. We created models for two breeding water bird species, common eider Somateria mollissima and herring gull Larus argentatus, based on data from two regions in the Finnish archipelago (234 islands). We used seven variables which we considered as potential predictors of nest site location: distance to forest, distance to rock and distance to low vegetation, exposure, elevation, slope and curvature of the land surface. We tested the predictive ability of the models crosswise between the areas by using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The models were transferable between our study areas and the predictive performance varied from fair to excellent. The most important predictors overall were exposure and distance to forest. More general models, with higher regularization values in the Maxent software, had better transferability regarding predictive performance. However, when we fitted a model based on 60% of the data from both regions and evaluated the model on the remaining 40%, the most complex model had the highest accuracy. Extrapolation of SDMs, evaluated on data from the same region, should therefore always be done with caution as the most accurate model might not have the best transferability if it is not general enough.

AB  - Current global warming causes range changes and affects the distribution of species. Microendemics are the first affected and the most threatened by climate change. Here, we model the potential range of the rupestrian grassland biome (campos rupestres) in a neotropical, endemic-rich mountain range to project changes in its distribution and biodiversity. Our approach is based on the distribution of 42 asclepiad species endemic to the Espinhago Range, southeastern Brazil. Models were produced for the present and for 2020, 2050 and 2080, under two different scenarios of CO2 emission, by implementing a maximum entropy machine-learning algorithm (maxent). The area suitable for campos rupestres was projected to be smaller in the future, and in 2080 would represent approximately half of the current area, most of which would be restricted to the southern portion of the Espinhaco Range. According to our models, by the end of the century, the area suitable for campos rupestres in the northern portion of the Espinhago Range (Chapada Diamantina) would be reduced to only 1.7%, restricted to two small fragments that are not yet protected by the current reserves. This habitat loss corresponds to an estimated 56% richness loss and the likely extinction of 328 (97%) microendemic species of angiosperms. Our results highlight the importance of approaches at local and regional scales for conservation planning in a world undergoing anthropogenic climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are statistical tools aiming at mapping and predicting species distributions across landscapes. Data acquisition being limited in space and time, SDM are commonly used to predict species distribution in unsampled areas or years, with the expectation that modelled habitat-species relationships will hold across spatial or temporal contexts (i.e., model transferability). This key aspect of habitat modelling has major implications for spatial management, yet it has received limited attention, especially in the dynamic marine realm. Our aims were to test geographical and temporal habitat model transferability and to make recommendations for future population-scale habitat modelling. Location Methods Two contrasted regions of the North Western Mediterranean Sea: the cold and productive waters of the Gulf of Lion, and the warm and oligotrophic waters of Corsica. We GPS-tracked 189 Scopoli's shearwaters, Calonectris diomedea, at four breeding sites during the chick-rearing period in 2011 and 2012 (418 foraging trips), and analysed their fine-scale foraging behaviour. We then built colony-specific habitat models (GAMMs) to test SDM geographical and temporal transferability and investigated the effect of extrinsic (environmental extrapolation) and intrinsic (trip characteristics) factors on transferability. Results Main conclusions Scopoli's shearwaters from our four study sites had comparable foraging strategies (as assessed from trip characteristics and isotopic diet tracers). Despite such similarities, SDMs revealed colony-specific habitat associations. Geographical and temporal model transferability was better within than between regions. Crucially, our study illustrates how habitat-species relationships can vary between colonies located <200 km apart, and underlines the effect of spatio-temporal extrapolation in habitat modelling. We therefore warn that defining adequate spatial scales for model predictions is critical to sound marine spatial planning and conservation.

AB  - A recovery plan for an imperiled plant species is impossible without good knowledge of population demography and biotic/abiotic effects on the latter. The aim of our study was to analyze to what extent the Negev populations of Iris atrofusca Baker (Iridaceae), a species endemic to Israel and Jordan, are threatened by the internal population dynamics, and the factors affecting it, including grazing and competition. We conducted a demographic population viability analysis to identify the most important life cycle stages and forecast the population future; and tested experimentally the effects of grazing and competition with a co-occurring Asphodelus ramosus on species growth and reproduction. In addition, we utilized species distribution modeling (SDM) to determine a potentially suitable species range, both under the current climate and the climate expected in the near future. After evaluating the long-term demographic trends of the Negev populations, the recommended conservation actions to prevent their disappearance were not congruent for two different parts of this region because both the population processes of reproduction and recruitment and the role of external factors affecting them differed between the sub-regions.

AB  - Understanding the driving forces behind the distribution of threatened species is critical to set priorities for conservation measures and spatial planning. We examined the distribution of a globally threatened bird, the corncrake (Crex crex), in the lowland floodplains of the Rhine River, which provide an important breeding habitat for the species. We related corncrake distribution to landscape characteristics (area, shape, texture, diversity) at three spatial scales: distinct floodplain units ("floodplain scale"), circular zones around individual observations ("home range scale"), and individual patches ("patch scale") using logistic regression. Potential intrinsic spatial patterns in the corncrake data were accounted for by including geographic coordinates and an autocovariate as predictors in the regression analysis. The autocovariate was the most important predictor of corncrake occurrence, probably reflecting the strong conspecific attraction that is characteristic of the species. Significant landscape predictors mainly pertained to area characteristics at the patch scale and the home range scale; the probability of corncrake occurrence increased with potential habitat area, patch area, and nature reserve area. The median potential habitat patch size associated with corncrake occurrence was 11.3 ha; 90% of the corncrake records were associated with patches at least 2.2 ha in size. These results indicate that the corncrake is an area-sensitive species, possibly governed by the males' tendency to reside near other males while maintaining distinct territories. Our results imply that corncrake habitat conservation schemes should focus on the preservation of sufficient potential habitat area and that existing management measures, like delayed mowing, should be implemented in relatively large, preferably contiguous areas.

AB  - This study proposes and discusses a multi-scale spatial planning method implemented simultaneously at local and national level to prioritize ecosystem management actions across landscapes and seascapes. Mismatches in scale between the occurrence of biodiversity patterns and ecological processes, and the size and nature of the human footprint, and the different levels and scope of governance, are a significant challenge in conservation planning. These scale mismatches are further confounded by data resolution disparities across and amongst the different scales. To address this challenge, we developed a multi-resolution scale-linked marine spatial planning method. We tested this approach in the development of a Conservation Plan for a significant portion of South Africa's exclusive economic zone, adjacent to the east coast province of KwaZulu-Natal (the SeaPlan project). The study's dataset integrated the geographic distribution of 390 biodiversity elements (species, habitats, and oceanographic processes) and 38 human activities. A multi-resolution system of planning unit layers (PUL), with individual PUs ranging in resolution from 0.2 to 10 km, was designed to arrange and analyse these data. Spatial priorities for conservation were selected incrementally at different scales, contributing conservation targets from the fine-, medium- and large-scale analyses, and from the coast to the offshore. Compared to a basic single-resolution scale-unlinked plan, our multi-resolution scale-linked method selects 6% less conservation area to achieve the same targets. Compared to a multi-resolution scale-unlinked plan, our method requires only an additional 5% area. Overall, this method reflects the multi-scale nature of marine social-ecological systems more realistically, is relatively simple and replicable, and serves to better connect fine-scale and large-scale spatial management policies. We discuss the impacts of this study on protected area expansion planning processes in South Africa. This study showcases a methodological advance that has the potential to impact marine spatial planning practices and policies.

AB  - The small red brocket deer Mazama bororo is endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a biome that has been greatly fragmented and altered by human activities. This elusive species is morphologically similar to the red brocket deer Mazama americana and the Brazilian dwarf brocket deer Mazama nana, and genetic typing is necessary for reliable identification. To determine the geographical range of M. bororo more accurately, we conducted non-invasive genetic sampling using scat detection dogs trained to locate deer faeces. We surveyed 46 protected areas located within the species' potential distribution and collected a total of 555 scat samples in 30 of the protected areas. Using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism approach, we genotyped 497 scat samples (89%) and detected M. bororo in seven localities in three Brazilian states. The results support a range extension of the small red brocket deer to latitudes 23 and 28 degrees S and longitudes 47 and 49 degrees W. We show that the species' distribution is associated with 37,517 km(2) of the Ombrophilous Dense Forest in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and this conclusion is supported by species distribution modelling. The small red brocket deer is the largest endemic species in Brazil and may have the smallest geographical distribution of any Neotropical deer species. This species occupies fragmented landscapes and is threatened by human encroachment, poaching, and predation by dogs, and based on our findings we recommend policy intervention for conservation planning of the Ombrophilous Dense Forest.

   Location Europe.
   Methods Using recently updated catchment-scale species data and climate projections from multiple climate models, we assessed the climate change threat by the 2050s for 1648 European freshwater plants, fishes, molluscs, odonates, amphibians, crayfish and turtles for two dispersal scenarios and identified hot-spots of change at three spatial scales: major river basins, countries and freshwater ecoregions. We considered both common species and the often overlooked rare species. To set our findings within the context of current and future conservation networks, we evaluated the coverage of freshwater biodiversity by Europe's protected area network.
   Results Six per cent of common and 77% of rare species are predicted to lose more than 90% of their current range. Eight fish species and nine mollusc species are predicted to experience 100% range loss under climate change. As the most species-rich group, molluscs are particularly vulnerable due to the high proportion of rare species and their relatively limited ability to disperse. Furthermore, around 50% of molluscs and fish species will have no protected area coverage given their projected distributions.
   Main conclusions We identified the species most at threat due to projected changes in both catchment suitability and representation within the European protected area network. Our findings suggest an urgent need for freshwater management plans to facilitate adaptation to climate change.

AB  - Species' range maps based on expert opinion are a critical resource for conservation planning. Expert maps are usually accompanied by species descriptions that specify sources of internal range heterogeneity, such as habitat associations, but these are rarely considered when using expert maps for analyses. We developed a quantitative metric (expert score) to evaluate the agreement between an expert map and a habitat probability surface obtained from a species distribution model. This method rewards both the avoidance of unsuitable sites and the inclusion of suitable sites in the expert map. We obtained expert maps of 330 butterfly species from each of 2 widely used North American sources (Glassberg [1999, 2001] and Scott [1986]) and computed species-wise expert scores for each. Overall, the Glassberg maps secured higher expert scores than Scott (0.61 and 0.41, respectively) due to the specific rules (e.g., Glassberg only included regions where the species was known to reproduce whereas Scott included all areas a species expanded to each year) they used to include or exclude areas from ranges. The predictive performance of expert maps was almost always hampered by the inclusion of unsuitable sites, rather than by exclusion of suitable sites (deviance outside of expert maps was extremely low). Map topology was the primary predictor of expert performance rather than any factor related to species characteristics such as mobility. Given the heterogeneity and discontinuity of suitable landscapes, expert maps drawn with more detail are more likely to agree with species distribution models and thus minimize both commission and omission errors.

AB  - Identifying the factors predicting the high-elevation suitable habitats of Central Asian argali wild sheep and how these suitable habitats are affected by the changing climate regimes could help address conservation and management efforts and identify future critical habitat for the species in eastern Tajikistan. This study used environmental niche models (ENMs) to map and compare potential present and future distributions of suitable environmental conditions for Marco Polo argali. Argali occurrence points were collected during field surveys conducted from 2009 to 2016. Our models showed that terrain ruggedness and annual mean temperature had strong correlations on argali distribution. We then used two greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for two future time periods (2050 and 2070) to model the impacts of climate change on Marco Polo argali habitat. Results indicated a decline of suitable habitat with majority of losses observed at lower elevations (3,300-4,300m). Models that considered all variables (climatic and nonclimatic) predicted losses of present suitable areas of 60.6% (6,928km(2)) and 63.2% (7,219km(2)) by 2050 and 2070, respectively. Results also showed averaged habitat gains of 46.2% (6,106km(2)) at much higher elevations (4,500-6,900 m) and that elevational shifts of habitat use could occur in the future. Our results could provide information for conservation planning for this near threatened species in the region.

AB  - The jaguar (Panthera onca) inhabits most of the lowlands (<2000 m) of central and South America in small and numerous fragmented populations. This species now occupies only 50% of its historic range and is included in ICUN red list. Current conservation and management plans rely on the identification and preservation of corridors and potential areas for species dispersion that provide gene flow. Over the last decade, expert-based knowledge consolidation and computational modeling complemented with radio-telemetry and camera-trapping analysis defined suitable areas for jaguar long-term survival and corridors for preserving jaguar connectivity. However, none of these static models incorporate jaguar population dynamics and assume that current population distribution is at steady state equilibrium. Here, we analyze jaguar metapopulation dynamics with a spatially explicit stochastic dispersal model to predict jaguar population distribution and density at a continental level. We also incorporate other biological features in the model such as gender differences regarding movement patterns and include the effect of human-jaguar conflict. This dynamic model provides a good framework for jaguar conservation analysis by providing new insights into jaguar migration and species viability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pond turtle Emys trinacris is an endangered endemic species of Sicily showing a fragmented distribution throughout the main island. In this study, we applied "Ensemble Niche Modelling", combining more classical statistical techniques as Generalized Linear Models and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines with machine-learning approaches as Boosted Regression Trees and Maxent, to model the potential distribution of the species under current and future climatic conditions. Moreover, a "gap analysis" performed on both the species' presence sites and the predictions from the Ensemble Models is proposed to integrate outputs from these models, in order to assess the conservation status of this threatened species in the context of biodiversity management. For this aim, four "Representative Concentration Pathways", corresponding to different greenhouse gases emissions trajectories were considered to project the obtained models to both 2050 and 2070. Areas lost, gained or remaining stable for the target species in the projected models were calculated. E. trinacris' potential distribution resulted to be significantly dependent upon precipitation-linked variables, mainly precipitation of wettest and coldest quarter. Future negative effects for the conservation of this species, because of more unstable precipitation patterns and extreme meteorological events, emerged from our analyses. Further, the sites currently inhabited by E. trinacris are, for more than a half, out of the Protected Areas network, highlighting an inadequate management of the species by the authorities responsible for its protection. Our results, therefore, suggest that in the next future the Sicilian pond turtle will need the utmost attention by the scientific community to avoid the imminent risk of extinction. Finally, the gap analysis performed in GIS environment resulted to be a very informative post-modeling technique, potentially applicable to the management of species at risk and to Protected Areas' planning in many contexts.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most significant challenges to biodiversity conservation, particularly in dry tropical islands, such as the Cabo Verde archipelago where only three endemic tree taxa occur - Dracaena draco subsp. caboverdeana, Phoenix atlantica and Sideroxylon marginatum - all classified as threatened. The main goal of this study was to predict the possible shifts in the climatically suitable habitat ranges for Cabo Verdean endemic tree species under different climate change scenarios. We applied species distribution models (SDMs) to the available occurrence data, and projected the distribution of the three taxa for 2050 and 2080, according to the expected climate change scenarios. The best models were obtained using the Random Forest algorithm; they showed that, by 2080, the suitable habitat for Dracaena draco subsp. caboverdeana and Sideroxylon marginatum will have decreased by 28% and 34%, respectively; conversely, the suitable habitat will have increased by 59% for Phoenix atlantica, the taxon best adapted to arid conditions. Additionally, Santo Antao is the island where endangered trees are more encompassed by protected areas. Overall, this study contributed with new integrated data to support the design and implementation of a strategic plan to promote the conservation and ecological value of Cabo Verde endemic trees in this climatically vulnerable country.

AB  - Wind farms are steadily growing across Europe, with potentially detrimental effects on wildlife. Indeed, cumulative impacts in addition to local effects should be considered when planning wind farm development at a regional scale, and mapping the potential risk to bats at this scale would help in the large-scale planning of wind turbines and focus field surveys on vulnerable areas. Although modelling offers a powerful approach to tackle this goal, its application has been thus far neglected. We developed a simple regional-scale analysis in an area of central Italy (Molise region) that is undergoing considerable wind farm development. We implemented species distribution models (SDMs) for two bat species vulnerable to wind farm impact, Nyctalus leisleri and Pipistrellus pipistrellus. We developed risk maps by overlaying SDMs for the two species with turbine locations, assessed the alteration of the landscape patterns of foraging habitat patches determined by the wind turbines, and identified highly vulnerable areas where wind farm construction would be particularly risky. SDMs were statistically robust (AUC a parts per thousand yen0.8 for both species) and revealed that 41 % of the region offers suitable foraging habitat for both species. These areas host over 50 % of the existing or planned wind farms, with 21 % of the turbines located within 150 m of forest edges, suggesting an increase in fatality risk. The alterations in suitable foraging patches consisted of a 7.7 % increase in the number of patches, a 10.7 % increase in the shape index, and a 8.1 % decrease in the mean patch area. The region's western portion, which is most suitable to both species, requires careful consideration with regard to future wind farm planning.

AB  - Climate change poses a great challenge for biodiversity conservation. Several studies exist regarding climate change's impacts on European plants, yet none has investigated how climate change will affect the extinction risk of the entire endemic flora of an island biodiversity hotspot, with intense human disturbance. Our aim is to assess climate change's impacts on the biodiversity patterns of the endemic plants of Crete (S Aegean) and provide a case-study upon which a climate-smart conservation planning strategy might be set. We employed a variety of macroecological analyses and estimated the current and future biodiversity, conservation and extinction hotspots in Crete. We evaluated the effectiveness of climatic refugia and the Natura 2000 network of protected areas (PAs) for protecting the most vulnerable species and identified the taxa of conservation priority based on the Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) index. The results revealed that high altitude areas of Cretan mountains constitute biodiversity hotspots and areas of high conservation and evolutionary value. Due to the "escalator to extinction" phenomenon, these areas are projected to become diversity "death-zones" and should thus be prioritised. Conservation efforts should be targeted at areas with overlaps among PAs and climatic refugia, characterised by high diversity and EDGE scores. This conservation-prioritisation planning will allow the preservation of evolutionary heritage, trait diversity and future ecosystem services for human well-being and acts as a pilot for similar regions worldwide.

AB  - Protected areas in the European Union under the Natura 2000 reserve system cover about 17 percent of the total land area. Systematic evaluations of the effectiveness of the current reserve system have been scarce and restricted to regional assessments. One reason for that may be the poor availability of comprehensive fine scale biodiversity data for the highly fragmented and densely human-populated European continent. We apply recently developed modeling tools for systematic conservation planning to conduct a detailed gap analysis using coarse scale species occurrence data. The employed mathematical model uses mixed integer programming to determine the cost-minimizing distribution of habitat locations subject to biophysical, economic, and policy restrictions. We include fine scale wetland habitat data as well as species-specific proxies for population density and viable population threshold. First, we evaluate the performance of the current Natura 2000 system in covering endangered wetland vertebrate species. Results show that five area-demanding vertebrates are not covered by the current reserve system. Second, we identify potentials for expanding the network to move toward complete coverage for the considered species mostly in countries of North-Eastern Europe. About 3 million hectares of additional reserve area at a cost of 107 million Euro per year would be required to achieve coverage of all considered species. Third, we present spatially explicit priority regions for a cost-effective expansion of the current reserve network.

AB  - Although human-modified habitats often result in a loss of biodiversity, some have been found to serve as habitat refuges for threatened species. Given the globally declining status of amphibians, understanding why some species are found in heavily modified environments is of considerable interest. We used the endangered green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) as a model to investigate the factors influencing their distribution toward industrial areas within a landscape. The number of permanent waterbodies within a kilometer of surveyed sites was the best predictor of L aurea occupancy, abundance and reproduction. It appears that industrial activities, such as dredging and waste disposal inadvertently created refuge habitat for L aurea to fortuitously persist in a heavily modified landscape. Future conservation plans should mimic the positive effects of industrialization, such as increasing the number of permanent waterbodies, especially in areas containing ephemeral or isolated waterbodies and threatened with drought. Our findings also suggest that despite amphibians being relatively small animals, some species may require a larger landscape than anticipated. Recognizing life history traits, in combination with a landscape-based approach toward species with perceived limited motility, may result in more successful conservation outcomes. Identifying why threatened species persist in heavily disturbed landscapes, such as industrial sites, can provide direction toward future conservation efforts to prevent and reverse their decline.

AB  - Simple Summary Populations of many marine species are threatened by a number of interacting factors, including anthropogenic activities, climate change, and biodiversity loss. The assessment of the conservation status of such populations relies heavily on several types of data, such as large-scale geographical and ecological distribution. Seahorses are charismatic fish sensitive to environmental pressures, and according to the IUCN directive 95/2020, they should be considered a model for environmental quality assessment. As in many other areas, the data on seahorse ecological distribution in Europe are scattered, patchy, and mainly focused on small-scale studies. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review using the PRISMA protocol to identify the current knowledge status, detect gaps, and propose future research priorities. We analyzed 32 years of published studies and described the distribution of Hippocampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus across 176 sites in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Black Sea as a function of habitat, depth, and degree of confinement. The applied method evidenced the overall lack of a detailed habitat description in published studies. Seahorse conservation would benefit from an analytical description of habitats, such as data on the depth, nature of the substrate, and associated biological communities, as well as the use of a standardized habitat classification system, such as formally recognized EUNIS habitat codes. Human pressures on marine ecosystems have caused extensive degradation of marine habitats and several local extinctions. Overexploitation and destructive fishing practices are responsible for biodiversity loss in many coastal ecosystems. The definition of conservation programs in marine fish requires comprehensive knowledge on large-scale geographical distribution, while considering distribution/abundance patterns in relation to key environmental variables. Due to their life-cycle traits, the two European seahorses (Hippocampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus), as with other congeneric species, are particularly sensitive to the effects of anthropogenic activities and habitat changes. However, information on the ecological distribution of these two species is scattered, patchy, and mainly focused on small-scale studies. In this paper, we followed an international standard protocol for systematic reviews (the PRISMA protocol) to provide a detailed assessment of the two species' geographical distribution in relation to the environmental characteristics. According to the 134 analyzed studies, Hippocampus guttulatus is more common in confined areas, while H. hippocampus is found in marine shelf waters. With several interspecific differences, seagrasses were the most used holdfasts of both species. The EUNIS codes (European nature information system) referring to a specific and unique habitat were discussed as a potential tool for defining the ecological distribution of the two species. The obtained results and their future implementation could help plan conservation actions.

AB  - It is a hard reality that virtually all countries, no matter how well resourced, take conservation and land use decisions based on highly patchy and imperfect data - if indeed any data at all. Despite a mushrooming of scientific evidence and journals in the past decade, and open-access provision of many expensive global datasets, developing countries in particular often have to make do with inaccurate and coarse-scale global data, in the absence of targeted, local data to solve immediate conservation problems. To what extent can citizen science data compensate for the patchiness of conventional government-gathered scientific data in order to support planning, policy and management? We demonstrate how southern Africa's citizen science-based "early warning system for biodiversity" is used to support land-use planning and conservation decisions, including Red List, strategic and project-based environmental impact assessments and national protected area expansion and implementation strategies. This system integrates volunteer-based species atlases such as the Protea Atlas Project and Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP), species population monitoring such as the Custodians of Rare and Endangered Wildflowers (CREW) project, and site-based rapid assessment and monitoring such as MyBirdPatch and BioBlitz. Countries in southern Africa are on a sharp continuum of research capacity, funding, political engagement and own datasets. Yet there is the capacity for adaptive management systems based in significant part on civil society volunteerism. Crucially, these must be underpinned by statistically sound, simple, repeatable scientific protocols, which are still rare in Africa. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate and reliable predictions of pest species distributions in forest ecosystems are urgently needed by forest managers to develop management plans and monitor new areas of potential establishment. Presence-only species distribution models are commonly used in these evaluations. The maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) has gained popularity for modelling species distribution. Here, MaxEnt was used to model the spatial distribution of the Mexican pine bark beetle (Dendroctonus mexicanus) in a daily fashion by using forecast data from the Weather Research and Forecasting model. This study aimed to exploit freely available geographic and environmental data and software and thus provide a pathway to overcome the lack of costly data and technical guidance that are a challenge to implementing national monitoring and management strategies in developing countries. Our results showed overall agreement values between 60 and 87%. The results of this research can be used for D. mexicanus monitoring and management and may aid as a model to monitor similar species.

   The knowledge of both potential distribution and habitat suitability is fundamental for conservation planning and management of a variety of taxa world-wide. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied as predictive tools for these purposes. Such models are based on the concept of ecological niche and assume that species distribute themselves based on niche spaces defined by climate and habitat features. However, this assumption can be violated due to the existence of pure spatial range constraints, a factor rarely accounted for in SDMs, particularly for highly mobile species. We analyse whether pure distance effects, niche-based environmental responses or a combination of both factors can play an important role in limiting the large-scale distribution of highly mobile species.
   Location
   Spain, southern Europe.
   Methods
   We modelled the spatial distribution of an expanding raptor species, the marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus, in Spain. We implemented one conventional statistical method (generalized linear model) and one nonparametric technique (maximum entropy, Maxent) using a large dataset on marsh harrier occurrence (n=1586) in two different periods of the annual cycle, that is breeding and wintering seasons. We developed models that included environmental variables and that either ignored or incorporated spatial constraints using spatial eigenvector mapping (spatial filters).
   Results
   By comparing model accuracy, we found evidence that the distribution of marsh harriers in Spain was spatially constrained beyond environmental variables and that the effect of spatial constraints varies depending on the period of their annual cycle.
   Main conclusions
   Contrary to the equilibrium postulate, our results support the prediction that environmental specializations do not necessarily result in complete habitat matching due to dispersal limitations. Thus, ignoring spatial constraints in SDMs can lead to misunderstandings of the ecological mechanisms that explain species range limits.

AB  - High Nature Value (HNV) farmland is typically characterised by low-intensity farming associated with high biodiversity and species of conservation concern. Mapping the occurrence and distribution of such farmland are useful for appropriate targeting of conservation measures and supporting associated rural communities. We mapped the likely distribution of HNV farmland in the Republic of Ireland using a linear regression model incorporating established European indicators, adapted for Ireland and weightings based on expert opinion. The indicators used were semi-natural habitat cover, stocking density, hedgerow density, river and stream density and soil diversity, with highest weightings placed on the first two indicators (40% and 30%, respectively). The map provides information on the likely occurrence and distribution of HNV farmland in each electoral division as a reference point for future monitoring of the distribution of HNV farmland in the Republic of Ireland in order to assist with planning and policy development for the rural environment.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems appear to be sensitive to even minor climatic shifts, and the dendritic nature of rivers as well as patchy distribution of habitats within the terrestrial landscape could limit the ability of species to track suitable climate conditions. Although the importance of dispersal is recognised in theory, there is great uncertainty when quantifying the capacity of species to shift their distributions in response to climate change. The influence of dispersal capacity on species' vulnerability to climate change was assessed, using the modelled projections of 527 freshwater species in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Species' future ranges were calculated by iteratively identifying colonisation of accessible habitats and loss of suitable habitats within network models. The accessibility of new habitats was based on a given dispersal mode (aquatic, semi-terrestrial and aerial). The relative impact of dispersal parameters on projected range were evaluated alongside other known sources of uncertainty (climate and emissions scenarios, modelling algorithm and biological group), analysed collectively in a generalised additive mixed-model, and spatially to locate regions of NSW where projections are associated with the most uncertainty. Our simulations (1.4million scenario combinations) suggest at least a third of species will lose more than half their range under climate change. Nevertheless, we emphasise the broad uncertainty that any average encapsulates. Dispersal capacity only had a minor impact on projected range shifts relative to other modelling assumptions but the network-pathways and maps of uncertainty have value for conservation planning at large scales. Projected range losses initially decreased rapidly as dispersal rates increased but the benefits are reduced above 2-3kmyear(-1). Taxa restricted to dispersal within the stream network (aquatic) were more vulnerable to climate change than taxa with semi-terrestrial or aerial dispersal and maps of variation due to dispersal mode and rate indicate where habitat connectivity would be most beneficial. This study demonstrates the breadth of uncertainties that challenge plans for improving ecosystem adaptation under climate change and highlights where in the landscape those differences were consistent. We emphasise the need for freshwater conservation studies to be ecologically representative, to focus on broad-scale connectivity for taxa that can move between catchments, and an accessible network of refugia for taxa with more limited dispersal.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been established across all marine environments, though their coherence and effectiveness in protecting umbrella species remains unclear. We used a multi-model ensemble forecasting approach, on 8 years of at-sea censuses of 30 seabird species to identify candidate MPAs in the Portuguese coast, prioritizing important areas for their conservation based on their occurrence and distribution. We overlapped the outputs generated by the Ensemble Ecological Niche Models (EENMs) with layers representing important environmental stressors (fishing intensity, ship density and oil pollution risk), and calculated loss in conservation value using them as cost layers. Three key marine areas were identified along the Portuguese coast: For breeders, there was a key marine area encompassing the Tagus and Sado estuaries and Berlengas archipelago; for non breeders and migratory species two important areas were identified in the Northern and Southern coast. The key marine area identified in the Northern coast is characterized by high productivity and biodiversity, and can be affected by oil pollution from the refineries and the intensive ship traffic in this area. Also, the area identified in the Southern coast of Portugal for migratory seabirds overlaps extensively with areas of high fishing activity. Our results show that the Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) established along the Portuguese coast protect more than a third of the areas that we prioritized for breeding species and the official MPAs near 65% of the same areas. In contrast, Current IBAs and national legislation protect less than 4% of the coastal areas that we prioritize for non-breeding species in this study. Our study, combining multi-species distribution with environmental constraints induced by human activities, allowed us to assess the coherence of the Portuguese marine planning and identify candidate areas to join the Portuguese network of marine protected areas. Our results, employing data from annual at-sea surveys together with the human stressors known to affect the Portuguese coast, proved to be an extremely useful strategy to identify spatial conservation areas along the Portuguese coast as well as to access the adequacy and consistency of those areas. Despite the constraints of this demanding approach, we are confident that our study provides a reliable strategy to inform Marine conservation efforts and management planning in similar coastal environments elsewhere, characterized by strong coastal upwelling movements.

AB  - Although future anthropogenic climate change is recognized as one of the major threats to European species, its implementation during reserve planning has only been started recently. We here describe climate change impacts on the Iberian endemic lizard Lacerta schreiberi expecting serious declines and range reductions due to a loss of suitable climate space in the next future. We apply species distribution models to assess possible future changes in the lizard's range, identify areas with high extinction risk meriting conservation efforts and analyze whether the Natura 2000 network in its current stage will offer a sufficient protection for the genetically most valuable lineages. Despite a very good coverage and connectivity of the most valuable populations of L. schreiberi with the existing protected sites network, our results predict a strong loss of genetic variability by 2080. Also, two main patterns become evident: While the genetically less diverse north-western populations may be less affected by climate change, the climate change effects on the southern isolates and the genetically most diverse populations within the Central System may be devastating. To improve a successful prospective conservation of L. schreiberi the management of protected sites needs to consider the processes that threaten this species. Furthermore, our study highlights the urgent need to consider climate change effects on evolutionary significant units within the Natura 2000 framework.

AB  - Anticipating the ecological effects of climate change to inform natural resource climate adaptation planning represents one of the primary challenges of contemporary conservation science. Species distribution models have become a widely used tool to generate first-pass estimates of climate change impacts to species probabilities of occurrence. There are a number of technical challenges to constructing species distribution models that can be alleviated by the use of scientific workflow software. These challenges include data integration, visualization of modeled predictor-response relationships, and ensuring that models are reproducible and transferable in an adaptive natural resource management framework. We used freely available software called VisTrails Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (VisTrails:SAHM) along with a novel ecohydrological predictor dataset and the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 future climate projections to construct species distribution models for eight forest and shrub species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the Northern Rocky Mountains USA. The species considered included multiple species of sagebrush and juniper, Aims flexilis, Pinus contorta, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Populus tremuloides, Abies lasciocarpa, Picea engelmannii, and Pinus albicaulis. Current and future species probabilities of occurrence were mapped in a GIS by land ownership category to assess the feasibility of undertaking present and future management action. Results suggested that decreasing spring snowpack and increasing late-season soil moisture deficit will lead to deteriorating habitat area for mountain forest species and expansion of habitat area for sagebrush and juniper communities. Results were consistent across nine global climate models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios. For most forest species their projected future distributions moved up in elevation from general federal to federally restricted lands where active management is currently prohibited by agency policy. Though not yet fully mature, custom scientific workflow software shows considerable promise to ease many of the technical challenges inherent in modeling the potential ecological impacts of climate change to support climate adaptation planning.

AB  - Decisions about land use significantly influence biodiversity globally. The field of spatial conservation prioritisation explores allocation of conservation effort, including for reserve network expansion, targeting habitat restoration, or minimising ecological impacts of development. Inevitably, the utility of such planning depends on the quantity and quality input data, including spatial information on biodiversity, threats, and cost of action. In this work we systematically develop understanding about the significance of these different data types in spatial conservation prioritisation. We clarify the common ways different data types enter an analysis, develop mathematical models to understand the effects of data in spatial prioritisation, and survey literature to establish typical quantities of different types of data used. We use Jackknife analysis to derive the expected change in site values, when a single new data layer is added to a prioritisation. We validate mathematical formulae for expected impacts using simulations. A survey of scientific literature reveals that typical spatial prioritisation analyses include hundreds of biodiversity feature layers (species, habitat types, ecosystem services), but the count of cost, threat or habitat condition layers is typically 0-5. Due to these differences, and the mathematical formulations commonly used to combine data types, the influence of a single cost, threat, or habitat condition data layer can be an order or two higher than the influence of a single biodiversity feature layer. In a classical cost-effectiveness formulation (benefits divided by costs, B/C) the influence of a single cost layer can even be as large as the joint influence of thousands of species distributions. We also clarify how changes in data impact site values and spatial priority rankings differently, with the latter being further influenced by data correlations, the spread of numeric values inside data layers and other data characteristics. For example, costs influence priorities significantly if cost is positively correlated with biodiversity, but the correlation is the other way around for biodiversity and habitat condition. This work helps conservation practitioners to direct efforts when collating data for spatial conservation planning. It also helps decision makers understand where to focus attention when interpreting conservation plans and their uncertainties.

AB  - Aim Various statistical techniques have been used to model species probabilities of occurrence in response to environmental conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of methods and investigates whether errors in model predictions are associated to specific kinds of geographical and environmental distributions of species.
   Location Portugal, Western Europe.
   Methods Probabilities of occurrence for 44 species of amphibians and reptiles in Portugal were modelled using seven modelling techniques: Gower metric, Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, classification trees, neural networks, generalized linear models, generalized additive models and spatial interpolators. Generalized linear and additive models were constructed with and without a term accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Model performance was measured using two methods: sensitivity and Kappa index. Species were grouped according to their spatial (area of occupancy and extent of occurrence) and environmental (marginality and tolerance) distributions. Two-way comparison tests were performed to detect significant interactions between models and species groups.
   Results Interaction between model and species groups was significant for both sensitivity and Kappa index. This indicates that model performance varied for species with different geographical and environmental distributions. Artificial neural networks performed generally better, immediately followed by generalized additive models including a covariate term for spatial autocorrelation. Non-parametric methods were preferred to parametric approaches, especially when modelling distributions of species with a greater area of occupancy, a larger extent of occurrence, lower marginality and higher tolerance.
   Main conclusions This is a first attempt to relate performance of modelling techniques with species spatial and environmental distributions. Results indicate a strong relationship between model performance and the kinds of species distributions being modelled. Some methods performed generally better, but no method was superior in all circumstances. A suggestion is made that choice of the appropriate method should be contingent on the goals and kinds of distributions being modelled.

AB  - Estuaries are among the most productive coastal ecosystems, supporting a wide variety of marine fishes and their early stages. High spatial and temporal variability in estuaries implies that management strategies must incorporate dynamic features to be efficient. In our study, we analysed 13 years of data on ichthyoplankton from the Patos Lagoon estuary (Brazil) to assess whether temporal variability can show distinct spatial patterns of fish eggs and larval distribution and to discuss how these results can be helpful to conservation planning. Spatial patterns of fish egg and larval assemblages were evaluated using cluster analysis. Indicator taxa for each group were also calculated as a product of the relative frequency and relative average abundance in each group. In addition, we used generalized linear models to analyse fish egg and larval abundance in relation to environmental variables. Results showed that fish eggs and larvae exhibit high variability among months, years and sampling stations in the time series. Temporal occurrence and spatial distribution were mainly associated with salinity. We found distinct spatial patterns for fish eggs and larvae in the Patos Lagoon estuary. Groups identified were different among years and indicated by a distinct genus. Our results can be considered as a first exploratory step to help managers to decide which species and temporal scale should be studied in detail and incorporated in management plans. Spatial conservation planning incorporating fluctuations in abundance and assemblage structure over time may help to ensure conservation for biodiversity persistence in highly dynamic ecosystems such as the Patos Lagoon estuary.

AB  - Vast, pristine ecosystems and their biodiversity are vanishing globally at frightening speed, but many large tracts of wilderness have not yet been systematically inventoried and important natural populations of threatened species remain poorly characterized. The forest-savanna ecotone of the Eastern Central African Republic (CAR) is one such poorly studied area. Using camera traps, transect walks and collected fecal samples, we provide the first quantitative survey of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in this region previously classified as a highly important chimpanzee conservation unit. In contrast to species distribution models and expert predictions, we did not find any evidence of chimpanzees in the large and remote forest blocks west of the Chinko River despite considerable search effort. Our study thus highlights the limitations of relying solely on remote sensing data to predict the presence or absence of endangered species and illustrates the necessity of extensive field surveys to accurately assess occurrence and density in remote areas. However, we did discover a sizeable and reproducing population of chimpanzees east of the Chinko River. Based on a density of 0.81 chimpanzees/km(2) in closed canopy forest that we inferred from nest count data, we estimate 910 weaned chimpanzees to inhabit the Chinko Nature Reserve (CNR) and further predict additional 2700 individuals in adjacent, unmanaged hunting zones and reserves. According to microsatellite data, these chimpanzees genetically cluster with P.t. schweinfurthii populations in East Africa. Conservation action and appropriate management plans are urgently needed to protect this important population and to prevent heavily-armed nomadic pastoralists from the Sahel, illegal miners, as well as elephant and meat poachers, from irretrievably destroying the natural vegetation and local biodiversity of the area.

AB  - Predicting the potential influences of climate change on the richness and distribution is essential for the protection of endangered species. Most orchid species are narrowly distributed in specific habitats and are very vulnerable to habitat disturbance, especially for endangered orchid species on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). In this study, we simulated the potential influences of climate change on the richness and distribution of 17 endangered orchid species on the QTP using the MaxEnt model based on the shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios (SSPs) in the 2050s and 2070s. The results showed that aspect, annual precipitation, elevation, mean temperature of driest quarter, topsoil pH (H2O), and topsoil sand fraction had a large influence on the potential distribution of endangered orchid species on the QTP. The area of potential distribution for orchid species richness ranging from 6 to 11 under the current climate scenario was 14,462 km(2) (accounting for 0.56% of QTP), and it was mostly distributed in the southeastern part of QTP. The area of orchid species richness ranging from 6 to 11 under SSP370 in the 2070s was the smallest (9,370 km(2): only accounting for 0.36% of QTP). The largest area of potential distribution for orchid species richness ranging from 6 to 11 was 45,394 km(2) (accounting for 1.77% of QTP) under SSP585 in the 2070s. The total potential distribution area of 17 orchid species richness all increased from the 2050s to the 2070s under SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585. The orchid species richness basically declined with the increasing elevation under current and future climate scenarios. The mean elevation of potential distribution for orchid species richness ranging from 6 to 11 under different climate scenarios was between 3,267 and 3,463 m. The mean elevation of potential distribution for orchid species richness ranging from 6 to 11 decreased from SSP126 (3,457 m) to SSP585 (3,267 m) in the 2070s. Based on these findings, future conservation plans should be concentrated on the selection of protected areas in the southeastern part of QTP to protect the endangered orchid species.

AB  - Future climate change will result in profound shifts in the distribution and abundance of biodiversity in the Tropical Andes, and poses a challenge to contemporary conservation planning in the region. However, currently it is not well understood where the impacts of climate disruption will be most severe and how conservation policy should respond. This study examines climate change impacts in the Peruvian Andes, with a specific focus on tropical montane forest ecosystems, which are particularly susceptible to climate change. Using an ensemble of classification models coupled with different climate change scenarios, we estimate high and low potential impacts on montane forest, by projecting which areas will become climatically unsuitable to support montane forest ecosystems by 2070. These projections are subsequently used to examine potential impacts on protected areas containing montane forest. The modeling output indicates that climate change will have a high potential impact on 58% of all montane forests, particularly in the elevation range between 800 and 1200 m.a.s.l. Furthermore, about 64% of montane forests located in protected areas will be exposed to high potential impact. These results highlight the need for Peru's conservation institutions to incorporate climate change considerations into prevailing conservation plans and adaptation strategies. To adjust to climate change, the adaptive capacity of forest ecosystems in the Peruvian Andes should be enhanced through restorative and preventive conservation measures such as improving forest functions and mitigating deforestation and forest degradation pressures.

AB  - The decline of farmland and grassland biodiversity is one the major conservation concerns nowadays. The European roller is a secondary cavity nester species typically inhabiting grasslands and farmlands. It has suffered large declines both in size and range of the population since the 1960s, but this negative trend has been reversed in several countries by applying direct conservation actions. As part of this study we aimed to evaluate the current habitat suitability of the historical breeding area of the species within Hungary, to promote the re-colonization and the enlargement of the breeding range in the Carpathian Basin, and to evaluate the potential significance of the Natura 2000 network in this process. We applied species distribution modelling (SDM) based on nest-box occupancy data to map potential areas for nest-box supplementation. Grasslands, broad-leaved forests and agricultural sites with significant areas of natural vegetation were found to be the most important predictors. The majority (71%) of the predicted area has no occupied nest-boxes. A significantly larger proportion of grid cells with archive data still preserve suitable land cover composition for rollers, than cells where former breeding was not confirmed, and only a small proportion of former breeding area has become completely unsuitable for the species. Our results indicate large overlaps between the Natura 2000 network and the predicted area, of which 28.3% overlaps with Special Protection Area (SPA) sites and 23.8% with Special Area of Conservation (SAC/SCI) sites. Our study highlights the importance of promoting the recolonization of the European roller in the Transdanubian region of Hungary and provides a useful tool for direct conservation planning for the species. Our results also suggest that a coordinated network of protected areas such as Natura 2000 can potentially serve as core areas in the recolonization processes.

AB  - Considering loss of biodiversity a global threat, cost-effective tools for monitoring spatial distribution of species are relevant for conservation planning. The aims of this study were (a) to compare the global pattern of species richness in Cuculidae with species richness of birds, amphibians and mammals; (b) whether it is spatially congruent with hotspot areas of biodiversity at a global scale; and (c) whether the distribution of night light intensity reflecting human population density is associated with cuckoo species richness. We mapped the global distribution of all cuckoo species, classified as parasitic or non-parasitic species. Species richness was calculated at a fixed spatial scale for: Cuculidae, amphibians, birds and mammals. We applied Generalized Linear Mixed Models in order to explore the associations between species richness of each group of animals, night light intensity and hotspots of biodiversity areas at a global scale.
   Worldwide patterns of species richness of parasitic and non-parasitic cuckoos reflected species richness of birds, amphibians and mammals. In addition, and importantly, species richness of cuckoos was spatially congruent with hotspot areas of biodiversity across the world. Finally, night light intensity was slightly positively associated with species richness of parasitic cuckoos. Our findings confirmed that cuckoos constitute an important surrogate of high species richness of different animal taxa at a global scale: It is easy to learn how to identify cuckoos, whereas other species of birds, mammals or amphibians can only be identified by specialists. Our findings also suggest that other parasitic cuckoo species can be used as a biodiversity surrogate in a similar way as the common cuckoo in Eurasia.

AB  - Biogeographic regionalization identifies natural species assemblages of a given region. In this study, the geographic distribution of chondrichthyan species richness and species assemblages for the Southwest Atlantic were identified. The geographic distribution of 103 chondrichthyans was estimated through modelling. Based on the obtained binary maps, the distribution of chondrichthyan richness was obtained at four taxonomic levels: class Chondrichthyes (chondrichthyans), subclass Holocephali (chimaeras), division Selachii (sharks), and division Batomorphi (batoids). The continental shelf off Uruguay and southern Brazil presented the highest levels of chondrichthyan richness, and a smaller peak was found in El Rincon (northern Argentina). Shark richness concentrated mainly off Lagoa dos Patos (southern Brazil). Batoid richness was maximal off Uruguay and northern Argentina, including modes in El Rincon, San Jorge Gulf, and slope of the Argentinean shelf. Classification analyses revealed the presence of a hierarchical regionalization, with three main and six minor assemblages. Main assemblages are hierarchically identifiable as provinces and minor ones as ecoregions or districts. Two of the main assemblages correspond with the Argentinean and Magellanic Provinces; the third one is identified here for the first time, the Patagonian Slope Province. This regionalization provides the basis for the design of protected area networks for conservation or management purposes.

AB  - Detecting and understanding recoveries of threatened species from past and recent presence/absence data is essential to improving conservation efforts. However, false positive trends may be reported because of false absences in past data, therefore appropriate testing is needed. We tested an expansion/recolonization of the otter (Lutra lutra) populations in Italy from a fragmented distribution outlined in the 1984-1985 period by using Monte Carlo simulations. Land-use changes, human depopulation and decrease in influence of anthropogenic features were investigated as potential drivers of recolonization by using GIS modeling. A survey of the entire Italian range of the otter, conducted in 2002-2004, recorded a 2.2-fold increase in the proportion of occupied 10-km squares and 49 local colonizations. The range size and proportion of urban land-use in the 1984-1985 distribution were smaller (P < 0.05) than those derived from simulated surveys based on 49 random false absences versus colonization events. The distribution range expanded southward and nearly reached the southern margins of the peninsula. Recolonization of moderately urbanized landscapes was not accompanied by human depopulation. According to partial logistic regressions, the pure effect of urban land proportion and industry proximity on otter occurrence probability declined by about 48%, suggesting a decreased impact on the stream habitat. Conversely, natural factors, increased in importance by about 116%. The absence of a significant northward expansion in the 20 year period suggests that northward habitat restoration should be planned to encourage further recolonization. On the other hand, potential urban threats in the newly occupied landscapes should be controlled.

AB  - Multiple-scale habitat assessment for rare plants is an important component of conservation and development planning. It is challenging, however, due to lack of information synthesis on the ecology of rare plants, lack of effective approaches for habitat assessment at multiple spatial scales, and lack of spatial data for relevant environmental attributes and scales. A multiple-scale habitat modeling approach was developed to meet this need. Regional-, landscape-, and site-scale habitat models were developed for eight rare plant species found in southern Texas, USA. The models were partially validated and used for planning of rare plant conservation and highway construction. Regional-scale habitat models were used to predict, based on coarse-scale geographic information system (GIS) data, spatial distribution of areas containing potential habitat of rare plant species and the probability of encountering potential rare plant habitats. Site-scale models, based on synthesis of the literature and field investigations, were developed for field survey and mapping of rare plant habitats to enable accurate assessment of potential and present habitat suitability of specific locations using fine-resolution field data on soil, landform and vegetation structure. The greatest need for assessing the presence and potential habitat of rare plants is at the landscape scales. Thus, landscape-scale models were developed for spatially explicit assessment of potential and present habitat suitability, based on site-scale models but using GIS and remote sensing-based data. These models can be used as effective tools for conservation planning, monitoring and management of rare plant habitat, as well as for reduction of land use conflicts and development cost, The processes of model development and application synthesizes the diffuse literature, identifies knowledge and data gaps to guide future research, and provides a framework for assimilating new information acquired in the future to improve habitat assessment.

AB  - Amphibians are the most threatened Class of vertebrate, with wetland-associated anurans in particular suffering high levels of habitat loss. We used predictive modelling to better understand the distribution of a critically endangered South African endemic (Hyperolius pickersgilli) and to guide conservation action. MaxEnt distribution models were produced based on limited occurrence data. Predicted localities with probability of occurrence >= 60% were surveyed. Ten new sub-populations were discovered. The mean probability of occurrence for the species at wetlands where it was detected was greater than that at wetlands where it was not detected or absent. In addition, 17 known historical localities were re-visited and the species deemed absent at 8 of these. The total number of localities at which the species is now known to occur is 18, which is an increase in the known extant sub-populations of six. We recalculate the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence for the species as 108 km(2) and 2081.5 km(2), respectively; both increases on previous estimates. Implications of these changes on the IUCN Red List status of H. pickersgilliare discussed. A friction map was created to identify possible linkages between sub-populations, which can be used to guide habitat restoration and population repatriation. Given the degree of isolation of subpopulations and the potentially severe threats to most of these, urgent conservation action for H. pickersgilli remains crucial. This study provides a method for use in conservation planning for wetland-breeding amphibians in eastern coastal regions of Africa and elsewhere. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Outputs of species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used as indicators of climate conditions favorable for species occurrence. When using these outputs to inform planning and decision making, it is essential that the uncertainties associated with the projections of present-day and future climatic suitability are carefully considered. Climate change assessments routinely consider the uncertainty introduced into SDM outputs by differences in future climate projections, and other uncertainty sources, such as the choice of the threshold to convert simulated probabilities to binary climatically suitable areas, are also oftentimes considered. However, the uncertainty introduced by the limitations of the species occurrence data used in the SDM calibration is rarely evaluated. These limitations, which include location error, sampling bias, and species misidentification, may reduce the utility of SDM outputs in conservation research and practice. Using understory bamboo species in southwest China as examples, here we demonstrate that species occurrences obtained using remote sensing offer an additional dataset for calibrating SDMs that, in conjunction with conventional observations and employing an ensemble approach of outputs from multiple models, provide an estimate of the uncertainty introduced by the species occurrence data. A biweekly time series of the satellite-based Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRI) was employed to estimate bamboo occurrence based on phenological signatures of the bamboo species and their overstory canopies. Using Maxent, a popular modeling framework, present-day and projected future climatic suitability were assessed separately for conventional species presence observations from the Fourth National Giant Panda Survey and for the remotely-sensed presence estimates. The ensemble of model outputs suggests that the uncertainty introduced by the species occurrence data, along with the interaction with other sources of uncertainty, may be as substantial as the uncertainty introduced by the use of different climate scenarios or by the threshold used to estimate binary climatically suitable areas. Ignoring the uncertainty introduced by the limitations of the species occurrences may compromise the interpretation of SDM outputs and reduce their usefulness for conservation planning. Remote sensing is a largely untapped resource for assessing uncertainty in SDM simulations.

AB  - Indicators for preserving marine biodiversity include knowledge of how the spatial distribution and critical habitats of species overlap with human activities and impacts. Such indicators are key tools for marine spatial planning, a process that identifies and resolves conflicts between human uses and the conservation of marine environments. The common bottlenose dolphin in the Mediterranean Sea is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List and a priority species of the EU Habitat Directive. Here, we estimated spatio-temporal patterns of the species occurrence in the area around one Marine Protected Area (MPA) and two Sites of Community Importance (SCI) of the North western Sardinia, with the aim to predict the species distribution and the main links with the environmental factors and boat traffic. To evaluate whether dolphin groups with calves showed any habitat preference different from groups without calves, separate models for both type of groups were done. The most important contributing variables to the dolphin habitat suitability models were the likelihood of boat presence, habitat type and mean sea surface temperature. Different model outputs were obtained depending on dolphin group composition. The area of high likelihood of dolphin presence ranged between 30 and 60 km(2) and was smaller for groups with calves. Further, the area of highest dolphin habitat suitability overlaps with the area of high boat traffic, suggesting that boating in the study site is a potential relevant anthropogenic threat to dolphins. Particularly, boating is concentrated inside and around the MPA/SCIs, indicating the need for stronger restriction measures. We propose updated SCI boundaries for effective protection of common bottlenose dolphins. These areas and the suggestions of regulation are specifically aimed at reducing the impact of boating on dolphins, especially for groups with calves. Synthesis and applications. Management measures should be designed based on the data here provided, and then implemented and enforced to decrease dolphin-boat interactions, especially for mother-calf pairs. The creation of new coastal SCIs should be considered especially where boat traffic overlaps with areas most suitable for dolphins. In these SCIs, boating should be managed to limit disturbance, avoidance or alterations of dolphin vital behavior.

AB  - Functional diversity represents a measure of diversity that incorporates the role of species in an ecosystem, and therefore its dynamics and resilience. Assessing its drivers and spatial variation represents an important step forward in our understanding of functional ecosystem dynamics and it is also necessary to achieve a comprehensive conservation planning. In this paper, we assessed mammal functional diversity for the 218 ecoregions within the Neotropical realm. We evaluated the overall influence and spatial variation of species richness, ecoregion extent, intervention and species at risk on functional diversity. Using ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression modeling approaches, we found that intervened areas and threatened and non-threatened species are the most influential overall drivers of functional diversity. However, we also detected that these variables do not operate equally across scales. Our local analyses indicated both that the variation explained and local coefficients vary spatially depending on the ecoregion and major habitat type. As estimates of functional diversity are based on current distribution of all mammals, negative influence of intervened areas and positive influence of non-threatened species may reflect a potential degradation of functional processes for some ecosystems. Most generally, the negative influence of intervention together with the influence of threatened species indicates that some areas are currently more susceptible to functional diversity loss. Our results help to pinpoint key areas requiring urgent conservation action to reduce natural land-cover loss and areas where threatened species play influential roles on ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Each of the last three decades has seen the Earth's surface get progressively warmer more than any preceding decade since the 1850s. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have been scientifically demonstrated as the primary cause of the observed global climate change. The reduction of greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere has deserved international attention. Aside from strategies to reduce emissions, increasing carbon storage by restoring and protecting destroyed forests has become an alternative method to lower carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Therefore, effective restoration/conservation plans for deforested lands are urgently needed. The current work focuses on the restoration and conservation potential of destroyed Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) forests in the Qilian Mountains of northwest China and provides a reasonable approach for drafting effective restoration/conservation plans for deforested lands. We first estimated habitat suitability of the Qinghai spruce using a habitat suitability model based on the relationships among the three most influential/significant environmental variables: average annual precipitation (P), average air temperature in July (T), and solar radiation (R) and the corresponding occurrence frequency of Qinghai spruce in the niche space. We then calculated the index of habitat suitability (IHS) for Qinghai spruce by applying a model in the study area. We finally used field data to classify the IHS map and identified the prior restoration and conservation areas for Qinghai spruce. The results show that (1) the optimal combination of T, P, and R for Qinghai spruce is 11.5 A degrees C, 380 mm, and 2 x 10(3) kWh/m(2), respectively; (2) these forests have potential for restoration; (3) areas with priority restoration and conservation potential are about 43 and 56.65 km(2). The results of this study will help decision-makers develop and implement effective restoration/conservation strategies in the Qilian Mountains. This study presents a useful approach for helping decision-makers in other regions of the world draft effective restoration/conservation plans for deforested lands. The implementation of these plans will reduce CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, in turn, may retard global warming.

AB  - Extirpated organisms are reintroduced into their former ranges worldwide to combat species declines and biodiversity losses. The growing field of reintroduction biology provides guiding principles for reestablishing populations, though criticisms remain regarding limited integration of initial planning, modeling frameworks, interdisciplinary collaborations, and multispecies approaches. We used an interdisciplinary, multispecies, quantitative framework to plan reintroductions of three fish species into Abrams Creek, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA. We first assessed the appropriateness of habitat at reintroduction sites for banded sculpin (Cottus carolinae), greenside darter (Etheostoma blennioides), and mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdii) using species distribution modeling. Next, we evaluated the relative suitability of nine potential source stock sites using population genomics, abundance estimates, and multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) based on known correlates of reintroduction success. Species distribution modeling identified mottled sculpin as a poor candidate, but banded sculpin and greenside darter as suitable candidates for reintroduction based on species-habitat relationships and habitats available in Abrams Creek. Genotyping by sequencing revealed acceptable levels of genetic diversity at all candidate source stock sites, identified population clusters, and allowed for estimating the number of fish that should be included in translocations. Finally, MCDA highlighted priorities among candidate source stock sites that were most likely to yield successful reintroductions based on differential weightings of habitat assessment, population genomics, and the number of fish available for translocation. Our integrative approach represents a unification of multiple recent advancements in the field of reintroduction biology and highlights the benefit of shifting away from simply choosing nearby populations for translocation to an information-based science with strong a priori planning coupled with several suggested posteriori monitoring objectives. Our framework can be applied to optimize reintroduction successes for a multitude of organisms and advances in the science of reintroduction biology by simultaneously addressing a variety of past criticisms of the field.

AB  - Species distribution maps are important tools for wildlife conservation planning and management. To model koala distributions, usually, a spatially representative sample of koala populations is collected through systematic field surveys. Details of koala sightings collected by members of the public could potentially be used to develop species distribution models if appropriate analytical approaches are applied to address the inherent biases in such datasets. We developed a stepwise approach for applying bias correction techniques to estimate and map koala distributions. Using a Boosted regression tree approach, we modelled indirectly the search effort made by observers to identify or sight koalas. Land lot density (58%) and human population density (19%) had the strongest positive impact on the indirect search effort, while the distances to roads were negatively associated with the indirect search effort. To estimate the koala distribution across South-East Queensland, we then developed models describing koala habitat (environmental model), access to koala habitat (accessibility model) and the search effort (search effort model), with the latter including the indirect search effort covariate. Finally, we corrected the estimates derived from these models (bias-corrected search effort and accessibility model). Three independent statistical modelling approaches (Lasso penalty Poisson regression, Down weighted Poisson regression, and Maximum entropy) were used to compare the five koala distribution models. Based on assessments of areas under curves, the predictive accuracy of models improved when area accessibility and search effort were included. Overall, the spatial extent of koala distributions increased in the prediction maps when models were corrected for accessibility and indirect search effort (except for Down-weighted Poisson regression).

AB  - The diversity and the abundance of amphibians have dramatically declined globally over the past 30 years, and the monitoring and conservation of their habitats is essential. However, traditional methods such as bait trapping and mark-recapture are costly, and morphological identification usually requires a high level of taxonomic expertise. Here, seasonal surveillances of Hida salamander Hynobius kimurae were performed by means of environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis with Hynobius-specific primers and a species-specific TaqMan probe. Water sampling and visual surveys were conducted seasonally in a stream in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. Detection rates of eDNA were then calculated by real-time PCR, and eDNA site occupancy probability was estimated by multi-scale occupancy modeling. The eDNA-based detection rate of Hida salamander was 76.7%, whereas the visual survey-based detection rate was 23.3%, and target eDNA was detected at almost all sites where the presence of target species was visually confirmed. Moreover, factors relating to the site- and sample-level occurrence probabilities of the target eDNA differed depending on the developmental stage of the target species. Our findings support previous studies showing that eDNA analysis enables an effective assessment of amphibian distributions without damaging the organisms or their habitat, and we compare for the first time the site occupancy probability of amphibian eDNA throughout the life cycle of an amphibian species. The present study contributes to the development of eDNA analysis as a tool for understanding the distribution and seasonal activity of amphibian species and will thus aid in the planning of conservation measures and habitat restoration for these species.

AB  - Protected areas help to decrease human impacts on threatened mammals but do not always include species' core habitats. Here we focus on the Vulnerable taruka Hippocamelus antisensis near the Atacama Desert, Chile, a population that is mainly threatened by interactions with local human communities. We develop a species distribution model for taruka and assess the contribution of protected areas to safeguarding its preferred habitat. From sightings (collected during 2004-2015), absence records (collected in 2014), and environmental variables, we determined that taruka habitat is scarce, highly fragmented and limited to humid areas. Only 7.7-11.2% of the taruka's core habitat is under protection. We recommend the establishment of a protected area in the south of Arica-Parinacota district, an area without settlements that lies within the taruka's core habitat, along with educational programmes, fencing of crops, and inclusion of communities in decision-making in areas where farmer-taruka interactions are negative.

AB  - Aim Increasing threats to freshwater biodiversity are rapidly changing the distinctiveness of regional species pools and local assemblages. Biotic homogenization/differentiation processes are threatening the integrity and persistence of native biodiversity patterns at a range of spatial scales and pose a challenge for effective conservation planning. Here, we evaluate the extent and determinants of fine-scale alteration in native freshwater fish assemblages among stream reaches throughout a large river basin and consider the implications of these changes for the long-term conservation of native fishes.
   Location Guadiana River basin (South-Western Iberian Peninsula).
   Methods We quantified the magnitude of change in compositional similarity between observed and reference assemblages and its potential effect on natural patterns of compositional distinctiveness. Reference assemblages were defined as the native species expected to occur naturally (in absence of anthropogenic alterations) and were reconstructed using a multivariate adaptive regression splines predictive model. We also evaluated the role of habitat degradation and introduced species as determinants of biotic homogenization/differentiation.
   Results We found a significant trend towards homogenization for native fish assemblages. Changes in native fish distributions led to the loss of distinctiveness patterns along natural environmental gradients. Introduced species were the most important factor explaining the homogenization process. Homogenization of native assemblages was stronger in areas close to reservoirs and in lowland reaches where introduced species were more abundant.
   Main conclusions The implementation of efficient conservation for the maintenance of native fish diversity is seriously threatened by the homogenization processes. The identification of priority areas for conservation is hindered by the fact that the most diverse communities are vanishing, which would require the selection of broader areas to adequately protect all the species. Given the principal role that introduced species play in the homogenization process and their relation with reservoirs, special attention must be paid to mitigating or preventing these threats.

AB  - Plastic responses of species to unprecedented conditions and increased variability caused by climate change (CC) and anthropogenic disturbances are expected to play a major role determining populations' extinction risk. We developed a method for assessing CC effects on population dynamics based on analyzing plastic life history responses to weather conditions within an ensemble forecasting framework. The method is illustrated using two threatened cactus species with contrasting distribution ranges. Demographic models were parameterized using 5 years of field data, from which the relationship between life-history traits and rainfall and temperature was estimated. These functions were used in Integral Projection Models to predict population growth under CC scenarios and different anthropogenic disturbance regimes. Both species were affected by CC and its interaction with disturbance. The most widespread species was less affected by CC, suggesting that past selection on plasticity allows it to survive under variable conditions. Managing disturbance appropriately lessened the impact of CC. Some directives for conservation under CC were identified based on projected elasticity values. Our procedure for modeling population dynamics as a function of climate may be used for designing management plans for conservation or sustainable use aimed at important plant sizes or life-history traits, predicting potential distributions, and identifying viable populations.

AB  - As human influences fragment native communities and ecosystems, remaining land must be better managed to conserve many elements of biodiversity. Much of this land is privately held, yet traditional private land-use management practices often further diminish biodiversity by promoting favored or edge-adapted species.
   Today, private land stewards are increasingly aware of and concerned about biodiversity, but little guidance exists for them to make land-use decisions incorporating principles and knowledge from conservation biology. Consequently, most management strategies are highly subjective. This article addresses that problem by introducing current conservation wisdom to management and use of private lands. The result is a model program for developing land management plans, with the goal of maintaining viable populations and natural distributions of native species and communities from a landscape perspective.
   The program establishes a protocol for classifying sites according to the importance of their species, communities, and other elements to global and regional biodiversity. These site classifications are based on the management objectives necessary to maintain important elements. Once managers classify a site, the program provides management standards, general stewardship principles, examples of land management strategies, and basic monitoring and evaluation procedures.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Climate change is a widely accepted threat to biodiversity. Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to forecast whether and how species distributions may track these changes. Yet, SDMs generally fail to account for genetic and demographic processes, limiting population-level inferences. We still do not understand how predicted environmental shifts will impact the spatial distribution of genetic diversity within taxa.
   METHODS: We propose a novel method that predicts spatially explicit genetic and demographic landscapes of populations under future climatic conditions. We use carefully parameterized SDMs as estimates of the spatial distribution of suitable habitats and landscape dispersal permeability under present-day, past, and future conditions. We use empirical genetic data and approximate Bayesian computation to estimate unknown demographic parameters. Finally, we employ these parameters to simulate realistic and complex models of responses to future environmental shifts. We contrast parameterized models under current and future landscapes to quantify the expected magnitude of change.
   KEY RESULTS: We implement this framework on neutral genetic data available from Penstemon deustus. Our results predict that future climate change will result in geographically widespread declines in genetic diversity in this species. The extent of reduction will heavily depend on the continuity of population networks and deme sizes.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide spatially explicit predictions of within-species genetic diversity using climatic, demographic, and genetic data. Our approach accounts for climatic, geographic, and biological complexity. This framework is promising for understanding evolutionary consequences of climate change, and guiding conservation planning.

AB  - The US Forest Service has proposed new regulations under the National Forest Management Act that would replace a long-standing requirement that the agency manage its lands "to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired non-native vertebrate species." In its place, the Forest Service would be obligated merely to assess ecosystem and species diversity. A landscape assessment process would rely on ecosystem-level surrogate measures, such as maps of vegetation communities and soils, to estimate species diversity. Reliance on such "coarse-filter" assessment techniques is problematic because there tends to be poor concordance between species distributions predicted by vegetation models and observations from species surveys. The proposed changes would increase the likelihood of continued declines in biodiversity and fail to address the original intent of the act. We contend that responsible stewardship requires a comprehensive strategy that includes not only coarse-filter, ecosystem-level assessment but also fine-filter, species-level assessments and viability assessments for at-risk species.

AB  - The importance of the spatial as well as the temporal structure of habitat patches for urban biodiversity has been recognised, but rarely quantified. In dynamic environments the rate of habitat destruction and recreation (i.e. the landscape turnover rate), the minimum amount of potential habitat, its spatial configuration as well as the environmental conditions determining habitat quality are crucial factors for species occurrence. We analysed species responses to environmental parameters and to the spatio-temporal configuration of urban brownfield habitats in a multi-species approach (37 plant and 43 insect species). Species presence/absence data and soil parameters, site age, vegetation structure and landscape context were recorded by random stratified sampling at 133 study plots in industrial areas in the city of Bremen (Germany). Based on the field data, we predicted species occurrences by species distribution models using a multi-model inference approach. Predicted species communities were driven by successional age both at the scale of a single building lot and at the landscape scale. Minimum average succession time of brownfield habitats required to support all and especially regionally rare species depended on the proportion of available open space; the larger the potential habitat area the faster the acceptable turnover. Most plant, grasshopper, and leafhopper species modelled could be maintained at an intermediate turnover rate (mean age of 10-15 years) and a proportion of open sites of at least 40%. Our modelling approach provides the opportunity of inferring optimal spatio-temporal landscape configurations for urban conservation management from patch scale species-environment relationships. The results indicate that urban planning should incorporate land use dynamics into the management of urban biodiversity.

AB  - AimSpecies and ecosystems may be unable to keep pace with rapid climate change projected for the 21st century. We evaluated an underexplored dimension of the mismatch between climate and biota: limitations to forest growth and succession affecting habitat suitability. Our objective was to inform continental-scale conservation for boreal songbirds under disequilibria between climate, vegetation and fauna.
   LocationBoreal and southern arctic ecoregions of North America.
   MethodsWe used forest inventory and avian survey data to classify 53 species by seral-stage affinity and applied these to generate alternative projections of changes in species' core habitat distributions based on different vegetation lag-time assumptions. We used our seral stage-modified refugia approach and the Zonation algorithm to identify multispecies boreal conservation priorities over the 21st century. We evaluated the sensitivity of land rankings to seral-stage affinity and species' weights and assessed the conservation value of the existing protected areas network compared to Zonation results.
   ResultsEnd-of-century projected changes in songbird distribution were reduced by up to 169% when vegetation lags were considered. Zonation land rankings based on unconstrained climate projections were concentrated at high latitudes, whereas those based on strict and modified refugia scenarios were concentrated in coastal and high-elevation areas, as well as biome transition zones, which were fairly consistent over time and species weights. The existing protected areas network covering 14% of the study area was estimated to conserve 12-14% of baseline avian biodiversity across time periods and scenarios, compared to 16-25% for top-ranked Zonation areas.
   Main conclusionsFor some boreal songbirds, limits to forest growth and succession may result in dramatic reductions in suitable habitat over the next century. Our seral stage-adjusted approach provides conservative and efficient boreal conservation priorities anchored around climatic macrorefugia that are robust to century-long climate change and complement the current protected areas network.

AB  - Climate-driven shifts of coastal species' ranges constitute a key factor shaping both the vegetation composition and biodiversity of coastal ecosystems. Although phylogeographic studies relying on genetic data have shed light on the evolutionary history of macroalgae along the Northwest Pacific (NW-Pacific) coast, their distribution dynamics are less understood and require interdisciplinary examination. Here, we used a combination of species distribution models (SDMs) and genetic data to explain the causes of population persistence and genetic differentiation and their consequences for the brown seaweed Sargassum horneri in the NW-Pacific. In this region, the phylogeographic structure of S. homeri was analyzed by screening 72 populations spawning across the entire coastal distribution and obtaining their mtDNA cox3 data. Population genetic structure and SDMs based on paleoclimatic data consistently revealed that southern coasts of the Sea of Japan, North-Pacific-Japan, and the northern part of Okinawa Trough might have served as potential refugia for S. horneri during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Furthermore, we projected the distribution dynamics of S. horneri under future climate scenarios. The range of S. homeri was predicted to move northward, with a significant loss of suitable habitat, under the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). By contrast, projected range shifts were minimal under the low emissions scenario (RCP 2.6). Furthermore, North-Pacific-Japan was projected to be long-term persistence habitat for S. horneri under future climatic conditions, thus including this area in conservation planning could help mitigate for climate change implications. Our results enable a better understanding of the impacts of climate change on the spatio-temporal distribution of macroalgae and how this can inform coastal management and marine conservation planning.

AB  - Understanding the ecological consequences of conservation policies on wildlife is critical for species conservation and policy implementation. China began to call for establishing a national park system in 2013 and used national parks as the predominant feature for its system of protected areas in 2019. Payment for ecosystem services (PES) and relocation constitute two important management strategies in new Chinese national parks and protected area system. To better understand the potential outcomes of such programs, we studied the winter foraging distribution of the threatened Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis), a flagship species of plateau wetlands, in Dashanbao Protected Area, SW China. Field survey data were combined with environmental variables and land use maps to model winter foraging habitat with respect to human settlements subject to PES and relocation. High suitability for foraging was mapped in the core zone around crane roosting sites, villages, and far from disturbance (e.g. main roads). Aiming at converting farmland to wetland, the payment for ecosystem services programs increased probability of occurrence of cranes by changing land cover in appropriate areas relative to crane roosts and other spatially distributed variables. Surprisingly, areas within 1 km of villages were recognized as highly suitable foraging habitats for cranes, which depend on waste grain in farmland in winter, revealing the potential risk of relocation-induced food shortage for wintering cranes. We argue that as an effective strategy in improving wildlife habitat, PES should be encouraged and relocation programs that change the existing long-term established human-wildlife interactions should be implemented only under full understanding of these relationships. As a pioneer study of the effects of conservation policy on wetland ecosystems in China, this study could shed light on conservation management for such ecosystem and species showing high dependence on a human modified environment. Future work should also focus on the social effects of these conservation strategies, especially relocation, during national park planning in China.

AB  - The beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) is listed as a threatened species in Mexico. Scientific research has been limited to two sites within its range (Chamela and Valle Motagua) outside of these two regions there have not been adequate surveys to define range limits or measure environmental correlates for defining suitable habitat. We constructed an ensemble model (EM) for the distribution of suitable habitat for H. horridum in both Mexico and Guatemala and then used that model to identify potential areas to focus conservation. We used nine presence-only modeling methods, and selected three to generate our EM. We used the EM to evaluate the efficacy of the existing Protected Natural Areas (PNAs) in Mexico and Guatemala for H. horridum. Also we used the best individual predictive model (Maxent) to obtain the most important factors for H. horridum presence and used them to analyse the habitat use; finally we used our predictive model to calculate niche breath for the species. The estimated potential distribution of H. horridum is 370,474 km(2); within this area we identified nine zones based on continuity and natural barriers. About 1.5% of the species distribution is under protection in the PNAs. The five most important factors for the presence of this species explained 78.2% of the generated model and are related to seasonality and soil cover, and these are used selectively. This species is closely associated with tropical deciduous forests, one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide and is inadequately protected in both Mexico and Guatemala. Our results clearly show the necessity of a protection plan for this species. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managers often have incomplete information to make decisions about threatened species management, and lack the time or funding needed to obtain complete information. Value of information (VOI) analysis can assist managers in deciding whether to manage using current information or monitor to reduce uncertainty before managing. However, VOI analysis has not yet been applied to spatial allocation of monitoring resources across a landscape.
   Here, we demonstrate how to make the best use of data from species distribution models (SDMs) and VOI analysis to assess the value of land protection decisions for single and multiple-species objectives across a heterogeneous landscape. Our method determines the situations where one should monitor before protecting the land, and those where one should act based on current incomplete information. Further, we prioritize land planning units based on cost-effectiveness (expected number of occurrences protected per dollar spent) and identify properties to target for monitoring or immediate conservation.
   In a single species case study, we found that the optimal decision was to act based on current information when the prior probability of detecting an occurrence in a survey was low. When probability of detection was high, it was most effective to monitor the majority of units. In a multi-species case study, monitoring was only optimal in 50% of cases, due to high inferred probability of at least one occurrence of a threatened species in many units. When compared to a simulation where units were monitored by default, using VOI to determine which units were monitored or prioritized for immediate conservation led to an increase in the expected number of occurrences protected.
   Synthesis and applications. Using a combination of species distribution models and value of information analysis can assist managers in efficiently distributing limited resources for protected area allocation. Our results suggest that if managers can use value of information to monitor more efficiently, it can lead to protecting a greater number of threatened species occurrences.

AB  - Climate change is currently considered one of the main phenomena affecting marine species through expansion or contraction of their distribution. Being ectothermic organisms, sharks of the family Carcharhinidae could be highly susceptible to the effects of climate change. These sharks are of great ecological importance, which is reflected in their role in the integrity of coastal and oceanic ecosystems as top predators that act to maintain the stability of the food chain, as well as providing economic value through fishing, consumption, and ecotourism. Currently, their populations are threatened by fishing pressure and anthropogenic activities, including meeting the demand for shark fins. Despite the ecological and economical importance of carcharhinid sharks, knowledge regarding how they are impacted by climate change remains scarce. Ecological niche modeling is a tool that allows analysis of future potential distributions under different climate change scenarios and could contribute to future planning activities and improved conservation outcomes for sharks. We generated models in Maxent in order to predict the potential geographic distribution of 25 carcharhinid sharks that inhabit Mexican waters, projecting this onto future climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) to calculate the potential losses and gains in their distribution areas by the year 2050. The greatest shifts in suitable areas were observed for the sharks Triaenodon obesus (gained area) and Carcharhinus porosus (lost area). Overall, under all four RCP future scenarios, six species presented gains in suitable area and 19 species presented losses. The greatest loss of suitable area for carcharhinid sharks was found with RCP8.5; however, under this high-emissions global warming scenario, seven species actually showed an increase in distribution area. Our results therefore indicate that climate change could reduce suitable areas for most of the species by 2050. Assessment of the distribution of shark species under climate change is urgently required in order to prioritize conservation efforts toward the most vulnerable species and to ensure the natural function of marine ecosystems, thus maintaining the important ecosystem services they provide to human society.

AB  - Tanzania's Ruaha landscape is an international priority area for large carnivores, supporting over 10% of the world's lions and important populations of leopards and spotted hyaenas. However, lack of ecological data on large carnivore distribution and habitat use hinders the development of effective carnivore conservation strategies in this critical landscape. Therefore, the study aimed to (i) identify the most significant ecogeographical variables influencing the potential distribution of lions, leopards and spotted hyaenas across the Ruaha landscape; (ii) identify zones with highest suitability for harbouring those species; and (iii) use species distribution modelling algorithms (SDMs) to define important areas for conservation of large carnivores. Habitat suitability was calculated based on environmental features from georeferenced presence-only carnivore location data. Potential distribution of large carnivores appeared to be strongly influenced by water availability; highly suitable areas were situated close to rivers and experienced above average annual precipitation. Net primary productivity and tree cover also exerted some influence on habitat suitability. All three species showed relatively narrow niche breadth and low tolerance to changes in habitat characteristics. From 21,050 km 2 assessed, 8.1% (1,702 km(2)) emerged as highly suitable for all three large carnivores collectively. Of that area, 95.4% (1,624 km(2)) was located within 30 km of the Park-village border, raising concerns about human-carnivore conflict. This was of particular concern for spotted hyaenas, as they were located significantly closer to the Park boundary than lions and leopards. This study provides the first map of potential carnivore distribution across the globally important Ruaha landscape, and demonstrates that SDMs can be effective for understanding large carnivore habitat requirements in poorly sampled areas. This approach could have relevance for many other important wildlife areas that only have limited, haphazard presence-only data, but which urgently require strategic conservation planning.

AB  - The use of predictive habitat distribution models by land managers in the conservation management of threatened species is increasing. Few models, however, are subsequently field-checked and evaluated. This study evaluates the statistical strength and usefulness for conservation purposes of three predictive habitat models developed for a threatened stag beetle, Hoplogonus simsoni, found in the wet eucalypt forests and mixed/rain forests of north-east Tasmania. The relationship between various environmental variables for which spatial (GIs) information was available and the density, frequency of occurrence and presence/absence of the species was investigated using generalised linear modelling. Models developed were coupled with the GIs data to develop maps of predicted occurrence within the species' range, grouped into categories of habitat quality. The models found that altitude, aspect, slope, distance to nearest stream and overstorey tree height were significantly associated with the occurrence of the species. Evaluation of the statistical strength of the models with independent data of species' occurrence collected at 95 sites found that the density model performed poorly with little correlation between predicted and observed densities of the species. The frequency of occurrence model, however, showed a moderate ability to predict both species' abundance and presence/absence. The presence/absence model had a similar discriminatory ability in predicting presence or absence of H. simsoni, but also showed some potential as an indirect predictor of species' abundance. Assuming a correlation between relative abundance and habitat quality, the frequency of occurrence predictive model appeared to be the better and more direct discriminator of high quality habitat relative to the other models. The value of species' habitat models and the need to evaluate their utility in the development of conservation strategies are discussed. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we conducted, for the first time, an extensive climate change impact assessment of bee pollinators in the Aegean Islands, Greece, a regional bee hotspot in the Mediterranean. We located the current biodiversity and future extinction hotspots in the region and identified areas in urgent need for conservation prioritization, by undertaking an overlap analysis with the established protected areas network in Greece. Most bee species occurring in the archipelago are expected to face severe range contractions and there is evidence of an underlying extinction debt in the study area. Our work could serve as the baseline for the integration of a rather neglected, yet extremely economically and ecologically important taxonomic group, the bees, in the systematic conservation planning in the archipelago. Pollinators' climate change impact assessments focus mainly on mainland regions. Thus, we are unaware how island species might fare in a rapidly changing world. This is even more pressing in the Mediterranean Basin, a global biodiversity hotspot. In Greece, a regional pollinator hotspot, climate change research is in its infancy and the insect Wallacean shortfall still remains unaddressed. In a species distribution modelling framework, we used the most comprehensive occurrence database for bees in Greece to locate the bee species richness hotspots in the Aegean, and investigated whether these might shift in the future due to climate change and assessed the Natura 2000 protected areas network effectiveness. Range contractions are anticipated for most taxa, becoming more prominent over time. Species richness hotspots are currently located in the NE Aegean and in highly disturbed sites. They will shift both altitudinally and latitudinally in the future. A small proportion of these hotspots are currently included in the Natura 2000 protected areas network and this proportion is projected to decrease in the coming decades. There is likely an extinction debt present in the Aegean bee communities that could result to pollination network collapse. There is a substantial conservation gap in Greece regarding bees and a critical re-assessment of the established Greek protected areas network is needed, focusing on areas identified as bee diversity hotspots over time.

AB  - Identification of ecological factors that drive animal distributions allows us to understand why distributions vary temporally and spatially, and to develop models to predict future changes to populations-vital tools for effective wildlife management and conservation. For waterbird broods in the boreal forest, distributions are likely driven by factors affecting quality of nesting and brood-rearing habitats, and the influence of these factors may extend beyond singles species, affecting the entire waterbird community. We used occupancy models to assess factors influencing species richness of waterbird broods on 72 boreal lakes, along with brood distributions of 3 species of conservation concern: lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), white-winged scoters (Melanitta fusca), and horned grebe (Podiceps auritus). Factors examined included abundance of invertebrate foods (Amphipoda, Diptera, Gastropoda, Hemiptera, Odonata), physical lake attributes (lake area, emergent vegetation), water chemistry (nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll a concentrations), and nesting habitats (water edge, non-forest cover). Of the 5 invertebrates, only amphipod density was related to richness and occupancy, consistently having a large and positive relationship. Despite this importance to waterbirds, amphipods were the most patchily distributed invertebrate, with 17% of the study lakes containing 70% of collected amphipods. Lake area was the only other covariate that strongly and positively influenced species richness and occupancy of scaup, scoters, and grebes. All 3 water chemistry covariates, which provided alternative measures of lake productivity, were positively related to species richness but had little effect on scaup, scoter, and grebe occupancy. Conversely, emergent vegetation was negatively related to richness, reflecting avoidance of overgrown lakes by broods. Finally, nesting habitats had no influence on richness and occupancy, indicating that, at a broad spatial scale, brood distributions are largely driven by the presence of quality brood-rearing lakes, not nesting habitats. Our findings are relevant to generating conservation plans or management goals; specifically, boreal lakes with abundant amphipods and surface areas >25ha are important habitat for waterbird broods and merit conservation, especially given the patchy distribution of amphipods. Moreover, these high quality brood-rearing lakes are much rarer, and thus more constraining, than are quality nesting habitats, which are likely abundant in the boreal. (c) 2015 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - We developed a potential distribution model for the tropical rain forest species of primates of southern Mexico: the black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra), the mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata), and the spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi). To do so, we applied the maximum entropy algorithm from the ecological niche modeling program MaxEnt. For each species, we used occurrence records from scientific collections, and published and unpublished sources, and we also used the 19 environmental coverage variables related to precipitation and temperature from WorldClim to develop the models. The predicted distribution of A. pigra was strongly associated with the mean temperature of the warmest quarter (23.6%), whereas the potential distributions of A. palliata and A. geoffroyi were strongly associated with precipitation during the coldest quarter (52.2 and 34.3% respectively). The potential distribution of A. geoffroyi is broader than that of the Alouatta spp. The areas with the greatest probability of presence of A. pigra and A. palliata are strongly associated with riparian vegetation, whereas the presence of A. geoffroyi is more strongly associated with the presence of rain forest. Our most significant contribution is the identification of areas with a high probability of the presence of these primate species, which is information that can be applied to planning future studies and then establishing criteria for the creation of areas to primate conservation in Mexico.

AB  - Tossa (Corchorus olitorius L.) is a significant cash crop, cultivated commercially in the lower flood plain of Bangladesh. The climatic regimes in Bangladesh are changing as well as the world does. However, this species is threatened by climate change. Occurrences of data on threatened and endangered species are frequently sparse which makes it difficult to analyse the species suitable habitat distribution using various modelling approaches. The current paper used maximum entropy (Maxent) and educational global climate model (EdGCM) modelling to predict and conserve the suitable habitat distributions for Tossa species in Bangladesh to the year 2100. Nine environmental variables, 239 occurrence data and two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were used for the Maxent modelling to project the impact of climate change on the Tossa distributions. Furthermore, the EdGCM was used to study the climatic space suitability for the Tossa species in the context of Bangladesh. Both of the climatic scenarios were used for the prediction to the year 2100. The Maxent model performed better than random for the Tossa species with a high AUC value of 0.86. Under the RCP scenarios, the Maxent model predicted habitat reduction for RCP4.5 is 2%, RCP8.5 is 9% and EdGCM is 10.2% from the current localities. The predictive modelling approach presented here is promising and can be applied to other important species for conservation planning, monitoring and management, especially those under the threat of extinction due to climate change.

AB  - Conservation planning and practice rely heavily on abundance information generated at local scales for decision-making. Unfortunately most distributional data are only provided as presence-absence records at regional or national scales and cannot be used for making local conservation decisions. To date, two methods have been proposed for estimating local abundances and area of occupancy from coarse-scale presence-absence data. Kunin (1998) proposed the use of the fractal method, which assumes that species distributions are self-similar across scales. He & Gaston (2000a), in turn, proposed the use of the negative binomial distribution (NBD) for estimating abundances from presence-absence data collected at different scales. Previously only plant data were used to test these models. In the present study, they were tested using distributional presence-absence, as well as abundance data for a selection of large herbivores that have a restricted distribution in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The results illustrate that the fractal method tends to overestimate areas of occupancy, while the NBD method underestimates the areas of occupancy of all species. This means that there were significant differences between the predictions provided by the two methods. Both these methods rely on the relationship between the area of occupancy and the size of the area over which the survey is conducted, but describe this relationship in a different way. These techniques could prove useful in the field of conservation biology and this study illustrates that these methods can be used on large mammal species and deliver results that are consistent with previous studies on plants.

AB  - Simple Summary Knowledge of genetic diversity is crucial to improve conservation plans for endangered species and ensure their long-term persistence. However, it may be difficult to accurately estimate genetic diversity when it is unfeasible to obtain sufficiently large sample sizes, which is often the case for marine endangered species. Here, we use Patella ferruginea as a model to investigate how small sample sizes affect genetic diversity estimates. We show that small sample sizes do not always hamper the detection of genetic patterns in endangered marine species, even though caution is needed when genetic divergence among populations is weak. Knowledge of Genetic diversity and its spatial distribution is crucial to improve conservation plans for endangered species. Genetic tools help ensure species' long-term persistence by unraveling connectivity patterns and evolutionary trajectories of populations. Here, microsatellite genotypes of individuals from populations of Patella ferruginea are used to assess the effect of sample size on metrics of within-and between-population genetic diversity by combining empirical and simulated data. Within-population metrics are slightly to moderately affected by small sample size, albeit the magnitude of the bias is proportional to the effective population size and gene flow. The power of detecting genetic differentiation among populations increases with sample size, albeit the gain of increasing the number of sampled individuals tends to be negligible between 30 and 50. Our results line up with those of previous studies and highlight that small sample sizes are not always a hindrance to investigating genetic patterns in endangered marine species. Caution is needed in interpreting genetic patterns based on small sample sizes when the observed genetic differentiation is weak. This study also highlights the importance of carrying out genetic monitoring in seemingly well-preserved but potentially isolated populations.

AB  - Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are ubiquitous in ecology to predict species occurrence throughout their range. Typically, SDMs are created using presence-only or presence-absence data. We hypothesize that the continuous metric of temporal occupancy, the proportion of time a species is observed at a given site, provides more detail about species occurrence than binary presence-based SDMs.
   Location North America.
   Methods We compared SDMs for 189 focal species using four modelling methods to determine whether North American avian species distributions are better predicted using temporal occupancy over presence-absence. We used the North American Breeding Bird Survey and built SDMs based on all sites sampled consecutively between 2001 and 2015, as well as on a subset of only five time points within the 15-year sampling window. Each model used the same environmental inputs to predict species range. Each SDM was cross-validated temporally and spatially.
   Results Species distributions were generally better predicted using temporal occupancy rather than presence-absence when using either a five-year or fifteen-year sampling window. Species that occurred in a smaller proportion of their predicted range were particularly better predicted with SDMs using temporal occupancy. Temporal occupancy SDMs had lower false discovery and false-positive rates but higher false-negative rates than presence-absence models.
   Main conclusions Temporal occupancy is a valuable metric that can improve predictions of species occurrence for birds and may improve conservation planning and design efforts.

AB  - The Amur tiger, a flagship species of the boreal forest ecosystem in Russian Far East and northeastern China, has declined dramatically in population and geographic distribution due to human caused habitat fragmentation and poaching over the past century. The fate of this largest feline species will also be influenced by the worsening impacts of climate change. In this paper we assess the possible effects of climate change (three scenarios from the 2007 IPCC Report) on the Amur tiger by integrating species distribution modeling (SDM) and population viability analysis (PVA). We projected the potential and realized suitable habitat distributions to examine the impacts from anthropogenic factors, and evaluated the changes of suitable habitat and extinction risk for 100 years under climate change. The realized suitable habitat was projected to be more severely fragmented than the potential suitable habitat because of human-related factors. The potential suitable habitat would expand northward under all climate change scenarios considered. However, the tiger population would suffer the largest decline and highest extinction risk in the next 100 years under the worst climate change scenario (A1B) even though the size of potential habitat would be greatest. Under climate change, the tiger population could persist for the next century only if the size and quality of current habitat patches would remain intact. In addition, our study demonstrated that using SDM alone could grossly overestimate the geographic distribution of the Amur tiger, and that coupling SDM and PVA could provide important insights into conservation planning to mitigate the effects of climate change.

AB  - Predicting climatic niche of species and projecting their potential range shifts in geographic distribution under future climate scenarios is essential for assessing impacts of climate change. Ecological niche based models are widely used to map habitat suitability of current and future potential distribution of species, using precise coordinates of species occurrences, along with climatic and various environmental variables. Despite the importance of high dependence on forest resources in the Himalayan region, the direct impacts of climate change on major forest tree species is not well-documented. In the present study, we used MaxEnt (or maximum entropy) modelling to predict current distribution and changes in the future distributions of four ecologically and economically dominant forest tree species (Quercus leucotrichophora, Q. semecarpifolia, Q. floribunda, and Pinus roxburghii) in the central Himalayan region. Future predictions were based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for two time periods (2050s and 2070s). We demonstrated the use of MaxEnt by combining different climatic, geomorphologic, and pedologic variables as predictor variables to model the potential climatic niches. We evaluated the model performance with an average AUC value varying as 0.809 (+/- 0.020), 0.982 (+/- 0.008), 0.966 (+/- 0.006), and 0.803 (+/- 0.025) for Q leucotrichophora, Q semecarpifolia, Q floribunda and P. roxburghii, respectively. Depending upon the RCPs, the results show both increase and decrease in suitable habitat range of these species across all future climate scenarios. The shifts in geographic distributions of climatic niches show unusual patterns, implying the need for urgent adaptive forest management strategies. Our approach can be used as a baseline database for broad-scale applicability in forest tree species restoration and conservation planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Good distribution maps based on adequate sampling of a number of taxonomic groups are required to provide reliable conservation strategies. Nevertheless, it is common that inventories of many animal groups, particularly insects, are incomplete or nonexistent, with large gaps appearing once all available information of insects is mapped, especially when wide spatial scales are considered. Due to the lack of resources and manpower, the accomplishment of future field campaigns in these generally poorly surveyed areas should be directed so as to maximise the information obtained with the minimum survey effort. Using an exhaustive database of Iberian water beetles (which was relatively scarce and biased), we aim to prioritise areas to propose a planned survey design able to generate more accurate geographical representations of species distributions. For this, a prediction on the geographic distribution of the species richness of this group in the Iberian Peninsula was first obtained using the information coming from seven sets of well-surveyed grid cells determined by using progressively more exigent completeness values. Both observed and estimated by accumulation curves, species richness values of these different cell groups were subsequently used as the dependent variable in the modelling procedure. We used generalised linear models and 18 environmental variables as predictors. In this manner, 14 species richness predictions were obtained whose predictive power was assessed by a Jackknife procedure. The best model explained 57.5% of total deviance with a high mean Jackknife predictive error (29.9%). The overlay of these predictions with the survey effort map allows us to locate those areas where more sampling effort is necessary (areas of high predicted species richness that are not well inventoried).

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs), which statistically relate species occurrence to climatic variables, are widely used to identify areas suitable for species growth under future climates and to plan for assisted migration. When SDMs are projected across times or spaces, it is assumed that species climatic requirements remain constant. However, empirical evidence supporting this assumption is rare, and SDM predictions could be biased. Historical human-aided movements of tree species can shed light on the reliability of SDM predictions in planning for assisted migration. We used Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), a North American conifer introduced into Europe during the mid-19th century, as a case-study to test niche conservatism. We combined transcontinental data sets of Douglas-fir occurrence and climatic predictors to compare the realized niches between native and introduced ranges. We calibrated a SDM in the native range and compared areas predicted to be climatically suitable with observed presences. The realized niches in the native and introduced ranges showed very limited overlap. The SDM calibrated in North America had very high predictive power in the native range, but failed to predict climatic suitability in Europe where Douglas-fir grows in climates that have no analogue in the native range. We review the ecological mechanisms and silvicultural practices that can trigger such shifts in realized niches. Retrospective analysis of tree species introduction revealed that the assumption of niche conservatism is erroneous. As a result, distributions predicted by SDM are importantly biased. There is a high risk that assisted migration programs may be misdirected and target inadequate species or introduction zones.

AB  - Plant endemism in the European Alps is clustered into particular geographic areas. Two contrasted and non exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain these hotspots of endemism: (i) those areas were glacial refugia, where endemism reflects survival-recolonisation dynamics since the onset of Pleistocene glaciations, (ii) those are high elevation mountain areas, where endemism was fostered by local speciation events due to geographic isolation and harsh environmental niches, or by low dispersal ability of inhabiting species.
   Here, we quantitatively compared these two hypotheses using data of species distribution in the European Alps (IntraBioDiv database), species phylogenetic relationships, and species ecological and biological characteristics. We developed a spatially and phylogenetically explicit modelling framework to analyze spatial patterns of endemism and the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages. Moreover, we analyzed interrelations between species trait syndromes and endemism.
   We found that high endemism occurrs in potential glacial refugia, but only those on calcareous bedrock, and also in areas with high elevation. Plant assemblages in calcareous refugia showed phylogenetic overdispersion a signature of non-selective conservation forces, whereas those located in high mountain areas showed phylogenetic clustering - a signature of recent diversification and environmental filtering. Endemic species were either stress-tolerant, poorly dispersing species, or high elevation specialists with a wide distribution within the European Alps.
   While both calcareous refugia and high-elevation hotspots harbour a large portion of plant endemism in the European Alps, the species they host have substantially different characteristics. Our results suggest that hotspots of endemism in calcareous refugia are more important for nature conservation planning, as they host many range restricted endemic species and rather isolated evolutionary lineages.

AB  - In the Moctezuma river, Central Mexico we recorded thirty five species of fish, corresponding to a gamma diversity of 2.5. The river basin is located in the biological transition zone between both America's bioregions. The highest alpha diversity was found in the ecotope Jalpilla (H' = 1.58), inside the section of the river Matlapa. Between sub-basins, the greatest beta diversity was located in the river Huichihuayan (H* = 2.36). Cichlasoma cyanoguttatum, Cichlasoma pantostictum, Cichlasoma steindachneri, Gambusia marshi, Ictalurus australis, Poecilia formosa and Poecilia reticulata were new records for the basin. Fish distribution was classified in six meta-basins. The most diverse family was Poeciliidae (14 species). Poecilia mexicana was the most abundant species followed by Astyanax mexicanus. Fifty one percent of the species were Neotropical, 20% Nearctic ones; 25.7% were native; only 2.8% were deliberately introduced. Chirostoma jordani and Notropis sallei were recent introductions from the Lerma river. Changes in habitat, channelization for agriculture, water transfers between rivers Lerma and Moctezuma, and the deliberate or accidental introduction and translocation of eight species, were the main reasons of the displacement and reduction in the distribution of the endemic species. Three of the recorded species are protected by Mexican environmental laws: Cichlasoma labridens, C. steindachneri and I. australis. Action plans to preserve fish community and the ecological processes at different territorial and time scales (meta-basin, basin and sub-basin) are proposed.

AB  - In the last years, different spatial analyses were developed to support multi-taxon biodiversity conservation strategies. In fact, the use of species distribution models as input allowed to create spatial decision-support maps. Of special interest are maps of potential biodiversity (MPB), which define distribution and ecological requirements of relevant species and maps of priority conservation areas (MPCA), which define priority areas considering endemism and richness. The objective of this paper was to assess multi-taxon biodiversity based on two different spatial analyses and to test their efficiency to support conservation decision at Patagonia. We computed 119 potential habitat suitability maps (one deer, birds, lizards, darkling-beetles, plants) with ENFA (Environmental Niche Factor Analysis) and 15 environmental variables, using Biomapper software. ENFA calculate two ecological indexes (marginality and specialization) which describe the narrowness of species niches and how extreme are the optimum environmental conditions related to the whole study area. These maps were combined obtaining a MPB and MPCA using Zonation software. Multivariate analyses were performed to compare methodologies, analysing environmental variables, ecological areas, forest types and protected areas. Multivariate and ecological indexes showed that deer, lizards and darkling-beetles presented a narrow range, while birds and plants presented a large range of marginality and specialization mainly related to vegetation and climate. At provincial level, highest potential biodiversity and conservation priority values were related to shrublands and humid steppes. However, MPCA showed higher values related to forests and alpine vegetation due to endemism, while MPB showed differences among forest types. These analyses showed that the most valuable areas were not represented in the protected areas, however, many higher conservation priority values were found inside the protected compared with unprotected areas. Different spatial decision-support maps presented similar outputs at provincial scale, but differed in the forest landscape matrix. Both methodologies can be used to plan conservation strategies depending on the specific objectives (e.g. highlighting richness or endemism).

AB  - Aim The aims of this paper are to: examine how current and historical ecological factors affect patterns of species richness, endemism and turnover in the Gulf of Guinea highlands, test theoretical biogeographical predictions and provide information for making informed conservation decisions.
   Location The Gulf of Guinea highlands in West Africa.
   Methods We used multivariate and matrix regression models, and cluster analyses to assess the influence of current climate and current and historical isolation on patterns of richness and turnover for montane birds across the highlands. We examined three groups of birds: montane species (including widespread species), montane endemics and endemic subspecies. We applied a complementarity-based reserve selection algorithm using species richness with irreplaceability measures to identify areas of high conservation concern.
   Results Environmental factors influenced richness for all groups of birds (species, endemic species and subspecies). Areas with high and consistent annual rainfall showed the highest species and endemic richness. Species clusters for all groups of birds generally differentiated three major montane regions, which are topographically isolated. Multiple mantel tests identified these same regions for endemic species and subspecies. The influence of historical isolation varied by species group; distributions of endemic montane species and subspecies were more associated with historical breaks than were all montane species, which included widespread non-endemic species.
   Main conclusions Our analyses indicated important geographical structure amongst the bird assemblages in the highlands and, therefore, conservation prioritization should include mountains from within the geographical subregions identified in these analyses because these regions may harbour evolutionarily distinct populations of birds.

AB  - Cities worldwide are expanding in area and human population, posing multiple challenges to amphibian populations, including habitat loss from removal of wetlands and terrestrial upland habitat, habitat fragmentation due to roads and the built environment, and habitat degradation from pollutants, extensive human use and introduced species. We developed an eight-step urban amphibian conservation framework based on established monitoring, analytical methods and community engagement to enable amphibian conservation in a large urban centre. The framework outlines a process used to conserve biodiversity in a complex landuse and decision-making environment supported by a series of successive complementary modelling techniques to measure amphibian presence, priority habitat and functional connectivity. We applied the framework in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to illustrate its potential. Here, urbanization has reduced wetlands by 90% and ecological knowledge on amphibians was poor. We improved knowledge on amphibian diversity and distribution, identified core wetlands and movement pathways for amphibian species and identified barriers in the wetland network where construction or restoration measures could re-establish amphibians or increase their densities. This knowledge was shared with ecologists and city planners for implementation through appropriate policies and plans. Our framework provides a series of stepwise products to improve an urban municipality's ability to restore or conserve priority habitat and movement pathways necessary for amphibian survival under pressure from multiple land uses. The framework provides a platform to identify city plans, policy and or programmes and to derive necessary information to support amphibian conservation.

AB  - An assessment of historical distribution patterns and potential reintroduction sites is important for reducing the risk of reintroduction failure of endangered species. The saiga antelope, Saiga tatarica, was extirpated in the mid-20th century in China. A captive population was established in the Wuwei Endangered Wildlife Breeding Centre (WEWBC) in the 1980s. Reintroduction is planned, but so far, no action has been taken. In this study, we delineated the historical distribution and potential reintroduction areas of saigas in China, using a literature review, interviews and predictive modelling. Results suggest that most of the seasonally suitable areas are non-overlapping, and China may have been a peripheral part of the main saiga range. WEWBC is not an ideal reintroduction site due to its low habitat suitability. Furthermore, we infer that two different movement patterns existed historically (regular migration and nomadic wandering). Our results demonstrate the challenges of restoring a freeranging, self-sustaining saiga population in China. We recommend the setting up of additional breeding centres in protected areas within the potential saiga range in Xinjiang, and the development of a national action plan to provide a framework for the future recovery of the species.

AB  - Conservation programmes are always limited by available resources. Careful planning is therefore required to increase the efficiency of conservation and gap analysis can be used for this purpose. This method was used to assess the representativeness of current ex situ and in situ conservation actions of 234 priority crop wild relatives (CWR) in Indonesia. This analysis also included species distribution modelling, the creation of an ecogeographical land characterization map, and a complementarity analysis to identify priorities area for in situ conservation and for further collecting of ex situ conservation programmes. The results show that both current ex situ and in situ conservation actions are insufficient. Sixty-six percent of priority CWRs have no recorded ex situ collections. Eighty CWRs with ex situ collections are still under-represented in the national genebanks and 65 CWRs have no presence records within the existing protected area network although 60 are predicted to exist in several protected areas according to their potential distribution models. The complementarity analysis shows that a minimum of 61 complementary grid areas (complementary based on grid cells) are required to conserve all priority taxa and 40 complementary protected areas (complementary based on existing protected areas) are required to conserve those with known populations within the existing in situ protected area network. The top ten of complementary protected areas are proposed as the initial areas for the development of CWR genetic reserves network in Indonesia. It is recommended to enhanced coordination between ex situ and in situ conservation stakeholders for sustaining the long term conservation of CWR in Indonesia. Implementation of the research recommendations will provide for the first time an effective conservation planning of Indonesia's CWR diversity and will significantly enhance the country's food and nutritional security.

AB  - Javan deer (Rusa timorensis) is a protected species in Indonesia and considered to be vulnerable under IUCN list. Nevertheless, its native geographic distribution remains unclear, and the impact of abiotic and biotic factors on this species are mostly unknown. We predicted the potential range of Javan deer in Java and Bali Islands using ten environmental variables, occurrence data of native (76 before 1965, and 653 after 1965) and introduced populations (559), and MaxEnt modelling. We evaluated the effects of habitat loss due to current land use, ecosystem availability, and importance of Indonesian protected areas into the models. Our predictive map significantly improved the IUCN assessment and described for the first time the spread of Javan deer out of its native range within Indonesia. The model of environmental suitability estimated a potential of 3,784.43 km(2) natural occurrence in Java and Bali and 36,352.61 km(2) for introduced populations in protected areas of West Nusa Tenggara to Papua. The most critical environmental predictors for both populations are the mean annual precipitation and the conservation status of land. Then, 45.66 % of the distribution of native populations overlaps with protected areas, 18.96 % with production forests, 11.07 % with non-protected areas, 10.10 % with limited production forests and 4.20 % with industrial oil palm plantations. Only 22.88 % of the distribution of introduced populations overlaps with protected areas. Our study provides reliable information on places where conservation efforts must be prioritized, both inside and outside the protected area network, to safeguard one of the remaining Indonesian large deer.

AB  - The population of the medicinal plant, Malabar nut (Justicia adhatoda L) is shrinking in Dun valley due to habitat fragmentation, invasion by Lantana camara, over-exploitation, and an ever-increasing human population - the most important being the increasing demand on land for agriculture, industries and the urbanization. Predicting potential geographic distribution of the species is important from species and habitat restoration point of view. This paper reports the results of a study carried out in the Lesser Himalayan foothills in India (Dun valley) on potential distribution modeling for Malabar nut using Maxent model. The Worldclim bioclimatic variables, slope, aspect, elevation, and the land use/land cover (based on IRS LISS-III) data and 46 spatially well-dispersed species occurrence points were used to predict the potential distribution off. adhatoda in ca. 1877 km(2) study area. Jackknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modeling. Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 92.3. The approach could be promising in predicting the potential distribution of medicinal plant species and thus, can be an effective tool in species restoration and conservation planning.

AB  - Plant endemism in the European Alps is clustered into particular geographic areas. Two contrasted and non exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain these hotspots of endemism: (i) those areas were glacial refugia, where endemism reflects survival-recolonisation dynamics since the onset of Pleistocene glaciations, (ii) those are high elevation mountain areas, where endemism was fostered by local speciation events due to geographic isolation and harsh environmental niches, or by low dispersal ability of inhabiting species.
   Here, we quantitatively compared these two hypotheses using data of species distribution in the European Alps (IntraBioDiv database), species phylogenetic relationships, and species ecological and biological characteristics. We developed a spatially and phylogenetically explicit modeling framework to analyze spatial patterns of endemism and the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages. Moreover, we analyzed interrelations between species trait syndromes and endemism.
   We found that high endemism occurrs in potential glacial refugia, but only those on calcareous bedrock, and also in areas with high elevation. Plant assemblages in calcareous refugia showed phylogenetic overdispersion - a signature of non-selective conservation forces, whereas those located in high mountain areas showed phylogenetic clustering -a signature of recent diversification and environmental filtering. Endemic species were either stress-tolerant, poorly dispersing species, or high elevation specialists with a wide distribution within the European Alps.
   While both calcareous refugia and high-elevation hotspots harbour a large portion of plant endemism in the European Alps, the species they host have substantially different characteristics. Our results suggest that hotspots of endemism in calcareous refugia are more important for nature conservation planning, as they host many range restricted endemic species and rather isolated evolutionary lineages.'

AB  - 1. Despite the abundance, richness and ecological importance of insects, distribution patterns remain unknown for most groups, and this creates serious difficulties for the evaluation of macroecological patterns and the underlying drivers. Although the problem is real, we provide an optimistic perspective on insect macroecology and conservation biogeography.
   2. Although data for macroecological analysis of insects are not as complete as for many other organisms (e.g., mammals and birds), at least for some insect groups they are equivalent to what existed 10 or 20 years ago for the charismatic megafauna, so initiatives to compile data for broad-scale analyses are feasible.
   3. The primary constraint for studies in insect macroecology and conservation biogeography is not (only) poor data; part of the problem arises from a lack of knowledge on how macroecological patterns and processes can be analysed and interpreted.
   4. Finally, we present an overview of recent papers using insects as model organisms in macroecology, including richness and diversity gradients, ecogeographical rules, inter-specific relationships, conservation planning and modelling species distributions. Although our list is not exhaustive, it may be useful as guidelines for future research and encourage ICD readers to develop analyses for other insect groups.

AB  - Conservation biology can benefit greatly from models that relate species' distributions to their environments. The foundation of successful modeling is a high-quality set of field data, and distribution models have specialized data requirements. The role of a distribution model may be primarily predictive or, alternatively, may emphasize relationships between an organism and its habitat. For the latter application, the environmental variables recorded should have direct, biological relationships with the organism. Interacting species may be valuable predictors and can improve understanding of distribution patterns. Sampling should cover the full range of environmental conditions within the study region, with samples stratified across major environmental gradients to ensure thorough coverage. Failure to sample correctly can lead to erroneous organism-environment relationships, affecting predictive ability and interpretation. Sampling ideally should examine a series of spatial scales, increasing the understanding of organism-environment relationships, identifying the most effective scales for predictive modeling and complementing the spatial hierarchies often used in conservation planning. Consideration of statistical issues could benefit most studies. The ratio of sample sites to environmental variables considered should ideally exceed a ratio of 10: 1 to improve the analytical power and reliability of subsequent modeling. Presence and/or absence models may suffer bias if training data detect the study organism at an atypical proportion of sites. We considered different strategies for spatial autocorrelation and recommend it be included wherever possible for the benefits in biological realism, predictive accuracy, and model versatility. Finally, we stress the importance of collecting independent evaluation data and suggest that, as with the training data, a systematic approach be used to ensure broad environmental coverage, rather than relying on a random selection of test sites.

AB  - Wind-farms have negative impacts on the environment, mainly through habitat destruction and bird mortality, making it urgent to design predictive tools to use in landscape planning. A frequent assumption of wind-farm assessment studies is that bird distribution and abundance and bird mortality through collision with turbines are closely related. However, previous results are contradictory and question the usefulness of these variables to select safer wind-farm locations. We focused on a species highly vulnerable to collision at wind-farms, the griffon vulture, to test whether mortality at turbines was related to the relative position of turbines within the vulture population. We used the location of all turbines on 34 wind-farms in southern Spain, details on 342 griffon vultures found dead, and the location and size of breeding colonies and roost sites of the species during the breeding and non-breeding seasons, respectively. using variables that describe the large-scale distribution and aggregation of vultures, we found that year-round mortality at turbines increased when they were located in highly populated areas, a result that can be translated into management guidelines to plan wind-farm locations.
   Bird abundances can help to guide wind-farm plans at large scales. Current protocols of counting birds at specific points during particular periods of time have low predictive power. However, other more integrative cues such as the spatial distribution and aggregation of some vulnerable species should be used as criteria for large-scale environmental planning. Local inspection of the relationship between mortality at existing turbines and their relative position within the spatial distribution of bird populations can guide managers in planning future wind-farms and in managing currently operating developments.

AB  - Climate changes may threaten the survival of felids by driving range shifts, altering the biogeographical characteristics of their existing range, and decreasing range overlap with protected areas. In this study, we investigate these threats and delineate priority areas for conservation by comparing current (1950-1999) with future (2080-2100) distribution predicted by climatic niche modelling. Distribution changes encompass centroid displacement of up to 1067 km, range contractions of up to 460 km(2), and fragmentation into up to 29 populations. Some felids may expand their distribution by up to 1016 km(2), which could facilitate the reconnection of isolated populations if appropriate management plans are implemented. The protected area network overlaps with just 5.85% of the current distribution of felids and would decline to 3.69% in the future scenario, necessitating an expansion of protected areas in areas of felids distribution. However, countries that are subject to the greatest landcover changes worldwide (e.g. Brazil, China, and India) are also home to the priority areas to felids conservation, underscoring the urgency and potential challenges of safeguarding felids.

AB  - The potential effects of global climate change on marine protected areas do not appear to have been addressed in the literature. This paper examines the literature on protected areas, conservation biology, marine ecology, oceanography, and climate change, and reviews some of the relevant differences between marine and terrestrial environments. Frameworks and classifications systems used in protected area design are discussed. Finally, a framework that summarizes some of the important oceanographic processes and their links to the food chain are reviewed. Species abundance and distribution are expected to change as a result of global climate change, potentially compromising the efficacy of marine protected areas as biodiversity conservation tools. This review suggests the need for: further interdisciplinary research and the use of linked models; an increase in marine protected areas for biodiversity conservation and as research sites for teasing apart fishing effects from climate effects; a temporally responsive approach to siting new marine protected areas, shifting their locations if necessary; and large-scale ecosystem/integrated management approaches to address the competing uses of the oceans and boundary-less threats such as global climate change and pollution.

AB  - Managing landscape connectivity is a widely recognized overarching strategy for conserving biodiversity in human-impacted landscapes. However, planning the conservation and management of landscape connectivity of multiple and ecologically distinct species is still challenging. Here we provide a spatially-explicit framework which identifies and prioritizes connectivity conservation and restoration actions for species with distinct habitat affinities. Specifically, our study system comprised three groups of common bird species, forest-specialists, farmland-specialists, and generalists, populating a highly heterogeneous agricultural countryside in the southwestern Iberian Peninsula. We first performed a comprehensive analysis of the environmental variables underlying the distributional patterns of each bird species to reveal generalities in their guild-specific responses to landscape structure. Then, we identified sites which could be considered pivotal in maintaining current levels of landscape connectivity for the three bird guilds simultaneously, as well as the number and location of sites that need to be restored to maximize connectivity levels. Interestingly, we found that a small number of sites defined the shortest connectivity paths for the three bird guilds simultaneously, and were therefore considered key for conservation. Moreover, an even smaller number of sites were identified as critical to expand the landscape connectivity at maximum for the regional bird assemblage as a whole. Our spatially-explicit framework can provide valuable decision-making support to conservation practitioners aiming to identify key connectivity and restoration sites, a particularly urgent task in rapidly changing landscapes such as agroecosystems.

AB  - Gap analysis is used to analyse reserve networks and their coverage of biodiversity, thus identifying gaps in biodiversity representation that may be filled by additional conservation measures. Gap analysis has been used to identify priorities for species and habitat types. When it is applied to identify gaps in the coverage of environmental variables, it embodies the assumption that combinations of environmental variables are effective surrogates for biodiversity attributes. The question remains of how to fill gaps in conservation systems efficiently. Conservation prioritization software can identify those areas outside existing conservation areas that contribute to the efficient covering of gaps in biodiversity features. We show how environmental gap analysis can be implemented using high-resolution information about environmental variables and ecosystem condition with the publicly available conservation prioritization software, Zonation. Our method is based on the conversion of combinations of environmental variables into biodiversity features. We also replicated the analysis by using Species Distribution Models (SDMs) as biodiversity features to evaluate the robustness and utility of our environment-based analysis. We apply the technique to a planning case study of the state of Victoria. Australia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Species reintroductions often aim to establish populations of threatened taxa over the long-term. However, climate change may jeopardize reintroduction efforts by altering the conditions of a recipient site beyond the tolerances of the focal species. To aid the selection of recipient sites that will retain their suitability under climate change, species distribution models (SDMs) have been proposed as a method of locating areas with a greater likelihood of facilitating species persistence. 2. We applied SDMs to predict macroclimatic suitability changes for 13 threatened plant and invertebrate species considered for reintroduction at four lowland raised bog sites undergoing restoration. We estimated suitability based on current and projected future conditions under two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios - one low (RCP2.6) and one high (RCP8.5) - using three general circulation models, for the period 2041-2060. 3. When considering current predicted suitability, our models indicated that nine species were viable candidates for reintroduction to at least one of the restoration sites. But when accounting for potential future changes in suitability, the number of candidates was reduced to seven species, based on the RCP8.5 climate change scenario. While three of the sites received consistently similar predictions of suitability across species and scenarios, the most northerly site, Red Moss, received divergent suitability predictions for some species. This site is predicted to remain suitable for Metrioptera brachyptera and Genista anglica under at least one scenario despite substantial losses forecast across the rest of their U.K. ranges, suggesting that it could act as a macroclimatic refuge as climate change advances. 4. The findings presented here made a valuable contribution to the reintroduction planning process, by facilitating the prioritization of reintroduction efforts towards species with a greater likelihood of establishing long-term populations at the prospective recipient sites.

AB  - The Asian elephant has been listed as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List since 1986. In Peninsular Malaysia, the elephant population continues to decline, threatened by habitat degradation. Distinguishing their potential habitats is important in mitigating the impacts of forest fragmentation. This study aimed to predict the potential habitats of elephants in the fragmented forest landscape of Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve and to identify its characteristics. Habitat suitability was evaluated using several environmental variables--elevation, slope, land use, lithology, distance to river and distance from urban areas. The results showed that the distribution of suitable habitats mainly occurred in the eastern region of the study area. Elephant habitat prediction, using maximum entropy modelling, indicated that their most suitable habitat was located in a forested area that was greatly influenced by altitude and river proximity, while urban and agricultural areas cause forest fragmentation and restricted suitability. The prediction of wildlife habitats using maximum entropy modelling is a favourable and effective tool for improving the management and conservation planning of wildlife in the region.

AB  - Grassland birds are among the most globally threatened bird groups due to substantial degradation of native grassland habitats. However, the current network of grassland conservation areas may not be adequate for halting population declines and biodiversity loss. Here, we evaluate a network of grassland conservation areas within Wisconsin, U.S.A., that includes both large Focal Landscapes and smaller targeted conservation areas (e.g., Grassland Bird Conservation Areas, GBCAs) established within them. To date, this conservation network has lacked baseline information to assess whether the current placement of these conservation areas aligns with population hot spots of grassland-dependent taxa. To do so, we fitted data from thousands of avian point-count surveys collected by citizen scientists as part of Wisconsin's Breeding Bird Atlas II with multinomial N-mixture models to estimate habitat-abundance relationships, develop spatially explicit predictions of abundance, and establish ecological baselines within priority conservation areas for a suite of obligate grassland songbirds. Next, we developed spatial randomization tests to evaluate the placement of this conservation network relative to randomly placed conservation networks. Overall, less than 20% of species statewide populations were found within the current grassland conservation network. Spatial tests demonstrated a high representation of this bird assemblage within the entire conservation network, but with a bias toward birds associated with moderately tallgrasses relative to those associated with shortgrasses or tallgrasses. We also found that GBCAs had higher representation at Focal Landscape rather than statewide scales. Here, we demonstrated how combining citizen science data with hierarchical modeling is a powerful tool for estimating ecological baselines and conducting large-scale evaluations of an existing conservation network for multiple grassland birds. Our flexible spatial randomization approach offers the potential to be applied to other protected area networks and serves as a complementary tool for conservation planning efforts globally.

AB  - Focusing conservation efforts on priority areas is crucial for maximizing the effects of the limited available resources. Unfortunately, there is often a conflict between the optimal spatial scale for conservation measures and data available for planning. We tested the potential contribution of LiDAR data in providing high-resolution environmental predictors for conservation planning. We used detailed samples of ground beetles communities and high-resolution environmental data (i.e. land morphology, forest structure, and water availability) for modeling the habitat suitability for each species. All the specific models were combined to define priority areas for the conservation of carabids at the local level and to clarify the effect of each environmental feature on the forest suitability for ground beetles. The highest levels of suitability were obtained in less steep and north facing zones and in those where trees are taller, total volume of trees is larger, and tree density is lower. These parameters should be taken into account in sustainable forest management options aimed to preserve carabid communities. Moreover, our approach allowed to find exactly where, within the considered forest stands, the adoption of these measures would be particularly efficient. Our study is a demonstrative case that can be adapted to different taxa and different areas for improving the efficacy of forest management and of biodiversity conservation initiatives.

AB  - Due to their secretive habits, predicting the pattern of spatial distribution of small carnivores has been typically challenging, yet for conservation management it is essential to understand the association between this group of animals and environmental factors. We applied maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) to build distribution models and identify environmental predictors including bioclimatic variables, forest and land cover type, topography, vegetation index and anthropogenic variables for six small carnivore species in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. Species occurrence records were collated from camera-traps and vehicle transects during the years 2010 and 2011. We used the average training gain from forty model runs for each species to select the best set of predictors. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic plot (ROC) ranged from 0.81 to 0.93 for the training data and 0.72 to 0.87 for the test data. In habitat models for F. chaus, P. hermaphroditus, and H. smithii "distance to village'' and precipitation of the warmest quarter emerged as some of the most important variables. "Distance to village'' and aspect were important for V. indica while "distance to village'' and precipitation of the coldest quarter were significant for H. vitticollis. "Distance to village'', precipitation of the warmest quarter and land cover were influential variables in the distribution of H. edwardsii. The map of predicted probabilities of occurrence showed potentially suitable habitats accounting for 46 km(2) of the reserve for F. chaus, 62 km(2) for V. indica, 30 km(2) for P. hermaphroditus, 63 km(2) for H. vitticollis, 45 km(2) for H. smithii and 28 km(2) for H. edwardsii. Habitat heterogeneity driven by the east-west climatic gradient was correlated with the spatial distribution of small carnivores. This study exemplifies the usefulness of modeling small carnivore distribution to prioritize and direct conservation planning for habitat specialists in southern India.

AB  - Human-induced environmental changes, particularly climate change, pose a threat to many tropical montane species, making the identification of optimal future habitat a conservation priority. Here we used maximum entropy (Maxent) and boosted regression trees to predict suitable habitat of the threatened Bornean highland endemic Hose's civet (Diplogale hosei), that is currently available, and for future time periods (2050s and 2080s), considering future land cover and climate change predictions. Next, we identified areas that were consistently suitable under current and future model predictions as forest refuges. Our analysis predicted that Hose's civet is restricted mainly to the highlands of Borneo to an area less than 20,000 km(2) (about 2% of the entire island of Borneo). Changes in land cover have little impact on predicted suitable area for the species. However, we predicted habitat loss due to climate change to approximate 86% by 2080, except under a "green economy scenario" which showed stable or increasing suitable habitat. Refuges were small, about 11% of 2010 habitat, and mostly restricted to lower montane forest. About 28-35% of refuges lie within the current protected area network though much is designated as commercial forests within the proposed Heart of Borneo (HoB). For the conservation of Hose's civet and likely other Bornean highland endemics, we recommend increased wildlife and forest law enforcement in identified protected refuges and sustainable timber harvesting practices in surrounding commercial forests, both within the HoB and the extensions we identified. Results of our green model showed that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will likely contribute immensely to the long-term conservation of highland species such as Hose's civet.

AB  - Management of human activities in the marine environment increasingly requires spatially explicit risk assessments that link the occurrence and magnitude of a pressure to information on the sensitivity of the environment. We developed a marine spatial risk assessment framework for the UK continental shelf assessing the vulnerability of 11 fish and shellfish species to aggregate extraction. We calculated a sensitivity index (SI) using life-history characteristics and modelled species distributions on the UK shelf using long-term monitoring data and indicator kriging. Merging sensitivity indices and predicted species distributions allowed us to map the sensitivity of the selected fish to aggregate extraction. The robustness of the sensitivity map was affected primarily by widespread species with a low to medium level of sensitivity, while highly sensitive species with more restricted distributions had a limited effect on the overall sensitivity. The highest sensitivity in the case study occurred in coastal regions, and where nursery and spawning areas of four important commercial species occur. To test the framework, we overlaid the estimated sensitivity map with the occurrence of aggregate extraction activity in inshore waters, including sediment plume estimations, to describe species vulnerability to dredging. We conclude that our spatially explicit risk assessment framework can be applied to other ecosystem components and pressures at different spatial scales and it is therefore a promising tool that can support the sustainable development of marine spatial plans.

AB  - Detailed information on the geographic distribution of a crop is important planning efficient germplasm conservation strategies but is often not available, particularly for minor crops. Using germplasm collection data from Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, we used distribution modeling to predict the distribution of sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas L. (Lam.)] in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a consensus modeling approach using the following algorithms: genetic algorithm for rule set prediction (GARP), maximum entropy, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN. The predicted distribution encompasses known sweetpotato production areas as well as additional areas suited for this crop species: New geographic areas where at least three models predicted presence were in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, The Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda, and the Central African Republic. This information can be used to fill gaps in current sweetpotato germplasm collections as well as to further enhance the current presence-only based distribution model. Our approach demonstrates the usefulness of considering several models in developing distribution maps.

AB  - 1. Biodiversity indices are widely used to summarize changes in the distribution and abundance of multiple species and measure progress towards management targets. However, the sensitivity of biodiversity indices to the data, landscape classification and conservation values underpinning them are rarely interrogated. There are limited studies to help scientists and land managers use biodiversity indices in the presence of fire and vegetation succession.
   2. The geometric mean of species' relative abundance or occurrence (G) is a biodiversity index that can be used to determine the mix of post-fire vegetation that maximizes biodiversity. We explored the sensitivity of G to (1) type of biodiversity data, (2) representation of ecosystem states, (3) expression of conservation values, and (4) uncertainty in species' response to landscape structure. Our case study is an area of fire-prone woodland in southern Australia where G is used in fire management planning. We analysed three datasets to determine the fire responses of 170 bird, mammal and reptile species.
   3. G and fire management targets were sensitive to the species included in the analysis. The optimal mix of vegetation successional states for threatened birds was more narrowly defined than the optimal mix for all species combined. G was less sensitive to successional classification (i.e. number of states); although classifications of increasing complexity provided additional insights into desirable levels of heterogeneity.
   4. Weighting species by conservation status or endemism influenced the mix of vegetation states that maximized biodiversity. When a higher value was placed on threatened species the importance of late successional vegetation was emphasized.
   5. Representing variation in individual species' response to vegetation structure made it clearer when a decrease in G was likely to reflect a significant reduction in species occurrences.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Data, models and conservation values can be combined using biodiversity indices to make robust environmental decisions. Combining different types of biodiversity data using composite indices, such as the geometric mean, can improve the coverage and relevance of biodiversity indices. We recommend that evaluation of biodiversity indices for fire management verify how index assumptions align with management objectives, consider the relative merits of different types of biodiversity data, test sensitivity of ecosystem state definitions and incorporate conservation values through species weightings.

AB  - The inventories of fish fauna through the elevation interval in Andean rivers are tools to generate conservation strategies in the region, therefore the completeness of these inventories is essential to take sound decisions. The material deposited in five biological collections, and that collected in three explorations carried out in years 2014, 2015, and 2016 in 64 localities that drain into the Magdalena River basin was examined. The richness consisted of 115 fish species. We found that the rate of decrease in the number of species was 54 per 900 m. of elevation. Using a species prediction model, we showed that the total number of species was only recorded in the 300-600 m. interval and in the high Andean zone. This suggests that a greater sampling effort is required to obtain a sufficient representation of the estimated real richness for each the elevation intervals evaluated. Additionally, different threats on the water bodies were detected in the elevation intervals, such as extensive cattle ranching and agriculture, unregulated mineral extraction, hydroelectric power generation, as well as the use of fish as a protein resource, including the farming of introduced species. As the modification of habitats continues without adequate planning, there is a risk of affecting the richness and distribution of species in the basin, therefore, it is important to know their ecological aspects, which will allow to propose recommendations and find opportunities for their conservation.

AB  - Knowledge of the factors that influence spatial patterns in fish abundance, distribution and diversity are essential for informing fisheries and conservation management. The present study was conducted in the nearshore Pilbara bioregion of north-western Australia where the dynamic marine environment is characterised by large embayments, numerous islands and islets, coexisting with globally significant petrochemical and mineral industries. Within Western Australia, this nearshore bioregion has high biodiversity and is considered to play an essential role in the recruitment of species of commercial importance. To better inform future investigations into both ecological processes and planning scenarios for management, a rapid assessment of the distribution, abundance and associations with nearshore habitats of fishes across the region was conducted. Baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) were used to simultaneously sample the fish assemblage and habitat composition. Generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) were used to determine whether the abundance of fishes were related to habitat and a range of environmental variables (visibility, depth, distance to 30 m and 200 m depth isobars, boat ramps and the nearest large embayment (Exmouth Gulf). A diverse fish assemblage comprising 343 species from 58 families was recorded. The abundance and distribution patterns of fishery-target species and of the five most common and abundant species and families were linked positively with areas of high relief, hard coral cover, reef and macroalgae and negatively with the distance to the nearest oceanic waters (200 m depth isobar). This study provides information that can contribute to future marine spatial planning scenarios for management of the Pilbara using a unique, analytical approach that has broad application in biogeography.

AB  - The effects of climate change on biodiversity are increasingly well documented, and many methods have been developed to assess species' vulnerability to climatic changes, both ongoing and projected in the coming decades. To minimize global biodiversity losses, conservationists need to identify those species that are likely to be most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In this Review, we summarize different currencies used for assessing species' climate change vulnerability. We describe three main approaches used to derive these currencies (correlative, mechanistic and trait-based), and their associated data requirements, spatial and temporal scales of application and modelling methods. We identify strengths and weaknesses of the approaches and highlight the sources of uncertainty inherent in each method that limit projection reliability. Finally, we provide guidance for conservation practitioners in selecting the most appropriate approach(es) for their planning needs and highlight priority areas for further assessments.

AB  - The Endangered Arabian tahr Arabitragus jayakari is a rare and little known mountain ungulate, endemic to the 650 km mountain chain of northern Oman and the United Arab Emirates. To investigate the species' status and distribution we conducted a systematic camera-trap survey across its entire range. We used occupancy modelling to quantify habitat associations and create a predictive distribution model for the species. We found that tahr preferred steep, rugged mountain habitats, and occupancy was much higher in protected areas. Arabian tahr were subject to anthropogenic threats, with occupancy decreasing with closer proximity to villages, and with increasing numbers of domestic goats. Tahr occupancy was also negatively associated with elevation and rainfall, with peak occupancy at 800-1,000 m. Although previous assessments have associated the entire Hajar Mountain range with the Arabian tahr, we found that only 23.9%, or 6,986 km(2), of the mountain range was occupied. This reduction in area of occupancy reflects recent population declines, but also our improved methods of assessment. Based on our findings, future conservation efforts should focus on creating more protected areas, control measures to partition goats from core habitats of the Arabian tahr, and restoration and captive reinforcement within suitable habitats unoccupied by Arabian tahr. As infrastructure development is a threat to the Arabian tahr, our occurrence probability map provides a useful tool for spatial planning of developments to reduce impacts on the species.

AB  - The Mediterranean basin, and the Iberian Peninsula in particular, represent an outstanding "hotspot" of biological diversity with a long history of integration between natural ecosystems and human activities. Using deductive distribution models, and considering both Spain and Portugal, we downscaled traditional range maps for terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, breeding birds, mammals and reptiles) to the finest possible resolution with the data at hand, and we identified hotspots based on three criteria: i) species richness; ii) vulnerability, and iii) endemism. We also provided a first evaluation of the conservation status of biodiversity hotspots based on these three criteria considering both existing and proposed protected areas (i.e., Natura 2000). For the identification of hotspots, we used a method based on the cumulative distribution functions of species richness values. We found no clear surrogacy among the different types of hotspots in the Iberian Peninsula. The most important hotspots (considering all criteria) are located in the western and southwestern portions of the study area, in the Mediterranean biogeographical region. Existing protected areas are not specifically concentrated in areas of high species richness, with only 5.2% of the hotspots of total richness being currently protected. The Natura 2000 network can potentially constitute an important baseline for protecting vertebrate diversity in the Iberian Peninsula although further improvements are needed. We suggest taking a step forward in conservation planning in the Mediterranean basin, explicitly considering the history of the region as well as its present environmental context. This would allow moving from traditional reserve networks (conservation focused on "patterns") to considerations about the "processes" that generated present biodiversity.

AB  - We analyzed the changes in composition, diversity and structure of trees and shrubs along a successional gradient in southwest Mexico. Early stages were dominated by typical pioneer species but species of mature forests were present throughout the chronosequence, and therefore the species plant distribution between stages may be explained by the initial floristic composition model. Because sites from all stages had similar number of species, our study does not support the intermediate levels of disturbance hypothesis. Contrary to the patterns observed in other dry forests, the mature stages presented a relatively simple structure complexity compared to that of intermediate forests. This resulted from a few dominant species which are usually present in mature forests with some degree of perturbation. According to the polyclimax hypothesis, diversity of the mature forests appears to be influenced by local soil conditions, microclimates and biotic factors. Our study supports this idea because local conditions vary between sites and the dominant species of the late stages were different between stands. The conservation and management plans should be directed to different successional stages and not only to single patches in order to ensure the conservation of regional biodiversity.

AB  - The 400-500 wolves currently living in the Apennine range of peninsular Italy are slowly recolonizing the Alps and are expected to move northward. A nationwide management plan for the Italian wolf population is being prepared, and a zoning system with connecting corridors has been suggested. We developed a large-scale probabilistic model of wolf distribution as a contribution to the planning process. Thirteen environmental variables related to wolf needs and human Presence were analyzed in 12 well-studied wolf territories and in 100 areas where the species has been absent for the Past 25 years. These two areas were used as a training set in a discriminant analysis to evaluate Potential wolf presence throughout the entire country. We used the Mahalanobis distance statistic ns an index of environmental quality, calculated as the distance from the arrange environmental conditions of the wolf territories. Based on the Mahalanobis distance statistics, we constructed an actual and potential spatial distribution of the wolf for all of peninsula Italy. The jackknife procedure trans used to assess the stability of the distance model and showed good confidence in our model (coefficient of variation less than or equal to 13%). Distance from the wolf territories' centroid ns an index of environmental quality for the wolf was tested using 287 locations where wolves have been found dead in the past 25 years as a consequence of human action (poison, shotgun car accidents). A useful contribution to conservation Planning resulted from comparing the frequency distribution of the Mahalanobis distance of the dead wolf locations with the percentage? of study area within each distance class. This showed how the number of wolf casualties would greatly decrease with Protection of only a minor part of the study area and indicated the usefulness of our approach for evaluation of other conservation options, such as core areas and corridor identification.

AB  - Unsuitable livestock farming is considered as a main driver of biodiversity loss. In the high elevation areas across the world, many subalpine and alpine natural herbaceous communities are highly sensitive to sheep overgrazing. Such habitats of high biogeographic and conservation value are refugia for slow-growing, locally rare, and cold -adapted species. However, at a regional scale, no maps of these sensitive habitats exist that the authorities could refer to for regulating grazing. We therefore studied the possibility of using habitat suitability modeling (HSM) to map five selected habitats that are potentially threatened by overgrazing in the Northern Alps of the Swiss canton of Fribourg. For each habitat, we defined a group of characteristic species and gathered their occurrences from national data centers. These occurrences were pooled within each group and used as presences to calibrate the HSM. High-resolution predictors (10 m) were used to achieve fine-scale modeling. The models predicted accurate and ecologically relevant distributions for three of the habitats: alpine swards and heaths on exposed ridges and peaks, unstable calcareous screes and vegetated snow patches. These results show that habitats that are topo-graphically and environmentally well-defined can be finely predicted by HSM using distributions of character-istic species for use in spatial conservation planning. In the context of summer pasture management, this helped us to translate the Swiss legal basis onto maps of authorized grazing pressure.

AB  - Hunting is one of the main driving forces behind large mammal density distribution in many regions of the world. In tropical Africa, urban demand for bushmeat has been shown to dominate over subsistence hunting and its impact often overrides spatial-ecological species characteristics. To effectively protect remaining mammal populations the main factors that influence their distribution need to be integrated into conservation area prioritisation and management plans. This information has been lacking for Rio Muni, Equatorial Guinea, as prior studies have been outdated or have not systematically covered the continental region of the country. In this study we evaluated: 1) the relative importance of local vs. commercial hunting; 2) wildlife density of protected vs. non-protected areas; and 3) the importance of ecological factors vs. human influence in driving mammal density distribution in Rio Muni. We adopted a systematic countrywide line transect approach with particular focus on apes and elephants, but also including other mammal species. For analysis of field data we used generalised linear models with a set of predictor variables representing ecological conditions, anthropogenic pressure and protected areas. We estimate that there are currently 884 (437-1,789) elephants and 11,097 (8,719-13,592) chimpanzees and gorillas remaining in Rio Muni. The results indicate strong hunting pressures on both local and commercial levels, with roads demonstrating a negative impact on elephants and overall mammal body mass. Protected areas played no role in determining any of the mammal species distributions and significant human hunting signs were found inside these protected areas, illustrating the lack of environmental law enforcement throughout the country. Rio Muni is currently under-represented in conservation efforts in Western Equatorial Africa, and we recommend a focus on cross-boundary conservation, in particular in the Monte Alen-Monts de Cristal and Rio Campo Ma'an conservation landscapes, where the highest densities and diversity of large mammals remain.

AB  - Ecologists are interested in prediction of potential distribution of species in suitable areas, essential for planning conservation and management strategies. Unfortunately, often the only available information in such studies is the true presence of the species at few locations of the study area and the associated environmental covariates over the entire area, referred as presence-only data. We propose a Bayesian approach to estimate logistic linear regressions adapted to presence-only data through the introduction of a random approximation of the correction factor in the adjusted logistic model that allows us to overcome the need to know a priori the prevalence of the species.

AB  - Identifying conservation priorities for an understudied species can be challenging, as the amount and type of data available to work with are often limited. Here, we demonstrate a flexible workflow for identifying priorities for such data-limited species, focusing on the little-studied Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) in mainland Tropical Asia. Using recent occurrence records, we modeled the golden cat's expected area of occurrence and identified remaining habitat strongholds (i.e., large intact areas with moderate-to-high expected occurrence). We then classified these strongholds by recent camera-trap survey status (from a literature review) and nearfuture threat status (based on publicly available forest loss projections and Bayesian Belief Network derived estimates of hunting-induced extirpation risk) to identify conservation priorities. Finally, we projected the species' expected area of occurrence in the year 2000, approximately three generations prior to today, to define past declines and better evaluate the species' current conservation status. Lower levels of hunting-induced extirpation risk and higher levels of closedcanopy forest cover were the strongest predictors of recent camera-trap records. Our projections suggest a 68% decline in area with moderate-to-high expected occurrence between 2000 and 2020, with a further 18% decline predicted over the next 20 years. Past and near-future declines were primarily driven by cumulatively increasing levels of hunting-induced extirpation risk, suggesting assessments of conservation status based solely on declines in habitat may underes-timate actual population declines. Of the 40 remaining habitat strongholds, 77.5% were seriously threatened by forest loss and hunting. Only 52% of threatened strongholds had at least one site surveyed, compared to 100% of low-to-moderate threat strongholds, thus highlighting an important knowledge gap concerning the species' current distribution and population status. Our results suggest the golden cat has experienced, and will likely continue to experience, consider-able population declines and should be considered for up-listing to a threatened category (i.e., VU/EN) under criteria A2c of the IUCN Red List.

AB  - Aim High-resolution spatial soil data are crucial to species distribution modelling for fundamental research and conservation planning. Recent globally modelled soil layers (e.g. SoilGrids) have transformed distribution modelling, but may fail to represent regional soil characteristics accurately. We hypothesize that in the Cape biodiversity hotspot of South Africa, the use of global soil layers has led to underestimation of the importance of edaphic factors as determinants of species' and vegetation distributions. We present a series of new, regionally modelled layers to address this deficiency. Location Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR, South Africa). Methods We georeferenced edaphic characteristics from literature and other sources and used boosted regression trees (BRT) to associate edaphic characteristics with spatially explicit topographic, climatic, soil texture and biotic variables. Multinomial BRTs were used to predict mapped vegetation types from the collated edaphic and other data. Results BRTs reliably predicted pH (92% of variance), Na (87%), K (85%), electrical conductivity (81%) and P (73%), but were less accurate for total N (55%) and total C (61%), for which data were sparser. Soil clay and pH values differed markedly in range and in spatial variation from those in SoilGrids. Using our new edaphic layers, we were able to accurately predict spatial distributions of vegetation types within the GCFR (multi-class AUC = 0.96). The multinomial BRT predicted vegetation less well when based on SoilGrids data alone (AUC = 0.84). Main conclusions The more faithful representation of soil properties in our model is attributable both to its use of ca. 10-fold more samples, and to its regional focus. Our model of edaphic characteristics captures important edaphic variability that is vital for understanding plant and consequently faunal distributions, with wide-ranging conservation implications. Ongoing development of global syntheses of soil data requires more samples, especially in areas with high spatial heterogeneity and extreme edaphic conditions.

AB  - Assisted migration (AM) has been suggested as a management strategy for aiding species in reaching newly suitable locations as climate changes. Species distribution models (SDMs) can provide important insights for decisions on whether to assist a species in its migration; however, their application includes uncertainties. In this study, we use consensus SDMs to model the future suitable areas for 13 vascular plant species with poor dispersal capacity. Based on the outputs of SDMs under different climate change scenarios and future times, we quantify the predicted changes in suitable area by calculating metrics that describe the need and potential for migration. We find that, by the end of the 21st century, one of the species would benefit from AM under mild climate change, seven under moderate change, and for 12 out of 13 species studied AM appears to be a relevant conservation method under strong climate change. We also test the effect of different modeling attributes on the metrics and find little variation between SDMs constructed using different combinations of modeling methods and variable sets. However, the choice of climate variables had a larger influence on the level of the metrics than did the modeling method. We therefore suggest that the choice of climate variables should receive ample attention when measuring climate change threat using SDMs and that experiments aiming to uncover critical environmental factors for individual species should be extensively conducted. This study illustrates that dispersal assistance may be needed for many species under a wide range of possible future climates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fish populations undertaking ontogenetic or spawning migrations pose challenges to marine protected area (MPA) planning because of the large extent of their distribution areas. There is a need to identify the juvenile and spawner hotspots of these populations that could be set aside as MPAs. Species distribution models making comprehensive use of available monitoring data and predicting the realized juvenile and spawner hotspots of migratory fish populations will assist resource managers with MPA planning. We developed a statistical modelling approach relying on multiple, regional monitoring datasets for assisting spatial protection efforts targeting the juveniles, spawners, or both life stages, of migratory fish species and species complexes. This approach predicts juvenile and spawner hotspot indices, and critical life stage (CLS) hotspot indices, which integrate both juvenile and spawner hotspot indices. We applied the approach to 11 vulnerable species of the grouper-snapper complex of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which all form fish spawning aggregations (FSAs). The CLS hotspot index was predicted to be highest in the Pulley Ridge and Flower Garden Banks areas, followed by the West Florida Shelf, southwestern Florida waters and portions of the Louisiana-Mississippi-Alabama shelf. The Pulley Ridge Habitat Area of Particular Concern and Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary are two important existing MPAs of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, whose possible expansion is being considered. The predicted CLS hotspot indices suggest that expanding these MPAs or increasing harvest regulations within them would offer substantial protection to both the juveniles and spawners of many FSA-forming species of the grouper-snapper complex. Synthesis and applications. As the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) continues to increase worldwide, statistical modelling approaches making comprehensive use of available data are urgently needed to support resource managers' abilities to establish sound and efficient spatial protection plans. The outputs of our statistical models can serve as inputs to conservation planning software packages seeking optimal marine protected areas configurations or can be directly employed by resource managers for formulating spatial protection plans.

AB  - Climate change is currently considered one key threat to biodiversity. Species with a restricted distribution possibly will be more affected than those with wide ranges. Climate change can potentially affect both herbivores and their host plants and reduce their geographical ranges. The nature and intensity of their responses, however, may not necessarily match. We investigated the synergistic effects of climate change on two Neotropical butterfly species and their respective host plants at the end of twenty-first century. The species selected contrast in distribution extent, feeding habits and conservation status: Battus polystictus is widespread, oligophagous and common and Parides ascanius has a restricted distribution, is monophagous and is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN red list. Maps of the potential distribution of the butterflies and their host plants, as well as maps showing the changes in the ranges, in overlap area and direction of shifts were produced. Under forecasted climate change, all ranges and interaction areas decreased and the impacts were proportional to the intensity of change in future scenarios, either when compared all together or pairwise (p < 0.001). Based in our results estimation of climatically suitability, the monophagous butterfly with restricted distribution did suffer more severely these effects than the widespread generalist species. We did not anticipate, however, the possible strength of the predicted effects. Under the conditions modelled, P. ascanius would probably find no suitable conditions for occurrence, irrespectively of its host plant, and might go extinct. B. polystictus, on the other hand, suffered marked decreases in suitable area (46% for RCP4.5 and 91% for RCP8.5) and dramatic southward shifts (> 1439 km for RCP4.5 and > 1956 km for RCP8.5) on its range. This effect is further worsening because although most host plants are also much affected by the changes, the shift in their ranges is on average much smaller and each species responded in subtly different ways to the changing conditions, so that most of their future range may be spatially incompatible with the B. polystictus. We propose that the extinction risk of P. ascanius should be adjusted to critically endangered and point that species interactions and climate change must be accounted for in conservation planning. Implications for insect conservation The assessment carried out in this study contributes to the knowledge of climate change scenarios of butterfly species correlated with their host plants until the end of this century. These results can propose priority sites for conservation efforts like contribute to change status of P. ascanius to critically endangered, actually listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list.

AB  - A new predictive modelling technique called the fuzzy envelope model (FEM) is introduced. The technique can be used to predict potential distributions of organisms using presence-only locality records and a set of environmental predictor variables. FEM uses fuzzy logic to classify a set of predictor variable maps based on the values associated with presence records and combines the results to produce a potential distribution map for a target species. This technique represents several refinements of the envelope approach used in the BIOCLIM modelling package. These refinements are related to the way in which FEMs deal with uncertainty, the way in which this uncertainty is represented in the resultant potential distribution maps, and the way that these maps can be interpreted and applied. To illustrate its potential use in biogeographical studies, FEM was applied to predicting the potential distribution of three invasive alien plant species (Lantana camara L., Ricinus communis L. and Solanum mauritianum Scop.), and three native cicada species (Capicada decora Germar, Platypleura deusta Thun. and P. capensis L.) in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. These models were quantitatively compared with models produced by means of the algorithm used in the BIOCLIM modelling package, which is referred to as a crisp envelope model (the CEM design). The average performance of models of the FEM design was consistently higher than those of the CEM design. There were significant differences in model performance among species but there was no significant interaction between model design and species. The average maximum kappa value ranged from 0.70 to 0.90 for FEM design and from 0.57 to 0.89 for the CEM design, which can be described as 'good' to 'excellent' using published ranges of agreement for the kappa statistic. This technique can be used to predict species' potential distributions that could be used for identifying regions at risk from invasion by alien species. These predictions could also be used in conservation planning in the case of native species.

AB  - Aim The ongoing global change makes landscape planning and management of ecological corridors crucial to preserve biodiversity. We propose a workflow optimizing the use of different data sources to convert ecological niche models (ENMs) into landscape-focused species distribution models (SDMs), using these latter to compute ecological corridors. We infer corridors connecting present occurrence localities to future climatic refugia as well as to localities where extinct populations occurred. Also, a continuous connectivity change index is proposed to assess current-future differences. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our workflow to conservation, assessing the capability of established protected areas to preserve ecological corridors. Location Europe. Methods As case study to illustrate our framework, we use a database comprising occurrence localities of Vipera ursinii, one of the most endangered European reptiles. We obtain weighted SDMs for each of the four V. ursinii subspecies by coupling climate-based ENMs with standardized occurrence frequencies along land use and altitude gradients through weighted averaging in GIS. We calculate current and future landscape connectivity for each subspecies based on the corresponding weighted SDM. We compare predictive performance of "traditional" ENMs, including climate, land use and topography as predictors and weighted SDMs. Results Weighted SDMs outperform ENMs, according to Boyce index. SDMs are used to infer connectivity, predicted to decrease in all future scenarios for V. ursinii, and assess where connections may favour movements of individuals to, for example, future suitable areas. Generally, protected areas are predicted to cover low-connectivity territories. Main conclusions The proposed "couple-and-weigh" approach could represent a helpful tool to investigate biogeography, conservation and landscape planning topics, as it permits to capitalize on occurrence records and accessible environmental predictors by narrowing the target species' potential distribution, estimated within "traditional" ENMs, to the realized one through post-modelling GIS analyses, which in turn improves estimation of friction maps used to infer connectivity.

AB  - Existing marine bioregions covering the Pacific Ocean are conceptualised at spatial scales that are too broad for national marine spatial planning. Here, we developed the first combined oceanic and coastal marine bioregionalisation at national scales, delineating 262 deep-water and 103 reef-associated bioregions across the southwest Pacific. The deep-water bioregions were informed by thirty biophysical environmental variables. For reef-associated environments, records for 806 taxa at 7369 sites were used to predict the probability of observing taxa based on environmental variables. Both deep-water and reef-associated bioregions were defined with cluster analysis applied to the environmental variables and predicted species observation probabilities, respectively to classify areas with high taxonomic similarity. Local experts further refined the delineation of the bioregions at national scales for four countries. This work provides marine bioregions that enable the design of ecologically representative national systems of marine protected areas within offshore and inshore environments in the Pacific.

AB  - The decline in distribution and abundance of biodiversity requires evidence-based guidelines for cost-effective conservation management and systematic quantitative assessments of its effects. We investigated the efficiency of a habitat restoration programme aimed at reducing the risk of extinction of the Iolas blue Iolana iolas (Ochsenheimer, 1816), one of the rarest butterflies of Central Europe. Using occupancy and capture-mark-recapture (CMR) models accounting for probability of detection, we assessed habitat patch occupancy, habitat selection, demography and dispersal with the aim of testing and refining restoration measures. Count surveys performed at 38 plantations dedicated to the species' unique host plant resulted in an occupancy rate of 50 %, with mostly very low relative abundance indices. The site-occupancy habitat analysis demonstrated that species abundance was best explained by host plant vitality, habitat patch connectivity, and solar radiation. CMR surveys yielded very high catchability (82 %), individual detectability (86 %) rates and limited dispersal capacity. These results form the basis for future efficient count surveys to assess species distribution and abundance. They also provide evidence-based recommendations for improving ongoing habitat restoration: (i) the attractiveness of host plant plantations must be enhanced by promoting mass blossoming, which can be achieved through systematic autumn pruning of the extant plantations; (ii) new plantations should be created in order to fill in the gaps in the landscape matrix, to increase meta-population capacity through improved habitat connectivity. Finally, this study demonstrates the relevance of efficiency tests as an integral, adaptive phase of any conservation research activity.

AB  - Aim Cetaceans are inherently difficult to study due to their elusive, pelagic and often highly migratory nature. New Zealand waters are home to 50% of the world's cetacean species, but their spatial distributions are poorly known. Here, we model distributions of 30 cetacean taxa using an extensive at-sea sightings dataset (n > 14,000) and high-resolution (1 km(2)) environmental data layers.
   Location New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
   Methods Two models were used to predict probability of species occurrence based on available sightings records. For taxa with <50 sightings (n = 15), Relative Environmental Suitability (RES), and for taxa with >= 50 sightings (n = 15), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models were used. Independently collected presence/absence data were used for further model evaluation for a subset of taxa.
   Results RES models for rarely sighted species showed reasonable fits to available sightings and stranding data based on literature and expert knowledge on the species' autecology. BRT models showed high predictive power for commonly sighted species (AUC: 0.79-0.99). Important variables for predicting the occurrence of cetacean taxa were temperature residuals, bathymetry, distance to the 500 m isobath, mixed layer depth and water turbidity. Cetacean distribution patterns varied from highly localised, nearshore (e.g., Hector's dolphin), to more ubiquitous (e.g., common dolphin) to primarily offshore species (e.g., blue whale). Cetacean richness based on stacked species occurrence layers illustrated patterns of fewer inshore taxa with localised richness hotspots, and higher offshore richness especially in locales of the Macquarie Ridge, Bounty Trough and Chatham Rise.
   Main conclusions Predicted spatial distributions fill a major knowledge gap towards informing future assessments and conservation planning for cetaceans in New Zealand's extensive EEZ. While sightings datasets were not spatially comprehensive for any taxa, these two best available approaches allow for predictive modelling of both more common, and of rarely sighted, cetacean species with limited available information.

AB  - The Earth is undergoing an accelerated rate of native ecosystem conversion and degradation and there is increased interest in measuring and modelling biodiversity from space. Biogeographers have a long-standing interest in measuring patterns of species occurrence and distributional movements and an interest in modelling species distributions and patterns of diversity. Much progress has been made in identifying plant species from space using high-resolution satellites (QuickBird, IKONOS), while the measurement of species movements has become commonplace with the ARGOS satellite tracking system which has been used to track the movements of thousands of individual animals. There have been significant advances in land-cover classifications by combining data from multi-passive and active sensors, and new classification techniques. Species distribution modelling has been growing at a striking rate and the incorporation of spaceborne data on climate, topography, land cover, and vegetation structure has great potential to improve models. There have been significant advances in modelling species richness, alpha diversity, and beta diversity using multisensors to quantify land-cover classifications and landscape metrics, measures of productivity, and measures of heterogeneity. Remote sensing of nature reserves can provide natural resources managers with near real-time data within and around reserves that can be used to support conservation efforts anywhere in the world. Future research should focus on incorporating recent spaceborne sensors, more extensive integration of available spaceborne imagery, and the collection and dissemination of high-quality field data. This will improve our understanding of the distribution of life on earth.

AB  - Background Many research papers have utilized Species Distribution Models to estimate a species' current and future geographic distribution and environmental niche. This study aims to (a) understand critical features of SDMs used to model endemic and rare species and (b) to identify possible constraints with the collected data. The present systematic review examined how SDMs are used on endemic and rare plant species to identify optimal practices for future research. Results The evaluated literature (79 articles) was published between January 2010 and December 2020. The number of papers grew considerably over time. The studies were primarily conducted in Asia (41%), Europe (24%), and Africa (2%). The bulk of the research evaluated (38%) focused on theoretical ecology, climate change impacts (19%), and conservation policy and planning (22%). Most of the papers were published in publications devoted to biodiversity conservation, ecological or multidisciplinary fields. The degree of uncertainty was not disclosed in most studies (81%). Conclusion This systematic review provides a broad overview of the emerging trends and gaps in the SDMs research. The majority of studies failed to present uncertainties and error estimates. However, when model performance estimates are given, the model results will be highly effective, allowing for more assurance in the predictions they make. Furthermore, based on our systematic review, we recommend that in the future rare and endemic SDMs should represent uncertainty levels and estimates of errors in the modelling process.

AB  - Estuaries are socio-ecological systems that can be represented as a holistic combination of biotic and abiotic conditions in spatially explicit units defined by: (i) the ecotope, as the integration of the physiotope (abiotic-homogeneous units) and the biotope (biotic-homogeneous units), and (ii) the anthrotope, synthesizing data on human drivers of ecological change. Nested physiotopes were identified in an estuary using a hierarchical approach that integrates information about eight abiotic, and biologically meaningful, variables. The biotope of Zostera noltei was delimited using a potential distribution model of species and overlapped with the physiotope map to characterize the ecotopes. The anthrotope was estimated as the cumulative impacts of anthropic activities over the ecotopes. The diversity of Z. noltei ecotopes was compared with the anthrotope map to estimate the potential impacts of human pressures on this species. The hierarchical methodology and resulting maps provide flexible and interdisciplinary tools for conservation, management, education and research.

AB  - Aim To analyze impacts of habitat loss on evolutionary diversity and to test widely used biodiversity metrics as surrogates for phylogenetic diversity, we study spatial and taxonomic patterns of phylogenetic diversity in a wide-ranging endemic Neotropical snake lineage.
   Location South America and the Antilles.
   Methods We updated distribution maps for 41 taxa, using species distribution models and a revised presence-records database. We estimated evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) for each taxon using recent molecular and morphological phylogenies and weighted these values with two measures of extinction risk: percentages of habitat loss and IUCN threat status. We mapped phylogenetic diversity and richness levels and compared phylogenetic distances in pitviper subsets selected via endemism, richness, threat, habitat loss, biome type and the presence in biodiversity hotspots to values obtained in randomized assemblages.
   Results Evolutionary distinctiveness differed according to the phylogeny used, and conservation assessment ranks varied according to the chosen proxy of extinction risk. Two of the three main areas of high phylogenetic diversity were coincident with areas of high species richness. A third area was identified only by one phylogeny and was not a richness hotspot. Faunal assemblages identified by level of endemism, habitat loss, biome type or the presence in biodiversity hotspots captured phylogenetic diversity levels no better than random assemblages. Pitvipers found in the richest areas or included in the IUCN Red List showed significant phylogenetic clustering.
   Main conclusions Usual biodiversity metrics were unable to adequately represent spatial patterns of evolutionary diversity in pitvipers. Current Red List status fails to properly represent evolutionary distinctiveness in the group. Phylogenetic diversity is unevenly distributed even within biodiversity hotspots, and species-poor areas may harbour high phylogenetic diversity. This reinforces the need for targeted and spatially accurate approaches for adequately representing evolutionary processes in conservation planning.

AB  - The loss of habitat and biodiversity worldwide has led to considerable resources being spent for conservation purposes on actions such as the acquisition and management of land, the rehabilitation of degraded habitats, and the purchase of easements from private landowners. Prioritising these actions is challenging due to the complexity of the problem and because there can be multiple actors undertaking conservation actions, often with divergent or partially overlapping objectives. We use a modelling framework to explore this issue with a study involving two agents sequentially purchasing land for conservation. We apply our model to simulated data using distributions taken from real data to simulate the cost of patches and the rarity and co-occurence of species.
   In our model each agent attempted to implement a conservation network that met its target for the minimum cost using the conservation planning software Marxan. We examine three scenarios where the conservation targets of the agents differ. The first scenario (called NGO-NGO) models the situation where two NGOs are both are targeting different sets of threatened species. The second and third scenarios (called NGO-Gov and Gov-NGO, respectively) represent a case where a government agency attempts to implement a complementary conservation network representing all species, while an NGO is focused on achieving additional protection for the most endangered species.
   For each of these scenarios we examined three types of interactions between agents: i) acting in isolation where the agents are attempting to achieve their targets solely though their own actions ii) sharing information where each agent is aware of the species representation achieved within the other agent's conservation network and, iii) pooling resources where agents combine their resources and undertake conservation actions as a single entity. The latter two interactions represent different types of collaborations and in each scenario we determine the cost savings from sharing information or pooling resources. In each case we examined the utility of these interactions from the viewpoint of the combined conservation network resulting from both agents' actions, as well as from each agent's individual perspective.
   The costs for each agent to achieve their objectives varied depending on the order in which the agents acted, the type of interaction between agents, and the specific goals of each agent. There were significant cost savings from increased collaboration via sharing information in the NGO-NGO scenario were the agent's representation goals were mutually exclusive (in terms of specie targeted). In the NGO-Gov and Gov-NGO scenarios, collaboration generated much smaller savings. If the two agents collaborate by pooling resources there are multiple ways the total cost could be shared between both agents. For each scenario we investigate the costs and benefits for all possible cost sharing proportions. We find that there are a range of cost sharing proportions where both agents can benefit in the NGO-NGO scenarios while the NGO-Gov and Gov-NGO scenarios again showed little benefit.
   Although the model presented here has a range of simplifying assumptions, it demonstrates that the value of collaboration can vary significantly in different situations. In most cases, collaborating would have associated costs and these costs need to be weighed against the potential benefits from collaboration. The model demonstrates a method for determining the range of collaboration costs that would result in collaboration providing an efficient use of scarce conservation resources

AB  - Aim Seagrass beds are declining globally and are increasingly vulnerable to sea level rise (SLR), which could have consequences for the rich biodiversity they support. Spatial variation in the role of seagrass beds in enhancing biodiversity is poorly resolved, limiting our ability to set priorities for conservation and restoration. We aimed to model the biodiversity enhancement value of seagrass beds. Location Florida Gulf Coast, USA. Methods We used generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to describe the distribution, total cover and species composition of seagrass beds and to estimate their effects on spatial patterns of faunal species richness under three scenarios. Specifically, we: (a) quantified the biodiversity enhancement value of current seagrass beds, (b) inferred the biodiversity value of potential restoration areas and (c) projected potential changes in the distribution and biodiversity enhancement value of seagrass beds due to SLR using low (+0.50 m) and high (+1.0 m) SLR forecasts for 2100. Results Current seagrass beds supported 43%-64% more species than unvegetated habitats, even when accounting for spatial variability in predicted faunal richness due to other environmental, seascape, temporal and geographic factors. Seagrass restoration in potential habitats would also increase biodiversity in the near-term (i.e., 43%-45% above unvegetated levels). However, model projections indicate that SLR could result in significant losses of current seagrass beds and potential restoration areas, causing contracted distributions and lower seagrass cover. Overall, these changes could result in significant reductions in the enhancement value provided by seagrasses. Although, there could also be many suitable locations for seagrasses by 2100, with some having either comparable or potentially increased enhancement value. Main conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of considering spatial variation in biodiversity benefits when planning for seagrass conservation and restoration and when managing the impacts of SLR.

AB  - Characterizing zone fragility is a significant challenge when managing natural areas, but it must be prioritized in conservation efforts. The most commonly employed methodology is to rely on criteria established by experts, which can introduce subjectivity. However, more objective approaches should be used when developing conservation plans. This study follows one methodology focusing on classifying zone vulnerability within a protected natural area, taking as a study case a temporal pond network located in SW Spain; threatened aquatic plants were used as a bioindicators. Spatial data were analyzed using geographic information systems (GIS), and potentially vulnerable zones were identified using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and, more specifically, the weighted overlay method. Criteria weights were determined by variables contribution obtained through species distribution models (SDM), via the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). The purpose was to avoid artificial bias in decision-making. The analysis indicated that 42.04% of the study area was highly vulnerable. In contrast, only the 14.34% of the study area was at very low risk, meaning it can help maintain pond network biodiversity. These results indicate that potentially vulnerable and crucial zones can be identified using GIS, facilitating the establishment of conservation priorities in a complex system. This methodology could be useful for prioritizing and implementing management and conservation efforts focused on unique species and habitats in protected natural areas.

AB  - In this work, we report the predicted distribution of the threatened fluminense swallowtail butterfly, Parides ascanius (Cramer 1775), and correlate it to the presence of urban and protected areas within its range. The distribution was modeled using a genetic algorithm. The predicted distribution of the fluminense swallowtail shows high agreement within Rio de Janeiro state, in a near-continuous strip of 2,038,253 ha along the coastal lowlands, 17.8 percent of which is within urban areas. Only 8.7 percent (178,187 ha) of the remaining (nonurban) predicted model overlapped at least partially with protected areas (19 in all). Almost half of these protected areas also overlapped with urban areas, resulting in an additional loss of 58,751 ha. In seven of 19 protected areas, the distribution of P. ascanius was predicted by less than 50 percent of the models; five of the remaining protected areas are less restrictive reserves. Despite the wide distribution predicted by the models, only two of the observed occurrence points matched the predicted distribution within protected areas. Modeling threatened species distribution is a useful tool for highlighting gaps in networks of protected areas and should aid in planning to fill these gaps. However, in several developing countries with high biodiversity, there is insufficient basic biological information for many threatened species. In these cases, prospecting field studies are urgently needed.

AB  - The stacking of species-distribution models (S-SDMs) is receiving attention by conservation researchers because this approach is capable of simultaneously predicting species richness and composition. However, the steps required to build S-SDMs implies at least two choices that influence its predictive performance which have not been extensively assessed: the selection of the modelling algorithm and the application of a threshold to transform the species-distribution models into binary maps to be added together to build the final S-SDM. Our goal was to provide guidelines concerning the best combinations of modelling algorithms and thresholds with which to build more accurate S-SDMs. We generated 380 S-SDMs of 1224 tree species in Mesoamerica by combining 19 distribution modelling methods with 20 different thresholds using presence-only data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. We compared the predicted richness and composition with inventory data obtained from the BIOTREE-NET forest plot database. We designed two indicators of predictive performance that were based on the diversity factors used to measure species turnover: a (shared species between the observed and predicted compositions), b and c (the exclusive species of the predicted and observed compositions respectively) and compared them with the Sorensen and Beta-Simpson turnover measures. Our proposed indexes and the Sorensen index proved suitable as indicators of predictive performance for S-SDMs, whereas the Beta-Simpson turnover measure presented issues that would prevent its application to evaluate S-SDMs. Some modelling methods especially machine learning and ensemble model forecasting methods performed significantly better than others in minimizing the error in predicted richness and composition. Our results also points out that restrictive thresholds (with high omission errors) lead to more accurate S-SDMs in terms of species richness and composition. Here, we demonstrate that particular combinations of modelling methods and thresholds provide results with higher predictive performance. These results provide clear modelling guidelines that will help S-SDM modellers to select the appropriate combination of modelling methods and thresholds to build more accurate S-SDMs, and therefore will have a positive impact on the quality of the diversity models used to assist conservation planning.

AB  - Context Climate change is an important driver of habitat contraction and the loss of biodiversity. Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to assess the impacts of climate change and to identify priority conservation areas. Conservation assessment of endemic keystone species can foster the conservation of forest ecosystems. Objectives The objectives of this study are: (1) to evaluate the potential impacts of future climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) on the extents of the habitat of eight endemic montane conifer species under dispersal scenarios (full and limited) and (2) to estimate the percentage loss in the area of occupancy (AOO) of the target species based on projected habitat suitability in order to assess their extinction risks and identify priority conservation areas. Methods Southwestern China is a global hotspot of conifer diversity and endemism. We used three ensemble-SDMs along with the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List criteria to evaluate the impacts of climate change. Results Abies fabri, Abies fargesii var. faxoniana, Abies recurvata var. ernestii, and Picea neoveitchii are predicted to lose more than 90% of their AOOs under both the climate and dispersal scenarios. All of these species are predicted to become extinct or critically endangered except for Picea retroflexa and Abies squamata. It should be noted that while the changes in the AOOs changes were filtered for the current unsuitable man-made areas these predictions do not account for future land use changes. Conclusions Stable and suitable habitats are promising tools for in-situ conservation planning. Moreover, future conservation actions should give full consideration to the pattern of climate and land use.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a powerful tool for conserving marine biodiversity when designed using ecological information and conservation goals and targets. Dugongs (Dugong dugon) were not an explicit target in the design of the network of MPAs in New Caledonia, despite being one of the region's World Heritage values. Our study retrospectively assessed the capacity of the New Caledonia MPA network to protect dugongs from anthropogenic threats. We developed a spatially explicit model of dugong distribution and relative density based on information collected from 10 years of aerial surveys. We quantified the amount of overlap between areas supporting high densities of dugongs and MPAs. We found that most of the important dugong habitats of New Caledonia had a low coverage of MPAs that provide high levels of restriction on anthropogenic activities. We identified several important dugong habitats along the west and the north-east coast that were not covered by MPAs and should be a priority for future management. The spatial mismatch between MPAs and dugongs was likely caused by weaknesses in the planning process, including the: (1) lack of explicit conservation goals and targets; (2) omission of spatial information on species' distribution; (3) mismatch of spatial scales; (4) cost considerations; and (5) incorrect application of the IUCN protected area categories. We provide guidance on how these shortcomings can be avoided for marine species of conservation concern in New Caledonia and other regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examine the logic of designing nature reserves to understand better how to integrate the concepts of representativeness and persistence. Simple models of viability are used to evaluate how the expected number of species in the reserve system changes with variation in the risk of extinction among species, their rate of occurrence, and the distribution of species. The optimal size of individual reserves increased with the mean and variance of the probability of extinction among species and with the rate at which the risk of extinction declines with the cost of each reserve. In contrast, the rate of occurrence of species within reserves and their rate of accumulation with increasing reserve area had a relatively minor influence on the optimal size of reserves. Patterns of endemism were most important for the location of reserves. Including differences among species in the analysis reduced the optimal number of individual reserves (and increased the size of each) when operating under a fixed budget compared with reserve designs based on single species. A case study in the city of Melbourne, Australia, demonstrates the conservation value of small (similar to 1 ha) grassland reserves and the underrepresentation of Melbourne's volcanic plains in the region's conservation network.

AB  - Landscape change affects the distribution of wildlife and represents a conservation concern, especially in Asia, which is experiencing rapid development. We examined the impacts of landscape change on corsac foxes in Mongolia. We addressed 2 questions: 1) how do common features of a landscape, such as habitats, topography, and human structures, shape the distribution of the species? and 2) how will the loss of those features affect distribution? We developed an occupancy model based on locations (n = 2,437) collected in Ikh Nart Nature Reserve, then estimated the marginal loss in average occupancy across the landscape when features were removed. The model with the most support indicated that occupancy was best described by the additive combination of open plain, tall grassland, and shrubland habitats. Average occupancy across the reserve was 22% under current conditions. Simulations involving the removal of each habitat resulted in a marginal loss of 12%, 35%, and 49% in average occupancy, respectively. The loss of all 3 habitats, as expected under climate change projections, will probably make the landscape unsuitable. The results provide the first model of corsac fox occupancy, which can be used to examine distribution and impacts of change in other parts of the species' range. They also suggest that managers should plan conservation activities to allow corsac fox distribution to shift northward as the region becomes warmer and drier and vegetation communities change.

AB  - Management reference for nature reserve networks based on MaxEnt modeling and gap analysis: a case study of the brown-eared pheasant in China.-Nature reserve designs and networks are important for wildlife and habitat conservation. Gap analyses are efficient and reliable tools for prioritizing habitat conservation efforts, especially when considering endangered species. We propose a conservation plan for the brown-eared pheasant, Crossoptilon mantchuricum, by identifying protection gap areas based on 14 existing nature reserves. A total of 45 locality sites and 11 environmental variables were selected according to the characteristics of habitat use of the brown-eared pheasant and applied to a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to obtain the species distribution. The MaxEnt model results showed a high prediction accuracy. The gap analysis results revealed that the Luliang Mountains in Shanxi and the Xiaowutai Mountains in Hebei had protection gaps. We found 458 km(2) of optimum habitat and 1,390 km(2) of moderately suitable habitat within the national nature reserve range. However, almost 1,861 km2 of the optimum habitat and 17,035 km2 of the moderately suitable habitat were unprotected, equivalent to 9.0% and 82.1%, respectively, of the total suitable habitat. Most of the unprotected area comprised moderately suitable habitat for brown-eared pheasant and should be prioritized in future conservation efforts. There are nine nature reserves along a north-to-south range in the Luliang Mountains that form a wildlife habitat corridor. To maintain the integrity, originality, and continuity of these habitats and thus protect brown-eared pheasants, local conservation departments should be strengthened to improve provincial nature reserve management and successfully carry out conservation efforts.

AB  - Biological survey has been an integral component of conservation planning in Western Australia for > 30 years, providing baseline data for reserve selection and the management of biodiversity at the genetic, species and community levels. Flora surveys are particularly important, given the diverse and poorly documented nature of the state's vascular flora. Surveys have been conducted at the following four scales: regional, subregional, local and individual species. At all scales, flora surveys have provided detail on individual taxon distribution, have identified previously unknown or unrecognised taxa, have located presumed extinct taxa and have substantially contributed to information on the distribution of threatened flora. Regional-scale surveys normally involve multidisciplinary teams studying a broad selection of the biota. These combined plot-based data are used to develop a 'classify-then-model' approach to assessment of comprehensiveness, adequacy and representativeness of the regional conservation reserve system. These regional models describe the broad-scale patterning of common taxa but their utility in reflecting patterns in naturally rare or highly restricted taxa is uncertain. Results from recent surveys show poor correlations between floristic patterning and other components of the biota.

AB  - Knowledge about the spatial distribution of seabirds at sea is important for conservation. During marine conservation planning, logistical constraints preclude seabird surveys covering the complete area of interest and spatial distribution of seabirds is frequently inferred from predictive statistical models. Increasingly complex models are available to relate the distribution and abundance of pelagic seabirds to environmental variables, but a comparison of their usefulness for delineating protected areas for seabirds is lacking. Here we compare the performance of five modelling techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, Random Forest, boosted regression trees, and maximum entropy) to predict the distribution of Balearic Shearwaters (Puffinus mauretanicus) along the coast of the western Iberian Peninsula. We used ship transect data from 2004 to 2009 and 13 environmental variables to predict occurrence and density, and evaluated predictive performance of all models using spatially segregated test data. Predicted distribution varied among the different models, although predictive performance varied little. An ensemble prediction that combined results from all five techniques was robust and confirmed the existence of marine important bird areas for Balearic Shearwaters in Portugal and Spain. Our predictions suggested additional areas that would be of high priority for conservation and could be proposed as protected areas. Abundance data were extremely difficult to predict, and none of five modelling techniques provided a reliable prediction of spatial patterns. We advocate the use of ensemble modelling that combines the output of several methods to predict the spatial distribution of seabirds, and use these predictions to target separate surveys assessing the abundance of seabirds in areas of regular use.

AB  - Identifying declining species is essential for conservation planning. This research assessed abundance and distribution changes of 207 plant species in north-central North America and evaluated the importance of a suite of functional characteristics in predicting their persistence over 115 years (1895-2009). Functional characteristics included native versus introduced origin, pollination syndrome, symbiosis and habitat requirements, and phenological responsiveness to temperature change. Plant specimens from Ohio State University's Herbarium were used to assess abundance and distribution changes. The partial Solow equation and the sighting rate model were used to calculate the average probability that a species had declined over the study interval. Rarefaction analysis was used to calculate the percent change in distribution as measured by county occurrences from historic (1895-1970) to modern (1971-2009) time periods. Twenty-seven percent of the 207 species decreased in abundance from 1895 to 2009 and 68 % showed distribution contraction. Native species were seven times more likely to decline in abundance and showed a two-fold greater distribution contraction compared to introduced species. Introduced species that strongly advanced flowering with warming showed greater distribution expansion than those with weak phenological responsiveness. Species that require a symbiont for growth or development were twice as likely to decrease in abundance as those without symbiont requirements. This analysis indicates non-random patterns of threat to species diversity among plant functional groups. With climate warming, highly responsive introduced species may become more widespread. Thus, climate warming may exacerbate the already substantial impacts of land-use change, symbiont loss, and non-native species invasion on species persistence.

AB  - An important metric for many aspects of species conservation planning and risk assessment is an estimate of total population size. For landbirds breeding in North America, Partners in Flight (PIF) generates global, continental, and regional population size estimates. These estimates are an important component of the PIF species assessment process, but have also been used by others for a range of applications. The PIF population size estimates are primarily calculated using a formula designed to extrapolate bird counts recorded by the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to regional population estimates. The extrapolation formula includes multiple assumptions and sources of uncertainty, but there were previously no attempts to quantify this uncertainty in the published population size estimates aside from a categorical data quality score. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we propagated the main sources of uncertainty arising from individual components of the model through to the final estimation of landbird population sizes. This approach results in distributions of population size estimates rather than point estimates. We found the width of uncertainty of population size estimates to be generally narrower than the order-of-magnitude distances between the population size score categories PIF uses in the species assessment process, suggesting confidence in the categorical ranking used by PIF. Our approach provides a means to identify species whose uncertainty bounds span more than one categorical rank, which was not previously possible with the data quality scores. Although there is still room for additional improvements to the estimation of avian population sizes and uncertainty, particularly with respect to replacing categorical model components with empirical estimates, our estimates of population size distributions have broader utility to a range of conservation planning and risk assessment activities relying on avian population size estimates.

AB  - Habitat evaluation constitutes an important and fundamental step in the management of wildlife populations and conservation strategy planning. The buff-throated partridge (Tetraophasis szechenyii) is a medium-sized Galliform species with national conservation priority endemic to the high mountains of western China, yet its habitat status across its distribution range has not been studied. We predicted current potential suitable habitats for the buff-throated partridge in China with 155 presence points collected between 2005 and 2019, using MaxEnt modeling. The predicted habitat of the buff-throated partridge covered an area of 191,259 km(2), with highly suitable habitat concentrated in Shaluli and Daxueshan Mountains, with marginal habitat patches of lower suitability scattered over Mangkang, Yunling, Nushan and Nyainqe<^>ntanglha Mountains. The most suitable habitat for buff-throated partridge was associated with environmental variables isothermality (similar to 45), moderate annual rainfall (678 mm), lower human population density (<30 people/ km(2)), and steep slope at an elevation of 4000 m a.s.l. Our study suggested that although the area of buff-throated partridge habitat was large, its highly suitable habitat was restricted and fragmented due to the natural barriers of major rivers and increased human disturbance. Therefore, the status of buff-throated partridge habitat was not promising, and we proposed three recommendations for conservation strategy being 1) highest conservation priorities for the species being protection of its core distribution and habitat ranging from southwestern Sichuan to northern Yunnan, especially several national nature reserves in these regions; 2) design corridors to facilitate population communication and genetic diversity; 3) restrictions on human disturbance such as free-ranging yak grazing in buff-throated partridge habitat.

AB  - AimDetailed knowledge of species distributions, endemism patterns and threats is critical to site prioritization and conservation planning. However, data from biodiversity inventories are still limited, especially for tropical forests, and even well recognized hotspots remain understudied. We provide an example of how updated knowledge on species occurrence from strategically directed biodiversity surveys can change knowledge on perceived biodiversity importance, and facilitate understanding diversity patterns and the delivery of conservation recommendations.
   LocationEastern Arc Mountains (EAM), Kenya and Tanzania.
   MethodsWe surveyed amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals during 2005-2009, targeting mountain blocks that had been poorly surveyed or unsurveyed by the early Noughties. We combined new and old data to produce a database of species presence by mountain block spanning four decades of research. Species richness is regressed against survey effort, funding, ecological and human disturbance factors to analyse the best predictors of vertebrate richness across mountain blocks. Similarity among species assemblages among blocks is analysed using dissimilarity analysis.
   ResultsNew surveys raised the number of endemic and regional endemic vertebrates by 24% (from 170 to 211 species), including 27 new species of which 23 are amphibians and reptiles. Vertebrate richness is best explained by forest area, but rainfall is also important, especially for amphibians and reptiles. Forest elevational range is important for mammals and for block-endemic birds. Funding explains 19% of the variation in total species richness, while survey effort generally explains <10% of variance. Cluster analysis shows that species assemblages are partitioned by geographical proximity among mountain blocks.
   Main conclusionsThe biological value of the EAM has been underestimated, and strategic surveys are important even in well-recognized hotspots. The exceptional and global importance of these mountains for endemic vertebrates is highlighted, supporting the development of a network of Nature Reserves and the proposed inclusion within UNESCO's natural World Heritage Sites.

AB  - Flagship species have been used widely as umbrella species (i.e., species with large home range whose protection often provides protection for sympatric species) in the management of China's nature reserves. This conflation of flagship and umbrella species is best represented by the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and other large, endangered mammals designated as conservation targets in site selection and planning of reserves. Few empirical studies have tested the effectiveness of flagship species as surrogates for a broader range of sympatric species. Using extensive camera-trap data, we examined the effectiveness of management zones designated to protect flagship (target) species in conserving sympatric species in 4 wildlife reserves (Gutianshan, Changqing, Laohegou, and Wolong). We tested whether the progression from peripheral to core zones was associated with an increasing habitat association for both target and sympatric species. The distribution patterns of the study species across the zones in each reserve indicated a disparity between management zones and the species' habitat requirements. Management zone was included in the final model for all target species, and most of them had higher occurrence in core zones relative to less-protected zones, but zone was not a predictor for most of the sympatric species. When management zone was associated with the occurrence of sympatric species, threatened species generally had higher detections in core zones, whereas common species had higher detections outside of the core zone. Our results suggested that reserve planning based on flagship species does not adequately protect sympatric species due to their specialized habitat requirements. We recommend re-examining the effectiveness of management zoning and urge a multispecies and reserve-wide monitoring plan to improve protection of China's wildlife.

AB  - Prediction error is considered an important problem in species distribution models. To address this issue, we here examined the accuracy of overlays of presence-only-based models for many individual species in representing patterns of assemblage diversity. For this purpose, we used a database of 977 160 records of seed plant occurrences on an intensively surveyed, species-rich island (Tenerife, Canary Islands) for modelling the distribution of all its 841 native plant species individually. The modelling was done using Maxent, one of the best-performing presence-only modelling techniques, using various thresholds to convert the estimated suitability values into predicted presence or absence. Distribution models for each individual species were overlaid to predict species richness and composition, which were then compared to the observed values for well-surveyed grid cells. We found high levels of compositional error, when the best performing suitability threshold for predicting species richness was applied. Our best prediction had a mean species richness error of 24% and a mean compositional error of 60% relative to the observed values for the well-surveyed cells; > 50% of all species were included erroneously in > 25% of the well-surveyed cells. Hence, large quantities of data are not necessarily enough to obtain reliable predictions of assemblage diversity, limiting the usefulness of this methodology in conservation planning.

AB  - Endangered species conservation planning needs to consider the effects of future climate change. Species distribution models are commonly used to predict future shifts in habitat suitability. We evaluated the effects of climate change on the highly endangered mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) using a variety of modeling approaches, and assessing model outputs from the perspective of three spatial habitat management strategies: status quo, expansion and relocation. We show that alternative assumptions about the ecological niche of mountain gorillas can have a very large effect on model predictions. ` Standard' correlative models using 18 climatic predictor variables suggested that by 2090 there would be no suitable habitat left for the mountain gorilla in its existing parks, whereas a `limiting-factor' model, that uses a proxy of primary productivity, suggested that climate suitability would not change much. Species distribution models based on fewer predictor variables, on alternative assumptions about niche conservatism (including or excluding the other subspecies Gorilla beringii graueri), and a model based on gorilla behavior, had intermediate predictions. These alternative models show strong variation, and, in contrast to the standard approach with 18 variables, suggest that mountain gorilla habitat in the parks may remain suitable, that protected areas could be expanded into lower (warmer) areas, and that there might be climactically suitable habitat in other places where new populations could possibly be established. Differences among model predictions point to avenues for model improvement and further research. Similarities among model predictions point to possible areas for climate change adaptation management. For species with narrow distributions, such as the mountain gorilla, modeling the impact of climate change should be based on careful evaluation of their biology, particularly of the factors that currently appear to limit their distribution, and should avoid the naive application of standard correlative methods with many predictor variables.

AB  - The planned construction of 38 hydropower dams will impact the fish species inhabiting freshwater ecosystems in the megadiverse African country of Gabon. Many of Gabon's most culturally and economically important fish species are marine-associated, moving between fresh and salt or brackish waters. However, we know little about their life histories or movement patterns, which makes it difficult to predict the impacts of dam development on biodiversity and fisheries in Gabon. Here, we apply MaxEnt distribution modeling to predict the distribution of marine-associated fishes in Gabon's freshwaters. The model predicts a high likelihood of these fishes occurring in every coastal watershed, throughout the undammed Nyanga drainage, and extending similar to 400 km into the Ogooue River and its tributaries Ngounie and Abanga. If all 38 dams are constructed, marine-associated fishes will lose approximately 17% of riverine habitats (7400 km) including 7% of the best quality habitat (460 km). Proposed dams pose a substantial threat to Gabon's most culturally and economically important fishes.

AB  - Introduction: Huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus Molina) is the most threatened flag species of Southern Patagonia, where conservation efforts were not effective to avoid the retraction of its distribution area. Habitat quality modeling can assist to design better management strategies for regional conservation planning. The objective was to elaborate one habitat suitability map for huemul, defining the environmental characteristics at landscape level, and determining the distribution of the suitable habitat inside the current natural reserve network.
   Methods: We used a database of 453 records and explored 40 potential explanatory variables (climate, topographic, and landscape variables including human-related ones) to develop one habitat suitability map using the Environmental Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) for Santa Cruz province (Argentina). We combined the outputs in a GIS project using different shapes, including the current natural reserve network.
   Results: We defined the potential habitat for huemul, where forest edges and ecotone zones (e.g., mainly alpine environments) were the most important environmental variables, as well as some forest types (e.g., Nothofagus pumilio). Habitat losses were found in the extreme potential distribution areas (northern and southern areas), probably related to the increasing ranch activities. The current natural reserve network maintains approximately half of the huemul potential habitat in Santa Cruz province, where National Parks presented the similar conservation importance than the Provincial natural reserves.
   Conclusions: Habitat suitability model for huemul can be used as a decision support system for new management strategies at different landscape levels to improve the current conservation efforts.

AB  - Marine predators attract significant attention in ocean conservation planning and are therefore often used politically to promote reserve designation. We discuss whether their ecology and life history can help provide a rigorous ecological foundation for marine reserve design. In general, we find that reserves can benefit marine megafauna, and that megafauna can help establish target areas and boundaries for ecosystem reserves. However, the spatial nature of the interplay between potential threats and predator life histories requires careful consideration for the establishment of effective reserves. Modeling tools such as demographic sensitivity analysis will aid in establishing protection for different life stages and distributional ranges. The need for pelagic marine reserves is becoming increasingly apparent, and it is in this venue that marine predators maybe most effectively used as indicator species of underlying prey distribution and ecosystem processes.

AB  - Species distribution models are widely used in conservation planning, but obtaining the necessary occurrence data can be challenging, particularly for rare species. In these cases, citizen science may provide insight into species distributions. To understand the distribution of the newly described and Critically Endangered Amazona lilacina, we collated species observations and reliable eBird records from 2010-2020. We combined these with environmental predictors and either randomly generated background points or absence points generated from eBird checklists, to build distribution models using MaxEnt. We also conducted interviews with people local to the species' range to gather community-sourced occurrence data. We grouped these data according to perceived expertise of the observer, based on the ability to identify A. lilacina and its distinguishing features, knowledge of its ecology, overall awareness of parrot biodiversity, and the observation type. We evaluated all models using AUC and Tjur R-2. Field data models built using background points performed better than those using eBird absence points (AUC = 0.80 +/- 0.02, Tjur R-2 = 0.46 +/- 0.01 compared to AUC = 0.78 +/- 0.03, Tjur R-2 = 0.43 +/- 0.21). The best performing community data model used presence records from people who were able recognise a photograph of A. lilacina and correctly describe its distinguishing physical or behavioural characteristics (AUC = 0.84 +/- 0.05, Tjur R-2 = 0.51 +/- 0.01). There was up to 92% overlap between the field data and community data models, which when combined, predicted 17,772 km(2) of suitable habitat. Use of community knowledge offers a cost-efficient method to obtain data for species distribution modelling; we offer recommendations on how to assess its performance and present a final map of potential distribution for A. lilacina.

AB  - Aim Mapping species distributions is a crucial but challenging requirement of wildlife management. The frequent need to sample vast expanses of potential habitat increases the cost of planned surveys and rewards accumulation of opportunistic observations. In this paper, we integrate planned-survey data from roost counts with opportunistic samples from eBird, WikiAves and Xeno-canto citizen-science platforms to map the geographic range of the endangered Vinaceous-breasted Parrot. We demonstrate the estimation and mapping of species occurrence based on data integration while accounting for specifics of each dataset, including observation technique and uncertainty about the observations. Location Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. Methods Our analysis illustrates (a) the incorporation of sampling effort, spatial autocorrelation and site covariates in a joint-likelihood, hierarchical, data integration model; (b) the evaluation of the contribution of each dataset, as well as the contribution of effort covariates, spatial autocorrelation and site covariates to the predictive ability of fitted models using a cross-validation approach; and (c) how spatial representation of the latent occupancy state (i.e. realized occupancy) helps identify areas with high uncertainty that should be prioritized in future fieldwork. Results We estimate a Vinaceous-breasted Parrot geographic range of 434,670 km(2), which is three times larger than the "Extant" area previously reported in the IUCN Red List. The exclusion of one dataset at a time from the analyses always resulted in worse predictions by the models of truncated data than by the Full Model, which included all datasets. Likewise, exclusion of spatial autocorrelation, site covariates or sampling effort resulted in worse predictions. Main conclusions The integration of different datasets into one joint-likelihood model produced a more reliable representation of the species range than any individual dataset taken on its own, improving the use of citizen-science data in combination with planned-survey results.

AB  - The short-tailed weasel (Mustela erminea) is a Holarctic boreo-montane species that has one of the largest natural geographic ranges of any mammal. At its southern range limits in arid western North America, the species is rare, and factors associated with its distribution are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the availability of voles (Microtus) as prey was a key limiting factor for the distribution of the species. Consequently, we predicted that important variables associated with the occurrence of short-tailed weasels included snow cover and riparian habitat, both of which are linked to abundant vole populations in this region. We tested these predictions in New Mexico using ecological niche models developed with a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) and based on bioclimatic and biophysical variables. Consistent with our predictions, distribution of the short-tailed weasel was primarily determined by high winter snowfall and proximity to perennial streams. Descriptive habitat data associated with specimen records supported a close association of short-tailed weasels with riparian zones, especially those characterized by the presence of sedges and ponds made by the American beaver (Castor canadensis). We conclude that the short-tailed weasel is facing conservation threats in this region due to a fragmented distribution, degradation of riparian habitats, altered small mammal prey communities, and climate change. We recommend that the short-tailed weasel be considered in conservation planning in this region and that management focus on means to enhance riparian habitat and curtailing dangers posed by climate warming.

AB  - Aim To identify priority areas for in situ conservation and collection of germplasm for ex situ backup of crop wild relative (CWR) diversity in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region as part of an action plan for the conservation and use of the region's important CWR diversity. Location SADC region. Methods Diversity, gap and climate change analyses at species and ecogeographic diversity levels were undertaken for 113 regional priority CWR taxa. Results CWR hotspots were identified in Eswatini (former Swaziland), Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Twenty-one per cent of regionally priority CWR occur exclusively outside existing protected areas (PAs), 50% are not conserved ex situ, and 64% are predicted to be negatively impacted by climate change. A total of 120 existing PAs in 13 countries were identified as containing populations likely to persist in the future for 80% of CWR taxa and about 50% of the ecogeographic diversity of these taxa; remaining diversity can be conserved in an additional 151 complementary sites in 11 countries. Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, South Africa and Tanzania contain important areas for conserving CWR diversity in situ in which no negative climate change impact is predicted. Priority CWR diversity in the provinces of Bas-Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Cabinda (Angola) is threatened by climate change and should be collected urgently for ex situ conservation. Other areas rich in ecogeographic diversity that is not conserved ex situ are located in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Main conclusions We identified 120 PAs and 151 complementary sites outside of PAs in 13 SADC countries that could form the basis of the SADC Network for In Situ Conservation of CWR. We also selected priority areas for filling gaps in ex situ collections and for field survey.

AB  - Due to unsustainable harvesting and land use changes, two medicinally valuable, endangered liana species Coscinium fenestratum and Embelia ribes face severe threat in the wild. Climate change could also have profound impact on the distribution of these species which could result in contraction and/or expansion in geographical range of these species. Coscinium fenestratum and E. ribes are medicinally important species used for treating multiple ailments in humans. While the domestic demands for these species are on the rise, the resource availability has been shrinking. For long term sustenance of these species, it is imperative that these species are brought under cultivation. In this study, we used maximum entropy approach to identify suitable areas of cultivation of these species under both current and future scenarios viz., RCP's 2.6 and 8.5 by 2070. Our study suggests that due to climate change there is a very small gain in the suitable area in future which could help sustain the populations of both the species in the wild. In addition, we provide spatially explicit maps for different suitability areas which can be effectively used for prioritizing the cultivation sites for each species. For both the species, areas adjoining tropical broadleaved forest patches in the Western Ghats offer potential habitats at higher levels of probability for cultivation of species. We recommend that due consideration should be given for the sustainability of these two species by promoting cultivation outside the wild habitats and provide adequate protection of the two studied species in the wild. These results should also be useful for conservation planning and for prioritizing areas for protection as well as for large-scale commercial cultivation of these two species.

AB  - Around the world, SDMs have been widely used to support forest management planning and biodiversity conservation. Beyond the prediction of species distribution provided by the SDMs, this study aimed to analyze the spatial distribution of tree species diversity using SDMs. The study area is a Faidherbia albida parkland in Central Senegal. It is characterized by a tree-based farming system dominated by Faidherbia albida. Using a robust and representative dataset of 9258 tree species occurrence, we first determined by an SDM the current potential spatial distribution of the 16 main tree species forming the parkland. Specifically, using 6 SDM algorithms and applying several modeling techniques with different categories of predictor variables (e.g., climate, topography, soil properties and human impact) we benchmarked 576 SDMs to achieve best model predictions for tree species. Then, tree species diversity maps were created on the basis of the resulting SDM predictions. Finally, the spatial dynamics of tree species diversity were discussed in relation to landscape characteristics, including heterogeneity, composition and human impact. The results showed that there is no single 'best' SDM algorithm (among the 6 algorithms tested) or modeling approach for all species. Benchmarking several modeling techniques allowed strengthening SDM performance, achieving AUC values that ranged from 0.64 (intermediate accuracy) to 0.87 (very good accuracy). The spatial dynamics of tree species diversity is related to the landscape heterogeneity and composition. In the Sahelian agroforestry systems (AFS), tree diversity is sustained by anthropization. A significant negative correlation with the distance to the village was found, i.e. the closer you get to the village, the greater the diversity of trees. This study could be crucial for analyzing tree species diversity when abundance information is not available.

   Location China.
   Methods Range maps and occurrence records of amphibian species in China were analysed separately using ensemble species distribution modelling across three spatial scales to assess scale dependency. Climate velocity and corresponding residence time in protected areas and species' ranges were calculated, together with a number of other effectiveness indices.
   Results Predicted declines in amphibian richness, endemism, phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic endemism and suitable habitat were lower in protected than in unprotected areas, complementary-priority sites or richness hotspots. However, less-disturbed amphibian habitat, calculated from current and future projected land use data, in both protected and unprotected areas were consistently lost over time although this reduction was lower in protected areas. Although residence time of precipitation was longer in protected areas and within species' ranges in protected areas, resident time of temperature was significantly shorter in both. These results were consistent regardless of data sources and spatial scales.
   Main conclusions China's current protected areas are predicted to maintain future amphibian distribution and diversity, but are insufficient in preventing the losses of suitable climate and areas of less-disturbed habitat. The top 10% of future conservation gaps for amphibians were identified in China based on performance of effectiveness indices. The two largest gaps prioritized for future protected areas include the southern parts of Tibet and the Hengduan Mountains.

AB  - Aim: Conservation planning requires the prioritization of a subset of taxa and geographical locations to focus monitoring and management efforts. Integration of the threats and opportunities posed by climate change often relies on predictions from species distribution models, particularly for assessments of vulnerability or invasion risk for multiple taxa. We evaluated whether species distribution models could reliably rank changes in species range size under climate and land use change.
   Location: Conterminous U.S.A.
   Time period: 1977-2014.
   Major taxa studied: Passerine birds.
   Methods: We estimated ensembles of species distribution models based on historical North American Breeding Bird Survey occurrences for 190 songbirds, and generated predictions to recent years given c.35 years of observed land use and climate change. We evaluated model predictions using standard metrics of discrimination performance and a more detailed assessment of the ability of models to rank species vulnerability to climate change based on predicted range loss, range gain, and overall change in range size.
   Results: Species distribution models yielded unreliable and misleading assessments of relative vulnerability to climate and land use change. Models could not accurately predict range expansion or contraction, and therefore failed to anticipate patterns of range change among species. These failures occurred despite excellent overall discrimination ability and transferability to the validation time period, which reflected strong performance at the majority of locations that were either always or never occupied by each species.
   Main conclusions: Models failed for the questions and at the locations of greatest interest to conservation and management. This highlights potential pitfalls of multi-taxa impact assessments under global change; in our case, models provided misleading rankings of the most impacted species, and spatial information about range changes was not credible. As modelling methods and frameworks continue to be refined, performance assessments and validation efforts should focus on the measures of risk and vulnerability useful for decision-making.

AB  - The marginal and unproductive elements of farmland landscapes, such as shrubs, hedgerows, isolated trees and uncultivated patches, represent key habitats for many bird species, as far as nesting, feeding and protection are concerned. Anyway this marginal vegetation has been removed due to the agricultural intensification which occurred in Europe during the last decades. In this study, the environmental variables known as marginal vegetation, which explain the presence and distribution of farmland bird species, were analyzed using Generalized Linear Models and hierarchical partitioning protocol. Our results have quantified the total contribution of marginal vegetation on the presence of farmland bird species and also the relative importance of every type of marginal vegetation. These results confirm how these elements, used also as one indication of high nature values of farmlands (HNV), are fit for studies on farmland birds distribution in Central Italy. Some species were more related to hedgerows, while others were related primarily to shrubs and others also to uncultivated marginal patches. The quantification of relative importance of each marginal vegetation is an useful tool for landscape restoration planning. However, as the relative importance was different for each bird species, the studies on farmland birds occurrence remain key to improve the accuracy of predictive frameworks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

AB  - Global climate change appears to be one of the main threats to biodiversity in the near future and is already affecting the distribution of many species. Currently threatened species are a special concern while the extent to which they are sensitive to climate change remains uncertain. Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) is classified as endangered and a conservation focus on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Using measures of species range shift, we explored how the distribution of Przewalski's gazelle may be impacted by projected climate change based on a maximum entropy approach. We also evaluated the uncertainty in the projections of the risks arising from climate change. Modeling predicted the Przewalski's gazelle would be sensitive to future climate change. As the time horizon increased, the strength of effects from climate change increased. Even assuming unlimited dispersal capacity of gazelles, a moderate decrease to complete loss of range was projected by 2080 under different thresholds for transforming the probability prediction to presence/absence data. Current localities of gazelles will undergo a decrease in their occurrence probability. Projections of the impacts of climate change were significantly affected by thresholds and general circulation models. This study suggests climate change clearly poses a severe threat and increases the extinction risk to Przewalski's gazelle. Our findings 1) confirm that endangered endemic species is highly vulnerable to climate change and 2) highlight the fact that forecasting impacts of climate change needs an assessment of the uncertainty. It is extremely important that conservation strategies consider the predicted geographical shifts and be planned with full knowledge of the reliability of projected impacts of climate change.

AB  - Many threats to biodiversity can be predicted and are well mapped but others are uncertain in their extent, impact on biodiversity, and ability for conservation efforts to address, making them more difficult to account for in spatial conservation planning efforts, and as a result, they are often ignored. Here, we use a spatial prioritisation analysis to evaluate the consequences of considering only relatively well-mapped threats to biodiversity and compare this with planning scenarios that also account for more uncertain threats (in this case mining and armed conflict) under different management strategies. We evaluate three management strategies to address these more uncertain threats: 1. to ignore them; 2. avoid them; or 3. specifically target actions towards them, first individually and then simultaneously to assess the impact of their inclusion in spatial prioritisations. We apply our approach to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and identify priority areas for conserving biodiversity and carbon sequestration services. We found that a strategy that avoids addressing threats of mining and armed conflict more often misses important opportunities for biodiversity conservation, compared to a strategy that targets action towards areas under threat (assuming a biodiversity benefit is possible). We found that considering mining and armed conflict threats to biodiversity independently rather than simultaneously results in 13 800-14 800 km(2) and 15 700-25 100 km(2) of potential missed conservation opportunities when undertaking threat-avoiding and threat-targeting management strategies, respectively. Our analysis emphasises the importance of considering all threats that can be mapped in spatial conservation prioritisation.

AB  - The American marten Martes americana is a species of conservation concern in the northeastern United States due to widespread declines from over-harvesting and habitat loss. Little information exists on current marten distribution and how landscape characteristics shape patterns of occupancy across the region, which could help develop effective recovery strategies. The rarity of marten and lack of historical distribution records are also problematic for region-wide conservation planning. Expert opinion can provide a source of information for estimating species-landscape relationships and is especially useful when empirical data are sparse. We created a survey to elicit expert opinion and build a model that describes marten occupancy in the northeastern United States as a function of landscape conditions. We elicited opinions from 18 marten experts that included wildlife managers, trappers and researchers. Each expert estimated occupancy probability at 30 sites in their geographic region of expertise. We, then, fit the response data with a set of 58 models that incorporated the effects of covariates related to forest characteristics, climate, anthropogenic impacts and competition at two spatial scales (1.5 and 5 km radii), and used model selection techniques to determine the best model in the set. Three top models had strong empirical support, which we model averaged based on AIC weights. The final model included effects of five covariates at the 5-km scale: percent canopy cover (positive), percent spruce-fir land cover (positive), winter temperature (negative), elevation (positive) and road density (negative). A receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the model performed well based on recent occurrence records. We mapped distribution across the region and used circuit theory to estimate movement corridors between isolated core populations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of expert-opinion data at modeling occupancy for rare species and provide tools for planning marten recovery in the northeastern United States.

AB  - Deep-sea fisheries provide an important source of protein to Pacific Island countries and territories that are highly dependent on fish for food security. However, spatial management of these deep-sea habitats is hindered by insufficient data. We developed species distribution models using spatially limited presence data for the main harvested species in the Western Central Pacific Ocean. We used bathymetric and water temperature data to develop presence-only species distribution models for the commercially exploited deep-sea snappers Etelis Cuvier 1828, Pristipomoides Valenciennes 1830, and Aphareus Cuvier 1830. We evaluated the performance of four different algorithms (CTA, GLM, MARS, and MAXENT) within the BIOMOD framework to obtain an ensemble of predicted distributions. We projected these predictions across the Western Central Pacific Ocean to produce maps of potential deep-sea snapper distributions in 32 countries and territories. Depth was consistently the best predictor of presence for all species groups across all models. Bathymetric slope was consistently the poorest predictor. Temperature at depth was a good predictor of presence for GLM only. Model precision was highest for MAXENT and CTA. There were strong regional patterns in predicted distribution of suitable habitat, with the largest areas of suitable habitat (> 35% of the Exclusive Economic Zone) predicted in seven South Pacific countries and territories (Fiji, Matthew & Hunter, Nauru, New Caledonia, Tonga, Vanuatu and Wallis & Futuna). Predicted habitat also varied among species, with the proportion of predicted habitat highest for Aphareus and lowest for Etelis. Despite data paucity, the relationship between deep-sea snapper presence and their environments was sufficiently strong to predict their distribution across a large area of the Pacific Ocean. Our results therefore provide a strong baseline for designing monitoring programs that balance resource exploitation and conservation planning, and for predicting future distributions of deep-sea snappers.

AB  - Population genomics has significantly increased our ability to make inferences about microevolutionary processes and demographic histories, which have the potential to improve protection and recovery of imperiled species. Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionida) represent one of the most imperiled groups of organisms globally. Despite systemic decline of mussel abundance and diversity, studies evaluating spatiotemporal changes in distribution, demographic histories, and ecological factors that threaten long-term persistence of imperiled species remain lacking. In this study, we use genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) and mitochondrial sequence data (mtDNA) to define conservation units (CUs) for two highly imperiled freshwater mussel species, Potamilus amphichaenus and Potamilus streckersoni. We then synthesize our molecular findings with details from field collections spanning from 1901 to 2019 to further elucidate distributional trends, contemporary status, and other factors that may be contributing to population declines for our focal species. We collected GBS and mtDNA data for individuals of P. amphichaenus and P. streckersoni from freshwater mussel collections in the Brazos, Neches, Sabine, and Trinity drainages ranging from 2012 to 2019. Molecular analyses resolved disputing number of genetic clusters within P. amphichaenus and P. streckersoni; however, we find defensible support for four CUs, each corresponding to an independent river basin. Evaluations of historical and recent occurrence data illuminated a generally increasing trend of occurrence in each of the four CUs, which were correlated with recent increases in sampling effort. Taken together, these findings suggest that P. amphichaenus and P. streckersoni are likely rare throughout their respective ranges. Because of this, the establishment of CUs will facilitate evidence-based recovery planning and ensure potential captive propagation and translocation efforts are beneficial. Our synthesis represents a case study for conservation genomic assessments in freshwater mussels and provides a model for future studies aimed at recovery planning for these highly imperiled organisms.

AB  - Investigation of biodiversity, including genetic diversity within species, is crucial for rational planning of nature conservation and species protection. Endemics or narrow-ranged taxa, sensitive to alteration of physical and chemical conditions, may serve as local bioindicators. Homoeogammarus scutarensis is an endemic, cold-adapted amphipod crustacean, inhabiting fragmented spring habitats, within a relatively small area of the Lake Skadar basin. The basin is recently under heavy anthropogenic influence leading to habitat deterioration. Genetic diversity within H. scutarensis was investigated using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and the nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA markers. Genetic diversity within the mitochondrial (mt)DNA appeared to be surprisingly high as for the limited spatial scale. The history of within-species divergence dates back at least to the Pliocene. A case of interspecific mtDNA introgression from the endemic H. scutarensis to the widespread and partly sympatric Homoeogammarus thoni was observed in one of the studied populations. Demographic analysis showed that the demography of H. scutarensis population has been stable, without evidence of expansion. Thus, we believe that H. scutarensis, responsive to environmental changes, is a proper model mirroring the conditions in sensitive habitats of the Lake Skadar basin. To protect ongoing evolutionary processes, the conservation measures for this species should take into account the complex fine-scale lineage endemism patterns. This case study may also provide a hint for planning conservation strategies in other geologically old spring systems. Most of the localities where H. scutarensis occurs provide refugia for divergent mtDNA lineages, suggesting prolonged isolation between sites and independent evolutionary histories. We conclude that H. scutarensis is composed of two or three conservation units. One of them occupies the headwaters of the Crnojevica River and spring in its valley. The other is widespread throughout the sub-lacustrine springs and the Zeta Plain; however, a group of unique haplotypes is found in springs in the Podhum Bay. Their presence and distribution should be considered while planning any investments or conservation strategies.

AB  - While cost estimation is a very positive tool for spatial conservation prioritisation, there are few examples where costs (in monetary terms) are applied. We present a repeatable method to estimate and map field values in monetary terms using common correlative models. We modelled, with a resolution of 1 km(2), the information obtained by several real estate's agencies with a set of eleven environmental, climatic, and anthropogenic variables. Land cover was the main influencing factor, but further variables were affecting bids on field sales according to the socio-economic specificity of each administrative province. The estimated values were related to endemic plant species richness, their conservation status and altitudinal ranges. Richest areas in endemics have lower values given current market conditions and, within these endemic rich areas, values near the coast were generally higher than the rest of endemic-rich territories. Despite their limits, our method offers an alternative perspective on the challenges of simplifying the extrapolation of useful information for planning and disseminating the conservation of many ecosystem services providers.

AB  - Over half of globally threatened animal species have experienced rapid geographic range loss. Identifying the parts of species' distributions most vulnerable to local extinction would benefit conservation planning. However, previous studies give little consensus on whether ranges decline to the core or edge. We built on previous work by using empirical data to examine the position of recent local extinctions within species' geographic ranges, address range position as a continuum, and explore the influence of environmental factors. We aggregated point-locality data for 125 Galliform species from across the Palearctic and Indo-Malaya into equal-area half-degree grid cells and used a multispecies dynamic Bayesian occupancy model to estimate rates of local extinctions. Our model provides a novel approach to identify loss of populations from within species ranges. We investigated the relationship between extinction rates and distance from range edge by examining whether patterns were consistent across biogeographic realm and different categories of land use. In the Palearctic, local extinctions occurred closer to the range edge than range core in both unconverted and human-dominated landscapes. In Indo-Malaya, no pattern was found for unconverted landscapes, but in human-dominated landscapes extinctions tended to occur closer to the core than the edge. Our results suggest that local and regional factors override general spatial patterns of recent local extinction within species' ranges and highlight the difficulty of predicting the parts of a species' distribution most vulnerable to threat.

AB  - Protected Areas (PA) play a pivotal role in conservation biology. Climate change challenges the concept of static PAs as species may not find suitable climatic conditions in the PAs designed to protect them in the future. Here, we assess this emerging mismatch for the endemic mountain flora of the Iranian Plateau, the main part of the Irano-Anatolian global biodiversity hotspot. We compare the climatic requirements of each of 1277 endemic plant species with the climatic conditions offered by those parts of the Iranian PA network that are within the dispersal range of each species. We undertake this comparison for current climatic conditions and the conditions predicted for the years 2050 and 2070 under the climatic scenarios RCP4.5 und RCP8.5. We find that 50 % of the species climatic niche space is represented in the PA network under current conditions. Depending on the cli-matic scenario and time frame, representation will decrease to 15-25 % in the future. Species of lowest and highest elevations, and, in particular, species with narrow ranges, are predicted to face the most pronounced losses of climatic representation in PAs. We conclude that the contribution of the current Iranian PA network to protecting the rich endemic flora of the country under climate change is limited. The network overrepresents climatically homogenous desert ecosystems and neglects endemism hotspots of high mountain chains. Efficient conservation planning in this biodiversity hotspot should focus on expanding elevational gradients within PAs and prioritize the protection of narrow range, low and high elevation species.

AB  - The utility of habitat models for species conservation relies on the integration of ecological knowledge into the modeling process. However, this practice is often limited by incomplete information on the study species requirements and insufficient efforts to adopt robust inference modeling approaches. We developed occurrence and breeding habitat models for the European brown bear Ursus arctos in the Northern range of the poorly-known Carpathian population, focusing on the evaluation of a restricted set of hypotheses based on prevailing insights on the species constrains. Hypotheses were confronted using a dataset of 3151 bear observations in Poland for the period 1985-2005. Forest availability was the most important limiting factor, whereas anthropic factors (human density and urban areas) separated between suitable and non-suitable forest-rich areas. Forest composition contributed poorly to predict bear occurrence but was important to differentiate between breeding and non-breeding habitats: breeding females required a larger amount of forest cover, lower human influence and the interspersion of grassland/shrubland patches. Model transfer to the western Carpathian population in Slovakia supported the accuracy of habitat predictions and the robustness of the approach. Results highlight the need to control unplanned urban sprawl to preserve the species habitat and the connectivity between the Western and Eastern segments of the Carpathian population. Predicted but unoccupied habitats in other regions also require consideration, particularly some favorable areas of confluence with other large carnivore habitats. We encourage adopting robust hypothesis testing approaches in habitat modeling in order to support better model transferability and conservation planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration have been key issues of watershed management in many countries. To maintain or restore the environmental quality of watersheds, we need to assess the impact of anthropogenic changes on stream ecosystems with accuracy. in addition, watershed conservation planners have to make strategic plans and determine priorities of each conservation activity.
   A new monitoring methodology to evaluate the change of habitat condition for freshwater fish based on a predictive habitat model using logistic regression was developed and applied to the whole of Japan. The main contributions of our approach were 1) the construction of a Geographical information System (GIS) database that integrates many types of data, including freshwater fish species, water quality, habitat fragmentation by damming, geology, and climate; 2) spatial analysis for quantitative assessment and predictive habitat modeling using logistic regression to combine fish survey data and environmental habitat factors to determine critical and major habitat variables for each target fish; and 3) digital mapping and changes detection of fish habitat potential for targeted endangered fish species to show habitat distribution and spatio-temporal changes of habitat potential over a 25-year period (from 1977 to 2002). We found that predicted suitable habitat and actual fish habitat showed high overlap, and that habitat conditions and distribution patterns of target freshwater fish had been affected by major habitat variables to target species respectively.

AB  - Distribution ranges of many organisms are changing in response to global climate change and human activities. To test the impact of climatic change on distribution range of cyprinid fish species, Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) was used to predict the current climatically suitable habitats and to identify key variables shaping the potential distribution for the genus Alburnus in Iran, an excellent example of high diversity and endemism in the western Palearctic region. Then, future changes in potential suitable areas of the genus Alburnus were evaluated with one future global climatic model (GCM) based on 2050 climatic projection. Results show as a general pattern, basins along the Elburz and Zagros Mountains had highest climatic suitability for the genus in Iran. According to the results of jackknife test and percent contribution of each variable to construct the models, precipitation plays the important role on the distribution of Alburnus species in Iran than temperature. Model outputs show all species likely to be negatively affected by the climate change in future and the currently potential suitable areas were predicted to decrease in the coming decades, suggesting a comprehensive management plan for conservation of this cyprinid fish need to be conducted in the country.

AB  - Studying large mammal species in tropical forests is a conservation challenge with species behavior and ecology often increasing the probability of non-detection during surveys. Consequently, knowledge of the distribution, status, and natural history of many large mammal species in Southeast Asia is limited. I developed occupancy models from camera-trapping data, thereby accounting for imperfect detection at sampling sites, to clarify the status and habitat requirements of four globally threatened or near threatened large mammals (banteng Bos javanicus, gaur Bos gaurus, dhole Cuon alpinus, and leopard Panthera pardus) in Mondulkiri Protected Forest, eastern Cambodia. Camera traps were operational for >3500 trap nights with 202 photographic encounters of the four study species. Model averaged occupancy estimates were between 5 percent (leopard) and 140 percent (gaur) higher than naive estimates (i.e., proportion of camera-trap sites species recorded from) thus highlighting the importance of accounting for detectability during conservation surveys. I recommend the use of an occupancy framework when using camera-trap data to study the status, ecology, and habitat preferences of poorly known and elusive species. The results highlight the importance of mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forest for wild cattle in eastern Cambodia and I emphasize that these habitats must be considered in conservation planning across the Lower Mekong Dry Forest Ecoregion.

AB  - The protection of migratory birds and their habitats is important to the ecological stability of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Currently protected areas (PAs) were designed in accordance with species distribution patterns under current climatic conditions, thus ignoring climate change will lead to a decrease in the protection efficiency of PAs. In this study, using the flagship species Grus nigricollis, as an example, we used the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to simulate the distributions and conservation status of G. nigricollis and optimized the existing PA boundaries . The results showed that (1) suitable habitat- for G. nigricollis accounts for 12.48% of the QTP area, and the PAs established under current climatic conditions cover 17.84% of this suitable habitat area; (2) future climate changes will influence the distribution and quality of G. nigricollis habitats, and the average protection efficiency of the current PAs in four climatic scenarios will decrease from 17.84% to 15.31%; and (3) through optimization, the efficiency of existing PAs can be increased by 0.75 times and reach 28.37%, indicating PA planning must consider not only current climate conditions but also the effects of climate changes. Our results aim to address shortcomings in the conservation efficiency of PAs and provide an example for resolving mismatched PA boundaries and habitat changes for species.

AB  - Aim The uncertainty associated with species distribution model (SDM) projections is poorly characterized, despite its potential value to decision makers. Error estimates from most modelling techniques have been shown to be biased due to their failure to account for spatial autocorrelation (SAC) of residual error. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) have the ability to account for SAC through the inclusion of a spatially structured random intercept, interpreted to account for the effect of missing predictors. This framework promises a more realistic characterization of parameter and prediction uncertainty. Our aim is to assess the ability of GLMMs and a conventional SDM approach, generalized linear models (GLM), to produce accurate projections and estimates of prediction uncertainty. Innovation We employ a unique historical dataset to assess the accuracy of projections and uncertainty estimates from GLMMs and GLMs. Models were trained using historical (19281940) observations for 99 woody plant species in California, USA, and assessed using temporally independent validation data (20002005). Main conclusions GLMMs provided a closer fit to historic data, had fewer significant covariates, were better able to eliminate spatial autocorrelation of residual error, and had larger credible intervals for projections than GLMs. The accuracy of projections was similar between methods but GLMMs better quantified projection uncertainty. Additionally, GLMMs produced more conservative estimates of species range size and range size change than GLMs. We conclude that the GLMM error structure allows for a more realistic characterization of SDM uncertainty. This is critical for conservation applications that rely on honest assessments of projection uncertainty.

AB  - Asian Houbara Chlamydotis macqueenii is a vulnerable flagship species specific to steppe, desert and semi-desert habitats of the Middle East and Central Asia. Iran provides a critical corridor in the middle of Asian Houbara's migratory route and also hosts a relatively large proportion of wintering and breeding populations. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution and habitat suitability of both wintering and breeding populations of Asian Houbara in Iran and evaluate the effectiveness of the existing protected area network for long-term protection of the species. For this purpose, 644 occurrence points for wintering and 216 points for breeding birds were collected from 17 Iranian provinces during 2015 to 2017. We then used a consensus species distribution modelling (SDM) approach using 11 uncorrelated environmental variables to explore the distribution of Asian Houbara habitats. Results showed that climatic and topographic variations have the most significant influence on the regional-scale distribution of Asian Houbara. Of the suitable habitats recognised for the wintering and breeding populations, 40.6% and 29.6% respectively overlapped with the extent of the protected network. A high level of spatial niche similarity (78%) was observed between wintering and breeding populations. The central, eastern and south-central Iranian semi-arid regions and desert landscapes hosted the majority of both wintering and breeding houbara occurrences. Results of this study could be used for adopting direct management planning and raising the protection level of important no-hunting areas.

AB  - The justification and targeting of conservation policy rests on reliable measures of public and private benefits from competing land uses. Advances in Earth system observation and modeling permit the mapping of public ecosystem services at unprecedented scales and resolutions, prompting new proposals for land protection policies and priorities. Data on private benefits from land use are not available at similar scales and resolutions, resulting in a data mismatch with unknown consequences. Here I show that private benefits from land can be quantified at large scales and high resolutions, and that doing so can have important implications for conservation policy models. I developed high-resolution estimates of fair market value of private lands in the contiguous United States by training tree-based ensemble models on 6 million land sales. The resulting estimates predict conservation cost with up to 8.5 times greater accuracy than earlier proxies. Studies using coarser cost proxies underestimate conservation costs, especially at the expensive tail of the distribution. This has led to underestimations of policy budgets by factors of up to 37.5 in recent work. More accurate cost accounting will help policy makers acknowledge the full magnitude of contemporary conservation challenges and can help improve the targeting of public ecosystem service investments.

AB  - Crocodile lizards (Shinisaurus crocodilurus) are an endangered, 'living fossil' reptile from a monophyletic family and therefore, a high priority for conservation. We constructed climatic models to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of crocodile lizards for the period 2000 to 2100 and determined the key environmental factors that affect the dispersal of this endangered species. For the construction of climatic models, we used 985 presence-only data points and 6 predictor variables which showed excellent performance (AUC = 0.974). The three top-ranked factors predicting crocodile lizard distribution were precipitation of the wettest month (bio13, 37.1%), precipitation of the coldest quarter (bio19, 17.9%), and temperature seasonality (bio4, 14.3%). Crocodile lizards were, just as they are now, widely distributed in the north of Guangdong Province in China and Quang Ninh Province in Vietnam at the last glacial maximum (LGM). Since the LGM, there has been an increase in suitable habitats, particularly in east-central Guangxi Province, China. Under future global warming scenarios, the potential habitat for crocodile lizards is expected to decrease significantly in the next 100 years. Under the most optimistic scenario, only 7.35% to 6.54% of suitable habitat will remain, and under the worst climatic scenario, only 8.34% to 0.86% of suitable habitat will remain. Models for no dispersal and limited dispersal showed that all crocodile lizards would lose habitat as temperatures increase. Our work contributes to an increased understanding of the current and future spatial distribution of the species, supporting practical management and conservation plans.

AB  - 1. The species abundance distribution (SAD) is an important concept in ecology, and much work has focused on the SAD in a theoretical context. However, less focus has been placed on the utility of SADs in applied ecology and biodiversity management, which therefore forms the focus of the present article. We illustrate that study of the SAD allows inferences beyond those that flow from many simple diversity indices, enabling workers to identify patterns in the commonness and rarity of species in a community.
   2. First, we discuss how incorporating SAD analyses into the study of ecological communities can generate useful information for the management of biodiversity. In particular, we argue that deconstructing ecological assemblages into various subsets and analysing how each subset contributes to the overall SAD can reveal patterns of interest to managers. Secondly, we review the many applications of SADs in applied ecological fields, including disturbance ecology, conservation planning and conservation biological control.
   3. Using examples we show that the SAD can be useful in applied ecology as it is visually intuitive, easy to implement in a broad variety of ecological contexts, and does not require substantial species-specific data. We provide a summary of the various methods available for plotting the SAD and illustrate how each method provides information of value for applied ecologists.
   4. Using empirical and simulated data, we show that the SAD can provide early warning of the effects of disturbance on ecological communities and that a number of SAD models represent useful tools for comparing communities in a management context.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Applied ecologists require tools that allow for relatively quick assessments of ecosystem health and/or the success of management prescriptions aimed at ameliorating the effects of disturbance. We demonstrate that that the methods reviewed herein provide such tools and that the species abundance distribution (SAD) has additional applied uses beyond traditional applications in disturbance ecology. We hope that this synthesis will provide a catalyst for advancing a more utilitarian SAD research agenda.

AB  - Climate change has a significant impact on the distribution of species over time. In response, species may shift, contract, extend or fragment their distributions to track preferred environmental conditions. This study aims to track the recent (1970-2000), Quaternary (Last Glacial Maximum (LGM): 21 Kya and the Mid-Holocene (MH): 6 Kya) and future (2070) range dynamics, as well as identifying putative climate refugia of the Near Eastern fire salamander, Salamandra infraimmaculata in the Near and Middle East. For this purpose, ensemble species distribution modelling (eSDM) using ten algorithms was applied to 119 occurrence records within CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM global climate models. According to the findings of this study, bioclimatic parameters, especially precipitation of wettest month (33.77%), annual precipitation (15.04%) and max temperature of warmest month (12.23%), have a stronger impact on S. infraimmaculata distribution than environmental variables referring to solar radiation, soil, topography and land cover as well as human impact. The modelled eSDM revealed a pattern of past range expansion and postglacial contraction. During the LGM, the range of species expanded to lower elevations, compared to MH and recent climate conditions. Based on future climate projections, habitat loss will be more apparent at the margins of the distribution range and low elevations, while habitat gain will be visible at higher elevations. The consensus model predicted that countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea (Syria, Lebanon, Palestine/Israel, southwestern Turkey), as well as a small portion of the central Zagros mountains in western Iran, northeastern Iraq and southeast to central Turkey may act as climate refugia for the S. infraimmaculata. In comparison to the historical and recent distribution, this result predicts that species ranges will fragment in the future. Therefore, global climate change should be considered a potential threat to this species and effective conservation plans should be implemented.

AB  - Agroforestry tree domestication research is geared at promoting diversification of on-farm tree species composition. A survey was conducted in western Kenya with the objective of exploring possibilities for diversification for a particular agroecosystem, involving a complete tree census, tree measurement and collection of ethnobotanical information in 201 small-scale farms. Various approaches to landscape diversification were explored, including random distribution of trees to increase alpha richness and species richness at higher scales in the landscape, and random distribution of species composition over villages to increase the average richness of villages. The results showed that random distribution would result in increments of average species richness in the landscape, without requiring increments of total and average abundance. A new, fast and exact method of calculating site-based species accumulation curves was presented. The method yielded results that were extremely close to classical algorithms using 10,000 randomisations. Four use-groups (beverage, fodder, charcoal and soil fertility enhancement) were identified as use-groups with alpha richness smaller than one species, but only beverage and fodder had lowest richness at all scales (fruit and construction wood joined the four use-groups of lowest average species richness at higher scales in the landscape). The novel approaches used in this study could be used in future biodiversity studies on species accumulation patterns, or on spatial distribution patterns of species richness in a landscape.

AB  - Formulations for determining conservation plans for sensitive wildlife species must account for economic costs of habitat protection and uncertainties about how wildlife populations will respond. This paper describes such a formulation and addresses the computational challenge of solving it. The problem is to determine the cost-efficient level of habitat protection that satisfies a viability constraint for a sensitive wildlife population. The viability constraint requires a high probability of attaining a population size target. Because of the complexity of wildlife prediction models, population survival probabilities under alternative protection plans must be estimated using Monte Carlo simulation. The computational challenge arises from the conflicting effects of sample size: fewer replications used to estimate survival probability increases the speed of the search algorithm but reduces the precision of the estimator of the optimal protection plan. Importance sampling is demonstrated as a simulation technique for reducing estimator variance for a given sample size, particularly when the tail of the population distribution is of critical importance. The method is demonstrated on a hypothetical problem involving gray wolf management in the Great Lakes region of the United States. In comparison to random sampling, importance sampling produces a 21-fold reduction in the variance of the estimator of the minimum-cost protection plan. Results from the optimization model demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the minimum-cost protection plan to the structure of the growth model and the magnitude of environmental variation. This sensitivity is not widely recognized in the literature on wildlife habitat planning and is a strong reason for using optimization methods that can handle stochastic population models with a wide range of structures.

AB  - Aim Deforestation is rapidly altering Southeast Asian landscapes, resulting in some of the highest rates of habitat loss worldwide. Among the many species facing declines in this region, clouded leopards rank notably for their ambassadorial potential and capacity to act as powerful levers for broader forest conservation programmes. Thus, identifying core habitat and conservation opportunities are critical for curbing further Neofelis declines and extending umbrella protection for diverse forest biota similarly threatened by widespread habitat loss. Furthermore, a recent comprehensive habitat assessment of Sunda clouded leopards (N. diardi) highlights the lack of such information for the mainland species (N. nebulosa) and facilitates a comparative assessment. Location Southeast Asia. Methods Species-habitat relationships are scale-dependent, yet <5% of all recent habitat modelling papers apply robust approaches to optimize multivariate scale relationships. Using one of the largest camera trap datasets ever collected, we developed scale-optimized species distribution models for two con-generic carnivores, and quantitatively compared their habitat niches. Results We identified core habitat, connectivity corridors, and ranked remaining habitat patches for conservation prioritization. Closed-canopy forest was the strongest predictor, with similar to 25% lower Neofelis detections when forest cover declined from 100 to 65%. A strong, positive association with increasing precipitation suggests ongoing climate change as a growing threat along drier edges of the species' range. While deforestation and land use conversion were deleterious for both species, N. nebulosa was uniquely associated with shrublands and grasslands. We identified 800 km(2) as a minimum patch size for supporting clouded leopard conservation. Main conclusions We illustrate the utility of multi-scale modelling for identifying key habitat requirements, optimal scales of use and critical targets for guiding conservation prioritization. Curbing deforestation and development within remaining core habitat and dispersal corridors, particularly in Myanmar, Laos and Malaysia, is critical for supporting evolutionary potential of clouded leopards and conservation of associated forest biodiversity.

AB  - Human-induced effects on lowland conifer forests in hemiboreal regions are increasing because of expanded use of these northern ecosystems for raw materials, energy, and minerals as well as the potential effects of climatic changes. These forests support many breeding bird species across the Holarctic and allow the persistence of several boreal bird species in hemiboreal and even temperate regions. These bird species are of particular conservation concern as shifting patterns northward in forest composition caused by climate change will likely affect their populations. However, effective management and conservation options are limited because the specifics of these species' breeding habitats are not well understood. We modeled and mapped habitat suitability for 11 species of boreal birds that breed in the lowland conifer forests of the Agassiz Lowlands Ecological Subsection in northern Minnesota and are likely to have reduced breeding habitat in the future: Spruce Grouse (Falcipennis canadensis), Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Olivesided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), Yellow-bellied Flycatcher (Empidonax flaviventris), Boreal Chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus), Goldencrowned Kinglet (Regulus satrapa), Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Palm Warbler (Setophaga palmarum), and Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis). Sets of 7 to 16 potential environmental covariates, including both stand-level and landscape attributes, were used to develop individual species models. Within this lowland conifer-dominated ecosystem, we found significant selection for specific forest and landscape characteristics by all but one of these species, with the best models including between one and nine variables. Habitat suitability maps were developed from these models and predictions tested with an independent dataset. Model performance depended on species, correctly predicting 56-96% of test data. We present a map combining suitability scores for five species of conservation concern that has been used for conservation planning and management opportunities across a broad, lowland forest landscape. We recommend managers utilize the detailed model development and validation framework to address local and regional conservation issues.

AB  - Delineating priority areas for highly mobile marine megafauna represents a major challenge for conservation biology. To manage such areas, one must understand both their spatial properties (i.e., location, number, extent), and the level of exposure to a number of given pressures. Here, we used a combination of ensemble distribution models, field-based validation methods and a cumulative effect assessment to illustrate key foraging sites and risk hotspots for adult loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, in the Mediterranean Sea. We found that foraging sites covered about 10% of the neritic zone of the Mediterranean basin. We identified sites which are well recognized by scientists, but also other areas for which our knowledge on the potential importance is limited. The patterns of the habitat use generated by field data validated the accuracy of the distribution model. About one fifth of the foraging areas hosted in the Mediterranean could be considered as hotspots of risk, characterized by high or very high exposure to cumulative pressures. Our results suggest that management and conservation efforts should continue to be held at key, well-known foraging grounds of adult sea turtles (e.g., Northern Adriatic Sea, Tunisian Plateau) but there are several more potential sites (e.g., parts of the Aegean Sea and the Western Mediterranean) which deserve our attention in order to ensure viable populations.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) across past, present, and future timelines provide insights into the current distribution of these species and their reaction to climate change. Specifically, if a species is threatened or not well-known, the information may be critical to understand that species. In this study, we computed SDMs for Orientocoluber spinalis, a monotypic snake genus found in central and northeast Asia, across the past (last interglacial, last glacial maximum, and mid-Holocene), present, and future (2070s). The goal of the study was to understand the shifts in distribution across time, and the climatic factors primarily affecting the distribution of the species. We found the suitable habitat of O. spinalis to be persistently located in cold-dry winter and hot summer climatic areas where annual mean temperature, isothermality, and annual mean precipitation were important for suitable habitat conditions. Since the last glacial maximum, the suitable habitat of the species has consistently shifted northward. Despite the increase in suitable habitat, the rapid alterations in weather regimes because of climate change in the near future are likely to greatly threaten the southern populations of O. spinalis, especially in South Korea and China. To cope with such potential future threats, understanding the ecological requirements of the species and developing conservation plans are urgently needed.

AB  - Aim Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are among the most frequently used tools for conservation planning under climate and land use changes. Conservation-focused climate change studies are often conducted on a national or local level and can use different sources of occurrence records (e.g., local databases, national biodiversity monitoring) collated at different geographic extents. However, little is known about how these restrictions in geographic space (i.e., Wallacean shortfall) can lead to restrictions in environmental space (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall) and accordingly affect conclusions about a species' vulnerability to climate change.

   Methods We present an example study constructing SDMs for three Mexican tree species (Alnus acuminata, Liquidambar styraciflua and Quercus xalapensis) using datasets collated at a global (Americas), national (Mexico) and local (cloud forests of eastern Mexico) level to demonstrate the potential effects of a Wallacean shortfall on the estimation of the environmental niche-and thus on a Hutchinsonian shortfall-its projection in space and time and, consequently, on species' potential vulnerability to climate change.
   Results The consequence of using the three datasets was species-specific and strongly depended on the extent to which the Wallacean shortfall affected estimations of environmental niches (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall). Where restrictions in geographic space lead to an underestimation of the environmental niche, vulnerability to climate change was estimated to be substantially higher. Additionally, the restrictions in geographic space may increase the likelihood of issues with non-analogue climates, increasing model uncertainty.
   Main conclusion We recommend assessing the extent to which a species' entire realized environmental niche is captured within the target conservation area, and increasing the geographic extent, if needed, to account for environments and occurrences reflecting potential future conditions. This way, the risk of underestimating the climatic potential of the species (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall), as well as the errors induced by extrapolation into "locally novel" climates, can be minimized.

AB  - BackgroundInland wetlands are crucial for biodiversity conservation, especially in highly-urbanized landscapes. In the European Union, many wetlands are included in the EU Natura 2000' network, the main tool for biodiversity conservation over the continent, which requires the development of site-specific management plans. Clear and feasible recommendations are necessary to provide site managers with effective tools for the maintenance of biodiversity in these unstable environments. Birds are excellent umbrella species, therefore a management targeted at increasing habitat suitability for focal bird species would likely benefit broader wetland biological communities.MethodsDuring spring-summer 2017, we collected presence/absence data for 10 bird species of conservation interest at a site scale for 21 Natura 2000 sites. We also carried out a point count survey to detect presence/absence of four reedbed-dwelling species at 75 points. At the site level, we estimated landscape characteristics from regional GIS-layers, whereas fine-scaled habitat composition was recorded on the field within a 100m-buffer around the 75 points. We analysed the effect of the extent of different habitats on species' occurrence probability by means of multi-species binomial multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) at both scales. We also run species-specific MARS models to compare their performance with those of multi-species models.ResultsAt the site scale, the extent of the reedbeds/mires was positively associated with the occurrence of all species of conservation concern. At the point-count scale, reedbed extent positively predicted species' occurrence, but only in presence of patches of clear shallow water. Species-specific MARS models showed qualitatively similar results for some species, but generally were outperformed by multi-species ones.ConclusionsMulti-species MARS models confirmed to be an efficient tool in disclosing species-habitat relationships even for set of species including scarce taxa and when only short-term monitoring data are available. In terms of conservation measures, our findings stress the importance of Phragmites australis reedbed as a key habitat for avian biodiversity, but only when it is flooded and interspersed with scattered patches of open water. The preservation of wide (>100/150ha) and flooded reedbeds structured in spots of no less than 2ha emerges as the main conservation measure for the long-term conservation of the threatened avifauna of inland pre-Alpine wetlands.

AB  - Background: The inclusion of information on the phenology of any given species can significantly improve the resulting of potential distribution models. Scientific literature does not provide up-to-date information on the abiotic and biotic factors that determine the distribution of Croton guatemalensis, a species native to communities in south Mexico. For the first time, the potential distribution of C. guatemalensis was determined using a model which includes reproductive biology data.
   Questions: Which bioclimatic and climatic variables most contribute to the distribution of C. guatemalensis? Does reproductive biology data contribute significantly to the prediction of the species distribution?
   Studied species/Mathematical model: Croton guatemalensis/Maximum Entropy Modeling.
   Study area and dates: Chiapas, Mexico, January - December 2020.
   Methods: The MaxEnt 4.4.4 algorithm was used, incorporating 16 variables, including bioclimatic, climatic and elevation. In addition, a habitat suitability layer was built.
   Results: The model presented a precision of AUC = 0.964 +/- 0.004. Eight variables contributed to explain 86.5 % of the potential distribution of the species. According to their contribution to the model, the most important were the seasonality of precipitation, habitat suitability, elevation and April solar radiation. The species was found in the physiographic regions Central America South Mountain Range Subprovince, Central Depression of Chiapas Discontinuity, and Altos de Chiapas Subprovince.
   Conclusions: The inclusion of reproductive biology data of C. guatemalensis contributed to improve the model. This information allows the development of more effective management and conservation plans by identifying the precise regions in which the species is found.

AB  - Chioglossa lusitanica is a streamside salamander endemic to the northwestern corner of the Iberian Peninsula. In an extensive field survey we found the species to be widely distributed across northwestern Portugal. The distribution data were used to identify macroenvironmental parameters related to the presence of the species in Portugal, and to produce a descriptive distribution model for C. lusitanica. We modelled the species distribution based on five environmental parameters (precipitation, relief, July temperature, number of frost months and hardness of water) selected by logistic regression analysis. The model yielded a high score of correct classification (95%). Excluding parameters unavailable for Spain the model included four parameters (precipitation, relief, July temperature and altitude) and had a 93% correct classification score. Extrapolation of the model to Spain yielded a correct classification of 92% and served as a validation of the modelling technique in an independent area. The models indicate the existence of several potentially suitable areas outside the known distribution of the species, providing clues about the species historical biogeography. The models, through the identification of highly suitable and stable protection regions, may contribute to informed conservation planning.

AB  - 1. The ecological niche is a fundamental biological concept. Modelling species' niches is central to numerous ecological applications, including predicting species invasions, identifying reservoirs for disease, nature reserve design and forecasting the effects of anthropogenic and natural climate change on species' ranges.
   2. A computational analogue of Hutchinson's ecological niche concept (the multidimensional hyperspace of species' environmental requirements) is the support of the distribution of environments in which the species persist. Recently developed machine-learning algorithms can estimate the support of such high-dimensional distributions. We show how support vector machines can be used to map ecological niches using only observations of species presence to train distribution models for 106 species of woody plants and trees in a montane environment using up to nine environmental covariates.
   3. We compared the accuracy of three methods that differ in their approaches to reducing model complexity. We tested models with independent observations of both species presence and species absence. We found that the simplest procedure, which uses all available variables and no pre-processing to reduce correlation, was best overall. Ecological niche models based on support vector machines are theoretically superior to models that rely on simulating pseudo-absence data and are comparable in empirical tests.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Accurate species distribution models are crucial for effective environmental planning, management and conservation, and for unravelling the role of the environment in human health and welfare. Models based on distribution estimation rather than classification overcome theoretical and practical obstacles that pervade species distribution modelling. In particular, ecological niche models based on machine-learning algorithms for estimating the support of a statistical distribution provide a promising new approach to identifying species' potential distributions and to project changes in these distributions as a result of climate change, land use and landscape alteration.

AB  - An iterative reserve selection algorithm is used to address real-world constraints which affect our ability to achieve regional biodiversity representativeness when using the principle of complementarity Two key constraints in representative reserve selection procedures are addressed: incomplete data sets and established reserve networks. In the first instance, a geographic information system (GIS) is implemented to interpolate the observed biodiversity data and derive data for unsurveyed 15' x 15' grid cells from neighbouring grid cells. Conservative interpolation increased the number of data records by 8%, whereas the less conservative interpolation led to a 260% increase in the number of data records. Site selections based on the less conservative interpolation appears more efficient, but this greater efficiency may come at a price, namely, of not truly representing all species on the ground. Such interpolated data sets should thus be ground-truthed with further field surveys before using them for definitive conservation planning. Secondly, the established reserve network is shown to make an ineffective contribution to regional representation of mammalian species. The preselection of existing reserves has the effect of increasing the land area required for full species representation. Large ad hoc reserve networks can therefore increase the cost of achieving representative systems. The effect of the systematic alteration of (1) pre-selection criteria, (2) degree of data interpolation and (3) selection rules used by the algorithm on evaluating alternative reserve network configurations is discussed and forms the basis of a 'relative algorithm-specific index' (RASI) for identifying frequently selected sites. This can be used in land-use planning exercises to evaluate trade-offs between conservation, agriculture and development.

AB  - Aim The purpose of this study was to create predictive species distribution models (SDMs) for temperate reef-associated fish species densities and fish assemblage diversity and richness to aid in marine conservation and spatial planning.
   Location California, USA.
   Methods Using generalized additive models, we associated fish species densities and assemblage characteristics with seafloor structure, giant kelp biomass and wave climate and used these associations to predict the distribution and assemblage structure across the study area. We tested the accuracy of these predicted extrapolations using an independent data set. The SDMs were also used to estimate larger scale abundances to compare with other estimates of species abundance (uniform density extrapolation over rocky reef and density extrapolations taking into account variations in geomorphic structure).
   Results The SDMs successfully modelled the species-habitat relationships of seven rocky reef-associated fish species and showed that species' densities differed in their relationships with environmental variables. The predictive accuracy of the SDMs ranged from 0.26 to 0.60 (Pearson's r correlation between observed and predicted density values). The SDMs created for the fish assemblage-level variables had higher prediction accuracies with Pearson's r values of 0.61 for diversity and 0.71 for richness. The comparisons of the different methods for extrapolating species densities over a single marine protected area varied greatly in their abundance estimates with the uniform extrapolation (density values extrapolated evenly over the rocky reef) always estimating much greater abundances. The other two methods, which took into account variation in the geomorphic structure of the reef, provided much lower abundance estimates.
   Main conclusions Species distribution models that combine geomorphic, oceanographic and biogenic habitat variables can reliably predict spatial patterns of species density and assemblage attributes of temperate reef fishes at spatial scales of 50m. Thus, SDMs show great promise for informing spatial and ecosystem-based approaches to conservation and fisheries management.

AB  - Modern species distribution modelling (SDM) began in 1984 with the launch of the BIOCLIM program in Australia. With more than 900 papers mentioning 'species distribution model' published around the world to date, SDM is one of the most active areas of global ecology. Three books published in 2009, 2011 and 2017 have reviewed SDM, and the closely related areas of ecological niche modelling and habitat suitability modelling. All three books provide excellent introductions to these topics, but give very little information on the role that BIOCLIM played in laying the foundation for these research areas. Understanding the history of BIOCLIM is vital because it was the first package to implement the basic SDM process in an easy-to-use integrated system. It provided what are still the most commonly used set of 19 bioclimatic variables and contributed to the development of the interpolation routines used to prepare the most commonly used source of bioclimatic data (WorldClim). Early BIOCLIM studies investigated important issues such as ecological niche, invasion risk, conservation planning and impacts of climate change. Although all three books acknowledge that the BIOCLIM package was important in early SDM research, they all deal with the pioneering work very briefly and omit important details which are described here. Virtually all current SDM studies owe something to the pioneering BIOCLIM work, but this is rarely acknowledged.

AB  - Detailed understanding of a species' natural history and environmental needs across spatial scales is a primary requisite for effective conservation planning, particularly for species with complex life cycles in which different life stages occupy different niches and respond to the environment at different scales. However, niche models applied to conservation often neglect early life stages and are mostly performed at broad spatial scales. Using the endangered heath tiger beetle (Cicindela sylvatica) as a model species, we relate presence/absence and abundance data of locally dispersing adults and sedentary larvae to abiotic and biotic variables measured in a multiscale approach within the geographic extent relevant to active conservation management. At the scale of hundreds of meters, fine-grained abiotic conditions (i.e., vegetation structure) are fundamental determinants of the occurrence of both life stages, whereas the effect of biotic factors is mostly contained in the abiotic signature. The combination of dense heath vegetation and bare ground areas is thus the first requirement for the species' preservation, provided that accessibility to the suitable habitat is ensured. At a smaller scale (centimetres), the influence of abiotic factors on larval occurrence becomes negligible, suggesting the existence of important additional variables acting within larval proximity. Sustained significant correlations between neighbouring larvae in the models provide an indication of the potential impact of neighbourhood crowding on the larval niche within a few centimetres. Since the species spends the majority of its life cycle in the larval stage, it is essential to consider the hierarchical abiotic and biotic processes affecting the larvae when designing practical conservation guidelines for the species. This underlines the necessity for a more critical evaluation of the consequences of disregarding niche variation between life stages when estimating niches and addressing effective conservation measures for species with complex life cycles.

AB  - 1. Optimizing the design of marine protected area (MPA) networks for the conservation of migratory marine species and their habitats involves a suite of important considerations, such as appropriate scale requirements and the distribution of anthropogenic impacts. Often, a fundamental component of the conservation planning process is delineating areas of high use or high biodiversity within a region of interest. 2. However, basing conservation strategies off merely the number of individuals in an ecosystem is outdated and potentially subject to arbitrary thresholds. To be effective at protecting marine megafauna, MPAs would ideally encompass habitats used by focal species. Through satellite-tracking studies, evidence of whether species actually use protected areas is emerging. 3. Here, we present a multispecies perspective on habitat selection within existing MPAs throughout the Floridian ecoregion, which encompasses coastal Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. Using an 11-year satellite-tracking dataset on 235 marine turtles, we used integrated step selection analysis to quantify the effects of sea turtle behavioural state (identified by a switching state-space model), protected area status, chlorophyll and bathymetry on habitat selection. 4. Our results show that sea turtles do select for existing protected areas, specifically multi-use zones, while controlling for the effects of depth and primary productivity. However, our analysis revealed that turtles showed no selection for the no-take zones within MPAs, during either transiting or foraging. 5. These findings contribute to the existing literature base of MPA use for highly mobile, imperilled species and could inform management of existing MPAs or changes to zoning, specifically multi-use to no-take. Our use of a robust spatial modelling framework to evaluate habitat selection relative to MPAs could be incorporated into conservation planning to build MPA networks designed to accommodate migratory species.

AB  - Spatial and temporal distribution of seabird transiting and foraging at sea is an important consideration for marine conservation planning. Using at-sea observations of seabirds (n = 317), collected during the breeding season from 2012 to 2016, we built boosted regression tree (BRT) models to identify relationships between numerically dominant seabird species (red-footed booby, brown noddy, white tern, and wedge-tailed shearwater), geomorphology, oceanographic variability, and climate oscillation in the Chagos Archipelago. We documented positive relationships between red-footed booby and wedge-tailed shearwater abundance with the strength in the Indian Ocean Dipole, as represented by the Dipole Mode Index (6.7% and 23.7% contribution, respectively). The abundance of red-footed boobies, brown noddies, and white terns declined abruptly with greater distance to island (17.6%, 34.1%, and 41.1% contribution, respectively). We further quantified the effects of proximity to rat-free and rat-invaded islands on seabird distribution at sea and identified breaking point distribution thresholds. We detected areas of increased abundance at sea and habitat use-age under a scenario where rats are eradicated from invaded nearby islands and recolonized by seabirds. Following rat eradication, abundance at sea of red-footed booby, brown noddy, and white terns increased by 14%, 17%, and 3%, respectively, with no important increase detected for shearwaters. Our results have implication for seabird conservation and island restoration. Climate oscillations may cause shifts in seabird distribution, possibly through changes in regional productivity and prey distribution. Invasive species eradications and subsequent island recolonization can lead to greater access for seabirds to areas at sea, due to increased foraging or transiting through, potentially leading to distribution gains and increased competition. Our approach predicting distribution after successful eradications enables anticipatory threat mitigation in these areas, minimizing competition between colonies and thereby maximizing the risk of success and the conservation impact of eradication programs.

AB  - Assessment of the suitability of anthropogenic landscapes for wildlife species is crucial for setting priorities for biodiversity conservation. This study aimed to analyse the environmental suitability of a highly fragmented region of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the world's 25 recognized biodiversity hotspots, for forest bird species. Eight forest bird species were selected for the analyses, based on point counts (n = 122) conducted in April-September 2006 and January-March 2009. Six additional variables (landscape diversity, distance from forest and streams, aspect, elevation and slope) were modelled in Maxent for (1) actual and (2) simulated land cover, based on the forest expansion required by existing Brazilian forest legislation. Models were evaluated by bootstrap or jackknife methods and their performance was assessed by AUC, omission error, binomial probability or p value. All predictive models were statistically significant, with high AUC values and low omission errors. A small proportion of the actual landscape (24.41 +/- 6.31%) was suitable for forest bird species. The simulated landscapes lead to an increase of c. 30% in total suitable areas. In average, models predicted a small increase (23.69 +/- 6.95%) in the area of suitable native forest for bird species. Being close to forest increased the environmental suitability of landscapes for all bird species; landscape diversity was also a significant factor for some species. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that species distribution modelling (SDM) successfully predicted bird distribution across a heterogeneous landscape at fine spatial resolution, as all models were biologically relevant and statistically significant. The use of landscape variables as predictors contributed significantly to the results, particularly for species distributions over small extents and at fine scales. This is the first study to evaluate the environmental suitability of the remaining Brazilian Atlantic Forest for bird species in an agricultural landscape, and provides important additional data for regional environmental planning.

AB  - Context. Species Distribution Models (SDM) can be used to investigate and understand relationships between species occurrence and environmental variables, so as to predict potential distribution. These predictions can facilitate conservation actions and management decisions. Oxley Wild Rivers National Park (OWRNP) is regarded as an important stronghold for the threatened brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata), on the basis of the presence of the largest known metapopulation of the species. Adequate knowledge of the species' ecology and distribution in OWRNP is a key objective in the national recovery plan for the species occurring in the Park.
   Aims. To model distribution using key GIS-derived environmental factors for the brush-tailed rock-wallaby in OWRNP and to ground-truth its presence through field surveys in areas of high habitat suitability.
   Methods. We used Maxent to model the distribution of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby within OWRNP on the basis of 282 occurrence records collected from an online database, elicitation of informal records from experts, helicopter surveys and historic records. Environmental variables used in the analysis were aspect, distance to water, elevation, geology type, slope and vegetation type.
   Key results. Vegetation type (37.9%) was the highest contributing predictor of suitable habitat, whereas aspect (4.8%) contributed the least. The model produced an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.780. The model was able to discriminate between suitable and non-suitable habitat for brush-tailed rock-wallabies. Areas identified in our model as being highly suitable yielded eight new occurrence records during subsequent ground-truthing field surveys.
   Conclusions. Brush-tailed rock-wallaby distribution in OWRNP is primarily associated with vegetation type, followed by distance to water, elevation, geology, slope and aspect. Field surveys indicated that the model was able to identify areas of high habitat suitability.

AB  - Mineral licks are faunal attractors, whose distribution determines the structure and composition of Amazonian landscapes and the way they are used by wildlife and traditional communities. Research on the distribution of mineral licks is scarce, limiting the possibility of using them in conservation beyond local scales. Using the species distribution modeling framework, we predicted the distribution of suitable conditions for mineral licks in the Northwest Amazon, compiling localities from academic and traditional sources and using environmental variables associated with geology, geomorphology, edaphology, topography, and hydrology. Best models, selected according to evaluation metrics incorporated in the ENMeval "R" package, showed to be robust and predict sectors with different areas, but similar distributions. Suitable areas covered up to 14.6% of the study area and confirmed the association of mineral licks with the drainage system. The erosive capacities of the rivers and their roles in terms of sediment deposition allowed the generation of ideal conditions for the expression of mineral licks in past and present riparian zones. Closeness to salt deposits and the seacoast was also important, giving information about the underground and aboveground mineral availability, crucial aspects for mineral lick formation. Considering the extension and distribution of our predictions, we proposed its use as input for other spatial modeling exercises, for example, as part of a complex resistance matrix to evaluate ecological connectivity or as criteria to prioritize sectors for restoration in the Colombian Amazon, where it is imperative to consolidate functional networks to prevent isolation between the Amazon and Andes regions.

AB  - Species distribution models are commonly used to predict species responses to climate change. However, their usefulness in conservation planning and policy is controversial because they are difficult to validate across time and space. Here we capitalize on small mammal surveys repeated over a century in Yosemite National Park, USA, to assess accuracy of model predictions. Historical (1900-1940) climate, vegetation, and species occurrence data were used to develop single- and multi-species multivariate adaptive regression spline distribution models for three species of chipmunk. Models were projected onto the current (1980-2007) environmental surface and then tested against modern field resurveys of each species. We evaluated models both within and between time periods and found that even with the inclusion of biotic predictors, climate alone is the dominant predictor explaining the distribution of the study species within a time period. However, climate was not consistently an adequate predictor of the distributional change observed in all three species across time. For two of the three species, climate alone or climate and vegetation models showed good predictive performance across time. The stability of the distribution from the past to present observed in the third species, however, was not predicted by our modeling approach. Our results demonstrate that correlative distribution models are useful in understanding species' potential responses to environmental change, but also show how changes in species-environment correlations through time can limit the predictive performance of models.

AB  - Protected areas are among the most widely accepted methods to set aside biodiversity from their most impinging threats. However, protected areas are not always located such that their positive impacts over biodiversity are maximized. This drawback is especially significant and uncontrolled when intense climate-change dynamics stresses local biodiversity equilibrium. This study aims to weight plausible evolutive scenarios (up to 2040) of PA-effectiveness to secure the most suitable climates for 94 vertebrate species in Central Mexico, a region that, historically, has faced large biodiversity turnover rates. Effectiveness was appraised at two scales. For a set of species, effectiveness expresses the spatial matching of established protected areas (ePAs) with top priority areas (T17) obtained from an optmised area-selection protocol. For each single species, effectiveness relates the predicted trends of climate suitable areas within ePAs/T17 with trends outside ePAs/T17. Results show that aprox.54% of ePAs area occur within T17 and species present variable responses, with suitability gains up to 10% and potential climate suitability losses of aprox.30% within ePAs. A considerable high amount of T17 (aprox.74%) is left unprotected. By assuming the high-valued component of past conservation efforts, this study delivers a double-guidance for planners and decision-makers. First, it pinpoints the ePAs that will demand further conservation investments in the upcoming years. Second, it identifies the unprotected regions where most active conservation actions are needed to supplement ePAs for a climate-effective protected area network. The framework here-proposed gives decision-makers the means to undertake effective and robust decisions in a dynamic and uncertain world.

AB  - In recent years, scientific investigations on the effectiveness of Protected Areas (PM) in conserving biodiversity and sustaining ecosystem functions under the impact of climate change have increasingly received more attention from researchers and park managers. In this study, we used a combination of species distribution modelling (SDM) and spatial hierarchical systematic conservation planning technique to delineate and prioritize areas for endemic plant species conservation under current and future (2050s, 2070s) climate conditions in Sikkim Himalaya. Data on endemic plant species occurrence were sourced from our already published studies and their potential suitable habitats under current and future climates were modelled using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) SDM. The MaxEnt habitat suitability projections of species were used in Zonation software to identify priority conservation areas in Sikkim Himalaya. We found that the existing PA network in the region was inadequate in conserving the endemic plant diversity either in the current or future climate scenarios. Based on our results, we propose addition of 896 square kilometres (sq km) to the existing PA network in the study area to ensure meaningful conservation goals. Additionally, we propose creation of 3 new PM (Yumsedong, Lachen and Chungthang) and the need for expanding the boundaries of existing PM (Maenam, Fambong Lho and Barsey) in the study area. Our analyses show that to mitigate the effects of ensuing climate change, a single large PA with wide geographic and elevational extents instead of several smaller PM would be a more prudent strategy for conserving the plant diversity in the Himalaya.

AB  - The breeding system and mating strategy of a species are at the heart of its behavioral ecology and part of determining its population dynamics. Thus, understanding breeding and mating behavior, and its flexibility, is important for accurate population modeling and successful conservation management. Here, we combine previous work with species-specific data and phylogenetic context to shine the spotlight on the breeding system of North Island (NI) brown kiwi, Apteryx mantelli, in a conservation context. The NI brown kiwi is of wide interest as a ratite, which are known for their variable breeding biology both within and between species, and its dire need of conservation management. With the aid of data from a long-term study in a rare, high-density population, we conclude that, although NI brown kiwi have several features characteristic of monogamous bird species (substantial investment in offspring by both parents, long-life expectancy, and well-developed sense of olfaction), it has as many that are consistent with potential for polygamy (uneven quality and distribution of resources, long and asynchronous breeding season, super-precocial chicks, and non-monogamous relatives). Consequently, we suggest that (1) the breeding system of NI brown kiwi is more flexible than has been widely recognized, and (2) further study of NI brown kiwi mating behavior would greatly benefit its conservation planning. Specifically, the prevalence of polygamy will directly affect genetic admixture, maintaining of genetic diversity, and distribution of parentage-all crucial factors influencing translocation success and genetic rescue. We argue that the NI brown kiwi study system could contribute to the increased incorporation of behavioral aspects in conservation management, and we provide suggestions for informative studies that would facilitate this.

AB  - The distribution of mobile species in dynamic systems can vary greatly over time and space. Estimating their population size and geographic range can be problematic and affect the accuracy of conservation assessments. Scarce data on mobile species and the resources they need can also limit the type of analytical approaches available to derive such estimates. We quantified change in availability and use of key ecological resources required for breeding for a critically endangered nomadic habitat specialist, the Swift Parrot (Lathamus discolor). We compared estimates of occupied habitat derived from dynamic presence-background (i.e., presence-only data) climatic models with estimates derived from dynamic occupancy models that included a direct measure of food availability. We then compared estimates that incorporate fine-resolution spatial data on the availability of key ecological resources (i.e., functional habitats) with more common approaches that focus on broader climatic suitability or vegetation cover (due to the absence of fine-resolution data). The occupancy models produced significantly (P < 0.001) smaller (up to an order of magnitude) and more spatially discrete estimates of the total occupied area than climate-based models. The spatial location and extent of the total area occupied with the occupancy models was highly variable between years (131 and 1498 km(2)). Estimates accounting for the area of functional habitats were significantly smaller (2-58% [SD 16]) than estimates based only on the total area occupied. An increase or decrease in the area of one functional habitat (foraging or nesting) did not necessarily correspond to an increase or decrease in the other. Thus, an increase in the extent of occupied area may not equate to improved habitat quality or function. We argue these patterns are typical for mobile resource specialists but often go unnoticed because of limited data over relevant spatial and temporal scales and lack of spatial data on the availability of key resources. Understanding changes in the relative availability of functional habitats is crucial to informing conservation planning and accurately assessing extinction risk for mobile resource specialists.

AB  - Ecologists and paleontologists often rely on higher taxon surrogates instead of complete inventories of biological diversity. Despite their intrinsic appeal, the performance of these surrogates has been markedly inconsistent across empirical studies, to the extent that there is no consensus on appropriate taxonomic resolution (i.e., whether genus- or family-level categories are more appropriate) or their overall usefulness. A framework linking the reliability of higher taxon surrogates to biogeographic setting would allow for the interpretation of previously published work and provide some needed guidance regarding the actual application of these surrogates in biodiversity assessments, conservation planning, and the interpretation of the fossil record. We developed a mathematical model to show how taxonomic diversity, community structure, and sampling effort together affect three measures of higher taxon performance: the correlation between species and higher taxon richness, the relative shapes and asymptotes of species and higher taxon accumulation curves, and the efficiency of higher taxa in a complementarity-based reserve-selection algorithm. In our model, higher taxon surrogates performed well in communities in which a few common species were most abundant, and less well in communities with many equally abundant species. Furthermore, higher taxon surrogates performed well when there was a small mean and variance in the number of species per higher taxa. We also show that empirically measured species-higher-taxon correlations can be partly spurious (i.e., a mathematical artifact), except when the species accumulation curve has reached an asymptote. This particular result is of considerable practical interest given the widespread use of rapid survey methods in biodiversity assessment and the application of higher taxon methods to taxa in which species accumulation curves rarely reach an asymptote, e.g., insects.

AB  - Conservation practitioners are increasingly looking to species translocations as a tool to recover imperiled taxa. Quantitative predictions of where animals are likely to move when released into new areas would allow managers to better address the social, institutional, and ecological dimensions of conservation translocations. Using >5 million California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) occurrence locations from 75 individuals, we developed and tested circuit-based models to predict condor movement away from release sites. We found that circuit-based models of electrical current were well calibrated to the distribution of condor movement data in southern and central California (continuous Boyce Index = 0.86 and 0.98, respectively). Model calibration was improved in southern California when additional nodes were added to the circuit to account for nesting and feeding areas, where condor movement densities were higher (continuous Boyce Index = 0.95). Circuit-based projections of electrical current around a proposed release site in northern California comported with the condor's historical distribution and revealed that, initially, condor movements would likely be most concentrated in northwestern California and southwest Oregon. Landscape linkage maps, which incorporate information on landscape resistance, complement circuit-based models and aid in the identification of specific avenues for population connectivity or areas where movement between populations may be constrained. We found landscape linkages in the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada provided the most connectivity to a proposed reintroduction site in northern California. Our methods are applicable to conservation translocations for other species and are flexible, allowing researchers to develop multiple competing hypotheses when there are uncertainties about landscape or social attractants, or uncertainties in the landscape conductance surface.

AB  - Islands are of high interest for conservationists, due to their great biodiversity within discrete territories. Nonetheless, several mechanisms of plant diversity patterns are unknown, especially for continental islands. In this paper, we explored how endemic and alien vascular plant species richness and the compositional dissimilarity of small Mediterranean continental islands vary according to factors related to human activities, geography/landscape, and climate. Actions for endemic plant conservation were also prioritised according to both endemic and alien components. To this aim, data of endemic and alien plant species for forty islands of Sardinia were considered. Species-area residuals, which express the actual species composition free of area-effects, were modelled using 19 variables related to anthropogenic, geographic/landscape and climatic domains (group of factors). The geographic/landscape domain appeared to be important for both endemic and alien species richness and compositional dissimilarity, while the climatic one was especially relevant for alien species richness. The anthropogenic domain was mostly important for the compositional dissimilarity of aliens and for the endemic species richness. Actions for endemic plant conservation were of high priority for 14 islands; 11 of which are located off the northwest coast of Sardinia. Our research confirms that the Mediterranean small islands of Sardinia are plant endemism hotspots prone to alien invasion. Our findings suggest that removing anthropogenic disturbances is not sufficient to prevent plant invasions. Other factors related to climatic and geographic/landscape domains are as or more important in determining endemic and alien plant composition.

AB  - Understanding threatened species diversity is important for long-term conservation planning. Geodiversitythe diversity of Earth surface materials, forms, and processesmay be a useful biodiversity surrogate for conservation and have conservation value itself. Geodiversity and species richness relationships have been demonstrated; establishing whether geodiversity relates to threatened species' diversity and distribution pattern is a logical next step for conservation. We used 4 geodiversity variables (rock-type and soil-type richness, geomorphological diversity, and hydrological feature diversity) and 4 climatic and topographic variables to model threatened species diversity across 31 of Finland's national parks. We also analyzed rarity-weighted richness (a measure of site complementarity) of threatened vascular plants, fungi, bryophytes, and all species combined. Our 1-km(2) resolution data set included 271 threatened species from 16 major taxa. We modeled threatened species richness (raw and rarity weighted) with boosted regression trees. Climatic variables, especially the annual temperature sum above 5 degrees C, dominated our models, which is consistent with the critical role of temperature in this boreal environment. Geodiversity added significant explanatory power. High geodiversity values were consistently associated with high threatened species richness across taxa. The combined effect of geodiversity variables was even more pronounced in the rarity-weighted richness analyses (except for fungi) than in those for species richness. Geodiversity measures correlated most strongly with species richness (raw and rarity weighted) of threatened vascular plants and bryophytes and were weakest for molluscs, lichens, and mammals. Although simple measures of topography improve biodiversity modeling, our results suggest that geodiversity data relating to geology, landforms, and hydrology are also worth including. This reinforces recent arguments that conserving nature's stage is an important principle in conservation.

AB  - The demand for food resources is increasing quickly because human populations are growing; therefore, food security may become one of the largest human challenges of this century. Crop wild relatives (CWRs) are the most valuable plant genetic resources (PGR) for the conservation of genetic diversity in crops. However, climate change is an added pressure on biodiversity, particularly on this valuable group of plants. It is predicted that more than 50% of this group may be lost by 2055 as a result of the effects of climate change. Iran ranks high in the world in its conservation priorities for CWRs. This study investigates the impacts of climate change on Aegilops L. as important CWRs. MaxEnt was applied to predict the spatial distribution of seven Aegilops species under different climatic scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) of 2050 and 2080. According to the findings, all species exhibited reduction or expansion responses under all of the above-mentioned climatic scenarios. However, the range change was negative for some species (i.e., Aegilops columnaris, Aegilops cylindrica, Aegilops speltoides, Aegilops tauschii [in all scenarios of 2050 and 2080], and Aegilops kotschyi [RCP 2.6 2050 and 2080]), and positive for others (i.e., Aegilops crassa, Aegilops triuncialis [in all scenarios of 2050 and 2080], and Aegilops kotschyi [RCP 8.5 2050 and 2080]). The results of this study emphasize the need for conservation plans for the country's genetic resources, including regular monitoring and assessment of ecological and demographic changes.

AB  - Ecological systems are inherently complex. The processes that affect the distributions of animals and plants operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales, presenting a unique challenge for the development and coordination of effective conservation strategies, particularly for wide-ranging species. In order to study ecological systems across scales,. data must be collected at fine resolutions across broad spatial and temporal extents. Crowdsourcing has emerged as an efficient way to gather these data by engaging large numbers of people to record observations. However, data gathered by crowdsourced projects are often biased due to the opportunistic approach of data collection. In this article, we propose a general class of models called AdaSTEM (for adaptive spatiotemporal exploratory models) that are designed to meet these challenges by adapting to multiple scales while exploiting variation, in data density common with crowdsourced data. To illustrate the use of AdaSTEM, we produce intraseasonal distribution estimates of long-distance migrations across the Western Hemisphere using data from eBird, a citizen science project that utilizes volunteers to collect observations of birds. Subsequently, model diagnostics are used to quantify and visualize the scale and quality of distribution estimates. This analysis shows how AdaSTEM can automatically adapt to complex spatiotemporal processes across a range of scales, thus providing essential information for full-life cycle conservation planning of broadly distributed species, communities, and ecosystems.

AB  - BackgroundThe Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus muta japonica lives in the alpine zones of central Japan, which is the southern limit of the global distribution for this species. This species is highly dependent on alpine habitats, which are considered vulnerable to rapid climate change. This study aimed to assess the impact of climate change on potential L. muta japonica habitat based on predicted changes to alpine vegetation, to identify population vulnerability under future climatic conditions for conservation planning. We developed species distribution models, which considered the structure of the alpine ecosystem by incorporating spatial hierarchy on specific environmental factors to assess the potential habitats for L. muta japonica under current and future climates. We used 24 general circulation models (GCMs) for 2081-2100 as future climate conditions.ResultsThe predicted potential habitat for L. muta japonica was similar to the actual distribution of the territories in the study area of Japan's northern Alps (36.25-36.5 degrees N, 137.5-137.7 degrees E). Future potential habitat for L. muta japonica was projected to decrease to 0.4% of the current potential habitat in the median of occurrence probabilities under 24 GCMs, due to a decrease in alpine vegetation communities. Some potential habitats in the central and northwestern part of the study area were predicted to be sustained in the future, depending on the GCMs.ConclusionsOur model results predicted that the potential habitats for L. muta japonica in Japan's northern Alps, which provides core habitat for this subspecies, would be vulnerable by 2081-2100. Small sustainable habitats may serve as refugia, facilitating the survival of L. muta japonica populations under future climatic conditions. Impact assessment studies of the effect of climate change on L. muta japonica habitats at a nationwide scale are urgently required to establish effective conservation planning for this species, which includes identifying candidate areas for assisted migration as an adaptive strategy.

AB  - Relative to target species, priority conservation species occur rarely in fishery interactions, resulting in imbalanced, overdispersed data. We present Ensemble Random Forests (ERFs) as an intuitive extension of the Random Forest algorithm to handle rare event bias. Each Random Forest receives individual stratified randomly sampled training/test sets, then down-samples the majority class for each decision tree. Results are averaged across Random Forests to generate an ensemble prediction. Through simulation, we show that ERFs outperform Random Forest with and without down-sampling, as well as with the synthetic minority over-sampling technique, for highly class imbalanced to balanced datasets. Spatial covariance greatly impacts ERFs' perceived performance, as shown through simulation and case studies. In case studies from the Hawaii deep-set longline fishery, giant manta ray Mobula birostris syn. Manta birostris and scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini presence had high spatial covariance and high model test performance, while false killer whale Pseudorca crassidens had low spatial covariance and low model test performance. Overall, we find ERFs have 4 advantages: (1) reduced successive partitioning effects; (2) prediction uncertainty propagation; (3) better accounting for interacting covariates through balancing; and (4) minimization of false positives, as the majority of Random Forests within the ensemble vote correctly. As ERFs can readily mitigate rare event bias without requiring large presence sample sizes or imparting considerable balancing bias, they are likely to be a valuable tool in bycatch and species distribution modeling, as well as spatial conservation planning, especially for protected species where presence can be rare.

AB  - The kelp species Laminaria hyperborea constitutes highly productive kelp forest systems hosting a broad diversity of species and providing the basis for commercial kelp harvesting and, through its productivity, the fishing industry. Spatial planning and management of this important habitat and resource needs to be based on distribution maps and detailed knowledge of the main factors influencing the distribution. However, in countries with a long and complex coastline, such as Norway, detailed mapping is practically and economically difficult. Consequently, alternative methods are required. Based on modelled and field-measured geophysical variables and presence/absence data of L. hyperborea, a spatial predictive probability model for kelp distribution is developed. The influence of depth, slope, terrain curvature, light exposure, wave exposure, and current speed on the distribution of L. hyperborea are modelled using a generalized additive model. Using the Akaike Information Criterion, we found that the most important geophysical factors explaining the distribution of kelp were depth, terrain curvature, and wave and light exposure. The resulting predictive model was very reliable, showing good ability to predict the presence and absence of kelp.

AB  - Although analyses of species spatial distributions and genetic variation, creation of Red Lists and reserve design studies predominate in the plant conservation biology literature, in any conservation project they should be only a second step succeeding population demographic assessments. Demographic studies and analysis of the species regeneration niche are vital because only such studies can identify the factors that determine the population fate, the stages of the life-cycle that are most important for the population viability, and the regeneration niche parameters. Using published demographic data, we modelled a situation when either seed production or survival of emerging seedlings occur intermittently. We found that when recruitment occurs intermittently, the population size frequency distribution deviates from inverse J-curve, but no gaps in size classes are observed unless seed germination and/or survival of emerging seedlings are extremely rare events. Then we use these results to interprete population demography of ten threatened tree species from Wuling Mountains, China, and come to a conclusion that their demographic structure can not be a result of natural processes. Taken together, our results show how important even a single population census can be if it includes counting seedlings and saplings, for determining population viability and appropriate population management. Two types of populations must be recognized as requiring different managements strategies: with regeneration naturally occurring (even if limited) and with no seedlings/saplings present. Populations from the first category can be subjected to such management actions as reinforcement using plant material of appropriate origin. Planting conspecifics can boost regeneration through increased seed production. However, reinforcement will make no sense in populations in which lack of regeneration is due to reasons other than seed limitation. In such populations long-term monitoring and study program must be established to understand the reasons for lack of regeneration.

AB  - Populations of Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) are declining in Canada's Atlantic Northern Forest. Land conservancies and government agencies are interested in identifying areas to protect populations, while some timber companies wish to manage forests to minimize impacts on Canada Warbler and potentially create future habitat. We developed seven conservation planning scenarios using Zonation software to prioritize candidate areas for permanent land conservation (4 scenarios) or responsible forest management (minimizing species removal during forest harvesting while promoting colonization of regenerated forest; 3 scenarios). Factors used to prioritize areas included Canada Warbler population density, connectivity to protected areas, future climate suitability, anthropogenic disturbance, and recent Canada Warbler observations. We analyzed each scenario for three estimates of natal dispersal distance (5, 10, and 50 km). We found that scenarios assuming large dispersal distances prioritized a few large hotspots, while low dispersal distance scenarios prioritized smaller, broadly distributed areas. For all scenarios, efficiency (proportion of current Canada Warbler population retained per unit area) declined with higher dispersal distance estimates and inclusion of climate change effects in the scenario. Using low dispersal distance scenarios in decision-making offers a more conservative approach to maintaining this species at risk. Given the differences among the scenarios, we encourage conservation planners to evaluate the reliability of dispersal estimates, the influence of habitat connectivity, and future climate suitability when prioritizing areas for conservation.

AB  - About a quarter of the world's plant species is under threat of extinction and depletion, often due to accelerated human activity, in addition to impacts of climatic changes. In order to preserve plant species against the extinction risk and keep for biodiversity, detailed knowledge about the requirements of plant habitats, as well as, the identification of most endangered sites should be determined, and the possible plants conservation means should be planned. Using accurate modeling for the distributions of plants is important in different applications of plant conservation and the environment. In the current study, Ebenus armitagei and Periploca angustifolia were selected as a study targets because they were classified as endangered species. In the current study, a model has been developed to estimating endangered plants distributive areas in Wadi Al-Afreet area. The selected plant species are, expected to disappear. The suggested model is based on finding the links between known botanical phenomena and the environmental variables. The model used leads show the distribution of environmental variables (i.e absolute and relative cover and density, height and diameter) of the two endangered species. It helps also too understand the soil impacts on plant distribution, thus some soil parameters (Total Dissolved Solids TDS), cations (Na+, K+, Ca+2 and Mg+2), pH, sand and silt + clay) were analyzed. The used model allows to predict the sites where the two endangered plants are expected to disappear along wadi Al-Afreet. The results showed that most threatened locations for Ebenus armitagei were predicted in the South-Eastern part of wadi Al-Afreet and the eastern part of midstream whereas the west-south part including upstream and midstream parts are less affected. The most threatened locations for Periploca angustifolia were predicted in the midstream part of wadi Al-Afreet whereas the upstream part had the least effects. Downstream location appeared ideal for P. angustifolia distribution. Results showed that the most important plant and soil characteristics that affected and controlled the distribution of plants and vegetation coverage structure in Wadi Al-Afreet are Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), silt and clay, pH and Mg+(2). The model can help in setting priorities for plants to restore their natural habitat for more effective plant conservation and restoration.

AB  - Dynamic models for range expansion provide a promising tool for assessing species' capacity to respond to climate change by shifting their ranges to new areas. However, these models include a number of uncertainties which may affect how successfully they can be applied to climate change oriented conservation planning. We used RangeShifter, a novel dynamic and individual-based modelling platform, to study two potential sources of such uncertainties: the selection of land cover data and the parameterization of key life-history traits. As an example, we modelled the range expansion dynamics of two butterfly species, one habitat specialist (Maniola jurtina) and one generalist (Issoria lathonia). Our results show that projections of total population size, number of occupied grid cells and the mean maximal latitudinal range shift were all clearly dependent on the choice made between using CORINE land cover data vs. using more detailed grassland data from three alternative national databases. Range expansion was also sensitive to the parameterization of the four considered life-history traits (magnitude and probability of long-distance dispersal events, population growth rate and carrying capacity), with carrying capacity and magnitude of long-distance dispersal showing the strongest effect. Our results highlight the sensitivity of dynamic species population models to the selection of existing land cover data and to uncertainty in the model parameters and indicate that these need to be carefully evaluated before the models are applied to conservation planning.

AB  - Ecological surveys provide the basic information needed to estimate differences in species richness among assemblages. Comparable estimates of the differences in richness between assemblages require equal mean species detectabilities across assemblages. However, mean species detectabilities are often unknown, typically low, and potentially different from one assemblage to another. As a result, inferences regarding differences in species richness among assemblages can be biased. We evaluated how well three methods used to produce comparable estimates of species richness achieved equal mean species detectabilities across diverse assemblages: rarefaction, statistical estimators, and standardization of sampling effort on mean taxonomic similarity among replicate samples (MRS). We used simulated assemblages to mimic a wide range of species-occurrence distributions and species richness to compare the performance of these three methods. Inferences regarding differences in species richness based on rarefaction were highly biased when richness estimates were compared among assemblages with distinctly different species-occurrence distributions. Statistical estimators only marginally reduced this bias. Standardization on MRS yielded the most comparable estimates of differences in species richness. These findings have important implications for our understanding of species-richness patterns, inferences drawn from biological monitoring data, and planning for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - At the European Level, SACs (Special Areas of Conservation) are considered among the most reliable tools for increasing the efficiency of protective actions and to identify species vulnerability hotspots across spatial scales. Nevertheless, SACs may fail in their scope when design and management are not dynamically adapted to meet ecologicalprinciples. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of relevant key species, such as common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), is crucial in order to achieve the objective of the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC), and is a fundamental step in the process of Marine Spatial Planning. From this perspective, new data and analysis are required to produce forecasts at spatiotemporal scales relevant to individual organisms. Here, we propose a study based on a MaxEnt modelling exercise to define the spatial distributional patterns of bottlenose dolphin at different temporal scales (over periods of multiple months and years) to increase the ecological understanding of how the species use the eco-space, and to delimit boundaries of a SAC in the waters surrounding Lampedusa Island, a hotspot for cetaceans in the Southern Mediterranean Sea. We show that bottlenose dolphin prefer shallower feeding grounds that often host complex and rich food webs, but also that this preference is constrained by disturbance factors such as boat traffic. As sea-related tourism, including dolphin-watching, is one of the most important economic activities of the island, the study results can be used from a management perspective, in order to reach a solution regarding two apparently conflicting needs - species protection and economic development.

AB  - Species distribution models are key to spatially explicit conservation and management plans. Modeling distributions using data collected by the public has become increasingly popular; however, it is vital to evaluate their advantages and limitations. We investigated whether distribution models developed using opportunistic data (public reports) are congruent with those developed using professional data, while evaluating two strategies to remove spatial biases: data filtering and covariate removal. We compared GPS telemetry data (598 locations, 2010-2018) with public reports (1384 locations, 2016-2019) of American black bears (Ursus americanus) in Missouri (USA). Reports were subdivided into unfiltered reports, filtered reports (more reliable), and verified reports (confirmed by state agency staff). Each data set was modeled twice, with and without road covariates. Each distribution model was an ensemble of three machine-learning methods. Models using filtered or verified reports and excluding road covariates were most similar to the telemetry model, both in spatial extent and spatial suitability patterns. However, the report-derived distributions included several times more agriculture and developed land. The inclusion of roads resulted in spurious patterns and consistently reduced the predicted distribution area by similar to 10%. Elevation and vegetation productivity were consistently selected as the most important variables, regardless of data source and covariates included in models, but the report-derived distributions included more agriculture and developed lands. Filtering data for reliability and removing covariates related to spatial biases resulted in models suitable to estimate broad black bear distribution, though differences remained that could represent different segments of the bear population (e.g., dispersing vs. established). Verification was not essential to develop suitable models if reports are filtered for reliability, important for areas that lack professionally collected data to model species distributions.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Western Tragopan is a globally threatened pheasant species of the Western Himalayan Biodiversity Hotspot, whereas protected areas are tools used to protect species and their habitat. In this study, we selected protected areas falling within the potential habitat of the Western Tragopan and evaluated their management effectiveness to understand their role in the protection of the pheasants of global conservation concern. Our results show that only Machiara National Park scored just above 40% (indicating relatively weak management), 22 of the PAs fell within the 25-50% quantile (indicating weak management), and 3 scored below 25% (indicating poor management). PAs within the species distributional range covered 92,387 ha which is only 2% of the total potential habitat of the tragopan. Thus, we concluded that protected areas are not sufficiently contributing to protecting species and its habitat and need to revise their plans. We further recommended establishment of more protected areas within the potential habitat of the species to help protect this iconic species of Western Himalaya.
   Protected areas are a critical tool to conserve biodiversity in the face of the global crisis of species extinction. Here, we present the first ever management effectiveness assessment of Pakistan's Protected Areas (PAs). We link these assessments to the delivery of conservation outcomes focusing on the threatened Western Tragopan (Tragopan melanocephalus) endemic to Pakistan and India. We used two approaches, first mapping the spatial distribution of potential habitat coverage using machine learning ensemble models and second, an assessment of the management effectiveness of protected areas. Our results show that only Machiara National Park scored just above 40% (indicating relatively weak management), 22 of the PAs fell within the 25-50% quantile (indicating weak management), and 3 scored below 25% (indicating poor management). PAs within the species distributional range covered 92,387 ha which is only 2% of the total potential habitat of the Tragopan. Scoring of Planning element was insufficient both in term of the site and species. Likewise, inputs (e.g., research and monitoring program, staff numbers, staff training, current budget, security of budget, and management after process) were also inadequate. Finally, we recommend the establishment of more protected areas within the species potential habitat and inclusion of species-specific plans in Pakistan's PAs management.

AB  - Conservation planning and management typically require accurate and spatially explicit data at scales that are relevant for conservation objectives. In marine conservation, these data are often combined with spatial analytical techniques to produce marine habitat maps. While marine habitat mapping is increasingly used to inform conservation efforts, this field is still relatively young and its methods are rapidly evolving. Because conservation efforts do not always specify standards or guidelines for the production of habitat maps, results can vary dramatically. As representations of real environmental characteristics, habitat maps are highly sensitive to how they are produced. In this review paper, I present four concepts that are known to cause variation in spatial representation and prediction of habitats: the methodology used, the quality and scale of the data, and the choice of variables in regards to fitness for use. I then discuss the potential antinomy associated with the use of habitat maps in conservation: while habitat maps have become an invaluable tool to inform and assist decision-making, maps of the same area built using different methods and data may provide dissimilar representations, thus providing different information and possibly leading to different decisions. Exploring the theories and methods that have proved effective in terrestrial conservation and the spatial sciences, and how they can be integrated in marine habitat mapping practices, could help improve maps used to support marine conservation efforts and result in more reliable products to inform conservation decisions. Having a strong, consistent, transparent, repeatable, and science-based protocol for data collection and mapping is essential for effectively supporting decision-makers in developing conservation and management plans. The development of user-friendly tools to assist in the application of such protocol is crucial to a widespread improvement in practices. I discuss the potential to use interactive and collaborative Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to encourage the conservation and management community, from data collectors and mapmakers to decision-makers, to move toward a digital resilience and to develop such science-based protocol. Until standards and protocols are developed, habitat maps should always be interpreted with care, and the methods and metadata associated with their production should always be explicitly stated.

AB  - Balancing society's competing needs of development and conservation requires careful consideration of tradeoffs. Renewable energy development and biodiversity conservation are often considered beneficial environmental goals. The direct footprint and disturbance of renewable energy, however, can displace species' habitat and negatively impact populations and natural communities if sited without ecological consideration. Offsets have emerged as a potentially useful tool to mitigate residual impacts after trying to avoid, minimize, or restore affected sites. Yet the problem of efficiently designing a set of offset sites becomes increasingly complex where many species or many sites are involved. Spatial conservation prioritization tools are designed to handle this problem, but have seen little application to offset siting and analysis. To address this need we designed an offset siting support tool for the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) of California, and present a case study of hypothetical impacts from solar development in the Western Mojave subsection. We compare two offset scenarios designed to mitigate a hypothetical 15,331 ha derived from proposed utility-scale solar energy development (USSED) projects. The first scenario prioritizes offsets based precisely on impacted features, while the second scenario offsets impacts to maximize biodiversity conservation gains in the region. The two methods only agree on 28% of their prioritized sites and differ in meeting species-specific offset goals. Differences between the two scenarios highlight the importance of clearly specifying choices and priorities for offset siting and mitigation in general. Similarly, the effects of background climate and land use change may lessen the durability or effectiveness of offsets if not considered. Our offset siting support tool was designed specifically for the DRECP area, but with minor code modification could work well in other offset analyses, and could provide continuing support for a potentially innovative mitigation solution to environmental impacts.

AB  - Ecological niche modeling (and the related species distribution modeling) has been used as a tool with which to assess potential impacts of climate change processes on geographic distributions of species. However, the factors introducing variation into niche modeling outcomes are not well understood: To this end, we used seven algorithms to develop models (Maxent, GARP, BIOCLIM, artificial neural networks, support-vector machines, climate envelope, and environmental distance) to estimate the potential geographic distribution of olives (Olea europaea sensu lato, including Olea ferruginea) under two climatic data sets (current 2000 and future 2050). Five general circulation models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios were used as predictor variables in future projections of the geographic potential of this species; models were fit at global extents (100 spatial resolution) but transferred and interpreted for a region of particular interest in Central Asia, which largely avoids problems with truncation of niche estimates. We found marked differences among approaches in predicted distributions and model performance, as well as in the future distributional pattern reconstructed, from one algorithm to another. These general approaches, when model-to-model variation is managed appropriately, appear promising in predicting the potential geographic distribution of O. europaea sensu lato and thus can be an effective tool in restoration and conservation planning for wild populations, as well as possible commercial plantations of this species.

AB  - Here we applied phylogenetically based conservation analyses using a novel multivariate approach to better evaluate the effects of human land use on different primate lineages worldwide. Using a 1' x 1' grid, we obtained information on primate species distribution and the cover of six land use categories (Urban, Village, Cropland, Rangeland, Seminatural and Wild). We synthesized the phylogenetic composition into principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure. We correlated phylogenetic composition and land use in each region, and assessed statistical significance via null model. In America, the Atelidae clade was associated to areas with larger coverage of villages whereas Pitheciidae was found on areas with higher cover of wildlands. Moreover, we found some Atelidae, Callitrichidae and Pitheciidae species to be associated with seminatural areas, while other Alouatta and Callicebus species were more related with higher coverage of rangelands. In Madagascar, Lemuridae was negatively associated with wild areas. Africa did not show any statistically significant association between clades and land use. Asia had an intense association of some Cercopithecidae species with high coverage of villages. Primate lineages are currently facing different land use pressures, which would imply in the need of clade-specific conservation planning.

AB  - Aim: Climate is considered a major driver of species distributions. Long-term climatic means are commonly used as predictors in correlative species distribution models (SDMs). However, this coarse temporal resolution does not reflect local conditions that populations experience, such as short-term weather extremes, which may have a strong impact on population dynamics and local distributions. We here compare the performance of climate- and weather-based predictors in regional SDMs and their influence on future predictions, which are increasingly used in conservation planning.
   Location: South-western Germany.
   Methods: We built different SDMs for 20 Orthoptera species based on three predictor sets at a regional scale for current and future climate scenarios. We calculated standard bioclimatic variables and yearly and seasonal sets of climate change indicating variables of weather extremes. As the impact of extreme events may be stronger for habitat specialists than for generalists, we distinguished species' degrees of specialization. We computed linear mixed-effects models to identify significant effects of algorithm, predictor set and specialization on model performance and calculated correlations and geographical niche overlap between spatial predictions.
   Results: Current predictions were rather similar among all predictor sets, but highly variable for future climate scenarios. Bioclimatic and seasonal weather predictors performed slightly better than yearly weather predictors, though performance differences were minor. We found no evidence that specialists are more sensitive to weather extremes than generalists.
   Main conclusions: For future projections of species distributions, SDM predictor selection should not solely be based on current performances and predictions. As long-term climate and short-term weather predictors represent different environmental drivers of a species' distribution, we argue to interpret diverging future projections as complements. Even if similar current performances and predictions might imply their equivalency, favouring one predictor set neglects important aspects of future distributions and might mislead conservation decisions based on them.

AB  - Climate change is acting to reallocate biomes, shift the distribution of species, and alter community assemblages in Alaska. Predictions regarding how these changes will affect the biodiversity and interspecific relationships of small mammals are necessary to pro-actively inform conservation planning. We used a set of online occurrence records and machine learning methods to create bioclimatic envelope models for 17 species of small mammals (rodents and shrews) across Alaska. Models formed the basis for sets of species-specific distribution maps for 2010 and were projected forward using the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) A2 scenario to predict distributions of the same species for 2100. We found that distributions of cold-climate, northern, and interior small mammal species experienced large decreases in area while shifting northward, upward in elevation, and inland across the state. In contrast, many southern and continental species expanded throughout Alaska, and also moved down-slope and toward the coast. Statewide community assemblages remained constant for 15 of the 17 species, but distributional shifts resulted in novel species assemblages in several regions. Overall biodiversity patterns were similar for both time frames, but followed general species distribution movement trends. Biodiversity losses occurred in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and Seward Peninsula while the Beaufort Coastal Plain and western Brooks Range experienced modest gains in species richness as distributions shifted to form novel assemblages. Quantitative species distribution and biodiversity change projections should help land managers to develop adaptive strategies for conserving dispersal corridors, small mammal biodiversity, and ecosystem functionality into the future.

AB  - Although birds are among the best studied taxa, many of the globally threatened species lack the information required to fully assess their conservation status and needs. One such species is the Anjouan Scops Owl Otus capnodes which was presumed extinct until its rediscovery to science in 1992. Based on the limited extent and decline of the moist forests in the highlands of Anjouan in the Comoro Islands, a population size of only 100-200 pairs was estimated and the species was classified as 'Critically Endangered'. The current study is the first comprehensive survey ever conducted on this species, and aimed to establish the current distribution and population size. Point counts with distance sampling were conducted across the agroforestry and forest zones of Anjouan in both a dry and wet season. A niche suitability model predicted the species distribution to be wider than expected with owls observed as low as 300 m altitude and in highly modified agroforestry habitats. However, the encounter rate in natural relatively undisturbed forest was significantly greater than in other habitats. The wider than expected geographic range of O. capnodes supports a possible downlisting of this species on the IUCN Red List to 'Endangered'. Population size was found to be far greater than previously thought, at approximately 3,450 individual owls in the dry season and 5,450 in the wet season. These results show the importance of investing in robust surveys of poorly known and cryptic bird species, and provide up to date and important information for landscape scale conservation planning in the Comoros Islands.

AB  - Aim Bioclimatic envelope models (BEMs) for seven economically important tree species in Europe were independently validated using a hindcasting approach and fossil pollen records spanning the last 1000 years, including the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the 20th century (PRES). The aim was to determine the accuracy of combining BEMs and palaeoecological data to predict continental-scale changes in distribution, and the availability of fossil data to hindcast economically important species. Location Europe, 11 degrees W33 degrees E, 3372 degrees N. Methods Eight types of BEMs were implemented in this study, covering most state-of-the-art modelling techniques. Present and palaeoclimatic data were obtained from the atmosphereocean global circulation model ECHO-G. The last millennium was divided into three climatically distinct periods: the MWP (ad 9001300), the LIA (ad 16001850) and PRES (ad 19002000). Models were calibrated for each period and validated with climatic and pollen data from the remaining periods. Successfully validated models were projected onto a 1 degrees European grid. Results BEMs were successfully validated with independent data. The average area under the curve statistic showed strong model performance, indicating: (1) the strength of BEMs for modelling current and future distributions and, (2) the potential of fossil pollen records to undertake these approaches. European-scale 1 degrees- gridded maps of probability of occurrence largely agreed with observed 20th-century distributions for most taxa, allowing the construction of past modelled species distributions. Main conclusions Results suggest a high potential for BEMs to be used to model future species distributions, and highlight the importance of palaeoecological data to independently validate these models, taking into account the scales at which these data operate. Although valid, BEMs showed poorer performance with heavily managed species and/or those growing in heterogeneous terrain or with discontinuous distributions. The last millennium in Europe was characterized by an increase in woody crop species and a decline of forest species, suggesting increasing land use by humans.

AB  - Detailed field and modelling studies have been completed at different spatial scales for the endangered arboreal marsupial, Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri); a species virtually confined to the ash-type eucalypt forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. These forests are also subject to considerable pressure to produce timber and paper products. The studies of Leadbeater's Possum highlighted the factors influencing the distribution and abundance of the species ranging from broad distribution patterns, the occupancy of habitat patches at the landscape scale, and the use of individual den sites and the quality of trees that provide food within particular stands. These scales correspond to the entire known range of the species, sub-populations within a metapopulation occupying an ensemble of patches at the landscape scale, and colonies occupying den trees in individual stands. Information on the factors influencing the distribution of Leadbeater's Possum at one spatial scale were found to be important for informing processes at another. For example, an understanding of the species' habitat requirements informed the spatial distribution of habitat patches at the landscape level which, in turn, gave insights into predicted metapopulation dynamics. Each spatial scale of ecological investigation of Leadbeater's Possum had a corresponding scale of forest management, and they included: virtually the entire ash-type eucalypt resource in the region, the location of large reserves, the design of corridors and retained patches within production forest landscapes, silvicultural practices employed in individual stands, and the retention of individual trees and clusters of trees on logged sites. This range of forest management scales, and the corresponding-scaled array of ecological studies, have particular implications for the conservation of Leadbeater's Possum. The results of investigations to date have revealed that conservation efforts must focus on ash-type eucalypt forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria because populations of Leadbeater's Possum are virtually confined to these areas. Within the broadscale limits of the distribution of the species, the long-term conservation of Leadbeater's Possum will not only be dependent on large reserves, but also intermediate-scale reserves and corridors within wood production areas, as well changed silvicultural practices to better provide suitable habitat on logged sites. While each strategy will make a contribution to the persistence of Leadbeater's Possum, it also has important limitations; an outcome which highlights the need for a multi-scale approach to attempts to conserve the species. Notably, the overaching implications for the design of an array of different conservation strategies for Leadbeater's Possum could not have been derived from any single study at a particular spatial scale. Thus, the case study on Leadbeater's Possum suggests that consideration of factors at a range of scales should be an integral part of management and conservation planning, not only for this species, but for wildlife per se.

AB  - The projections of species distribution models (SDMs) have provided critical knowledge for conservation planning under climate change in the Republic of Korea. However, uncertainty about the SDM projections has been criticized as a major challenge to reliable projections. The present research investigated uncertainty among competing models (Model uncertainty) and uncertainty of future climate conditions (climate uncertainty) driving from different GCMs and CO2 emission scenarios in predicting the future distributions of plants. For this purpose, using nine single-model algorithms and the pre-evaluation weighted ensemble method, we modeled the geographical distributions of Silver Magnolia (Machilus thunbergii Siebold & Zucc.), a warm-adapted evergreen broadleaved tree; furthermore, we predicted its future distributions under 20 climate change scenarios (5 global circulation models (GCMs) x 4 CO2 emission scenarios (RCPs)). The results showed a great variation in the accuracies of nine single-model projections: the mean AUC values of nine single-models ranged from 0.764 (SER) to 0.970 (RF), and the mean TSS ranged from 0.529 (SRE) to 0.852 (RF). RF (mean AUC= 0.970, mean TSS = 0.852) and the ensemble forecast (AUC= 0.968, TSS=0.804) showed the highest predictive power, while SRE showed the lowest. The future distributions of Silver Magnolia projected with the ensemble SDM clearly varied according to GCMs and RCPs. The twenty climate scenarios produced twenty different projections of the magnolia prospective distribution. GCMs commonly projected the maximum range expansion under RCP 8.5 in 2050 and 2070, but CO2 emission scenarios explaining the minimum expansions differed according to GCMs. In conclusion, our results show that GCMs, CO2 emission scenarios and SDM algorithms produce considerable variations in the SDM projections. Therefore, this research suggests that understanding of model and climate uncertainties is critical for an effective conservation planning in forest management under climate change on the Korean Peninsula.

AB  - Understanding the historical dynamics of animal species is critical for accurate prediction of their response to climate changes. During the late Quaternary period, Southeast Asia had a larger land area than today due to lower sea levels, and its terrestrial landscape was covered by extensive forests and savanna. To date, however, the distribution fluctuation of vegetation and its impacts on genetic structure and demographic history of local animals during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are still disputed. In addition, the responses of animal species on Hainan Island, located in northern Southeast Asia, to climate changes during the LGM are poorly understood. Here, we combined phylogeographic analysis, paleoclimatic evidence, and species distribution models to examine the response of the flightless Hainan Partridge (Arborophila ardens) to climate change. We concluded that A. ardens survived through LGM climate changes, and its current distribution on Hainan Island was its in situ refuge. Range model results indicated that A. ardens once covered a much larger area than its current distribution. Demographic history described a relatively stable pattern during and following the LGM. In addition, weak population genetic structure suggests a role in promoting gene flow between populations with climate-induced elevation shifts. Human activities must be considered in conservation planning due to their impact on fragmented habitats. These first combined data for Hainan Partridge demonstrate the value of paired genetic and SDMs study. More related works that might deepen our understanding of the responses of the species in Southeast Asia to late Quaternary Climate are needed.

AB  - Modelling habitat suitability of semi-aquatic vertebrates for large scale conservation purposes is a particularly challenging task, due to the fine-scale linearity of riverine habitats, and to the ecological continuum represented by the riparian and the aquatic ecosystems, on one side, and by a river and its tributaries, on the other.
   We advocate that habitat suitability models (HSMs) should represent the fine-scale complexity of the riparian and aquatic ecosystems at the drainage basin scale, which is the most relevant spatial unit for planning conservation strategies for semi-aquatic vertebrates, Hence, we developed a 3-step GIS-based modelling approach, and applied it to otter Lutra lutra in Italy to illustrate its potential applications for designing a nation-wide conservation strategy.
   First, we built a deductive HSM (resolution: 1:250,000, grain: 100 m x 100 m) of the riparian (100 m buffer around each river bank) and of the back-riparian (500 In buffer) areas along rivers. After, we created a synthetic index S-i summarising this information within the cells of a 5 km x 5 km grid superimposed to the whole country thus obtaining a nation-wide overview of habitat suitability. Both HSM and S-i were validated by using data on otter distribution, by performing a sensitivity analysis. Finally, we scaled-up the information provided by S-i to obtain a suitability index within each drainage basin (S-b). By overlapping a layer representing the basins occupied by otters to S-b we obtained an effective tool to identify basins to be prioritised for the conservation and expansion of existing populations, for rejoining isolated sub-populations, and for habitat restoration. The methodology developed here helps filling the gap between the urgent conservation needs of semi-aquatic species, and the inadequacy of traditional modelling approaches for species inhabiting one of the world's most endangered ecosystems.

AB  - Aim Forested regions are of global importance for a multitude of ecosystem functions and services and are critical for biodiversity. Anthropogenic climate-change compounds negative effects of land-use change on forest persistence and forest-dependent biodiversity. Habitat loss and climate change have an additive effect and drive species' extinctions in similar ways, resulting in a homogenization of biodiversity. Connectivity is key in conservation planning for mitigating climate change effects and facilitating species' abilities to disperse throughout remnant habitat and track their climate niches. We used three forest-specialized and habitat-specific bird species as focal species to understand avian connectivity and conservation of each of South Africa's three threatened forest classes, as each species is range-restricted to its respective forest type.
   Location South Africa.
   Methods We created ensemble models of species' distributions and combined core home- and breeding-range patches with a hybrid of least-cost pathways and ecological circuit theory linkages to assess the success of corridors in facilitating connectivity of each of the three forest types. We then predicted the likelihood of niche persistence for each species under future climate-change scenarios, and the efficacy of our connectivity modelling to facilitate range expansion or climate-niche tracking.
   Results The projected habitat loss under climate-change scenarios impacted core-habitat patch distribution, size and connectivity, exacerbated habitat fragmentation and increased resistance and the severity of pinch points and barriers along dispersal corridors. Forest systems and associated focal species projected to experience the highest levels of habitat loss/contraction occurred at mid- to high elevations. Climate-change resilience across ecosystems, and persistence of species therein, was dependent on connectivity, facilitating species' ability to track specific climate niches.
   Main conclusions Climate-change resilience of ecosystems, and persistence of biodiversity therein, is most likely to be a product of high functional biodiversity, connectedness and the ability of species to track specific climate niches.

AB  - Specialism is a key issue in conserving organisms. Using a new database of consumer resources we investigate specialism among British butterflies. Different measures for the range of sources exploited by adults are compared. As number of nectar sources correlates closely with number of records, new measures of specialism based on the residuals from this relationship are developed as well as a measure generated using a Monte Carlo procedure. Clear evidence for specialism in adult feeding emerges. A number of species depend heavily on alternative substrates to nectar flowers and others on flowers which are also larval host plants. Though many species have varied nectar sources, there is confirmation of the tendency of larval host plant specialists to be adult feeding specialists. Rarity, distribution losses and conservation status are associated with nectar specialism. We suggest that habitat fragmentation and regional extinctions are exacerbating resource (nectar and host plant) specialism. We draw attention to the importance of resource databases; there is clear indication now which nectar plants are more or less suitable for different butterfly species. Nevertheless, despite the current database comprising 10,539 records, it is deficient for 29 species (<50 records each). For conservation, site-specific data obtained according to strict survey protocols are required for determining ecological relationships and to direct site management. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The raccoon Procyon lotor (Linnaeus 1758) is a native species of North and Central America, but it can be also found as an alien species in parts of Europe and Asia. The raccoon's flexibility and capability in coping with environmental changes have made it the most successful invader compared with other species. In 1991, a raccoon was recorded in Iran for the first time. Since then, knowledge about the distribution, expansion range, and influences of this species on native ecosystem has remained unclear. The importance of environmental variables for the distribution of raccoons might vary widely across different spatial resolutions; therefore, we developed a robust statistical framework to predict the raccoon distribution across different spatial resolutions in Iran. Our predictions made by species distribution models (ENFA, GARP, and MaxEnt) highlighted the importance of food availability at a small spatial resolution and water resources, settlements, and population density at a large spatial resolution. The models indicate particular areas, mostly located in forests and rangelands near to the Caspian Sea, that can be a potential habitat for raccoons. We observed that the distribution of the raccoon population in Iran almost entirely overlaps with protected areas, which consequently brings about some conflicts with conservation practices and management plans. It is therefore imperative that the local knowledge be strengthened to adequately respond to the threats posed by raccoon invasions of special protected lands.

AB  - Environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation influence tree species distribution, but their relative contributions change with the spatial scale of analysis. We analyzed tree species turnover using twenty 1-ha permanent plots to quantify variation in floristic similarity explained by environmental factors and geographical distance at regional (among plots) and local (within plots) scales in seasonal premontane forests of northwestern Argentina. We related floristic similarity (Bray-Curtis) with environmental variation and geographical distance using specific regression models (regression of distance matrix and mixed-effects models at regional and local scales, respectively). Floristic similarity decreased with distance at both spatial scales but its relative contribution was significant only at the regional scale (18 and < 1 % at regional and local scale, respectively). Dispersal limitation may be a relevant process at biogeographical scale where dispersion at large distances become infrequent for some species. In addition, we identified that regional climatic and topographic gradients and local edaphic variation contribute to explain floristic similarity across scales in seasonal premontane forests. Environmental heterogeneity explained about the same variance in floristic similarity at regional and local scales (7 and 8 %, respectively). We conclude that quantitative aspects of floristic patterns, such as the relative contribution of niche and neutral processes to explain species distribution, can strengthen conservation strategies at different spatial scales, and therefore could be a useful tool in conservation planning.

AB  - Climate change is now known to be affecting the oceans. It is widely anticipated that impacts on marine mammals will be mediated primarily via changes in prey distribution and abundance and that the more mobile (or otherwise adaptable) species may be able to respond to this to some extent. However, the extent of this adaptability is largely unknown. Meanwhile, within the last few years direct observations have been made of several marine mammal populations that illustrate reactions to climate change. These observations indicate that certain species and populations may be especially vulnerable, including those with a limited habitat range, such as the vaquita Phocoena sinus, or those for which sea ice provides an important part of their habitat, such as narwhals Monodon monoceros, bowhead Balaena mysticetus and beluga Delphinapterus leucas whales and polar bears Ursus maritimus. Similarly, there are concerns about those species that migrate to feeding grounds in polar regions because of rapidly changing conditions there, and this includes many baleen whale populations. This review highlights the need to take projected impacts into account in future conservation and management plans, including species assessments. How this should be done in an adequately precautionary manner offers a significant challenge to those involved in such processes, although it is possible to identify at this time at least some species and populations that may be regarded as especially vulnerable. Marine ecosystems modellers and marine mammal experts will need to work together to make such assessments and conservation plans as robust as possible.

AB  - Legumes (family Leguminosae) are an economically important and widely distributed species found in several regions of the world, including the Guineo-Congolian (GC) forest region. Recent studies have reported the impact of climate change on plant biodiversity. Thus, understanding the distribution pattern of the endemic legume species of the GC region under current and future climate scenarios are imperative for long-term conservation management plans. We used 762 occurrence data of the 237 endemic legume species to elucidate the habitat suitability and impact of climate change on the species. Analyses used an ecological niche modeling ensemble method to map the current and future (2050-2070) distribution patterns of the endemic legumes under the RCP 4.5 scenario. Further, we generated the ensemble of four different species distribution modeling methods to predict areas where climatically suitable regions is lost or gained under future climate change. The model predicted the current suitable areas for endemic legumes to be Southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo (COG), and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Our findings indicate precipitation of Warmest Quarter and seasonality as the significant climatic variables affecting the habitat suitability of endemic legumes in the GC regions. Results showed areas such as the coastal region of Cote d' Ivoire, southwest province of Cameroon, Central African Republic, COG (Ngounnie), central DRC, and southern Nigeria will experience >40% loss of climatically suitable areas by 2050. Also, species such as Baphia maxima, and Psophocarpus scandens were projected to experience a 70% reduction in their climatically suitable areas under future climate scenarios. Our study concludes that the projected distribution of the endemic legume species in the GC region will consequently decline in the future due to the gross effect of climate change. The anticipated changes in the distribution patterns of the endemic legumes could have significant ecological and socio-economic significance. Therefore, we recommend improved conservation to protect the endemic legume species and its associated habitats in GC forest.

AB  - For more than 50 y ecologists have believed that spatial heterogeneity in habitat conditions promotes species richness by increasing opportunities for niche partitioning. However, a recent stochastic model combining the main elements of niche theory and island biogeography theory suggests that environmental heterogeneity has a general unimodal rather than a positive effect on species richness. This result was explained by an inherent tradeoff between environmental heterogeneity and the amount of suitable area available for individual species: for a given area, as heterogeneity increases, the amount of effective area available for individual species decreases, thereby reducing population sizes and increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinctions. Here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of this hypothesis. First we analyze an extensive database of breeding bird distribution in Catalonia and show that patterns of species richness, species abundance, and extinction rates are consistent with the predictions of the area-heterogeneity tradeoff and its proposed mechanisms. We then perform a metaanalysis of heterogeneity-diversity relationships in 54 published datasets and show that empirical data better fit the unimodal pattern predicted by the area-heterogeneity tradeoff than the positive pattern predicted by classic niche theory. Simulations in which species may have variable niche widths along a continuous environmental gradient are consistent with all empirical findings. The area-heterogeneity tradeoff brings a unique perspective to current theories of species diversity and has important implications for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) use spatial relationships between species occurrence and habitat (predictor) variables to generate maps of habitat suitability across a region of interest. These maps are frequently used in recovery planning efforts for endangered species, but they are influenced by data availability, selection of predictor variables, and choice of model type. Ground validation is necessary to robustly evaluate map accuracy, but it is rarely done, making it difficult to determine which modeling approach is best-suited for a given species or region. To address this uncertainty, we used two SDM types (Maxent and GLM) and two methods of selecting predictor variables to build four SDMs for an endangered prairie butterfly (Dakota skipper, Hesperia dacotae) in two regions of Manitoba, Canada. We then conducted field-based habitat suitability assessments at 120 locations in each region to enable direct comparisons of model output and accuracy. We found that soil type and surrounding landcover (grassland versus cropland) were important predictors of species occurrence regardless of region, predictor selection method, or model type. Cross-validation statistics indicated that most SDMs performed well (AUC > 0.7), but ground validation revealed that the habitat suitability maps they generated were inaccurate (Cohen's kappa < 0.4). Maxent models produced more accurate maps than GLMs, likely because false species absences adversely affected the latter, but only one Maxent-based map was accurate enough to help locate sites for future field investigations (Cohen's kappa > 0.3). Our results emphasize the importance of ground-validating SDM-based habitat suitability maps before incorporating them into species recovery plans.

AB  - Detailed spatio-temporal information about geographic distributions of species is critical for biodiversity analyses in conservation and planning. Traditional correlative modelling approaches use species observational data in model calibration and testing in a time-averaged framework. This method averages environmental values through time to yield a single environmental value for each location. Although valuable for exploring distributions of species at a broad level, this averaging is one of myriad factors impacting model quality and reliability.
   We sought to optimize traditional correlative niche model performance in distributional ecology contexts by incorporating time specificity into the existing modelling framework. We modified the existing framework to account for temporal dynamics in species' distributions to produce more robust, temporally explicit models. Using the Wood Thrush Hylostichla mustelina as our study species, we introduce a method of (a) deriving a temporally explicit pseudo-absence dataset using kernel density estimates to replicate relative sampling of sites through time, and (b) incorporating temporally explicit covariates in model calibration.
   By accounting for location, and month and year of primary data collection, the time-specific models successfully yielded dynamic predictions reflecting known distributional shifts in Hylocichla mustelina's annual movement pattern.
   The modified data preparation steps that we present incorporate temporal dimensions into traditional correlational modelling approaches improving predictive capacity and overall utility of these models for highly mobile, short-lived or behaviourally complex species. With the ability to estimate species' niches in greater detail, time-specific models will be able to address specific concerns of species-level management and policy development for highly mobile and/or migratory species, as well as disease vectors of public health interest.

AB  - The establishment of multiple zones offering different protection levels within a Marine Protected Area (MPA) can minimize social conflicts while maintaining associated biodiversity benefits such as fish population replenishment. Parrotfishes are among one of the most ecologically important reef fishes; yet extremely overexploited worldwide. In this context, well-designed priority management areas allowing no fishing activity (no-take zones) could help recover fish species, such as parrotfishes, through a MPA zoning process. Here, we tested this hypothesis by identifying the spatial configuration of zones that maximize the recovery of endangered parrotfish species (Scarus trispinosus; Scarus zelindae; Sparisoma amplum; Sparisoma axillare; Sparisoma frondosum) at the largest MPA in Brazil protecting nearshore coral reefs (MPA Costa dos Corais). We used parrotfish distribution data to produce species distribution models (SDMs) and combined them with conservation planning tools to delineate priority zones following a systematic approach. Then, we contrasted priority zones against non-systematic, newly designed no-take zones based on managers' and stakeholders' perspectives. After mapping the predicted abundance of each species within both zones based upon field surveys, we found that priority zones were more effective than non-systematic ones for the protection of two out of the five species: Scarus trispinosus and Sparisoma amplum. Thus, we considered that designing systematic zones was particularly relevant for increased protection of the two parrotfish species facing the largest decline. The prioritization analyses also showed that priority areas for parrotfish conservation following a systematic approach were mostly located surrounding and within no-take zones delineated by local stakeholders. The spatial overlap between systematic and non-systematic zones was of 38%. Hence, our study reinforces the importance of considering scientific information and methods (e.g., spatial distribution data and prioritization analyses) as a complementary strategy along with local stakeholders' knowledge, for delineating and refining management zones within MPAs.

AB  - As freshwater habitats are among the most endangered, there is an urgent need to identify critical areas for conservation, especially those that are home to endangered species. The Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) is a semi-aquatic mammal whose basic ecological requirements are largely unknown, hindering adequate conservation planning even though it is considered as a threatened species. Species distribution modelling is challenging for freshwater species. Indeed, the complexity of aquatic ecosystems (e.g., linear and hierarchical ordering) must be taken into account as well as imperfect sampling. High-quality and relevant hydrological descriptors should also be used. To understand the influence of environmental covariates on the occupancy and detection of the Pyrenean desman, we combine both a robust sign-survey data set (i.e. with genetic validation ensuring true presence information) and a hydrological model to simulate the flow regime across a whole catchment. Markovian site-occupancy analysis, taking into account sign detection and based on spatially adjacent replicates, indicated a positive influence of heterogeneity of substrate and shelters, and a negative influence of flow variability on Pyrenean desman detection. This valuable information should help to improve monitoring programs for this endangered species. Our results also highlighted a spatially clustered distribution and a positive influence of stream flow and number of tributaries on occupancy. Hence, modifications of flow regime (e.g. hydropower production, irrigation, climate change) and habitat fragmentation appear to be major threats for this species, altering the connectivity between tributaries and the mainstream river as well as between adjacent sub-catchments.

AB  - Latifi's Viper (Montivipera latifii), an endemic viper in the Alborz mountain chains in Iran, is facing serious threats within its last stronghold, the Lar National Park. The little information available on the distribution, population dynamics, and ecology of this scarce species, as well as its major threats, has hampered effective conservation planning. The present study was carried out to identify the main threats that affect Latifi's Viper within Lar National Park. We accomplished this by conducting a threat matrix analysis, based on discussion with herpetological experts in this region. We also attempted to better understand the ecology of this species through habitat modeling, based on presence-absence surveys. We found that overgrazing, illegal collection, and intentional killing, as well as isolation of populations and consequently inbreeding depression, are the main threats facing Latifi's Viper. The results of habitat modeling indicated that slope, herbaceous vegetation, and stone cover significantly affected habitat selection in spring while slope, tall and short herbaceous vegetation, tall grass cover, and stone cover affected habitat selection in summer. Our results confirm a slight difference in habitat preference of Latifi's Viper between the two seasons. These findings are important in identifying the most suitable habitats for this species within Lar National Park. They can also be crucial for adjusting the park's Latifi's Viper conservation and management plans accordingly.

AB  - Multispecies risk assessments have developed within many international conservation programs, reflecting a widespread need for efficiency. Under the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA), multispecies assessments ultimately lead to species-level listing decisions. Although this approach provides opportunities for improved efficiency, it also risks overwhelming or biasing the assessment process and would benefit from clear guidance for practitioners. We reviewed multispecies assessments conducted between 1993 and 2019 for ESA listing decisions to identify the ecological basis for combining species, the assessment approach used, and the policy factors influencing their efficacy. We identified 42 cases covering 359 species. Most assessments (81%) included two to five species, although the maximum was 82. A common theme involved grouping narrow endemics or habitat specialists based on taxonomic relatedness, similar distributions, and common threats to persistence. All assessments included a combined threats analysis, but few employed a common species' response model or expert elicitation process. Although ESA risk assessments are distinct from policy decisions, most assessments (50%) supported decisions that all species warranted endangered status. Available guidance has generally emphasized ecological similarity as the key attribute leading to successful multispecies assessments. The challenge with consistently selecting species based on qualitative proxies such as common distributions or threats to persistence is that ecological patterns and processes are scale dependent. Focusing instead on the assessment methods and their potential for bias and increased efficiency may provide a stronger basis for developing consistent and transparent guidance.

AB  - Background: The inclusion of information on the phenology of any given species can significantly improve the resulting of potential distri-bution models. Scientific literature does not provide up-to-date information on the abiotic and biotic factors that determine the distribution of Croton guatemalensis, a species native to communities in south Mexico. For the first time, the potential distribution of C. guatemalensis was determined using a model which includes reproductive biology data.
   Questions: Which bioclimatic and climatic variables most contribute to the distribution of C. guatemalensis? Does reproductive biology data contribute significantly to the prediction of the species distribution?
   Studied species/Mathematical model: Croton guatemalensis/Maximum Entropy Modeling.
   Study area and dates: Chiapas, Mexico, January -December 2020.
   Methods: The MaxEnt 4.4.4 algorithm was used, incorporating 16 variables, including bioclimatic, climatic and elevation. In addition, a habitat suitability layer was built.
   Results: The model presented a precision of AUC = 0.964 +/- 0.004. Eight variables contributed to explain 86.5 % of the potential distribution of the species. According to their contribution to the model, the most important were the seasonality of precipitation, habitat suitability, elevation and April solar radiation. The species was found in the physiographic regions Central America South Mountain Range Subprovince, Central Depression of Chiapas Discontinuity, and Altos de Chiapas Subprovince.
   Conclusions: The inclusion of reproductive biology data of C. guatemalensis contributed to improve the model. This information allows the development of more effective management and conservation plans by identifying the precise regions in which the species is found.

AB  - The geographicaldistribution of a species is limited by factors such as climate, resources, disturbances and species interactions. Environmental niche models attempt to encapsulate these limits and represent them spatially but do not always incorporate disturbance factors. We constructed MaxEnt models derived from a remotely sensed vegetation classification with, and without, an agricultural modification variable. Including agricultural modification improved model performance and led to more sites with native vegetation and fewer sites with exotic or degraded native vegetation being predicted suitable forA. parapulchella. Analysis of a relatively well-surveyed sub-area indicated that including agricultural modification led to slightly higher omission rates but markedly fewer likely false positives. Expert assessment of the model based on mapped habitat also suggested that including agricultural modification improved predictions. We estimate that agricultural modification has led to the destruction or decline of approximately30-35% of the most suitable habitat in the sub-area studied and approximately20-25% of suitable habitat across the entire study area, located in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Environmental niche models for a range of species, particularly habitat specialists, are likely to benefit from incorporating agricultural modification. Our findings are therefore relevant to threatened species planning and management, particularly at finer spatial scales.

AB  - Climate change is likely to shift the distributions of ecosystems worldwide. Most assessments of climate change are primarily species-focused and do not directly estimate how entire ecosystems may change. Using an ecosystem-based modelling approach, we provide a region-wide climate change vulnerability assessment of the seven major ecosystems across Africa's Albertine Rift. The Albertine Rift is a global biodiversity hotspot, containing more endemic vertebrates than anywhere else in Africa. We used Maxent to estimate each ecosystem's extent using current climate data, then we projected the potential distribution of each ecosystem for 2050 and 2070. We found that suitable conditions for most ecosystems are predicted to contract rapidly in extent and shift upwards in altitude. High-altitude ecosystems and the endemic species they support are at immediate risk, owing to rapid predicted shrinkage in their suitable extent. Only the Combretum-grasslands savannah ecosystem is predicted to expand, with suitable conditions increasing by 32% in area by 2050. The extent and structure of boundary zones between the Rift's ecosystems may change significantly through time, due to the contractions and shifts of the environmental conditions for existing ecosystem distributions. By 2070, 44% of the region could be climatically unsuitable for the current ecosystems. Conservation planning across the Rift will need to account for these ecosystem shifts and rapidly changing boundary zones to ensure the long-term persistence of the many endemic species. Beyond the Albertine Rift, this ecosystem-based modelling technique can be adapted to any terrestrial region, providing critical information for conservation vulnerability assessments.

AB  - Recognition of the accurate spatial distribution of species in the habitat is fundamental to analyze species interactions (positives as nurse plant interactions and negatives such as competition) and also to create viable conservation and management plans. We present here three study cases to illustrate the power of spatial analysis by distance indices (SADIE) as a tool to understand the ecological associations between the subject species and the associated flora: 1) We studied the positive and negative interactions of Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus a small cactus with the dominant shrub species of a desert; since these interactions are crucial to understand the establishment, distribution pattern, and viability of their populations. A. kotschobeyanus distributes in gaps with I alpha=2.144 and associated positively with Tiquilia sp (X=0.379, P<0.0001) and Opuntia meijmeri (X=0.2753, P<0.0001), and negatively with Karwinskia humboldtiana (X=-0.1948, P<0.9803) and Calanticaria bicolor (X=-0.2568, P<0.9982). 2) To improve the process of locating new populations of M. mathildae, because their location was indirectly detected by screening conspicuous associated tree species such as Bursera fagaroides and Lysiloma microphylla. For this study case we combine the SADIE analysis with GARP niche prediction models to improve the location for new populations. 3) We evaluated the spatial distribution of Agave americana and Agave salmiana under different traditional management strategies; the spatial distribution was predominantly aggregated in patches with average aggregation indices (I alpha=1.09, sd=0.38). Agave species tend to be dissociated with each other and also to pine and juniper trees. The spatial distribution of agaves and associates species changes among different management strategies and in cultivars. (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Climate envelope models are widely used to describe potential future distribution of species under different climate change scenarios. It is broadly recognized that there are both strengths and limitations to using climate envelope models and that outcomes are sensitive to initial assumptions, inputs, and modeling methods Selection of predictor variables, a central step in modeling, is one of the areas where different techniques can yield varying results. Selection of climate variables to use as predictors is often done using statistical approaches that develop correlations between occurrences and climate data. These approaches have received criticism in that they rely on the statistical properties of the data rather than directly incorporating biological information about species responses to temperature and precipitation. We evaluated and compared models and prediction maps for 15 threatened or endangered species in Florida based on two variable selection techniques: expert opinion and a statistical method. We compared model performance between these two approaches for contemporary predictions, and the spatial correlation, spatial overlap and area predicted for contemporary and future climate predictions. In general, experts identified more variables as being important than the statistical method and there was low overlap in the variable sets (<40%) between the two methods Despite these differences in variable sets (expert versus statistical), models had high performance metrics (>0.9 for area under the curve (AUC) and >0.7 for true skill statistic (TSS). Spatial overlap, which compares the spatial configuration between maps constructed using the different variable selection techniques, was only moderate overall (about 60%), with a great deal of variability across species. Difference in spatial overlap was even greater under future climate projections, indicating additional divergence of model outputs from different variable selection techniques. Our work is in agreement with other studies which have found that for broad-scale species distribution modeling, using statistical methods of variable selection is a useful first step, especially when there is a need to model a large number of species or expert knowledge of the species is limited. Expert input can then be used to refine models that seem unrealistic or for species that experts believe are particularly sensitive to change. It also emphasizes the importance of using multiple models to reduce uncertainty and improve map outputs for conservation planning. Where outputs overlap or show the same direction of change there is greater certainty in the predictions. Areas of disagreement can be used for learning by asking why the models do not agree, and may highlight areas where additional on-the-ground data collection could improve the models.

AB  - Climate change can have an effect on species distributions. The 1900 distribution and potential future distribution of diadromous fish in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East were explored using generalized additive models (GAMs) and selected habitat characteristics of 196 basins. Robust presence-absence models were built for 20 of the 28 diadromous species in the Study area using longitude, annual temperature, drainage surface area, annual precipitation, and source elevation as explanatory variables. Inspection of the relationship between each variable and species presence-absence revealed that the GAMs were generally interpretable and plausible. Given the predicted rise in annual temperature in climate models ranging between 1 degrees C and 7 degrees C by 2100, the fish species were classified according to those losing suitable basins, those gaining Suitable basins, and those showing little or no change. It was found that the climate envelopes based on temperature and precipitation for diadromous species Would, in general, be shifted farther northeastwards by 2100, and these shifting ranges were comparable with those assessed in other Studies. The uncertain future of some species was highlighted, and it was concluded that conservation policy and management plans will need to be revised in the face of climate change.

AB  - Located in the Cantabrian Sea (NE Atlantic), 30 nm off the Asturian coast, "El Cachucho" was the first off-shore Marine Protected Area (MPA) to be declared in Spain. The area includes Le Danois Bank and its intraslope basin. It joined the OSPAR Network of MPAs in 2009 and, thereafter, was included in the Natura 2000 Network in 2011. The main reason for its declaration as MPA was the presence of the 1170 Reefs habitat included in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive. In 2018, the MPAs Master Management Plan was under revision and its design criteria were subjected to evaluation. We used Marxan decision support tool to evaluate the MPA's management design criteria. This tool selects the most important conservation features, while minimizing the socioeconomic cost. First, the 1170 Reefs habitat was defined as the main environmental value. Specifically, we took into account the six large sized target species that are more representative of this habitat in the area: the sponges Asconema setubalense, Geodia cf. barretti and Phakellia robusta, the anthipatarian Leiopathes glaberrima, and the gorgonians Placogorgia sp. and Callogorgia verticillata. A spatial distribution map was produced for each species using Generalized Additive Models (GAM). We also considered the presence of spawning stocks of fish species which are present in the area as an important conservation value. Their spatial distribution was modeled through Maxent software. Additionally, for the socioeconomic cost, fishing effort of the different fisheries operating in the area was estimated linking VMS/Logbook data before and after the MPA was declared. The first results obtained with the Maraxan tool were presented in public consultation, in the context of the LIFE + INTEMARES Project, to help in decision making within the new Management Plan. Thus, to improve the management measures aimed at the conservation of the environmental values of the MPA, an enlargement of the protected area to the West was proposed, and a more reasonable use of the buffer area to fishermen than that defined in the former Management Plan was suggested. Involving all stakeholders in the development of the management plan for this MPA is a decisive step for the creation and consolidation of an important network of MPAs in Spain.

AB  - Hose's civet Diplogale hosei is one of the world's least known carnivores and is endemic to Borneo. We collected 43 records of which only 20 (Balanced Model) or 24 (Spatial Filtering Model) were used to model potential habitat suitability. We predicted habitat suitable for Hose's civet to be largely restricted to the central spine of the mountainous interior, corresponding to much of the northern half of the 'Heart of Borneo' complex. Although protected areas are scattered throughout this complex, many are poorly managed, facing threats from illegal logging and mining, poaching and encroachment. The surrounding matrix of logging concessions face conversion to monoculture plantations, in which there is no evidence that the species can persist. To ensure the conservation of the species, further research is urgently required, both in-depth ecological studies and basic inventory work using camera-traps across Borneo. More intensive surveys in all habitats are needed to improve current models so they can inform conservation planning more effectively. Pending sufficient information, sensible precautionary measures need to be taken such as increased enforcement including patrolling activities in key protected areas, encouraging sustainable forestry in the surrounding logging concessions and maintaining forested corridors to support movement and gene flow between sub-populations.

AB  - The karst landform in southern China is renowned for its high levels of species diversity and endemism. Globally, karst ecosystems are under threat from unsustainable anthropogenic disturbance and climate changes and are among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. In this study, we used the typical karst endemic genus in southern China, Primulina Hance, as a model to identify areas within the karst landform with high diversity and to investigate congruence between phylogenetic and species-based measures of diversity. Using phylogenetic information and species distribution data, we measured geographical patterns of diversity with four metrics: species richness (SR), corrected weighted endemism (CWE), phylogenetic diversity (PD), and phylogenetic endemism (PE). Our results revealed a high spatial congruence among SR, PD, and PE, with hotspot areas identified in the Nanling Mountains (i.e., north Guangdong and northeast Guangxi) and southeast Yungui Plateau (i.e., north and southwest Guangxi), whereas the hotspots of CWE are comparatively uniform throughout the geographic extent. The categorical analysis of neo- and paleoendemism identified a pattern of mixed neo- and paleoendemism in numerous grid cells, suggesting that karst areas in southern China have acted as both "museums" and "cradles" of plant evolution. Conservation gap analysis of hotspots revealed that the majority of prioritized hotspots (>90%) of the genus are outside of protected areas, therefore indicating the limited effectiveness of national nature reserves for the karst flora. Overall, our results suggest that the karst flora merits more conservation attention and SR can be an effective surrogate to capture PD in conservation planning.

AB  - Biodiversity monitoring is critical to assess the effectiveness of management activities and policy change, particularly in the light of accelerating impacts of environmental change, and for compiling national responses to international obligations and agreements. Monitoring methods able to identify species most likely to be affected by environmental change, and pinpoint those changes with the strongest impacts, will enable managers to target efforts towards vulnerable species and significant threats. Here we take a new approach to carnivore monitoring, combining camera-trap surveys with ecological niche factor analysis to assess distribution and patterns of habitat use of mammalian carnivore assemblages across northern Tanzania. We conducted 11 surveys over 430 camera-trap stations and 11 355 trap-days. We recorded 23 out of 35 carnivore species known to occur in Tanzania and report major extensions to the known distribution of the bushy-tailed mongoose Bdeogale crassicauda, previously thought to be rare. Carnivore biodiversity tended to be higher in national parks than in game reserves and forest reserves. We explored habitat use for seven species for which we had sufficient information. All species tended to be found near rivers and southern Acacia commiphora woodlands (except one mongoose species), and avoided deciduous shrubland, favouring deciduous woodland and/or open grassland. All species tended to avoid croplands suggesting that habitat conversion to agriculture could have serious implications for carnivore distribution. Our study provides a first example where camera-trap data are combined with niche analyses to reveal patterns in habitat use and spatial distribution of otherwise elusive and poorly known species and to inform reserve design and land-use planning. Our methodology represents a potentially powerful tool that can inform national and site-based wildlife managers and policy makers as well as international agreements on conservation.

AB  - Aim: Mycorrhizas are among the most common symbioses on Earth, impacting plant community structure and ecosystem functioning, yet little landscape-scale data linking mycorrhizal fungal diversity to biotic and abiotic properties exist to inform conservation. We examined arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity in tropical and temperate locations and identified potential drivers of species distributions and diversity for use as proxy indicators in biodiversity conservation.
   Location: AM fungal communities were documented at 60 sites in the Colorado Plateau in south-western United States and La Gran Sabana in south-eastern Venezuela.
   Methods: Communities of plants and AM fungi and abiotic variables were measured along 50-m transects in three vegetation types (shrublands, forests, and traditional agricultural fields). Model selection and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate environmental predictors of AM fungal diversity and community structure.
   Results: AM fungal species richness (alpha diversity) and community structure, but not among-site turnover (beta diversity), differed between tropical and temperate locations; only 15% of taxa were present in both locations. In unmanaged sites, AM fungal richness was not correlated with plant richness, but instead predicted by soil pH and temperature (temperate) or precipitation and latitude (tropics). The structure of AM fungal communities was influenced by plant identity but not plant diversity in both locations. Traditional, sedentary Hopi agriculture influenced AM fungal communities on the Colorado Plateau, but Pemon shifting slash-and-burn agriculture did not alter AM fungal communities at La Gran Sabana. At both locations, AM fungal community structure was linked to soil texture and nitrogen.
   Main conclusions: Our study demonstrates similarity between tropical and temperate regions in the biotic and abiotic drivers of landscape-scale AM fungal species distributions. Soil and climate as well as habitat heterogeneity may serve as proxy indicators of AM fungal communities for use in conservation planning to preserve the ecosystem functions and services of mycorrhizas.

AB  - Broad scale population estimates of declining species are desired for conservation efforts. However, for many secretive species including large carnivores, such estimates are often difficult. Based on published density estimates obtained through camera trapping, presence/absence data, and globally available predictive variables derived from satellite imagery, we modelled density and occurrence of a large carnivore, the jaguar, across the species' entire range. We then combined these models in a hierarchical framework to estimate the total population. Our models indicate that potential jaguar density is best predicted by measures of primary productivity, with the highest densities in the most productive tropical habitats and a clear declining gradient with distance from the equator. Jaguar distribution, in contrast, is determined by the combined effects of human impacts and environmental factors: probability of jaguar occurrence increased with forest cover, mean temperature, and annual precipitation and declined with increases in human foot print index and human density. Probability of occurrence was also significantly higher for protected areas than outside of them. We estimated the world's jaguar population at 173,000 (95% CI: 138,000-208,000) individuals, mostly concentrated in the Amazon Basin; elsewhere, populations tend to be small and fragmented. The high number of jaguars results from the large total area still occupied (almost 9 million km(2)) and low human densities (< 1 person/km(2)) coinciding with high primary productivity in the core area of jaguar range. Our results show the importance of protected areas for jaguar persistence. We conclude that combining modelling of density and distribution can reveal ecological patterns and processes at global scales, can provide robust estimates for use in species assessments, and can guide broad-scale conservation actions.

AB  - Cipo Canastero Asthenes luizaeis a relict ovenbird restricted to rocky outcrops at high elevations within thecampo rupestrevegetation of the Espinhaco Range in the state of Minas Gerais, south-eastern Brazil. This poorly known species is considered 'Near Threatened', but recent studies have suggested that it should be listed under a higher category of threat. To contribute to the knowledge of this species and its conservation assessment and related planning, we compiled all literature records of the species distribution (n= 16 locations), collected new data on its occurrence (n= 72 locations), and calculated its geographic range using four different approaches. First, we defined the sky islands where the species occurs (nine units) using the lowest elevation value recorded (1,100 m asl) as a cut-off. Second, we performed species distribution modelling (SDM) across the sky islands and identified an area of 2,225.21 km(2). Third, we measured the species' extent of occurrence (EOO = 24,555.85 km(2)) and used SDM to estimate its upper limit (EOOup = 30,697.58 km(2)). Fourth, we measured the area of occupancy (AOO = 228 km(2)) and used SDM to estimate its upper limit (AOOup = 1,827.39 km(2)). We analysed the Cipo Canastero sky islands in terms of landscape metrics including size, isolation, protected area coverage, shape index, core area index, and proportion covered by SDM. We observed a very fragmented distribution, especially in the North sector of the species distribution, composed of small and isolated populations (separated by up to 112 km); the South sector is the core of its distribution and is composed of larger, more connected patches with differences in shape complexity that are not strongly influenced by an edge effect. The range sizes calculated, along with other reported information regarding population and habitat trends, justifies the inclusion of the species in at least the 'Vulnerable' category.

AB  - A fundamental problem of sustainability is how to reduce the double complexity of ecological and social systems into simple operational terms. We highlight that the conservation concept of focal species (selected species sensitive to a set of anthropogenic threats to their habitat) links multiple issues of ecological sustainability, and their habitat models can provide a practical tool for solving these issues. A review of the literature shows that most spatial modeling of focal species focuses on vertebrates, lacks the aspect of aquatic and soil habitats, and has been slow in the uptake by actual management planning. We elaborate on a deductive modeling approach that first generalizes the main influential dimensions of habitat change (threats), which are then parameterized as habitat quality estimates for focal species. If built on theoretical understanding and properly scaled, the maps produced with such models can cost-effectively describe the dynamics of ecological qualities across forest landscapes, help set conservation priorities, and reflect on management plans and practices. The models also serve as ecological hypotheses on biodiversity and landscape function. We illustrate this approach based on recent additions to the forest reserve network in Estonia, which addressed the insufficient protection of productive forest types. For this purpose, mostly former production forests that may require restoration were set aside. We distinguished seven major habitat dimensions and their representative taxa in these forests and depicted each dimension as a practical stand-scale decision tree of habitat quality. The model outcomes implied that popular stand-structural targets of active forest restoration would recover passively in reasonable time in these areas, while a critically degraded condition (loss of old trees of characteristic species) required management beyond reserve borders. Another hidden issue revealed was that only a few stands of consistently low habitat quality concentrated in the landscape to allow cost-efficient restoration planning. We conclude that useful habitat models for sustainable forest management have to balance single-species realism with stakeholder expectations of meaningful targets and scales. Addressing such social aspects through the focal species concept could accelerate the adoption of biodiversity distribution modeling in forestry.

AB  - Human-sun bear conflict may negatively affect human properties and long-term survival of the sun bear. These conflicts become a major problem for conservation of the sun bear. Understanding what factors cause human-bear conflict remains poorly understood. Studies of conflict extent through identifying affected areas while accessing their level of risk are a prelude to reduce wildlife conflict issues. In this research, the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm was applied to predict potential conflict areas of the Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) in Peninsular Malaysia and identify the key factors shaping conflict distribution. The 233 spatially disperse conflicted sun bears were analysed in relation to 11 predictor variables. The risk model demonstrated that approximately 1% of Peninsular Malaysia was comprised of high potential conflict area, while good, moderate, and least potential -conflict areas constituted 2%, 5%, and 25%, respectively. The predictive model with an AUC value of 0.92 indicated that the crop areas adjacent to the forest edge and with high precipitation were significantly influenced on sun bear conflicts. This study provides useful tools for identifying potential conflict hotspots and highlights the significance of proper landscape planning to improve the mitigation of human-sun bear conflict and conservation efforts throughout Peninsular Malaysia.

AB  - 1. Predictive models of species' distributions are used increasingly in ecological studies investigating features as varied as biodiversity, habitat selection and interspecific competition. In a pilot study, we based a successful model for the great bustard Otis tarda on advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data, which offer attractive predictor variables because of the global coverage, high temporal frequency of overpasses and low cost. We wished to assess whether the approach could be applied at very large spatial scales, and whether the coarse resolution of the imagery (1 km(2)) would limit application to those bird species with large home ranges or to simple recognition of broad habitat types.
   2. We modelled the distributions of three agricultural steppe birds over the whole of Spain using a common set of predictor variables, including AVHRR imagery. The species, great bustard, little bustard Tetrax tetrax and calandra lark Melanocorhypha calandra, have similar habitat requirements but differently sized home ranges, and are all species of conservation concern. Good models would reveal differences in distribution between the species and have high predictive power despite the large geographical extent covered.
   3. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were built with the presence-absence of the species as the response variable. Individual species' responses to the habitat variables were identified using partial fits and compared with each other. We found that this modelling framework could successfully distinguish the habitats selected by the three species, while the response curves indicated how the habitats differed. Model fits and cross-validations assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots showed the models to be successful and robust.
   4. We overlaid the predictive maps to identify key areas for agricultural steppe birds in Spain and compared these with the present network of protected sites in two sample regions. In Castilla Leon the provision of protected sites appears appropriate, but in Castilla La Mancha large areas of apparently suitable habitat have no protection.
   5. These results confirm that large-scale models are able to increase our understanding of species' ecology and provide data for conservation planning. AVHRR imagery, in combination with other variables, has sufficient resolution to model a range of bird species, and GAMs have the flexibility to model subtle species-habitat responses.

AB  - Prioritizing threatened species protection has been proposed as an efficient response to the global biodiversity crisis. We used in-situ conservation data to predict the potential habitat area of four flagship species: the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), golden monkey (Rhinopithecus roxella quinlingensis), takin (Budorcas taxicolor bedfordi), and crested ibis (Nipponia nippon). We then designed systematic conservation planning schemes for various scenarios given species habitat preferences and anthropogenic activities and conducted a costeffectiveness assessment. Broadly, the geographical distributions of suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, and takins exhibited high spatial congruence (correlation coefficients of 0.59-0.90), and areas of high congruence were concentrated in the northern portion of the Qinling Mountains at high elevation (>1500 m). By contrast, the crested ibis was negatively correlated in space with its sympatric species (-0.47 to -0.29). Crested ibis habitats were clustered in the southern portion of the region at low elevation (<1500 m). A hypothetical conservation priority area (CPA) based on the giant panda, golden monkey, and takin included 39.64% of the Qinling Mountains and 100%, 99.99%, 99.59%, and 7.84% of the suitable habitats for giant pandas, golden monkeys, takins, and crested ibises, respectively. The same area included 99.07%, 70.87%, and 39.96% of the highly important areas for the ecosystem services of biodiversity conservation, water supply, and soil retention, respectively, and only 4.62%, 16.83%, and 13.4% of the area were associated with high-density residential area, impervious surfaces, and cropland, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that a CPA approach based on the specialist species could result in effective, low-cost biodiversity conservation in the Qinling Mountains. However, we note that existing protected areas account for only 26.52% of the CPA. We recommend that the main area of the proposed Qinling National Park should be based on the CPA developed here.

AB  - Sponge aggregations have been recognised as key component of shallow benthic ecosystems providing several important functional roles including habitat building and nutrient recycling. Within the deep-sea ecosystem, sponge aggregations may be extensive and available evidence suggests they may also play important functional roles, however data on their ecology, extent and distribution in the North Atlantic is lacking, hampering conservation efforts. In this study, we used Maximum Entropy Modelling and presence data for two deep-sea sponge aggregation types, Pheronema carpenteri aggregations and ostur aggregations dominated by geodid sponges, to address the following questions: 1) What environmental factors drive the broad-scale distribution of these selected sponge grounds? 2) What is the predicted distribution of these grounds in the northern North Atlantic, Norwegian and Barents Sea? 3) How are these sponge grounds distributed between Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and High Seas areas? 4) What percentage of these grounds in High Seas areas are protected by the current High Seas MPA network? Our results suggest that silicate concentration, temperature, depth and amount of particulate organic carbon are the most important drivers of sponge distribution. Most of the sponge grounds are located within national EEZs rather than in the High Seas. Coordinated conservation planning between nations with significant areas of sponge grounds such as Iceland, Greenland and Faroes (Denmark), Norway (coastal Norway and Svalbard), Portugal and the UK, should be implemented in order to effectively manage these communities in view of the increasing level of human activity within the deep-sea environment.

AB  - In the face of the growing challenges brought about by human activities, effective planning and decision-making in biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, restoration, and sustainable development are urgently needed. Ecological models can play a key role in supporting this need and helping to safeguard the natural assets that underpin human wellbeing and support life on land and below water (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; SDG 15 & 14). The urgency and complexity of safeguarding forest (SDG 15.2) and mountain ecosystems (SDG 15.4), for example, and halting decline in biodiversity (SDG 15.5) in the Anthropocene requires a re-envisioning of how ecological models can best support the comprehensive assessments of biodiversity and its change that are required for successful action.
   A key opportunity to advance ecological modeling for both predictive and explanatory purposes arises through a collaboration between ecologists and the Earth observation community, and a close integration of remote sensing and species distribution models. Remote sensing products have the capacity to provide continuous spatiotemporal information about key factors driving the distribution of organisms, therefore improving both the use and accuracy of these models for management and planning.
   Here we first survey the literature on remote sensing data products available to ecological modelers interested in improving predictions of species range dynamics under global change. We specifically explore the key biophysical processes underlying the distribution of species in the Anthropocene including climate variability, changes in land cover, and disturbances. We then discuss potential synergies between the ecological modeling and remote sensing communities, and highlight opportunities to close the data and conceptual gaps that currently impede a more effective application of remote sensing for the monitoring and modeling of ecological systems. Specific attention is given to how potential collaborations between the two communities could lead to new opportunities to report on progress towards global agendas - such as the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development of the United Nations or the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework of the Convention for Biological Diversity, and help guide conservation and management strategies towards sustainability.

AB  - There is an urgent need to conduct scientific research in order to comprehend the impact of climate change on the geographical distribution of species that constitute an ecological niche. To meet this need, the current and future distribution areas of a species can be predicted by applying machine learning techniques. This study aims to model the current and future geographical distribution of common hornbeam under different climate scenarios. Furthermore, we focus on the differences between the predicted current and future potential distribution areas of the species in terms of area and location by means of change analysis. 15 bioclimatic variables obtained for presence data from sample points representing the natural distribution area of common hornbeam were reduced to six variables to prevent high correlation and multi-collinearity. Next, the CNRM-ESM-1 climate change model was used to determine how the distribution areas of the species will be affected by climate change and the potential distribution areas of the species under the SSP2 4.5 and SSP5 8.5 scenarios in the periods 2041-2060 and 2081-2100 were modelled by MaxEnt 3.4.4 software. The change analysis comparing the current and future potential distribution areas suggested that common hornbeam would be affected by climate change, expanding its range in the north. The findings can be used effectively to address biodiversity conversation planning and management as a whole and develop new strategies. In this way, future risks can be diminished.

AB  - Aim: Application of environmental envelope modelling (EEM) for conservation planning requires careful validation. Opinions of experts who have worked with species of interest in the field can be a valuable and independent information source to validate EEM because of their first-hand experience with species occurrence and absence. However, their use in model validation is limited because of the subjectivity of their feedback. In this study, we present a method on the basis of cultural consensus theory to formalize expert model evaluations.
   Methods: We developed, for five tree species, distribution models with nine different variable combinations and Maxent EEM software. Species specialists validated the generated distribution maps through an online Google Earth interface with the scores from Invalid to Excellent. Experts were also asked about the commission and omission errors of the distribution models they evaluated. We weighted expert scores according to consensus theory. These values were used to obtain a final average expert score for each of the produced distribution models. The consensus-weighted expert scores were compared with un-weighted scores and correlated to four conventional model performance parameters after cross-validation with test data: Area Under Curve (AUC), maximum Kappa, commission error and omission error.
   Results: The median consensus-weighted expert score of all species-variable combinations was close to Fair. In general, experts that reached more consensus with peers were more positive about the EEM outcomes, compared to those that had more opposite judgements. Both consensus-weighted and un-weighted scores were significantly correlated to corresponding AUC, maximum Kappa and commission error values, but not to omission errors. More than half of the experts indicated that the distribution model they considered best included areas where the species is known to be absent. One third also indicated areas of species presence that were omitted by the model.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that experts are fairly positive about EEM outcomes. This is encouraging, but EEM application for conservation actions remains limited according to them. Methods to formalize expert knowledge allow a wider use of this information in model validation and improvement, and they complement conventional validation methods of presence-only modelling. Online GIS and survey applications facilitate the consultation of experts.

AB  - The implementation of climate-smart policies to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce emissions is being encouraged worldwide to fight climate change. Afforestation practices and rewilding initiatives are climate-smart examples suggested to tackle these issues. In contrast, fire-smart approaches, by stimulating traditional farmland activities or agroforestry practices, could also assist climate regulation while protecting biodiversity. However, there is scarce information concerning the potential impacts of these alternative land management strategies on climate regulation ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. As such, this work simulates future effects of different land management strategies in the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Meseta Iberica (Portugal-Spain). Climate-smart ('Afforestation', 'Rewilding') and fire-smart ('Farmland recovery', 'Agroforestry recovery') scenarios were modelled over a period of 60 years (1990-2050), and their impacts on climate regulation services were evaluated. Species distribution models for 207 vertebrates were built and future gains/losses in climate-habitat suitability were quantified. Results suggest climate-smart policies as the best for climate regulation (0.98 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) of mean carbon sequestration increase and 6801.5 Meuro of avoided economic losses in 2020-2050 under Afforestation scenarios), while providing the largest habitat gains for threatened species (around 50% for endangered and critically endangered species under Rewilding scenarios). Fire-smart scenarios also benefit carbon regulation services (0.82 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) of mean carbon sequestration increase and 3476.3 Meuro of avoided economic losses in 2020-2050 under Agroforestry scenarios), benefiting the majority of open-habitat species. This study highlights the main challenges concerning management policies in European rural mountains, while informing decision-makers regarding landscape planning under global change.

AB  - Climate change is affecting many freshwater species, particularly fishes. Predictions of future climate change suggest large and deleterious effects on species with narrow dispersal abilities due to limited hydrological connectivity. In turn, this creates the potential for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats, leading to physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The current extent of many freshwater fish species' spatio-temporal distribution patterns and their sensitivity to thermal impacts from climate change critical information for conservation planning are often unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is an ecologically important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally (Canada) and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to determine the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in projected suitable habitat for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN models). Statistically down scaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data was used to model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America for the period of 2041-2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and temperature variability were the main factors in determining Carmine shiner distribution. Patterns of projected habitat change by the 2050s suggest the spatial extent of the current distribution of Carmine shiner would shift north, with >50% of the current distribution changing with future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways for CO2 emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would become unsuitable for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to become available further north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority of habitat gains for Carmine shiner would be in areas currently inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting current populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century. These results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly vulnerable to a warming climate and suggest that management actions - such as assisted migration - may be needed to mitigate impacts from climate change and ensure the long-term persistence of the species.

AB  - Mapping of biodiversity elements to expose gaps in conservation networks has become a common strategy in nature-reserve design. We review a set of critical assumptions and issues that influence the interpretation and implementation of gap analysis, including: (1) the assumption that a subset of taxa can be used to indicate overall diversity patterns, and (2) the impact of uncertainty and error propagation in reserve design. We focus our review on species diversity patterns and use data from peer-reviewed literature or extant state-level databases to test specific predictions implied by these assumptions. Support for the biodiversity indicator assumption was varied. Patterns of diversity as reflected in species counts, coincidence of hot spots, and representativeness were not generally concordant among different taxa, with the degree of concordance depending on the measure of diversity used, the taxa examined, and the scale of analysis. Simulated errors in predicting the occurrence of individual species indicated that substantial differences in reserve-boundary recommendations could occur when uncertainty is incorporated into the analysis. Furthermore, focusing exclusively on vegetation and species distribution patterns in conservation planning will contribute to reserve-design uncertainty unless the processes behind the patterns are understood. To deal with these issues, reserve planners should base reserve design on the best available, albeit incomplete, data; should attempt to define those ecological circumstances when the indicator assumption is defensible; should incorporate uncertainty explicitly in mapped displays of biodiversity elements; and should simultaneously consider pattern and process in reserve-design problems.

AB  - Globally, ecosystems and their constituent flora and fauna face the localized and broad-scale influence of human activities. Conservation practitioners and environmental managers struggle to identify and mitigate threats, reverse species declines, restore degraded ecosystems, and manage natural resources sustainably. Scientific research and evidence are increasingly regarded as the foundation for new regulations, conservation actions, and management interventions. Conservation biologists and managers have traditionally focused on the characteristics (e.g. abundance, structure, trends) of populations, species, communities, and ecosystems, and simple indicators of the responses to environmental perturbations and other human activities. However, an understanding of the specific mechanisms underlying conservation problems is becoming increasingly important for decision-making, in part because physiological tools and knowledge are especially useful for developing cause-and-effect relationships, and for identifying the optimal range of habitats and stressor thresholds for different organisms. When physiological knowledge is incorporated into ecological models, it can improve predictions of organism responses to environmental change and provide tools to support management decisions. Without such knowledge, we may be left with simple associations. 'Conservation physiology' has been defined previously with a focus on vertebrates, but here we redefine the concept universally, for application to the diversity of taxa from microbes to plants, to animals, and to natural resources. We also consider 'physiology' in the broadest possible terms; i.e. how an organism functions, and any associated mechanisms, from development to bioenergetics, to environmental interactions, through to fitness. Moreover, we consider conservation physiology to include a wide range of applications beyond assisting imperiled populations, and include, for example, the eradication of invasive species, refinement of resource management strategies to minimize impacts, and evaluation of restoration plans. This concept of conservation physiology emphasizes the basis, importance, and ecological relevance of physiological diversity at a variety of scales. Real advances in conservation and resource management require integration and inter-disciplinarity. Conservation physiology and its suite of tools and concepts is a key part of the evidence base needed to address pressing environmental challenges.

AB  - The red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Linnaeus 1758, Phasianidae) is a common game bird in Europe and it is classified as SPEC 2 (Species of European Conservation Concern), that is, a species with unfavorable conservation status due to a marked population decline. Loss of suitable habitat and hunting management are considered among the major causes of its decline. Such a decline can be also related to agriculture intensification, changes in agricultural practices and the abandonment of less productive lands. Habitat suitability models are an important management tool to define the potential distribution range of a given species, design a protected area network, and plan appropriate management actions and evaluate their effects. This study was conducted on Elba Island (Tuscany) in spring 2011 to define the habitat factors that affect the A. rufa distribution in a typical Mediterranean landscape. On this island the species is declining, as it is in other areas of Europe. We carried out point counts in a survey stratified according to vegetation. We formulated Resource Probability Selection Functions following a presence vs. availability design by Binary Logistic Regression Analysis to obtain a map of potential distribution of the species. We observed that the red-legged partridge distribution was mainly linked to the natural habitat with garrigue and perennial meadows, whereas woody landscape had a negative effect. To stop the species decline on the island habitat improvement actions are needed, such as the cutting of dense vegetation to create open areas.

AB  - Many developing countries lack information to manage their endangered species, urging the need for affordable and reliable information. We used Bayesian hierarchical spatial models, with oceanographic variables, to predict the distribution range of Epinephelus marginatus, the dusky grouper, for the entire Southwest Atlantic. Weran a model using scientific information gathered from the literature and another using information gathered from fishers on species presence or absence. In both models, temperature was an important determinant of species occurrence. The predicted occurrence of the dusky grouper overlapped widely (Schoener's D = 0.71; Warren's I = 0.91) between the models, despite small differences on the southern and northern extremes of the distribution. These results suggest that basic information provided by fishers on species occurrence in their area can be reliable enough to predict species occurrence over large scales and can be potentially useful for marine spatial planning. Fishers' knowledge may be an even more viable alternative to data collection than what was previously thought, for countries that both struggle with financial limitations and have urgent conservation needs.

AB  - La R union Island has the largest area of intact vegetation of the islands in the Mascarene archipelago. Biological invasions are the primary threat to biodiversity in the intact habitats of the island (those not already transformed by agriculture and urbanization). Our study aimed to identify areas to prioritize in managing invasive alien plants for biodiversity conservation. We used extensive surveys of 238 distinct untransformed areas on La Reunion to define the current distribution patterns of all invasive species. Using expert knowledge, we compiled maps of the current distribution of the 46 most widespread/important invasive plants at the habitat scale (identified according to vegetation structure). Data from 440 botanical releves for the 20 most threatening invasive alien plant species across the island and climatic envelope models were used to derive climatic suitability surfaces; these were used to map potential distributions for these species. More than 10 species invade 16.7% of the remaining habitat. Five habitat types are invaded by 25 or more species, and eight have fewer than 10 invasive alien plant species. Cluster analysis based on presence/absence of species in the 18 habitat types produced eight groups of species that invade particular habitats. Potential distribution models show that some species have invaded large parts of their potential range (e.g. Fuchsia magellanica, Furcraea foetida, Hiptage benghalensis), whereas others have the potential to increase their range substantially (e.g. Clidemia hirta, Strobilanthes hamiltonianus, Ulex europaeus). Management implications are identified for both groups. Three broad groups of habitats were identified: (i) intact habitats with a low level of invasion (e.g. subalpine shrubland); (ii) moderately invaded habitats with varying levels of intactness (ranging from windward submountain rainforest to the Acacia heterophylla forest); and (iii) habitats with little remaining intact area and high levels of invasion (e.g. lowland rainforest). Different management interventions are appropriate for these three groups.

AB  - Climate change will significantly affect the distribution area of species. Through establishing distribution model, we can simulate the current and future potential distribution range and provide reference for the introduction and cultivation planning of rare or economic plants. Dendrocalamus sinicus, endemic to Yunnan Province of China, is the strongest woody bamboo in the world. In the present study, the MaxEnt model was performed to simulate the distribution of different types of D. sinicus in China and neighboring countries or regions. The results suggested that the suitable distribution range of "straight type'', the main type for cultivation and utilization, was 8 degrees-30 degrees N and 73 degrees-122 degrees E under the current climate conditions, while the potential distribution range of "bending type'' was 6 degrees-31 degrees N and 79 degrees-109 degrees E. The two most key climate variables associated with distribution of "straight type'' were "Temperature Annual Range'' with 36.6% contribution rate and "Temperature Seasonality'' (32.4%), while "Isothermality'' (47.8%) and "Precipitation of Driest Month'' (24.8%) for "bending type''. Under different climate change scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP5-8.5) and periods (2050, 2090), the potential distribution area of the "straight type'' were apparently different, indicating that the distribution area of D. sinicus will be affected significantly by climate changes in the future. Our findings would be not only beneficial to understanding limiting factors for natural distribution of D. sinicus, but also helpful for further germplasm conservation, introduction and cultivation planning of this rare woody bamboo.

AB  - AimThe study of areas of sympatry of species with predominantly parapatric distributions can provide valuable insights into their evolutionary history and the factors shaping patterns of species co-occurrence. This information is key in biogeography, evolutionary biology and conservation planning. In this study we analyse the distributions of two pairs of partially co-occurring congeneric amphibian species: tree frogs (Hyla molleri and H. meridionalis) and midwife toads (Alytes obstetricans and A. cisternasii).
   LocationIberian Peninsula (SW Europe).
   MethodsWe obtained distribution data from the herpetological atlases of Portugal and Spain, consisting of presences and absences on UTM 10x10km grid cells. We built an environmental favourability model for each species, using 24 potential predictor variables representative of physiography, climate and human activity. Variables were selected for each model using both information and significance criteria. Models were evaluated using both calibration and discrimination measures. Models were then combined using fuzzy intersection, and compared using correlation analysis (accounting for spatial autocorrelation), niche comparison metrics and fuzzy similarity indices.
   ResultsWe found significant dissimilarity between the favourability patterns for A. obstetricans and A. cisternasii, indicating environmental segregation of these two midwife toad species. In tree frogs, we found significant similarity between favourability for H. meridionalis and for its co-occurrence with H. molleri - that is, sympatry occurs mainly in areas that are favourable for H. meridionalis.
   Main conclusionsThese results provide clues to understand the evolutionary history of these four species, including the evolution of reproductive isolation, and suggest that conservation efforts for tree frogs may be focused on the areas that are favourable for both species, whereas midwife toads will require specific measures tailored for each species.

AB  - Understanding environmental factor determining ecological niche is very important to elucidating the distribution of species, and also revealing how closely related species are able to coexist in a particular region. Here, we applied ecological niche modeling to develop the ecological niches of two hynobiid salamanders: Salamandrella keyserlingii and Hynobius retardatus which are co-occurring on Hokkaido Island, Japan. We, then, tested hypotheses about ecological niche differentiation between the two species. Our models showed that the potential distribution of S. keyserlingii was strictly limited to a small area at Kushiro Marsh, while the suitable distribution of H. retardatus was covered widely on Hokkaido Island. The results revealed the little geographic range overlap and the differentiation on the requirements of the ecological condition between the two species. We found nonequivalent niches in identity tests and counterintuitive results in background tests, indicating that S. keyserlingii has used a habitat subset of H. retardatus. Overall, our result contributed to understand the ecological niche space, and suggest the historical formation of these species on Hokkaido Island. The models can also be used to aid conservation purposes, such as habitat management, planning and designation of protected areas.

AB  - Coastal and marine ecosystems characterized by foundation species, such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and mangrove forests, are rich in biodiversity and support a range of ecosystem services including coastal protection, food provisioning, water filtration, carbon sequestration, recreational opportunities, cultural value, among others. These ecosystems have experienced degradation and a net loss of total area in regions around the world due to a host of anthropogenic stressors, resulting in declines in the associated ecosystem services they provide. Because of the extensive degradation in many locations, increasing attention has turned to ecosystem restoration of these marine habitats. Restoration techniques for marine and coastal ecosystems are generally more expensive when compared to terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting locations that will provide the largest return on investment, not only for the probability and magnitude of restoration success, but also for ecosystem service outcomes. However, site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration receive relatively lithe attention in the scientific literature, suggesting a need to better study how spatial planning tools could be incorporated into restoration practice. To the degree that site selection has been formally evaluated in the literature, the criteria have tended to focus more on environmental conditions beneficial for the restored habitat, and less on ecosystem service outcomes once the habitat is restored, which may vary considerably from site to site, or with more complex landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of connectivity. Here we (1) review recent (2015-2019) scientific peer-reviewed literature for several marine ecosystems (seagrass beds, salt marshes, and mangrove forests) to investigate how commonly site selection or spatial planning principles are applied or investigated in scholarly research about marine ecosystem restoration at different spatial scales, (2) provide a conceptual overview of the rationale for applying spatial planning principles to marine ecosystem restoration, and (3) highlight promising analytical approaches from the marine spatial planning and conservation planning literatures that could help improve restoration outcomes. We argue that strategic site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration, particularly applied at larger spatial scales and accounting for ecosystem service outcomes, can help support more effective restoration.

AB  - Species distribution models are popular statistical tools for inferring potential distribution range of species across space and time and are extensively used in conservation planning. Models based on presence-only data (e.g., MaxEnt) are widely used; however, these models assume perfect species detectability. Occupancy modelling is considered a better modelling technique since it accounts for species detectability. Presence-only models are relatively simpler, requiring only presence locations, while occupancy models are data hungry models requiring detection/non-detection data from multiple visits to the survey sites. We utilized data from the Kerala Bird Atlas (India) and modelled current distribution for 109 species using MaxEnt and occupancy approaches. MaxEnt performed well even with less occurrences, while occupancy model failed for species with fewer than 40 records. In terms of evaluation metrics, AUC and Root Mean Square Error, both models performed relatively better for species with low occurrences than those with high occurrences (generalist species). The comparison metrics (Relative-rank scores, Root Mean Square Error, Hellinger distance and Expectation of Shared Presences) were significantly correlated with the number of occurrences; MaxEnt and occupancy based SDMs for widespread species had more concordance than SDMs of narrowly distributed species. There was some discordance between algorithms with regards to diversity hotspot. Selection of best combination of variables and correction for overprediction can help improve performances of both models and improve consistency between them. Given the data hungry nature of occupancy models and marginal difference with the MaxEnt models; it appears that latter is better suited for predicting the distribution of rare species and studies dealing with cumulative data from multiple species.

AB  - Climate is a core aspect of a species' niche that is frequently incorporated into species distribution models (SDMs). The proliferation of readily accessible climate data is stimulating the increasing use of climate-based species distribution models (CSDMs) in conservation planning and management. However, it is uncertain how sensitive CSDMs are to the choice of climate data used. We compared the performance of maximum entropy-based CSDMs calibrated with seven different climate data sets (WorldClim, Chelsa, TerraClimate, Climate Research Unit Time-Series [CRU-TS], PRISM, StreamCat, and EarthEnv). For each species (four amphibians and two reptiles in California), we used a standardized, objective procedure to select climate predictors from each data set. We then assessed performance with standard metrics, calculated variable importance scores, and compared predicted distributions to historical range maps of the target species. The climate data set used affected CSDM performance, with models based on some data sets overpredicting and others underpredicting distribu-tions compared with historical range maps of each of the species. Critically, for the six species we tested, no one climate data set always performed worst or best. These results indicate that the effects of different climate data sets should be incorporated into model evaluation when developing, applying, and interpreting climate-based SDMs.

AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are frequently associated with negative effects on biodiversity in natural and semi natural landscapes. Innovative spatio-temporal modelling tools may be valuable to support the design and optimization of conservation strategies for endangered species in a context of changes in land use and land cover (LULC). The Red-billed Chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) is a vulnerable corvid that exhibits high levels of population fragmentation and decline trends, due to its dependence on open habitats shaped by traditional agriculture and pastoralism. Here, we apply a spatially-explicit framework based on the stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM) principles to capture the trends of relevant population foraging ground attributes, assumed as proxies of the habitat suitability for two endangered Portuguese chough populations. StDM simulations were produced in order to capture the densities and distribution patterns of foraging flocking choughs in response to the complexity and dynamics of some realistic abandonment LULC scenarios expected to occur in the near future. Our modelling outputs reflect satisfactorily the seasonality of these patterns and suggest that the maintenance of traditional agriculture/pastoralism practices in at least 75% of the actual favourable areas is mandatory to ensure the foraging habitat suitability for choughs, evidencing the species high vulnerability in their last refuges in Portugal. This modelling approach represents a step forward in evaluating the consequences of LULC changes on endangered birds, which can be used in the future to guide effective conservation planning in the scope of habitat suitability management.

AB  - Kelp, seaweeds of the order Laminariales, are of ecological and conservation importance because they form undersea forest habitat for many varieties of fauna and flora including mammals, and commercial fish species. In the absence of a world map of the kelp biome, we predicted its potential distribution using geographic records and environment variables in a MaxEnt model. This estimated that the kelp biome occupied 1,469,900 km(2) and was present on 22% of the world's coastline. While average sea surface temperature was the most important environmental variable for the biome across all species, wave height, distance from the coast and minimum temperature were of most importance for individual species. This map can be used in planning where marine reserves should be best located, modelling the effects of climate change, and in estimating the blue (ocean) carbon storage. Current field observations should confirm the presence of kelp within the modelled biome, and if absent consider if human impacts, including climate change, are to blame.

AB  - There is an increasing need to model the distribution of species and habitats for effective conservation planning, but there is a paucity of models for the marine environment. We used presence (131) and absence (219) records of the marine angiosperm Zostera marina L from the archipelago of SW Finland, northern Baltic Sea, to model its distribution in a 5400 km(2) area. We used depth, slope, turbidity, wave exposure and distance to sandy shores as environmental predictors, and compared a presence-absence method: generalised additive model (GAM), with a presence only method: maximum entropy (Maxent). Models were validated using semi-independent data sets. Both models performed well and described the niche of Z marina fairly consistently, although there were differences in the way the models weighted the environmental variables, and consequently the spatial predictions differed somewhat. A notable outcome from the process was that with relatively equal model performance, the area actually predicted in geographical space can vary by twofold. The area predicted as suitable for Z marina by the ensemble was almost half of that predicted by the GAM model by itself. The ensemble of model predictions increased the model predictive capability marginally and clearly shifted the model towards a more conservative prediction, increasing specificity, but at the same time sacrificing sensitivity. The environmental predictors selected into the final models described the potential distribution of Z. marina well and showed that in the northern Baltic the species occupies a narrow niche, typically thriving in shallow and moderately exposed to exposed locations near sandy shores. We conclude that a prediction based on a combination of model results provides a more realistic estimate of the core area suitable for Z. marina and should be the modelling approach implemented in conservation planning and management.

AB  - Full-coverage maps on the distribution of marine biotopes are a necessary basis for Nature Conservation and Marine Spatial Planning. Yet biotope maps do not exist in many regions. We are generating the first full-coverage biotope map for the German Baltic Sea according to the HELCOM Underwater biotope and habitat classification system (HUB). Species distribution modelling is applied to create full-coverage spatial information of biological features. The results of biomass modelling of twelve target taxa and presence/absence modelling of three target taxa enabled the identification of biological levels up to HUB level 6. Environmental data on bathymetry, light penetration depth and substrate are used to identify habitat levels. HUB biotope levels were combined with HUB habitat levels to create a biotope map. Altogether, 68 HUB biotopes are identified in the German Baltic Sea. The new biotope map combining substrate characteristics and biological communities will facilitate marine management in the area.

AB  - Himalayan monal is a conservation priority species in its entire distribution range because of its declining population due to various anthropogenic threats. However, the information on its distribution and abundance is lacking, which is vital for conservation and management planning. Hence, the present study has assessed the abundance and occupancy of Himalayan monal in Uttarkashi district (Uttarakhand). Camera traps and conventional sign surveys were used for documenting the species during 2018-2019. We deployed a total of 69 camera traps (2819 trap nights) and surveyed 54 trails (650 km), representing the entire habitat and topographic variability of the landscape. The single-season occupancy framework was used to understand the distribution and occupancy of Himalayan monal in the Uttarkashi district. The top model suggests that the occupancy probability of Himalayan monal was positively influenced (beta = 27.52 SE +/- 16.25) by landscape slope and was negatively influenced by Reserve Forest (RF) (beta = -8.14 SE +/- 4.99). The observed naive occupancy of Himalayan monal was 0.69 in the study area, which was slightly lower than the estimated occupancy. However, in the null model, the site occupancy estimated was found to be 0.82 +/- 0.08 with a detection probability of 0.23 +/- 0.03. The overall abundance of monal was estimated to be 171.58 +/- 10.2 individuals in the study area with an average density of 0.62 km(-2). The activity pattern analysis indicates that Himalayan monal remains very active between 6:00 and 12:00 h and slightly less active during mid-day hours when humans are most active 11:30-16:30 h in its habitat. The present study is a first attempt to estimate occupancy and abundance of monal in non-protected areas (PA) using both the camera traps and sign surveys. We found that Himalayan monal is abundant outside the PAs, which is a good indication of its long-term viability. We also identified areas for conservation and management prioritization in Uttarkashi.

AB  - Aim Distribution modelling is a useful approach to obtain knowledge about the spatial distribution of biodiversity, required for, for example, red-list assessments. While distribution modelling methods have been applied mostly to single species, modelling of communities and ecosystems (EDM; ecosystem-level distribution modelling) produces results that are more directly relevant for management and decision-making. Although the choice of predictors is a pivotal part of the modelling process, few studies have compared the suitability of different sets of predictors for EDM. In this study, we compare the performance of 50 single environmental variables with that of 11 composite landscape gradients (CLGs) for prediction of ecosystem types. The CLGs represent gradients in landscape element composition derived from multivariate analyses, for example "inner-outer coast" and "land use intensity." Location Norway. Methods We used data from field-based ecosystem-type mapping of nine ecosystem types, and environmental variables with a resolution of 100 x 100 m. We built nine models for each ecosystem type with variables from different predictor sets. Logistic regression with forward selection of variables was used for EDM. Models were evaluated with independently collected data. Results Most ecosystem types could be predicted reliably, although model performance differed among ecosystem types. We identified significant differences in predictive power and model parsimony across models built from different predictor sets. Climatic variables alone performed poorly, indicating that the current climate alone is not sufficient to predict the current distribution of ecosystems. Used alone, the CLGs resulted in parsimonious models with relatively high predictive power. Used together with other variables, they consistently improved the models. Main conclusions Our study highlights the importance of variable selection in EDM. We argue that the use of composite variables as proxies for complex environmental gradients has the potential to improve predictions from EDMs and thus to inform conservation planning as well as improve the precision and credibility of red lists and global change assessments.

AB  - Among the expected consequences of climate change are shifts in species' ranges. Most of current methods to predict such shifts in species distributions consider changes in suitability of climatic conditions for existence. With these models, it is possible to indicate the potential distribution of species that would arise under spatial conditions that cause unlimited landscape accessibility and habitat suitability. At the regional scale, however, detailed predictions of changes in species distributions and performance are pivotal for conservation planning. This study aims to predict species occurrences at the regional scale, incorporating demographic processes and dispersal to assess habitat accessibility and suitability in detail. We investigated a system with trophic dependence: the Alcon blue butterfly (Phengaris alcon) is fully dependent on the occurrence of its host plant species marsh gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe). We applied a model chain, consisting of a soil and biomass model, a plant species occurrence and dispersal model and a butterfly metapopulation model. We investigated the effect of future climate change, both under affected and unaffected habitat conditions as determined by host plant occurrence. Our modelled results show that the butterflies perform best when habitat conditions remain unaffected by climate change. However, when climate change does affect the occurrence of its host plant species, butterfly distribution and performance will be deteriorated. This implies that detailed predictions of changes in species distributions and performance should incorporate dispersal, demographic processes and biotic interactions explicitly. Our approach allows for the identification of locations that are potentially suitable for the measures increasing network robustness for P. alcon. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mahseers are an important group of fishes endemic to Asia with most species considered threatened. Conservation plans to save declining wild populations are hindered by unstable taxonomy, and detailed systematic review could form a solid platform for future management and conservation. D-loop and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) mtDNA sequences were examined in nine mahseer species of Tor, Neolissochilus, and Naziritor. Pseudogenes amplified in a portion of the species limited the utility of the D-loop region. ABGD analysis, NJ, ML, and MP methods and genetic distance (TrN + I + G) using COI data revealed concordant species delimiting patterns. The three genera were monophyletic, separated as distinct clades (TrN + I + G 0.064 to 0.106), and Naziritor was flagged as a separate genus, distinct from Puntius (TrN + I + G 0.196). Out of seven nominal species known for Tor cogeners from India, only five were recovered with mtDNA data (TrN + I + G 0.000 to 0.037) and two species could not be distinguished with the molecular data set employed. Tor mosal, synonymized as Tor putitora, was rediscovered as a distinct species (TrN + I + G 0.031) based on its type locality. Tor mussulah was confirmed as a separate species (TrN + I + G 0.019 to 0.026). Two valid species, Tor macrolepis and T. mosal mahanadicus, were not distinct from T. putitora (TrN + I + G 0.00). The high divergence with mtDNA data failed to validate T. mosal mahanadicus as a subspecies of T. mosal (TrN + I + G 0.031). Morphological outliers discovered within the distribution range of Tor tor (TrN + I + G 0.022 to 0.025) shared the same lineage with T. putitora (TrN + I + G 0.002 to 0.005), indicating a new extended distribution of the Himalayan mahseer T. putitora in the rivers of the Indian central plateau. The findings indicate the need for integrating molecular and morphological tools for taxonomic revision of the Tor and Naziritor genera, so that taxa are precisely defined for accurate in situ and ex situ conservation decisions.

AB  - Aim: To inform conservation planning in the face of climate change, our objectives were to map spatial patterns of tree and songbird macrorefugia; to identify climatic limiting factors by region and taxonomic group; and to quantify multi-scale topographic components of end-of-century biotic refugia.
   Location: United States and Canada outside the far north.
   Time period: End of the 21st century.
   Major taxa studiedL Trees and songbirds.
   Methods: We used species distribution models for 324 trees and 268 songbirds to develop a macrorefugia index using species-specific climate velocity. Maps of multispecies refugia potential were developed for each taxonomic/functional group and quantile regression was used to identify climatic limiting factors and relationships with multi-scale topographic variables.
   Results: End-of-century macrorefugia for both trees and songbirds were concentrated in western mountains and, to a lesser extent, in north-eastern coastal regions. For the highest-value refugia, precipitation was generally most limiting in the north, and warm temperatures and moisture availability were limiting in the south. Tree refugia were more limited by precipitation and moisture, while songbird refugia were more limited by temperature. Upper-percentile refugia, but not median values, were well explained by topographic conditions. Songbird refugia were strongly associated with elevation, while coastal proximity and landform composition (particularly headwaters) were important for both groups. There was a general lack of concordance between patterns of current species richness and future climate refugia.
   Main conclusions: Macrorefugia patterns are partly explained by steep elevational or latitudinal temperature gradients and/or moderate climates, such as coastal regions. However, climatic limiting factors for these refugia suggest contrasts in the ecological processes governing warm-end range limits for different taxa in different regions. Our framework can be applied to other regions, taxa, and time periods to generate and explain biologically meaningful indices of macrorefugia for conservation planning.

AB  - In the Iberian Peninsula, Oak Decline (hereafter, OD) is becoming a serious and frequently occurring disease in Mediterranean oaks. Decline processes seem to involve multiple biotic and abiotic factors, which combine to reduce the vigour of oak trees often causing death. However, the exact causes of its extension are still unknown and therefore, given the ecological, economic and social relevance of these trees in Mediterranean countries it is crucial to develop tools that allow us to anticipate its occurrence and to reduce its expansion. In this sense, the present work aims to (i) unravel the relative role of environmental factors on the distribution of one of the most important phenomena that threat the biodiversity of the Iberian oaks, and (ii) to produce a spatially explicit model of OD risk, to assist conservation managers dealing with this phenomenon. To this, we have used a dataset of OD foci gathered during the period 2015-2017 by the program "Methodology for the inventory and monitoring of oak masses affected by the decline of oak in the southwest of Castilla y Leon" (this region is beginning to suffer the damages of this disease). In total, 68 locations were used to assess relationships with environmental factors (topographic conditions, abiotic stress conditions and human influence) using maximum entropy models (hereafter, MaxEnt) and variance-partitioning. OD distribution seems to be principally influenced by land-use (mainly dehesas), followed by dryer areas and areas with low slope gradients facing south or southeast. The resulting model has been used to produce a detailed OD risk map in central-western Spain. Our modelling approach may contribute to inform conservation planning and to establish the adequate management policy for Iberian oak dehesas, by helping to identify regions where the risk of OD is high.

AB  - The black coral Leiopathes glaberrima is an important habitat forming species that supports benthic biodiversity. Due to its high sensitivity to fishing activities, it has been classified as indicator of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs). However, the information on its habitat selection and large-scale spatial distribution in the Mediterranean Sea is poor. In this study a thorough literature review on the occurrence of L. glaberrima across the Mediterranean Sea was undertaken. Predictive modelling was carried out to produce the first continuous map of L. glaberrima suitable habitat in the central sector of the Mediterranean Sea. MaxEnt modeling was used to predict L. glaberrima probability of presence as a function of seven environmental predictors (bathymetry, slope, aspect North-South and East-West, kinetic energy due to currents at the seabed, seabed habitat types and sea bottom temperature). Our results show that bathymetry, slope and aspect are the most important factors driving L. glaberrima spatial distribution, while in less extent the other environmental variables. This study adds relevant information on the spatial distribution of vulnerable deep water corals in relation to the environmental factors in the Mediterranean Sea. It provides an important background for marine spatial planning especially for prioritizing areas for the conservation of VMEs.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of habitat selection is fundamental to the construction of proper conservation and management plans for many avian species. Habitat changes caused by human beings increase the landscape complexity and thus the complexity of data available for explaining species distribution. New techniques that assume no linearity and capable to extrapolate the response variables across landscapes are needed for dealing with difficult relationships between habitat variables and distribution data. We used a random forest algorithm to study breeding-site selection of herons and egrets in a human-influenced landscape by analyzing land use around their colonies. We analyzed the importance of each land-use variable for different scales and its relationship to the probability of colony presence. We found that there exist two main spatial scales on which herons and egrets select their colony sites: medium scale (4 km) and large scale (10-15 km). Colonies were attracted to areas with large amounts of evergreen forests at the medium scale, whereas avoidance of high-density urban areas was important at the large scale. Previous studies used attractive factors, mainly foraging areas, to explain bird-colony distributions, but our study is the first to show the major importance of repellent factors at large scales. We believe that the newest non-linear methods, such as random forests, are needed when modelling complex variable interactions when organisms are distributed in complex landscapes. These methods could help to improve the conservation plans of those species threatened by the advance of highly human-influenced landscapes.

AB  - Determining climatic and physiographic variables in Mexico's major ecoregions that are limiting to biodiversity and species of high conservation concern is essential for their conservation. Yet, at the national level to date, few studies have been performed with large data sets and cross-confirmation using multiple statistical analyses. Here, we used 25 endemic, rare and endangered species from 3610 sampling points throughout Mexico and 25 environmental attributes, including average precipitation for different seasons of the year, annual dryness index, slope of the terrain; and maximum, minimum and average temperatures to test our hypothesis that these species could be assessed with the same weight among all variables, showing similar indices of importance. Our results using principal component analysis, covariation analysis by permutations, and random forest regression showed that summer precipitation, length of the frost-free period, spring precipitation, winter precipitation and growing season precipitation all strongly influence the abundance of tropical species. In contrast, annual precipitation and the balance at different seasons (summer and growing season) were the most relevant variables on the temperate region species. For dry areas, the minimum temperature of the coldest month and the maximum temperature of the warmest month were the most significant variables. Using these different associations in different climatic regions could support a more precise management and conservation plan for the preservation of plant species diversity in forests under different global warming scenarios.

AB  - When organisms with similar phenotypes have conflicting management and conservation initiatives, approaches are needed to differentiate among subpopulations or discrete groups. For example, the eastern metapopulation of the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) has a migratory phenotype that is culled because they are viewed as a threat to commercial and natural resources, whereas resident birds are targeted for conservation. Understanding the distinct breeding habitats of resident versus migratory cormorants would aid in identification and management decisions. Here, we use species distribution models (SDM: Maxent) of cormorant nesting habitat to examine the eastern P. auritus metapopulation and the predicted breeding sites of its phenotypes. We then estimate the phenotypic identity of breeding colonies of cormorants where management plans are being developed. We transferred SDMs trained on data from resident bird colonies in Florida and migratory bird colonies in Minnesota to South Carolina in an effort to identify the phenotype of breeding cormorants there based on the local landscape characteristics. Nesting habitat characteristics of cormorant colonies in South Carolina more closely resembled those of the Florida phenotype than those of birds of the Minnesota phenotype. The presence of the resident phenotype in summer suggests that migratory and resident cormorants will co-occur in South Carolina in winter. Thus, there is an opportunity for separate management strategies for the two phenotypes in that state. We found differences in nesting habitat characteristics that could be used to refine management strategies and reduce human conflicts with abundant winter migrants and, at the same time, conserve less common colonies of resident cormorants. The models we use here show potential for advancing the study of geographically overlapping phenotypes with differing conservation and management priorities.

AB  - The urbanization process affects faunal distributions and movement patterns, contributing directly to biotic homogenization and representing an important threat to biodiversity. In particular, birds, which have been well studied as indicators of anthropogenic disturbance, are especially valuable in evaluating these impacts.
   While the negative impact of these processes and structures, most notably road and railway networks, are now well appreciated (e.g. habitat loss, disturbance, noise, mortality by collisions, barrier effects), the potentially positive effects on wildlife are less appreciated (the number of documented negative effects of roads on animal abundance outnumbered the number of positive effects by a factor of 5). Here, were reviewed a total of 92 peer-reviewed publications for the period of 36 years between 1978 and 2014, which reported positive effects of roads and associated anthropogenic structures on birds. Our results show that roads, railways and several associated constructions, commonly implicated in the decline of biodiversity, may also have positive effects on certain bird species or communities. The main types of positive effects on birds identified were classified as: (1) roads: providing foraging habitat; reducing the predation pressures; and providing a warm surface assists in conserving metabolic energy; (2) lights of streets: prolonging diurnal activity; (3) powerlines, fences, etc. along roads: providing perches for hunting activities; and (4) bridges, pylons, tree lines along roadsides, bases of powerline pylons: providing nesting sites and cover from predators. From this review, we provide a useful tool for ecologists, road planners and other stakeholders engaged on conservation or landscape planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In most tropical and subtropical biomes, conservation strategies are mainly focused on the preservation of forests. However, neotropical dry forest and savanna ecoregions include open habitats that may deserve conservation attention. We analyzed the historical patterns and potential distribution of natural grasslands, as well as their biodiversity in the northern Argentina dry Chaco, which is one of the largest and yet most rapidly transforming neotropical ecoregions. Paleocological literature, historical records, and bioclimatic modeling support the hypothesis that Chaco grasslands distribution was more extended in the past, and has been historically reduced by woody encroachment resulting from environmental changes occurred in the past century. Recent research shows that natural grasslands host distinctive components of the Chaco biodiversity, and a significant proportion of the vertebrate species have a negative association with woody biomass. Ongoing land use trends continue to threaten native grasslands both in unprotected sectors (where they are converted into agriculture and planted pastures) and inside protected areas (were fire suppression is favoring woody encroachment). Current conservation policies (Protected Areas, Argentine forest law, REDD+) neglect the importance of native grasslands for biodiversity conservation. Such forest-centered initiatives should be revised to specifically include native grasslands and their biodiversity into land use strategies that adequately balance agriculture and livestock production with biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Prediction of species' potentially suitable distribution areas and their range shifts under future climate change has long been the focus of macroecology and biogeography. Gymnocypris chilianensis of Schizothoracinae and Triplophysa hsutschouensis of Triplophysa are isolated to the Shiyang, Heihe, and Shule Rivers of the Hexi River system, listed from east to west, along the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). This spatial distribution provides a valuable set of conditions for investigating patterns of habitat suitability and potential impacts of accelerated plateau climate change on endemic plateau fish species. Here, we employed the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to first evaluate potentially suitable habitats of the two species and identify the primary impact factors under the current climate based on occurrence records and environmental variables; then, we predicted changes in suitable habitat areas and distribution centers under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs), 2.6 and 8.5, for the future (2050 and 2070). The results showed that annual precipitation and altitude were the two most important environmental factors predicting the suitable habitat of G. chilianensis and T. hsutschouensis. The areas of suitable habitat for G. chilianensis and T. hsutschouensis experienced a sequential westward decrease from the Shiyang River towards the Heihe and Shule Rivers under the current climate conditions. Under future climate changes, the areas of the potential geographical distribution of G. chilianensis and T. hsutschouensis were concentrated eastward towards the Shiyang River, the area of the species' ancestral origins. Suitable habitat centers of the two species shifted eastward from the Heihe River to the Shiyang River and higher altitude areas. Additionally, G. chilianensis showed a greater reduction in suitable habitat and greater eastward range shift compared to T. hsutschouensis. These findings provide empirical evidence that accelerated climate change on the QTP has severe consequences for endemic populations with restricted and isolated habitats. This study demonstrates that different plateau fish have similarities and differences in their responses to climate change. Our findings also highlight that the effects of climate change must be incorporated into the integrated conservation plans for fish species on the QTP and its adjacent areas.

AB  - Wildlife managers are often required to make important conservation and recovery decisions despite incomplete and uncertain knowledge of the species and ecosystems they manage. Conducting further research to collect more empirical data may reduce that uncertainty. However, a sense of urgency often surrounds threatened or endangered species' management and decisions cannot wait until a definitive understanding of a species' ecology and distribution is obtained. Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) are proving to be valuable and flexible tools for integrating available expert knowledge and empirical data, thus strengthening conservation decisions when empirical data is lacking. We developed a BBN model and linked it to a geographical information system (GIS) to map habitat suitability for the Julia Creek dunnart (Sminthopsis douglasi), an endangered ground-dwelling mammal of the Mitchell grasslands of north-west Queensland, Australia. Expert knowledge, supported by field data, was used to determine the probabilistic influence of grazing pressure, density of the invasive shrub prickly acacia (Acacia nilotica), land tenure, soil variability and seasonal variability on dunnart habitat suitability. The model was then applied in a GIS to map the likelihood of suitable dunnart habitat. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the influence of environmental conditions and management options on habitat suitability. The study provides an example of how expert knowledge and limited empirical data can be combined within a BBN model, and linked to GIS data, to assist in recovery planning of endangered fauna populations.

AB  - Statistical models predicting species distributions are essential not only to increase knowledge on species but for their application in conservation and ecologically-based management. The variation of fish species richness and abundance in the most representative habitats (saltmarsh, mudflat and subtidal) in five estuaries along the Portuguese coast was analysed through seasonal sampling surveys in 2009. Generalized additive models (GAM) were developed to describe the variation of species richness and abundances with a set of geomorphologic, hydrologic and environmental characteristics from the sampled estuaries and habitats. GAM were chosen as the complex interactions dominating these ecosystems and species distribution are non-linear. Final models built for each estuary and for all estuaries together performed well during the calibration phase and also during the validation phase, where an unused data sub-set from each estuary was used. There was not a similar combination of variables retained by the models for the studied estuaries but factors such as the area of the habitat, the distance to estuary mouth, percentage of mud in the sediment and depth were commonly retained. The partial effect of these predictor variables on the variation of species richness and abundance in the estuaries varied markedly and the importance of preserving the heterogeneity of habitats within estuaries was highlighted. Models for each individual estuary performed better than models for estuaries combined. Predictive models could be useful as a preliminary tool to prepare long-term conservation plans at different scales. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The goal of the Endangered Species Act is to improve the chances of listed species' survival by increasing population levels (US Fish and Wildlife Service in American burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus) recovery plan. Newton Corner, MA, p 80, 1991). If successful, a species will be delisted, but in order to achieve the goal of species recovery the demography, habitat preferences, reproductive biology, and cause of the species decline must be understood. Like many rare invertebrates, information about the endangered American burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus) prior to listing consisted of the taxonomic description and morphological characterization. Surveys for N. americanus provide data that can be integrated into spatial models to help predict suitable habitat. Our objective was to model the potential distribution of N. americanus and to evaluate these models ability to generate maps of potential habitat, thus focusing recovering efforts. We chose six modelling algorithms that utilized both presence and absence data from beetle surveys conducted throughout eastern Oklahoma. Using area under the curve (AUC) as our evaluation statistic, we found that ten of the twelve models performed within the AUC index category of "potentially useful" (AUC 0.7-0.9). Models utilizing presence only data performed well compared to models built with presence/absence data. This may indicate the weakness of using absence data to indicate unsuitable habitat. Lack of integration into the model of biotic interactions may also be affecting model performance. To improve model performance, the causes of N. americanus's endangered status and its population shrinkage should be considered. Although the best models were not highly accurate, the map of suitable habitat can help to inform conservation biologists of areas with a likelihood of N. americanus presence. Overgenerous models can mislead conservation planners in thinking that more areas are highly suitable. If resources are limited for planning preserves and areas of reintroduction, it may be better to be conservative and to limit consideration to the most suitable habitat.

AB  - Context Regional conservation efforts should incorporate fine scale landscape genetic and habitat suitability data for management decisions. This information permits conservation measures to be tailored to a specific landscape. Objectives We investigated the landscape determinants of gene flow and habitat suitability for the state-threatened Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) in northeastern New York (NNY). We applied the results from each to examine their complementary contributions to local connectivity and genetic structuring. Methods We conducted population and individual-based genetic analyses with microsatellite data to evaluate genetic structuring and landscape genetics in NNY. We coupled these genetic analyses with species distribution modeling (SDM) to estimate the extent of suitable habitat across this important region for species persistence in the state. Results Gene flow was strongly associated with open water and cultivated land, indicating the role open water channels play in connecting neighboring activity centers, and the propensity of females to select cultivated land to nest. Species distribution models based on Landsat-derived vegetation indices and percentage of scrub-shrub wetlands accurately identified Blanding's turtle habitat. Connectivity estimates from our NNY focal area using landscape genetic and SDM resistance surfaces showed potential movement constraints between the two genetic clusters. Conclusions Land cover better explained genetic distance data than geographic distance for Blanding's turtles in our focal area. Accurate SDMs were developed for our focal area with a small number of occurrences (< 50). Using both gene flow and habitat-informed resistance surfaces revealed localized connectivity constraints associated with each, permitting more comprehensive landscape planning.

AB  - Population declines and extirpations of large mammalian carnivores are major concerns for global biodiversity conservation. Many large carnivores are vulnerable to conflict with humans and attract conservation attention for their flagship appeal and ecological importance. Coexisting with carnivores requires an understanding of carnivore distribution and abundance relative to human activities and disturbances. Such knowledge is often hindered by the rare and elusive nature of carnivores and the lack of systematic ecological surveys in biodiverse regions facing high levels of threat. The Caucasus Ecoregion is one such biodiversity hotspot harboring several threatened mammal species for which there is a paucity of reliable data, including brown bears (Ursus arctos). Caucasus brown bear populations have declined significantly from historical times and may be isolated and vulnerable to disturbance from development activities such as mining, as well as increasing hunting pressure. To inform land-use planning and bear conservation in the Caucasus Ecoregion, we conducted systematic surveys in May-October 2015 in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains within the Vayots Dzor region of Armenia. We used noninvasive genetic sampling, camera trapping, and statistical models that account for imperfect detection to estimate density and distribution of the bear population in the 1,000-km(2) study area. Across 34 sampling sites, we obtained 3,163 camera-trap photos of brown bears and genotyped 28 individual bears (7 males and 21 females). Spatially explicit capture-recapture models revealed an unexpectedly high density of bears (59. 4 / 1 ,000 km(2) ; females = 44.6, 95% confidence interval, CI = 25.4-78.4; males = 14.8, 95% CI = 6.6-34.0), and multi-method occupancy models indicated that bears were distributed across most of the study area (psi = 0.85; SE = 0.07). These results provide robust evidence that a significant population of brown bears persists in Armenia's Vayots Dzor region, despite a history of hunting and habitat loss that have driven declines in brown bear populations throughout much of the Caucasus Ecoregion. Continued persistence of this flagship species may be threatened by mining, poaching, and other anthropogenic pressures in the region, underscoring the urgent need for strategic conservation planning, impact mitigation, and expanded ecological monitoring within this biodiversity hotspot.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change ( CC) is affecting a wide range of ecosystems and species, modifying current biodiversity patterns, and increasing the risk of extinction for many species. To address this threat, identifying, managing and protecting climate refugia has been suggested as an approach to incorporate CC into systematic conservation planning. In this study, we applied a detailed Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) approach with the Maximum Entropy Algorithm to assess the potential effects of CC on the distribution of climatic suitability for Saguinus leucopus and Saguinus oedipus. These two species were investigated to identify climate refugia, and to assess the effectiveness of Protected Areas (PAs). Correlative models were generated with presence records, and bioclimatic variables describing recent (similar to 2000) and future (similar to 2050) climates, with data from two Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), describing moderate (RCP 4.5) and extreme (RCP 8.5) climate change scenarios. For both species, moderate and extreme CC scenarios resulted in expansion of climatic suitability. Refugia models, through the overlapping of GCMs, indicated that 88% and 82% of the recent climate suitability may act as refugia for S. leucopus and S. oedipus. Greater variation was found coming from GCM selection than from RCPs. Regions of exposure to climatic novelties were identified for both species. Results suggest that climate refugia for these species are critically under-protected, as only 5.7% and 9.9% respectively, coincide with current PAs. Finally, PAs that are playing an important role in preserving climate refugia for these species are mentioned.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation in the Ukrainian Carpathians cannot be accomplished without a clear understanding of the factors negatively impacting habitats and species, and long-term projection of these impacts. One factor that may severely alter the ecosystems involved is the introduction and spread of invasive plant species, but the potential distribution and spatial aggregation of suitable habitats for several invaders have not been quantified. The Maxent approach was used to model the potential establishment within the entire mountain range of 11 alien invasive plant species based on stratified sampling and herbaria records and six variables representing climatic extremes, topography, and anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Predictions of habitat suitability were projected to two future change scenarios depicting increasing rates of climate warming and anthropogenic disturbances in 2050 and 2100. Under current climate and disturbance patterns, the models predicted suitable habitats for invasive species establishment to be aggregated in the southwest, east and north-east of the Ukrainian Carpathians, along major rivers and roads at altitudes of up to c. 700 m. Eight per cent of the total area within protected areas was predicted to be potentially susceptible to invasion by at least one species, with 13% of these susceptible habitats being suitable for all 11 species. Under the future change scenarios, suitable habitat ranges increased significantly in the entire study area and within regions of high conservation value. All species were projected to gain suitable habitats at higher altitudes along linear habitats and to potentially expand their ranges laterally from habitats predicted as suitable for current conditions along small rivers and roads. Under the scenario solely of increased average seasonal temperatures, suitable habitats for the establishment of at least one species within protected areas and a proposed ecological network increased by more than 15 percentage points by 2050 and by more than 30 percentage points by 2100 when compared with predictions for current conditions. Similar future patterns were discernible for the aggregation of suitable habitats for all 11 species. Incorporating increases in anthropogenic pressures into climatic-change projections led to a significantly greater projected expansion of suitable habitats for establishment as compared to scenarios considering only climatic changes. As the 11 species have already established viable populations within protected areas, further spread of at least one species is likely if conservation planning is not changed to include the management of invasive species in such areas.

AB  - The evolutionary and ecological importance of neutral and adaptive genetic diversity is widely recognized. Nevertheless, genetic diversity is rarely assessed for conservation planning, which often implicitly assumes a positive correlation between species and genetic diversity. Multiple drivers can cause the co-variation between the genetic diversity of one species and the richness of the whole communities, and explicit tests are needed to identify the processes that can determine species-genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs). Here, we tested whether intrapopulation genetic diversity (at neutral loci) and species richness co-vary in the amphibian communities of a southern Alpine region (Trentino, Italy), using the common frog (Rana temporaria) as focal species for the study of genetic diversity. We also analysed ecological similarity, niche overlap and interspecific interactions between the species, to unravel the processes determining SGDC. The neutral genetic diversity of common frogs was negatively related to species richness. The negative SGDC was probably due to an opposite influence of environmental gradients on the two levels of biodiversity, since the focal species and the other amphibians differ in ecological preferences, particularly in terms of thermal optimum. Conversely, we did not find evidence for a role of interspecific interactions in the negative SGDC. Our findings stress that species richness cannot be used as a universal proxy for genetic diversity, and only combining SGDC with analyses on the determinants of biodiversity can allow to identify the processes determining the relationships between genetic and species diversity.

AB  - Understanding how populations are distributed spatially can be an effective tool for conservation and management planning. This is especially true for threatened species of mobile marine megafauna, which can use vast expanses of the ocean as foraging and reproductive habitat. Additionally, the broad distributions of these species expose them to a wide variety of threats across their range. Marine turtles are one of these mobile marine megafauna taxa, with individuals making extensive migrations between nesting beaches and foraging grounds. However, it is not well understood how many marine turtle populations distribute themselves spatially at the population or species level. In this study, 178 post-nesting female Kemp's ridley sea turtles were concurrently satellite tracked from their primary and major secondary nesting beaches between 2010 and 2017 to determine population- and species-level distribution of females to foraging grounds. Filtered tracks and switching state-space models (SSMs) were used to determine the proportion of the adult female population dispersing to, and foraging in, the northern and southern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Fidelity to Gulf regions and foraging areas were also assessed. The majority of females dispersed to northern GoM (nGoM) foraging grounds indicating 82% of the adult female population may use the region to forage. Additionally, individuals displayed fidelity to regions, key foraging areas, and migratory corridors over time. These results suggest that the nGoM may provide the most important foraging areas for reproductively active females of the species and threats in the region may have a disproportionately higher impact on the adult female population, a population critical to the perpetuation and recovery of the species. Results highlight that continued bi-national recovery efforts are essential for recovery of Kemp's ridleys, as most females nest on Mexican beaches and forage in U.S. waters. The methodologies used could be applied to conservation and management efforts of other imperiled mobile marine megafauna.

AB  - Use of population viability analyses (PVAs) in endangered species recovery planning has been met with both support and criticism. Previous reviews promote use of PVA for setting scientifically based, measurable, and objective recovery criteria and recommend improvements to increase the framework's utility. However, others have questioned the value of PVA models for setting recovery criteria and assert that PVAs are more appropriate for understanding relative trade-offs between alternative management actions. We reviewed 258 final recovery plans for 642 plants listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act to determine the number of plans that used or recommended PVA in recovery planning. We also reviewed 223 publications that describe plant PVAs to assess how these models were designed and whether those designs reflected previous recommendations for improvement of PVAs. Twenty-four percent of listed species had recovery plans that used or recommended PVA. In publications, the typical model was a matrix population model parameterized with 5 years of demographic data that did not consider stochasticity, genetics, density dependence, seed banks, vegetative reproduction, dormancy, threats, or management strategies. Population growth rates for different populations of the same species or for the same population at different points in time were often statistically different or varied by >10%. Therefore, PVAs parameterized with underlying vital rates that vary to this degree may not accurately predict recovery objectives across a species' entire distribution or over longer time scales. We assert that PVA, although an important tool as part of an adaptive-management program, can help to determine quantitative recovery criteria only if more long-term data sets that capture spatiotemporal variability in vital rates become available. Lacking this, there is a strong need for viable and comprehensive methods for determining quantitative, science-based recovery criteria for endangered species with minimal data availability.

AB  - There is growing evidence that as a consequence of climate change the frequency of extreme hydrological events will increase. Predicting the impacts of these extreme events on ecological systems is a major research challenge. It is predicted that change in future river flows, characterised by greater occurrence of floods and droughts, will have profound impacts on aquatic invertebrate communities by removing sensitive species and restructuring food networks. However, it remains unclear how an increase in these hydrological extremes will impact on riparian communities and species at higher trophic levels. Here, we describe a new methodology that facilitates the integration of quantitative outputs of species' distribution models with the expert knowledge of conservation practitioners to produce a species' vulnerability index (SVI). Using our SVI framework, we assessed and ranked the vulnerability of 16 river bird species to a potential climate-induced shift in the frequency, duration and magnitude of flood and drought events. Vulnerability was associated primarily with ecological traits that restrict species to in-channel riverine habitat. Whilst the SVI was developed to assess species' vulnerability to hydrological extremes on rivers, it is equally applicable to other environmental domains as well as a range of avian and non-avian taxa. Furthermore, this original methodological approach provides researchers and managers with a valuable conservation tool that allows them to identify the species most vulnerable to climate change impacts and plan mitigation and adaptation strategies.

AB  - The current challenge in a context of major environmental changes is to anticipate the responses of species to future landscape and climate scenarios. In the Mediterranean basin, climate change is one the most powerful driving forces of fire dynamics, with fire frequency and impact having markedly increased in recent years. Species distribution modelling plays a fundamental role in this challenge, but better integration of available ecological knowledge is needed to adequately guide conservation efforts. Here, we quantified changes in habitat suitability of an early-succession bird in Catalonia, the Dartford Warbler (Sylvia undata), which is globally evaluated as Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List. We assessed potential changes in species distributions between 2000 and 2050 under different fire management and climate change scenarios, and described landscape dynamics using a spatially-explicit fire-succession model that simulates fire impacts in the landscape and post-fire regeneration (MEDFIRE model). Dartford Warbler occurrence data were acquired at two different spatial scales from: (1) the Atlas of European Breeding Birds (EBCC) and (2) the Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (CBBA). Habitat suitability was modelled using five widely-used modelling techniques in an ensemble forecasting framework. Our results indicated considerable habitat suitability losses (ranging between 47 and 57 % in baseline scenarios), which were modulated to a large extent by fire regime changes derived from fire management policies and climate changes. Such result highlighted the need for taking the spatial interaction between climate changes, fire-mediated landscape dynamics and fire management policies into account for coherently anticipating habitat suitability changes of early-succession bird species. We conclude that fire management programs need to be integrated into conservation plans to effectively preserve sparsely forested and early succession habitats and their associated species in the face of global environmental change.

AB  - The Endangered Asian elephant Elephas maximus comes into widespread conflict with agrarian communities, necessitating active management. The species' distribution is of primary importance for management planning. However, data-based countrywide distribution maps have not been available for any of the 13 Asian elephant range states. We conducted a 5 x 5 km grid-based questionnaire survey in Sri Lanka to produce an island-wide elephant distribution map. Elephants occur over 59.9% of Sri Lanka and people are resident in 69.4% of elephant range, indicating the challenge of separating people and elephants at a landscape scale. Elephants in Sri Lanka have lost 16.1% of their range since 1960 but their current distribution remains largely contiguous. We found the range of adult males was 15.1% greater, and less seasonal, than that of herds, possibly because males have a higher tolerance for conflict with people. The distribution of conflict coincided with the co-occurrence of humans and elephants. We conclude that a human-elephant coexistence model is the only viable option for effectively mitigating human-elephant conflict and conserving elephants in Sri Lanka. The findings are currently being used to effect a paradigm change in elephant conservation and management in the country.

AB  - Distribution of fishes, both occupancy and abundance, is often correlated with landscape-scale characteristics (e. g., geology, climate, and human disturbance). Understanding these relationships is essential for effective conservation of depressed populations. We used landscape characteristics to explain the distribution of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the Oregon Plan data set, one of the first long-term, probabilistic salmon monitoring data sets covering the full range of potential habitats. First we compared data structure and model performance between the Oregon Plan data set and two published data sets on coho salmon distribution. Most of the variation in spawner abundance occurred between reaches but much also occurred between years, limiting potential model performance. Similar suites of landscape predictors are correlated with coho salmon distribution across regions and data sets. We then modeled coho salmon spawner distribution using the Oregon Plan data set and determined that landscape characteristics could not explain presence vs. absence of spawners but that the percentage of agriculture, winter temperature range, and the intrinsic potential of the stream could explain some variation in abundance (weighted average R-2 = 0.30) where spawners were present. We conclude that the previous use of nonrandom monitoring data sets may have obscured understanding of species distribution, and we suggest minor modifications to large-scale monitoring programs.

AB  - The effectiveness of selecting umbrella species or groups of species to protect other groups is a key and unresolved issue in conservation planning. We detected areas important to the four groups of terrestrial vertebrates inhabiting Andalusia (southern Spain) according to four conservation-value criteria, i.e., richness, rarity, vulnerability, and endemicity. We calculated coincidences between criteria and taxa by the degree of correlation and fuzzy overlap between the different criteria for the same group (intra-group coincidence) and between the different groups of species for the same criteria (inter-group coincidence). For the groups to be appropriate umbrella species, inter-group coincidence should be high. The results showed that intra-group coincidence was high, but inter-group coincidence was low. Thus, zones of importance to each group of species tended to be located in different places compared to the other groups, and therefore none of them should be used as an indicator or umbrella group to protect the others. This result has implications for conservation policy, as the Andalusian authorities should not assume that protecting a site important to one group of species will also be relevant to conserve the other groups. Nevertheless, we identified the areas of relatively high conjoint importance for all the groups, and the best umbrella group in this region, which proved to be reptiles. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study investigates the ecological requirements of Astragalus curvirostris Boiss, with emphasis on determining the ecological factors that affect the distribution of plant species, and the species' response to changes in ecological factors using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) in the Iranian Province of Zanjan from 2017 to 2019. Randomized-systematic sampling was used to collect vegetation data. Data analysis was performed using SPSS17 and CANOC4.5 software. The results showed that the growth and development of A. curvirostris change according to environmental factors linked to the composition of the soil and the variety of the other species present. This model is indicative of a competitive limitation along the environmental gradient. By understanding all environmental parameters, the necessary steps could be taken towards planning proper management programs, including rangeland grazing management and determining the proper moment for seed collection, which will result in the conservation, improvement, and restoration of rangelands.

AB  - The hydrological variability of intermittent streams means that the spatial distribution of dry-season aquatic refuges within river networks and the temporal dynamics of hydrological connectivity between them are critical for the persistence of aquatic biodiversity. Here, a new approach is demonstrated to identify surface water bodies as priority refuges for efficient conservation management of freshwater biodiversity in intermittent stream networks. Recently developed models of surface water extent and daily streamflow were used to represent spatio-temporal variations in hydrological connectivity and surface water persistence within river networks of eastern Australia over a 107-yr period. Using this information, systematic conservation planning was applied to prioritize aquatic areas for conservation of 25 fish species under two scenarios. One scenario identified priority refuges to complement those already occurring in protected areas, whereas the other did not consider protected area status. The priority networks identified concentrated on the main stems of river catchments where surface water was more likely to be persistent and aquatic refuges were more likely to be connected, but also included headwaters for rare fish species. All three set conservation targets for the 25 fish species can be met in the best solution of priority networks. Although the second scenario achieved the targets with a smaller size of priority network overall, it required more new aquatic refuges and was thus less efficient than the first scenario. The newly developed datasets are useful for freshwater conservation prioritization because they account for hydrological variability of intermittent streams. The systematic prioritization approach applied is transferable to other regions and freshwater taxa to identify aquatic refuges for biodiversity conservation within intermittent stream systems.

AB  - Habitat modelling and predictive mapping are important tools for conservation planning, particularly for lesser known species such as many insectivorous bats. However, the scale at which modelling is undertaken can affect the predictive accuracy and restrict the use of the model at different scales. We assessed the validity of existing regional-scale habitat models at a local-scale and contrasted the habitat use of two morphologically similar species with differing conservation status (Mormopterus norfolkensis and Mormopterus species 2). We used negative binomial generalised linear models created from indices of activity and environmental variables collected from systematic acoustic surveys. We found that habitat type (based on vegetation community) best explained activity of both species, which were more active in floodplain areas, with most foraging activity recorded in the freshwater wetland habitat type. The threatened M. norfolkensis avoided urban areas, which contrasts with M. species 2 which occurred frequently in urban bushland. We found that the broad habitat types predicted from local-scale models were generally consistent with those from regional-scale models. However, threshold-dependent accuracy measures indicated a poor fit and we advise caution be applied when using the regional models at a fine scale, particularly when the consequences of false negatives or positives are severe. Additionally, our study illustrates that habitat type classifications can be important predictors and we suggest they are more practical for conservation than complex combinations of raw variables, as they are easily communicated to land managers.

AB  - Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies to conserve them. The last three decades have seen exponential growth in the number of studies evaluating how, how much, why, when, and where species will be impacted by climate change. We provide an overview of the rapidly developing field of climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) and describe key concepts, terms, steps and considerations. We stress the importance of identifying the full range of pressures, impacts and their associated mechanisms that species face and using this as a basis for selecting the appropriate assessment approaches for quantifying vulnerability. We outline four CCVA assessment approaches, namely trait-based, correlative, mechanistic and combined approaches and discuss their use. Since any assessment can deliver unreliable or even misleading results when incorrect data and parameters are applied, we discuss finding, selecting, and applying input data and provide examples of open-access resources. Because rare, small-range, and declining-range species are often of particular conservation concern while also posing significant challenges for CCVA, we describe alternative ways to assess them. We also describe how CCVAs can be used to inform IUCN Red List assessments of extinction risk. Finally, we suggest future directions in this field and propose areas where research efforts may be particularly valuable.

AB  - The development of species distribution models (SDMs) has benefited biodiversity conservation through their linkage of science to policy and decision processes. These models have evolved to provide scenarios of future landscapes based on known and projected environmental parameters. Whereas there are many caveats to their use, the persuasive power of the models for conveying the consequences of environmental change to the non-science community is immense. Scientists are obliged to convey the uncertainty of the futures depicted in their models, but also to involve the stakeholders who will shape those future conditions. Stakeholders can identify the natural resources they want to sustain, voice their priorities in environmental policy, and articulate the range of solutions they are willing to accept. The creation of alternative futures is an academic exercise if not linked to real viable decisions concerning important resources. SDMs only reach their full potential when they bring together scientists, public stakeholders and policy makers, and are used as an adaptive management tool to understand complex landscapes that are undergoing short- and long-term change.

AB  - In Europe, land use changes follow public policies, and particularly the Common Agricultural Policy. To predict the effect of policies on agricultural practices, landscape, and ultimately biodiversity, requires understanding of the interactions between social, economic and ecological dynamics at regional scale. We studied by means of prospective scenarios the possible effects of agricultural changes on biodiversity in a Mediterranean upland. This area is characterised by extensive grasslands that have been maintained for centuries by agriculture and are now threatened by tree and shrub encroachment. We built four scenarios that describe possible changes in agricultural EU policies by 2030. We selected 15 bird species on the basis of a high natural heritage responsibility of the study area for these species and 45 plant species on the same basis plus local rarity and habitat vulnerability. We analysed how these species were affected by the four scenarios by considering changes in their habitats. For each scenario, we analysed the driving forces that determine land use changes. Landscape dynamics was modelled with a Generalised Linear Model combining environmental and land use factors. Most of the 60 selected species depend on open habitats. Only the scenario where public support was only granted if it provided environmental services had a positive impact on open habitats and their associated biodiversity. This 'natural heritage' scenario was also rated positively by local stakeholders. This approach sheds light on the interest of inter/transdisciplinary studies, scenarios, and stakeholder involvement in the definition of public policies for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Primates, the closest living biological relatives with human, play the important roles in the livelihoods, human-health, and ecosystem services. In the Anthropocene, populations of 75% of primate species are decreasing globally - due to cultivation activities, logging harvesting, hunting, and climate change. In this study, we focus on Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) as the global conservation icons. Hence, understanding Bornean orangutan's distribution dynamics is crucial regarding to conservation and climate mitigation strategies. The objectives of this study are: (1) to predict current and future spatial distribution of orangutan in Borneo using pessimistic climate model and land cover projection as well; (2) to identify spatial dynamics of Bornean orangutan distribution due to climate and land cover change in 2030. Species distribution modelling of baseline and future scenario was performed using logistic regression model. The model was evaluated using overall accuracy, Kappa accuracy, and the true skill statistic (TSS). Land cover categories and climate parameters (i.e. annual temperature and precipitation) were used for model predictors. Presence points of observed primate species were retrieved from Ministry of Environment and Forestry Indonesia (MoEF). We used WorldClim v2.0 annual temperature and precipitation data for the baseline and CMIP5 MIROC-ESM model RCP8.5 2030 for the future climate scenario. We performed cellular automata algorithm to retrieve 2030 projected land-use for the future. Distance to road and distance to selected important land covers were used for transition potential modelling of land cover projection. Generally, the prediction shows that suitable habitat of Bornean orangutan will decrease in 2030. However, we found the gain of suitable area of Bornean orangutan. The overall accuracy was relatively high (OA = 0.71) and slightly moderate in Kappa coefficient and TSS (k = 0.42 and TSS = 0.42). Findings of this study should support the identification of priority conservation area of Bornean orangutan for the future and wildlife corridor management planning. Performing another algorithm (e.g. machine learning or presence-only model) probably could increase the accuracy of the model.

AB  - The Himalayan region is one of the global biodiversity hotspots. However, its biodiversity and ecosystems are threatened due to abiotic and biotic drivers. One of the major biotic threats to biodiversity in this region is the rapid spread of Invasive Alien Species (IAS). Natural forests and grasslands are increasingly getting infested by IAS affecting regeneration of native species and decline in availability of bio-resources. Assessing the current status of IAS and prediction of their future spread would be vital for evolving specific species management interventions. Keeping this in view, we conducted an in-depth study on two IASs, viz., Ageratina adenophora and Lantana camara in the Indian part of Kailash Sacred Landscape (KSL), Western Himalaya. Intensive field surveys were conducted to collect the presence of A. adenophora (n = 567) and L. camara (n = 120) along an altitudinal gradient between 300 and 3000 m a.s.l. We performed Principal Component Analysis to nullify the multi-colinearity effects of the environmental predictors following MaxEnt species distribution model in the current and future climatic scenarios for both the species. All current and future model precision (i.e., Area Under the Curve; AUC) for both species was higher than 0.81. It is predicted that under the current rate of climate change and higher emission (i.e., RCP 8.5 pathway), A. adenophora will spread 45.3% more than its current distribution and is likely to reach up to 3029 m a.s.l., whereas, L. camara will spread 29.8% more than its current distribution range and likely to reach up to 3018 m a.s.l. Our results will help in future conservation planning and participatory management of forests and grasslands in the Kailash Sacred Landscape-India.

AB  - Conservation planning of critical habitats for wildlife species at risk is a priority topic that requires the knowledge of how animals select and use their habitat, and how they respond to future developmental changes in their environment. This paper explores the role of a habitat-modeling methodological approach, agent-based modeling, which we advocate as a promising approach for ecological research. Agent-based models (ABMs) are capable of simultaneously distinguishing animal densities from habitat quality, can explicitly represent the environment and its dynamism, can accommodate spatial patterns of inter- and intra-species mechanisms, and can explore feedbacks and adaptations inherent in these systems. ABMs comprise autonomous, individual entities; each with dynamic, adaptive behaviors and heterogeneous characteristics that interact with each other and with their environment. These interactions result in emergent outcomes that can be used to quantitatively examine critical habitats from the individual- to population-level. ABMs can also explore how wildlife will respond to potential changes in environmental conditions, since they can readily incorporate adaptive animal-movement ecology in a changing landscape. This paper describes the necessary elements of an ABM developed specifically for understanding wildlife habitat selection, reviews the current empirical literature on ABMs in wildlife ecology and management, and evaluates the current and future roles these ABMs can play, specifically with regards to scenario planning of designated critical habitats.

AB  - This work utilizes bird survey data, regression modeling, land-use modeling and landscape metrics to evaluate the effects of various spatial bird diversity conservation approaches on land-use allocation, land-use patterns, and biodiversity in the Shangan sub-watershed in central Taiwan. A survey of the distribution of species revealed that bird species are concentrated in the central and western parts of the sub-watershed. The results obtained using a Shannon Weaver diversity regression model suggest that diversity of land-use increases the diversity of bird species. Logistic regression results verify that socioeconomic factors determine the potential advantages of designating a particular type of land-use in certain parts of the study area. The results of land-use simulation modeling indicate that the eastern and southwestern areas of the sub-watershed will change most frequently between 2007 and 2017. Additionally, increasing the areas to protect bird diversity will effectively increase the patch size, habitat core area, edge effect and habitat connectivity. The Shannon Weaver diversity regression model shows that protecting bird species diversity in large areas increases bird diversity. The proposed modeling approach is an effective tool that provides useful information for ecological planning and policymaking related to watersheds.

AB  - Human activities are considered a critical impact factor for decision-making in coupled human-nature systems, such as conservation of coastal systems. Identifying key human activities that cause significant habitat degradation for coastal species remains challenging. We improved the spatial subsidy approach to identify and prioritize control strategies for human-caused distribution shifts of marine species. We applied this method to a threatened Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in Xiamen Bay, China. Our results indicate that (1) a significant distribution shift for humpback dolphins from existing nature reserves to peripheral waters occurred from 2011 to 2014; (2) coastal tourism and industrial and urban construction had more significant negative impacts on humpback dolphins than maritime transportation and reclamation; and (3) proactive management should be implemented for maritime transportation and reclamation, while reactive management should be implemented for coastal tourism and industrial and urban construction. Human impact analysis, combined with spatially explicit modeling, contributes to determining the spatial alternatives for conservation planning. In response to possible ecological damage caused by human activities, the improved spatial subsidy results help provide knowledge and platforms for ecological compensation.

AB  - Remote sensing (RS) data may play an important role in the development of cost-effective means for modelling, mapping, planning and conserving biodiversity. Specifically, at the landscape scale, spatial models for the occurrences of species of conservation concern may be improved by the inclusion of RS-based predictors, to help managers to better meet different conservation challenges. In this study, we examine whether predicted distributions of 28 red-listed plant species in north-eastern Finland at the resolution of 25 ha are improved when advanced RS-variables are included as unclassified continuous predictor variables, in addition to more commonly used climate and topography variables. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we studied whether the spatial predictions of the distribution of red-listed plant species in boreal landscapes are improved by incorporating advanced RS (normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference soil index and Tasseled Cap transformations) information into species-environment models. Models were fitted using three different sets of explanatory variables: (1) climate-topography only; (2) remote sensing only; and (3) combined climate-topography and remote sensing variables, and evaluated by four-fold cross-validation with the area under the curve (AUC) statistics. The inclusion of RS variables improved both the explanatory power (on average 8.1 % improvement) and cross-validation performance (2.5 %) of the models. Hybrid models produced ecologically more reliable distribution maps than models using only climate-topography variables, especially for mire and shore species. In conclusion, Landsat ETM+ data integrated with climate and topographical information has the potential to improve biodiversity and rarity assessments in northern landscapes, especially in predictive studies covering extensive and remote areas.

AB  - We developed a distribution model of Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) using the maximum entropy method (Maxent) based on information from the database of the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment. The goal was to study the usefulness of such models to determine potential areas for reintroduction or natural colonization of the species. To validate the model, we used data generated from known densities of the Iberian ibex in 107 protected areas: 26 areas where the species is present, and 81 where it is not present. Findings showed that the preferred habitat for the species has steep slopes, altitude over 1,000 m, and seasonal variation in precipitation and temperature. We detected a significant relationship between the densities obtained in the study areas and their relation to the preferred habitat. Our results indicate these models can be useful in species management planning to determine areas for reintroduction of the species.

AB  - Predicting changes in species distributions under a changing climate is becoming widespread with the use of species distribution models (SDMs). The resulting predictions of future potential habitat can be cast in light of planned land use changes, such as urban expansion and energy development to identify areas with potential conflict. However, SDMs rarely incorporate an understanding of dispersal capacity, and therefore assume unlimited dispersal in potential range shifts under uncertain climate futures. We use SDMs to predict future distributions of the Mojave ground squirrel, Xerospermophilus mohavensis Merriam, and incorporate partial dispersal models informed by field data on juvenile dispersal to assess projected impact of climate change and energy development on future distributions of X. mohavensis. Our models predict loss of extant habitat, but also concurrent gains of new habitat under two scenarios of future climate change. Under the B1 emissions scenario-a storyline describing a convergent world with emphasis on curbing greenhouse gas emissions-our models predicted losses of up to 64% of extant habitat by 2080, while under the increased greenhouse gas emissions of the A2 scenario, we suggest losses of 56%. New potential habitat may become available to X. mohavensis, thereby offsetting as much as 6330 km(2) (50%) of the current habitat lost. Habitat lost due to planned energy development was marginal compared to habitat lost from changing climates, but disproportionately affected current habitat. Future areas of overlap in potential habitat between the two climate change scenarios are identified and discussed in context of proposed energy development. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Predicting species' suitable habitats is critical to biodiversity conservation planning and implementation. Species habitat distribution is closely linked to environmental and bioclimatic variables which are widely used for estimating habitat suitability (HS) from species distribution models (SDMs). Integration of environmental parameters derived from satellite remote sensing, bioclimatic variables, and edaphic properties has created an advanced way to improve the SDM performance. The objective of this study is to assess the performance for predicting the potential HS of the arid plant species using Maximum Entropy (MaxENT) species distribution model based on an ecological niche machine-learning algorithm. Prosopis cineraria (Ghaf) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was selected for the model simulation. The Ghaf tree is a keystone species to prevent desertification and improve soil fertility in arid environments. We have selected 33 environmental parameters, including satellite remote sensing data (MODIS NDVI, LST, and PET), WorldClim bioclimate variables and static edaphic properties (topography, elevation, soil quality) along with 100 field observations. Collinearity within the bioclimatic variables was eliminated using Pearson correlation. The variables with zero percentage contribution were eliminated for the final model simulation. To evaluate the contribution of environmental parameters to the performance of MaxEnt, we used three scenarios: a) All key predictor variables, b) Only bioclimatic variables, and c) without remote sensing variables. With scenario a) model simulation has substantially improved the potential HS prediction with mean AUC value 0.98, indicating a better predictive accuracy in the integration of satellite remote sensing data. MaxENT results showed that elevation, precipitation of coldest quarter, NDVI, and precipitation of warmest quarte had a significant contribution to the potential HS of Ghaf trees in the UAE. Model results showed that the spatial proportions of the potential HS in the UAE consisted of high (2%), medium (3.7%) and low (94.3%) suitability classes.

AB  - Mangrove forests support numerous ecosystemservices and contribute to coastal ecological risk reduction. However, they are one of the most severely threatened ecosystems in the world. China has carried out national mangrove restoration projects, but there is still insufficient scientific information for the strategic planning of this restoration. In this study, we carried out mangrove suitability assessments using the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models, and we mapped the restoration potential of mangrove forests in China for the first time. The restoration potential index (RPI), which combines suitability and land use data, is proposed as a rapid estimator method for locating theoretically available areas for restoration. The results showed that the MaxEnt model performed better than GARP in predicting potential mangrove distributions. Temperaturewas themost important environmental factor for determining large scale distribution of mangroves. The predicted northern limit of mangrove distribution was around 28 degrees 27' N-28 degrees 35' N. Using the RPI approach, 16,800 ha with the potential to restoremangrove forestswas identified. According to both models, the largest area with restoration potential occurs along the Guangdong and Guangxi coast. Nationwide, about 75% of the potential area suitable for mangrove forests has been lost as a consequence of land use and is no longer available for restoration. Around 6400 ha of ponds is currently used for aquaculture, accounting for 38% of theoretically restorable areas. These areas can be a priority for mangrove forest restoration. In conclusion, our findings provide a better scientific understanding of mangrove distribution in China and can underpin strategic design and planning of mangrove restoration. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Macroalgal forests are one of the most productive and valuable marine ecosystems, but yet strongly exposed to fragmentation and loss. Detailed large-scale information on their distribution is largely lacking, hindering conservation initiatives. In this study, a systematic effort to combine spatial data on Cystoseira C. Agardh canopies (Fucales, Phaeophyta) was carried out to develop a Habitat Suitability Model (HSM) at Mediterranean scale, providing critical tools to improve site prioritization for their management, restoration and protection. A georeferenced database on the occurrence of 20 Cystoseira species was produced collecting all the available information from published and grey literature, web data portals and co-authors personal data. Data were associated to 55 predictor variable layers in the (ASCII) raster format and were used in order to develop the HSM by means of a Random Forest, a very effective Machine Learning technique. Knowledge about the distribution of Cystoseira canopies was available for about the 14% of the Mediterranean coastline. Absence data were available only for the 2% of the basin. Despite these gaps, our HSM showed high accuracy levels in reproducing Cystoseira distribution so that the first continuous maps of the habitat across the entire basin was produced. Misclassification errors mainly occurred in the eastern and southern part of the basin, where large gaps of knowledge emerged. The most relevant drivers were the geomorphological ones, followed by anthropogenic variables proxies of pollution and urbanization. Our model shows the importance of data sharing to combine a large number of spatial and environmental data, allowing to individuate areas with high probability of Cystoseira occurrence as suitable for its presence. This approach encourages the use of this modeling tool for the prediction of Cystoseira distribution and for supporting and planning conservation and management initiatives. The step forward is to refine the spatial information of presence-absence data about Cystoseira canopies and of environmental predictors in order to address species-specific assessments.

AB  - Estimating species distributions requires species presence data of sufficient quantity from reputable sources that are geographically representative of the species' space use. Collecting presence data that meets these standards can be costly and is often complicated by limited land access. Citizen science projects are an appealing alternative source of presence data as these data are freely available and collected globally. Websites such as eBird have become increasingly large repositories of citizen science data. The vulnerable lesser prairie-chicken (LPC; Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is a species well-represented in the eBird database, with presence observations from 140 unique locations from 2012 to 2014. During that same period, a distribution-wide, standardized aerial survey with state and federal support recorded 106 LPC detections. Our objective was to compare species distribution models (SDMs) made with eBird data to models made with aerial survey data to determine the potential for citizen science data to contribute to conservation planning. We used maximum entropy modeling to create SDMs based on eBird data, aerial survey data, and a combination of both data sets using variables of biological significance to LPCs. We obtained comparable model performance using aerial survey data only [standardized test omission rate (STO): 23.4%, test AUC: 0.76] and with eBird data only (STO: 23.8%, AUC: 0.76). The I statistic confirmed a very high degree of similarity between the outputs of the two model sets (I = 0.929). However, a road bias existed within both data sets (positive and negative biases), potentially confounding some environmental correlates. Despite this bias, our combined model predicted an increase of 1,732,500 ha of unique area suitable for the LPC. Our results indicated that eBird data could be used as a low-cost source for species occurrence data to create species distribution models, though biases in these datasets should be assessed to guide interpretability of the predicted outputs.

AB  - Planning for resilience is the focus of many marine conservation programs and initiatives. These efforts aim to inform conservation strategies for marine regions to ensure they have inbuilt capacity to retain biological diversity and ecological function in the face of global environmental change - particularly changes in climate and resource exploitation. In the absence of direct biological and ecological information for many marine species, scientists are increasingly using spatially-explicit, predictive-modeling approaches. Through the improved access to multibeam sonar and underwater video technology these models provide spatial predictions of the most suitable regions for an organism at resolutions previously not possible. However, sensible-looking, well-performing models can provide very different predictions of distribution depending on which occurrence dataset is used. To examine this, we construct species distribution models for nine temperate marine sedentary fishes for a 25.7 km(2) study region off the coast of southeastern Australia. We use generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM) and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to build models based on co-located occurrence datasets derived from two underwater video methods (i.e. baited and towed video) and fine-scale multibeam sonar based seafloor habitat variables. Overall, this study found that the choice of modeling approach did not considerably influence the prediction of distributions based on the same occurrence dataset. However, greater dissimilarity between model predictions was observed across the nine fish taxa when the two occurrence datasets were compared (relative to models based on the same dataset). Based on these results it is difficult to draw any general trends in regards to which video method provides more reliable occurrence datasets. Nonetheless, we suggest predictions reflecting the species apparent distribution (i.e. a combination of species distribution and the probability of detecting it). Consequently, we also encourage researchers and marine managers to carefully interpret model predictions.

AB  - Habitat loss and degradation due to agricultural intensification and urbanization are key threats facing wild pollinators, especially bees. However, data on the distribution and abundance of most of the world's 20,000+ bee species is lacking, making it difficult to assess the effects of anthropogenic disturbance through time. Moreover, there are geographic biases in the study of bees creating gaps in our understanding of species distributions and regional patterns of diversity. Research efforts are often focused around cities or field stations associated with universities and other research institutions. In this perspectives paper, we provide examples of geographic bias in knowledge regarding bee species distributions using recently collected data from Michigan and Colorado, USA-two states with published species checklists. We illustrate how a limited sampling effort can advance knowledge about bee species distributions, yielding species occurrence records at local and regional scales. Given the implications of geographic biases, we recommend future research efforts focus on poorly sampled geographic regions, especially those affected by anthropogenic disturbance, in order to expand our understanding of human impacts on wild bee species. Sampling across a broader geographic area will provide critical information for taxonomy and predictive models of bee species distributions and diversity. We encourage researchers to plan future studies with consideration of strategies to avoid oversampling local bee populations, the taxonomic expertise required to identify specimens, and resources necessary to voucher specimens.

AB  - Environmental regulations often require wildlife surveys prior to habitat disturbance to avoid impacts or as the basis for planning mitigation, yet project-level surveys may not provide the insights needed to guide long-term management. Management of the red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) has largely been based on such surveys. As an alternative approach, we evaluated distribution patterns using frequency of red tree vole occurrence and habitat suitability models to guide conservation planning. We developed a suite of models based on subsets of covariates from two previously developed models and evaluated the extent to which spatial covariates improved the models. We used presence-absence data that were collected from 364 randomly selected 1-ha Current Vegetation Survey and Forest Inventory and Analysis plots to develop models and describe occurrence patterns. The best models included a spatial covariate, maximum tree diameter, distance from suitable habitat, forest age class, and the interaction between maximum tree diameter and forest age class. We compared performance of the previously published models, our best model, and an ensemble model that used predictions from all three models. Under the ensemble model, correct classification rates were relatively high and considerably improved, suggesting that the application of all three models provided greater accuracy than any individual model. We argue that habitat models, coupled with spatial patterns of the frequency of occurrence, can provide useful tools for addressing species management and may provide more insight than project-level surveys. The use of habitat suitability models can therefore be closely tied to red tree vole management decisions and conservation strategies, as well as reducing survey costs that otherwise often make projects infeasible.

AB  - During the last centuries, populations of marine megafauna-such as seabirds, turtles, and mammals-were intensively exploited. At present, other threats such as bycatch and pollution affect these species, which play key ecological roles in marine ecosystems as apex consumers and/or nutrient transporters. This study analyses the distribution of six megafaunal species (Chelonia mydas, Caretta caretta, Dermochelys coriacea, Thalassarche melanophris, Otaria flavescens, and Arctocephalus australis) coexisting in the Southwestern Atlantic to discuss their protection in terms of current management strategies in the region. Through the prediction of the species potential distributions and their relation to bathymetry, sea temperature and oceanographic fronts, key ecological areas are defined from a multi-taxa perspective. Information on the distribution of 70 individuals (18 sea turtles, 19 albatrosses, and 33 otariids) was obtained through satellite tracking conducted during 2007-2013 and analysed using a Geographic Information System and maximum entropy models. During the autumn-winter period, megafaunal species were distributed over the continental shelves of Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, mainly over the Argentine Exclusive Economic Zone and the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone. Despite some differences, all megafaunal species seems to have similar environmental requirements during the autumn-winter period. Mostly waters shallower than 50 m were identified as key ecological areas, with the Rio de la Plata as the habitat with the highest suitability for all the species. This area is highly productive and sustains the main coastal fisheries of Uruguay and Argentina, yet its role as a key ecological area for megafaunal species has been underestimated until now. This approach provides a basis to analyse the effect of anthropic activities on megafaunal species through risk maps and, ultimately, to generate knowledge to improve national and bi-national management plans between Argentina and Uruguay.

AB  - We modeled the potential distribution of plant species that grow on the beaches and dunes of the Mexican Atlantic coast in order to identify areas of high biodiversity. We used environmental layers in combination with georeferenced data, utilizing the MaxEnt algorithm, and produced four regional consensus maps according to the geographic distribution of the species: along the entire Mexican Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Mexico; the Yucatan Peninsula and all species combined together on a single map. The largest number of widely distributed species in the Gulf of Mexico was concentrated in the northern and central regions, while biodiversity on the Yucatan Peninsula was likely to be concentrated in the north and on Cozumel island, which is the biggest island in the Mexican Caribbean. The map combining all species together revealed a potential concurrence of species in the Gulf of Mexico and Yucatan Peninsula transition, where climatic characteristics converge within a small geographic area. In order to conserve beach and coastal dune plant biodiversity, special attention must be paid to the management plans of established protected areas and to the promotion of new protected areas consistent with the areas reported in this study, particularly in the central Gulf of Mexico and northern Yucatan Peninsula, where areas under protection are currently scarce.

AB  - Although the fire salamander, Salamandra infraimmaculata, is relatively distributed in a broad area in the Middle East, it lives in a narrow area in southeast and south Anatolia in Turkey. The habitats of the species have been downgraded day by day, and its IUCN category is listed as "NT, and the population trend is decreasing. Within the scope of this study, a model was created with the existing locality records of the species using ecological niche modeling. As a result of this model, the current and future distribution of the species were compared. The results obtained from the analyzes made within the scope of this study showed that the current probable distribution of the species coincides with the existing locality records. However, for possible climate change scenarios, the possible future distribution of the species will be thought to be negatively affected by the increase in the greenhouse gas effect, the change in the amount of carbon dioxide, and the increase of many harmful gas concentrations in the atmosphere. If all four climate scenarios proposed in this study in the future occur sequentially, the species will have to limit or change its range, and even become will be extinct in some areas. Species conservation action plans should be initiated, and local governments should take necessary measures to prevent this from happening.

AB  - Early detection and management of aquatic invasive species requires identification of those areas most at risk of invasion (i.e., hotspots). Here we identify present-day and future hotspots of invasion risk for marine invertebrates and algae in nearshore habitats of the northwest Atlantic and northeast Pacific using more than 12 years of monitoring data in conjunction with other occurrence data and stacked species distribution models. The stacked species distribution models predicted the general patterns of observed invasive species richness in both study areas (Atlantic: r(2) = 0.52, Pacific: r(2) = 0.42). In the northwest Atlantic, we identified hotspots through much of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and southern Maine, and in several bays in southwestern New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In the northeast Pacific, much of the southern Salish Sea was identified as a hotspot, as were a few areas along the outer coast of Washington and Oregon. Projecting our species distribution modelling results to 2075 (climate scenario RCP 8.5), we found that existing hotspots are likely to expand slightly in the Atlantic, while in the Pacific existing hotspots are predicted to shift or expand, new hotspots are likely to appear, and areas with few invasive species attaining moderate invasive species richness. Our results suggest that climate change will have larger effects on the distributions of our focal invasive species on the Pacific coast compared to the Atlantic. Resultant hotspot maps provide an integrated perspective and guidance to managers tasked with prioritizing locations for monitoring and implementing policy related to marine invasive species, with projected hotspots making planning for future changes in invasion risk possible.

AB  - Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are fundamental tools in ecology for predicting the geographic distribution of species based on environmental data. They are also very useful from an application point of view, whether for the implementation of conservation plans for threatened species or for monitoring invasive species. The generalizability and spatial accuracy of an SDM depend very strongly on the type of model used and the environmental data used as explanatory variables. In this article, we study a country-wide species distribution model based on very high resolution (VHR) (1 m) remote sensing images processed by a convolutional neural network. We demonstrate that this model can capture landscape and habitat information at very fine spatial scales while providing overall better predictive performance than conventional models. Moreover, to demonstrate the ecological significance of the model, we propose an original analysis based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) dimension reduction technique. It allows visualizing the relation between input data and species traits or environment learned by the model as well as conducting some statistical tests verifying them. We also analyze the spatial mapping of the t-SNE dimensions at both national and local levels, showing the model benefit of automatically learning environmental variation at multiple scales.

AB  - Bumble bees are an ecologically and economically important group of pollinating insects worldwide. Global climate change is predicted to affect bumble bee ecology including habitat suitability and geographic distribution. Our study aims to estimate the impact of projected climate change on 18 Mesoamerican bumble bee species. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) using current and future climate emissions scenarios (representative concentration pathway 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and models (CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, and MIROC-ESM-CHEM). Regardless of the scenario and model applied, our results suggest that all bumble bee species are predicted to undergo a reduction in their potential distribution and habitat suitability due to projected climate change. ENMs based on low emission scenarios predict a distribution loss ranging from 7% to 67% depending on the species for the year 2050. Furthermore, we discovered that the reduction of bumble bee geographic range shape will be more evident at the margins of their distribution. The reduction of suitable habitat is predicted to be accompanied by a 100-500 m upslope change in altitude and 1-581 km shift away from the current geographic centroid of a species' distribution. On average, protected natural areas in Mesoamerica cover similar to 14% of each species' current potential distribution, and this proportion is predicted to increase to similar to 23% in the high emission climate change scenarios. Our models predict that climate change will reduce Mesoamerican bumble bee habitat suitability, especially for rare species, by reducing their potential distribution ranges and suitability. The small proportion of current and future potential distribution falling in protected natural areas suggests that such areas will likely have marginal contribution to bumble bee habitat conservation. Our results have the capacity to inform stakeholders in designing effective landscape management for bumble bees, which may include developing restoration plans for montane pine oak forests habitats and native flowering plants.

AB  - Prediction of Iberian lynx road-mortality in southern Spain: a new approach using the MaxEnt algorithm. In recent years, the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) has experienced a significant increase in the size of its population and in its distribution. The species currently occupies areas in which it had been extinct for decades and new road mortality black spots have been identified. Its conservation requires an intensive risk assessment of road-deaths in potential future distribution areas. Using the MaxEnt algorithm we aimed to identify the roads where there is a greater risk of road collision for the Iberian lynx. More than 1,150 stretches of road were evaluated in Andalusia (southern Spain). Both road-related and habitat variables were included in the model. A total of 1,395 km of the 7,384 km evaluated (18.9 %) were classified as high risk road. Our results could help plan future conservation strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the MaxEnt algorithm has been used to provide spatially-explicit predictions about wildlife road mortality.

AB  - Genetic diversity is critical for conservation of endemic populations. It enhances adaptation to rapid environmental changes and persistence over evolutionary time-scales. In small and isolated populations, such as on islands, this is even more relevant. Nevertheless, few studies regarding the establishment of protected areas (PAs) on islands have taken genetic diversity into account. The Cape Verde Islands are in a biodiversity hotspot and present to resource planners unique problems and possibilities, hence are a good case study. This work primarily aims to compare targeting evolutionary significant units (ESUs) versus species in reserve selection algorithms for the conservation of the endemic Cape Verdean reptile diversity by assessing the PAs network adequacy, identifying its gaps, and optimizing it based on 'realistic' (considering areas inside PAs with lower cost) and 'ideal' (considering all non-humanized areas with higher potential for conservation) cost scenarios. Results clearly indicate that analyses targeting ESUs are more effective in the protection of genetic diversity and less costly in terms of selected area, in total and inside PM. Results also indicate that most ESUs and species are insufficiently protected and that extra PM are needed on most islands to reach conservation targets. Surprisingly, the total area selected in 'ideal' and 'realistic' prioritization scenarios are identical on most islands both for analyses targeting ESUs or species. Therefore the 'realistic' scenario should be largely followed. The work provides an innovative methodological framework for supporting the use of genetic diversity in reserve design and its results should assist in local-scale conservation planning.

AB  - Dacryodes buettneri is an important timber tree in Central Africa. Its wood, commercially called ozigo, is sold in domestic and international markets. The species is only occasionally planted, mostly in home gardens. It is locally threatened. To assist in management planning and sustainable in-situ conservation; a study of the geographic distribution and ecological niche of D. buettneri was conducted. Data from 218 georeferenced collections were used to describe the geographic distribution. Assimilations based on 19 climatic parameters were used in order to describe the areas where it grew and to determine optimal values of climatic factors. The results showed that there were more collections of D. buettneri from Gabon than from neighbouring countries, with only a few collections in southern Cameroon and southern Congo. The modelled optimal rainfall was between 1600 and 2000 mm year(-1) and the modelled optimal mean annual temperature, 23.8-25.8 degrees C. Dacryodes buettneri grows at low altitudes, from 0 to 750 in above sea level. The results of this study will be used to optimise strategies for in-situ conservation of populations of D. buettneri.

AB  - The effectiveness of measures targeted at the restoration of populations of endangered species in anthropogenically dominated regions is often limited by a combination of insufficient restoration of habitat quality and dispersal failure. Therefore, the joint prediction of suitable habitat and seed dispersal in dependency of management actions is required for effective nature management. Here we demonstrate an approach, which links a habitat suitability and a seed dispersal model. The linked model describes potential species distribution as a function of current species distribution, species-specific dispersal traits, the number of successful dispersal events, dispersal infrastructure and habitat configuration. The last two variables were related to water management actions. We demonstrate the applicability of the model in a strategy analysis of hydrological restoration measures for a large fen area in which still numerous endangered plant species grow.
   With the aid of the linked model, we were able to optimise the spatial planning of restoration measures, taking into account both the constraints of water management practices on abiotic restoration and the effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal. Moreover, we could demonstrate that stand-alone habitat suitability models, which assume unlimited dispersal, may considerably overestimate restoration prospects. For these reasons, we conclude that linked habitat suitability and dispersal models can provide useful insights into spatially differentiated potentials and constraints of nature restoration measures targeted at the sustainable conservation of endangered plant populations whose habitats have been deteriorated due to undesirable effects of land and water management on abiotic conditions. These insights may contribute to the design of cost-effective nature restoration and conservation measures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - P>1. Despite being expensive, complicated and less successful than the conservation of primary habitat, translocation is rapidly gaining importance as a conservation approach due to accelerated loss of natural environment. Finding the optimal abiotic and biotic conditions needed for successful translocation of plants can be difficult for species with limited information on prior distribution. Unfortunately, this is often the case with endangered plant species, including those urgently needing action.
   2. We present a method of evaluating the relative importance of multiple environmental parameters in translocation success. This method is based on the application of variation partitioning in canonical ordination and it allows usage of not only multiple independent biotic and abiotic variables, but also multiple dependent variables for fitness estimates.
   3. In this study, six soil parameters together with the abundance of 61 plant species and their total biomass were used to explain the variation in translocation success of Iris atrofusca plants among 22 microsites. The relative importance of each of the three factors was estimated using ordination techniques.
   4. Soil characteristics and total biomass of other plants did not significantly affect the performance of translocated irises, but the species composition of the surrounding vegetation did have a significant effect. The abundance of relatively rare species was closely correlated with iris performance. It is likely that these species do not affect the irises directly but instead represent environmental conditions not measured in this study, which are necessary for the survival of irises.
   5. Synthesis and applications.Variation partitioning appears to be a highly promising method for planning the translocation of plants and evaluating success due to its ability to estimate the unique contribution of each of two or more sets of environmental factors. It can be used to monitor success, and to identify the key contributory factors, in experimental translocations preceding actual introduction of plants in conservation programmes.

AB  - Using complementary metrics to evaluate phylogenetic diversity can facilitate the delimitation of floristic units and conservation priority areas. In this study, we describe the spatial patterns of phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity, phylogenetic endemism, and evolutionary distinctiveness of the hyperdiverse Ecuador Amazon forests and define priority areas for conservation. We established a network of 62 one-hectare plots in terra firme forests of Ecuadorian Amazon. In these plots, we tagged, collected, and identified every single adult tree with dbh 10cm. These data were combined with a regional community phylogenetic tree to calculate different phylogenetic diversity (PD) metrics in order to create spatial models. We used Loess regression to estimate the spatial variation of taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity as well as phylogenetic endemism and evolutionary distinctiveness. We found evidence for the definition of three floristic districts in the Ecuadorian Amazon, supported by both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity data. Areas with high levels of phylogenetic endemism and evolutionary distinctiveness in Ecuadorian Amazon forests are unprotected. Furthermore, these areas are severely threatened by proposed plans of oil and mining extraction at large scales and should be prioritized in conservation planning for this region.

AB  - AimCorrelative models that forecast extinction risk from climate change and invasion risks following species introductions, depend on the assumption that species' current distributions reflect their climate tolerances (climatic equilibrium'). This assumption has rarely been tested with independent distribution data, and studies that have done so have focused on species that are widespread or weedy in their native range. We use independent data to test climatic equilibrium for a broadly representative group of species, and ask whether there are any general indicators that can be used to identify when equilibrium occurs.
   LocationEurope and contiguous USA.
   MethodsWe contrasted the climate conditions occupied by 51 plant species in their native (European) and naturalized (USA) distributions by applying kernel smoothers to species' occurrence densities. We asked whether species had naturalized in climate conditions that differ from their native ranges, suggesting climatic disequilibrium in the native range, and whether characteristics of species' native distributions correspond with climatic equilibrium.
   ResultsA large proportion of species' naturalized distributions occurred outside the climatic conditions occupied in their native ranges: for 22 species, the majority of their naturalized ranges fell outside their native climate conditions. Our analyses revealed large areas in Europe that species do not occupy, but which match climatic conditions occupied in the USA, suggesting a high degree of climatic disequilibrium in the native range. Disequilibrium was most severe for species with native ranges that are small and occupy a narrow range of climatic conditions.
   Main conclusionsOur results demonstrate that the direct effects of climate on species distributions have been widely overestimated, and that previous large-scale validations of the equilibrium assumption using species' native and naturalized distributions are not generally applicable. Non-climatic range limitations are likely to be the norm, rather than the exception, and pose added risks for species under climate change.

AB  - Estimating absence locations of a species is important in conservation biology and conservation planning. For instance, using reliable absence as much as presence information, species distribution models can enhance their performance and produce more accurate predictions of the distribution of a species. Unfortunately, estimating reliable absence locations is difficult and often requires a deep knowledge of the species' distribution and of its abiotic and biotic environmental preferences and tolerance. In this paper, we propose a methodology to reconstruct reliable absence information from presence-only information, and the conditions that those presence-only data have to meet to make this possible.
   Large species occurrence data collections (otherwise called occurrence datasets) contain high quality and expert-reviewed species observation records from scientific surveys. These surveys can be used to retrieve species presence locations, but they also record places where the species in their target list were not observed. Although these absences could be simply due to sampling variation, it is possible to intersect many of these reports to estimate true absence locations, i.e. those due to habitat unsuitability or geographical hindrances. In this paper, we present a method to generate reliable absence locations of this type for marine species, using scientific surveys reports contained in the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), an authoritative species occurrence dataset. Our method spatially aggregates information from surveys focussing on the same target species. It detects absence locations for a given species as those locations in which repeated surveys (that included the species of interest in their target list) reported information only on other species. We qualitatively demonstrate the reliability of our method using distribution records of the Atlantic cod as a case study. Additionally, we quantitatively estimate its performance using another authoritative large species occurrence dataset, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). We also demonstrate that our approach has higher accuracy and presents complementary behaviour with respect to another method using environmental envelopes. Our process can support species distribution models (as well as other types of models, e.g. climate change models) by providing reliable data to presence/absence approaches. It can manage regional as well as global scale scenarios and runs within a collaborative e-Infrastructure (D4Science) that publishes it as-a-Service, allowing biologists to reproduce, repeat and share experimental results.

AB  - Simple SummaryClimate change has been regarded as one of the major threats to biodiversity by altering habitats and food sources for wildlife as well as the function of ecosystems. The giant panda is an endangered endemic species in China and a flagship species of the world's biodiversity conservation. Previous studies mostly focused on the effect of climate change on the giant panda itself. Few studies have addressed potential niche overlapping and interspecific competition between giant pandas and sympatric competitive species under future climate change. By assessing the spatial overlapping between giant pandas and sympatric competitive animals changes under future climate conditions in the Qinling Mountains, we found that the distribution areas of giant pandas and sympatric species would decrease remarkably under future climate changes. The shifting of the spatial aggregation between giant pandas and sympatric species vary under different climate change scenarios. New protected areas may need to be planned in order to maintain suitable habitats able to promote the survival of the species to climate changes.Understanding how climate change alters the spatial aggregation of sympatric species is important for biodiversity conservation. Previous studies usually focused on spatial shifting of species but paid little attention to changes in interspecific competitions under climate change. In this study, we evaluated the potential effects of climate change on the spatial aggregation of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and three sympatric competitive species (i.e., black bears (Ursus thibetanus), golden takins (Budorcas taxicolor), and wild boars (Sus scrofa)) in the Qinling Mountains, China. We employed an ensemble species distribution modeling (SDM) approach to map the current spatial distributions of giant pandas and sympatric animals and projected them to future climate scenarios in 2050s and 2070s. We then examined the range overlapping and niche similarities of these species under different climate change scenarios. The results showed that the distribution areas of giant pandas and sympatric species would decrease remarkably under future climate changes. The shifting directions of the overlapping between giant pandas and sympatric species vary under different climate change scenarios. In conclusion, future climate change greatly shapes the spatial overlapping pattern of giant pandas and sympatric species in the Qinling Mountains, while interspecific competition would be intensified under both mild and worst-case climate change scenarios.

AB  - Tidal flats throughout the Yellow and Bohai Seas provide essential habitat for migrating shorebirds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Land reclamation threatens this habitat. Using bird-sighting data and environmental variables, we identify areas appropriate for prioritized protection for 46 shorebird species, using a MaxEnt species distribution model and Zonation protection planning software. We also assess changes in habitat status and conservation importance of tidal flats along the Rudong and Dongtai coasts, Jiangsu Province, a significant shorebird biodiversity area recently inscribed as a World Heritage site. A priority area of 4523 km(2), containing more saltpan and aquaculture areas than tidal flats, and more than 90% of all tidal flat areas in the priority area, is identified, of which only 12.05% is currently protected within existing National Nature Reserves. Tidal flats along the Rudong and Dongtai coasts have decreased in area from 2000 to 2015, and particularly from 2010 to 2015 at a rate nine times that for 2000-2010. An irreplaceability index for coastal habitat for Xiaoyangkou, Rudong county, increased from 2012 to 2015, signaling a need for urgent habitat management and protection, such as afforded by establishing new nature reserves. Effective management and restoration of saltpan and aquaculture habitat in Bohai and Laizhou bays is also necessary.

AB  - 1. Top predators are seen as keystone species of ecosystems. Knowledge of their habitat requirements is important for their conservation and the stability of the wildlife communities that depend on them. The goal of our study was to model the habitat of leopard Panthera pardus in west and central Asia, where it is endangered, and analyse the connectivity between different known populations in the Caucasus to enable more effective conservation management strategies to be implemented.
   2. Presence and absence data for the species were evaluated from the Caucasus, Middle East and central Asia. Habitat variables related to climate, terrain, land cover and human disturbance were used to construct a predictive model of leopard habitat selection by employing a geographic information system (GIS) and logistic regression.
   3. Our model suggested that leopards in west and central Asia avoid deserts, areas with long-duration snow cover and areas that are near urban development. Our research also provides an algorithm for sample data management, which could be used in modelling habitats for similar species.
   4. Synthesis and applications. This model provides a tool to improve search effectiveness for leopard in the Caucasus, Middle East and central Asia as well as for the conservation and management of the species. The model can predict the probable distribution of leopards and the corridors between various known populations. Connectivity patterns can be used to facilitate corridor planning for leopard conservation, especially in the Caucasus, where the leopard is a top priority conservation species. Also, as top predators are often associated with high biodiversity, the leopard habitat model could help to identify biodiversity hotspots. The protection of biodiversity hotspots is seen as the most effective way to conserve biodiversity globally.

AB  - Geographic distribution and habitat quality are key criteria for assessing the degree of risk of species extinction threat. Campylorhynchus yucatanicus (Yucatan Wren, Troglodytidae) is an endemic bird of the Northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, with a distribution restricted to a narrow strip of habitat, between Campeche and Yucatan states. Currently, the Yucatan coast has lost more than half of the coastal dune vegetation, and other habitats have been modified mainly because there is no urban development plan and the natural resources management is poor. These factors threaten C. yucatanicus, which is listed as a near threatened species by IUCN and as an endangered species by Mexican law NOM059-2010. In this paper, C. yucatanicus's potential distribution was modeled using 64 presence records from several sources (1960 y 2009), a set of climate variables, and a vegetation index layer of normalized difference (NDVI). To assess the degree of landscape connectivity we used a map of vegetation types and land use, distance to villages and paved roads. The potential distribution model showed an area of approximately 2 711 km(2), which is 2 % of the total area of the Yucatan Peninsula distribution. In this area, only 27 % is protected by Biosphere Reserve category and only 10 % belong to core conservation areas, with land use restrictions and relatively effective protection. The populations from Ria Lagartos and Western Celestun regions appear to be the most isolated following the model of landscape connectivity. Landscape permeability among fragments of dune vegetation near the coast is low, mainly due to the distribution of urban areas. These results can be used to establish management strategies, and show that the species is in more delicate conditions than what it has been described by IUCN. We consider that C. yucatanicus should be given endangered category by IUCN, because of their distribution and the context of the current landscape connectivity.

AB  - Conservation organizations are collecting large-scale data regarding distribution and threats to vertebrate taxa. These data sets will enable planners to systematically identify large-scale conservation priorities; however, they will cover only a tiny proportion of living organisms. Therefore, it is essential to investigate to what extent the areas selected for conservation actions can provide protection for other species. We analyzed the umbrella effect between amphibians and mammals across mainland Africa. We built habitat suitability models within the geographic ranges of 1654 species, based on data collected in the framework of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Amphibian Assessment and IUCN Global Mammal Assessment. We applied systematic reserve selection algorithms to two sets of estimators of the area of occupancy of amphibians and mammals (geographic ranges and estimated suitable areas) and thus selected four reserve systems. We then quantified the protection that each of the four systems provided for amphibians and mammals. Reserves selected for amphibians and mammals were comparable in area, with the former concentrated in the Afrotropical region and the latter more evenly dispersed. Mammal reserves left fewer gaps in species coverage among amphibians than the reverse, but amphibian reserves included a larger proportion of each mammal's area of occupancy than the reverse. For both taxa, setting reserves to include estimated suitable areas instead of ranges resulted in the clustering of reserves in the tropics. Furthermore, it efficiently protected hidden gaps (species with unsuitable portions of their range inside protected areas) in the other taxon and included a higher proportion of the area of occupancy of the other taxon. Overall, amphibians and mammals in Africa acted as an umbrella for a high proportion of species in the other taxon. Focusing on estimated suitable areas instead of ranges improved the umbrella effect of both taxa.

AB  - An important goal of biological inventories is to provide information for environmental assessments of development projects and biodiversity conservation.
   Likewise, computer data bases have been proposed for efficient compilation and management of biological information. However, the attributes of biological inventories and computer data bases have not been examined with respect to environmental assessments. This article presents a case study in Mexico to analyze the current limitations of biological inventories for successful environmental assessments and biodiversity conservation in developing countries. Results demonstrate that, considering the objectives of environmental assessments and information constraints, computerized biological inventories should be assembled with a minimum of record fields: taxonomic data and georeferenced collection localities. Furthermore, it is proposed that environmental assessments should become a feedback to biological inventories and an important financial support to universities and research institutions in developing countries.

AB  - Predictive modelling of deep-sea species and assemblages with multibeam acoustic datasets as input variables is now a key tool in the provision of maps upon which spatial planning and management of the marine environment can be based. However, with a multitude of methods available, advice is needed on the best methods for the task at hand. In this study, we predictively modelled the distribution and extent of three vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) at the assemblage level ('Lophelia pertusa reef frameworks'; 'Stylasterids and lobose sponges'; and 'Xenophyophore fields') on the eastern flank of Rockall Bank, using three modelling methods: MaxEnt; RandomForests classification with multiple assemblages (gRF); and RandomForests classification with the presence/absence of a single VME (saRF). Performance metrics indicated that MaxEnt performed the best, but all models were considered valid. All three methods broadly agreed with regard to broad patterns in distribution. However, predicted extent presented a variation of up to 35 % between the different methods, and clear differences in predicted distribution were observed. We conclude that the choice of method is likely to influence the results of predicted maps, potentially impacting political decisions about deep-sea VME conservation.

AB  - The ideal conservation planning approach would enable decision-makers to use population viability analysis to assess the effects of management strategies and threats on all species at the landscape level. However, the lack of high-quality data derived from long-term studies, and uncertainty in model parameters and/or structure, often limit the use of population models to only a few species of conservation concern. We used spatially explicit metapopulation models in conjunction with multi-criteria decision analysis to assess how species-specific threats and management interventions would affect the persistence of African wild dog, black rhino, cheetah, elephant, leopard and lion, under six reserve scenarios, thereby providing the basis for deciding on a best course of conservation action in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal, which forms the central component of the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany biodiversity hotspot. Overall, the results suggest that current strategies of managing populations within individual, small, fenced reserves are unlikely to enhance metapopulation persistence should catastrophic events affect populations in the future. Creating larger and better-connected protected areas would ensure that threats can be better mitigated in the future for both African wild dog and leopard, which can disperse naturally, and black rhino, cheetah, elephant, and lion, which are constrained by electric fences but can be managed using translocation. The importance of both size and connectivity should inform endangered megafauna conservation and management, especially in the context of restoration efforts in increasingly human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Red-listed species are negatively affected by habitat degradation and fragmentation. They usually have small populations and may be affected by local extinctions which makes species distribution modeling (SDM) challenging. Although SDM has been used extensively for biodiversity protection and regional land-use planning, the transferability of SDM between regions is still at the developmental level. We show a first attempt to demonstrate model transferability for red-listed plant species over boreal regions. We modeled the distribution of 34 red-listed boreal peatland plant species at national and regional levels, using multiple streams of environmental data in Finland. The objectives were: (1) to evaluate how environmental characteristics explaining species distribution differ between three regions covering five vegetation zones (subarctic, northern, middle, southern boreal, and hemi-boreal vegetation zones); (2) to assess the performance of one national and three regional species distribution models (SDM: northern, middle, and southern regions); and (3) to test whether the regional models can be transferred to other regions and discuss alternative methods to improve transferability. The maximum entropy (maxent) algorithm was employed to predict suitable habitats for the assessed species. An SDM performance was measured with the area under the receiver operative characteristics (AUC), true skill statistics (TSS), and the continuous Boyce index (CBI). Three conclusions are relevant. First, the environmental variables explaining species distribution differed significantly (p < 0.05) between the three regions. Second, the internal measure of accuracy measured as cross-validation of AUC, TSS, and the CBI was quite similar in both the national and regional models, which indicates that realistic species distribution maps could be generated from all models. Last, the external measure of accuracy (i.e. transferability) in the regional models was lower than the internal measure of accuracy, which indicates that a good regional model could not automatically ensure good performance when transferred to another region. To improve the transferability of the regional models, we suggest the normalizing of environmental variable values. The data-driven evaluation of red-listed plant species provides an approach that can be used in biodiversity and nature conservation.

AB  - Ecological niche models have proved to be a powerful tool in assessing invasiveness risk of alien species, allowing the optimization of control strategies. Vespa velutina (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) is an invasive species with strong ecological, economical and health impacts in Europe after it was first reported in France in 2004. It was detected for the first time on a Mediterranean island (Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain) in 2015, where a single nest was found in the northwest of the island. Immediately, a control plan was implemented. In this study, we analysed 30 occurrence data in Mallorca island to assess the suitability distribution predicted for Mediterranean island conditions using an ensemble of small models. We obtained high values of AUC (0.9165), Somers' D (0.8331), Boyce (0.7611) and TSS (0.7754) as quality parameters of the final ensembled model. We show for the first time that there are suitable areas where this species can expand and stablish, mainly in steeper slopes and low isothermality zones. Likewise, the distribution suitability of V. velutina for other Mediterranean islands (Ibiza, Formentera, Menorca, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete and Cyprus) was also explored, showing potentially suitable zones. This study provides valuable information regarding the areas in the Mediterranean islands under risk of invasion, and it could be used by both scientists and managers for an early detection and control of the invasive species due to its cost-effectiveness in terms of conservation.
   Key message Recent invasions constitute a challenge for the application of ecological niche models. Ensemble of small models represented a novel and robust strategy to predict the distribution of Vespa velutina recent invasion in Mallorca. Climate, human and topographic influences combined explained the distribution of V. velutina. Models calibrated in Mallorca allowed to predict potentially suitable areas of invasion in other Mediterranean islands.

AB  - Context Riparian areas are considered to undergo major alterations under changing climate, making floodplain habitats targets for conservation and landscape planning. Protected areas might provide sanctuaries especially for sessile riparian plant species, but these niches are not always persistent over time. Objectives We investigate if plant species of floodplain forests are provided with suitable habitat within currently protected areas and if these refugia persist. A coupled-modelling approach is used to gain spatially explicit information on new areas for sanctuaries. Methods We use species distribution models to predict the niche of 12 Salicion albae and 7 Fraxinion floodplain forest species along rivers in Switzerland, under current, moderate and extreme climate change scenarios up to 80 years to the future (2100). The spread of plant species from current habitat to suitable future habitat is simulated using dispersal vectors and life history traits. Results Salicion albae species are more flexible under both climate change scenarios than Fraxinion species. The main limitation for the spread of species is their dispersal ability, as only a minority of the suitable cells is colonized during the simulation process. The predicted future presence within currently protected areas decreases under both climate change scenarios in the model. Conclusions Current protected floodplains do not provide persistent refugia for the plants studied, but might still be of importance to other organisms. Planning of sanctuaries for riparian plant species and communities need to focus on connectivity along rivers to maintain viable source populations in dynamic riverine landscapes under changing climate.

AB  - Clarifying species-environment relationships is crucial for the development of efficient conservation and restoration strategies. However, this work is often complicated by a lack of detailed information on species distribution and habitat features and tends to ignore the impact of scale and landscape features. Here, we tracked 11 Oriental White Storks (Ciconia boyciana) with GPS loggers during their wintering period at Poyang Lake and divided the tracking data into two parts (foraging and roosting states) according to the distribution of activity over the course of a day. Then, a three-step multiscale and multistate approach was employed to model habitat selection characteristics: (1) first, we minimized the search range of the scale for these two states based on daily movement characteristics; (2) second, we identified the optimized scale of each candidate variable; and (3) third, we fit a multiscale, multivariable habitat selection model in relation to natural features, human disturbance and especially landscape composition and configuration. Our findings reveal that habitat selection of the storks varied with spatial scale and that these scaling relationships were not consistent across different habitat requirements (foraging or roosting) and environmental features. Landscape configuration was a more powerful predictor for storks' foraging habitat selection, while roosting was more sensitive to landscape composition. Incorporating high-precision spatiotemporal satellite tracking data and landscape features derived from satellite images from the same periods into a multiscale habitat selection model can greatly improve the understanding of species-environmental relationships and guide efficient recovery planning and legislation.</p>

AB  - Understanding the relationship between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services concepts is essential for evidence-based policy development. We used text mining augmented by topic modelling to analyse abstracts of 15 310 peer-reviewed papers (from 2000 to 2020). We identified nine major topics; "Research & Policy", "Urban and Spatial Planning", "Economics & Conservation", "Diversity & Plants", "Species & Climate change", "Agriculture", "Conservation and Distribution", "Carbon & Soil & Forestry", "Hydro-& Microbiology". The topic "Research & Policy" performed highly, considering number of publications and citation rate, while in the case of other topics, the "best" performances varied, depending on the indicator applied. Topics with human, policy or economic dimensions had higher performances than the ones with 'pure' biodiversity and science. Agriculture dominated over forestry and fishery sectors, while some elements of biodiversity and ecosystem services were under-represented. Text mining is a powerful tool to identify relations between research supply and policy demand.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is one of the key drivers of global biodiversity loss. In this context, connectivity modelling is increasingly important for effective conservation. Most previous studies on connectivity modelling are based on focal species, while fewer studies focus on models based on landscape naturalness or wildness. We propose a methodological framework for wildland network planning, which utilizes the results from wilderness mapping as input data for connectivity models. The least-cost model and circuit model are applied using Linkage Mapper and Circuitscape, with wilderness areas selected as source patches together with resistance values transformed from a wilderness quality index. Taking the Great Taihang region of China as an example, wildland networks are created and pinch-points are identified. We show that the selection of core patches and resistance surfaces have a significant impact on the resulting corridors. The wildland network could serve as an effective and efficient alternative to habitat network and supplement the protected areas network, especially when the species distribution data are lacking, or a rapid assessment is required. This framework for wildland planning could potentially be applied to fragmented landscapes across various countries to eliminate or reduce the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.

AB  - Identifying highly frequented areas is a priority for sea turtle conservation, and the distribution of young individuals in open waters represents a major knowledge gap due to methodological biases. The drift of hatchlings from 38 loggerhead Caretta caretta and 10 green Chelonia mydas turtle nesting sites in the Mediterranean was simulated for the first 6 mo of life, with simulations repeated for 5 different years (2001 through 2005). Results indicate that hatchlings from the Levantine and south-central Mediterranean sites are mainly retained in the same areas of origin, while those from the Ionian area mainly disperse to the Ionian, Adriatic and southcentral Mediterranean areas. Combining hatchling dispersal with existing empirical information on juveniles and adults, a general distribution model among nesting sites, and oceanic and neritic foraging grounds for Mediterranean sea turtles is proposed. The Levantine zone may be particularly key for the conservation of the Mediterranean populations of both species, since it may host the highest concentration of individuals. Subregional management units identified by dispersal patterns may facilitate turtle conservation through a relatively small-scale international approach. In-water studies in specific zones are identified as a research priority for improving current knowledge and informing conservation plans.

AB  - Aim To demonstrate that the concept of carrying capacity for species richness (SK) is highly relevant to the conservation of biodiversity, and to estimate the spatial pattern of SK for native landbirds as a basis for conservation planning.
   Location North America.
   Methods We evaluated the leading hypotheses on biophysical factors affecting species richness for Breeding Bird Survey routes from areas with little influence of human activities. We then derived a best model based on information theory, and used this model to extrapolate SK across North America based on the biophysical predictor variables. The predictor variables included the latest and probably most accurate satellite and simulation-model derived products.
   Results The best model of SK included mean annual and inter-annual variation in gross primary productivity and potential evapotranspiration. This model explained 70% of the variation in landbird species richness. Geographically, predicted SK was lowest at higher latitudes and in the arid west, intermediate in the Rocky Mountains and highest in the eastern USA and the Great Lakes region of the USA and Canada. Main conclusions Areas that are high in SK but low in human density are high priorities for protection, and areas high in SK and high in human density are high priorities for restoration. Human density was positively related to SK, indicating that humans select environments similar to those with high bird species richness. Federal lands were disproportionately located in areas of low predicted SK.

AB  - Forest ecosystems of the Russian Federation are expected to face high risks under environmental dynamics related to climate change. Analyzing the likely impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems is crucial in order to understand the potential adaptation of forests, to guide management strategies, as well as to preserve ecosystem services. With the aim to provide information on the possible modifications of geographic ranges, in the medium to long-term, for some Russian dominant forest species under climate change, we applied a Cascade Ensemble System (CES) approach. This consists of combining Ensemble Platform for Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to six bias-corrected Earth System Model (ESM) projections, driven in turn by two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) proxies of greenhouse gas emission scenarios, in order to obtain area maps of the future suitability for forest species. The suitability information is then flagged with information about its "likelihood," adopting the IPCC terminology based on a consensus among projections. Maps of aggregated changes were created in order to identify areas potentially more vulnerable to climate change. Results showed that possible impacts of climate change (either gain or loss) were diversified across species with a pronounced Northward shift of the ranges. Further analyses were performed at sub-regional levels revealing the potential for the Arctic Circle to become a refuge area for some conifer species. Species-aggregated change analyses spotted two distinct areas as more vulnerable to habitat change, in the central and south-east portions of the Russian territory. Our findings represent useful and immediate biogeographical information available to Russian policy makers to delineate conservation strategies and forest management plans.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of landscape change on species distributions can help inform decision-making and conservation planning. Unfortunately, empirical data that span large spatial extents across multiple taxa are limited. In this study, we used expert elicitation techniques to develop species distribution models (SDMs) for harvested wildlife species (n = 10) in the New England region of the northeastern United States. We administered an online survey that elicited opinions from wildlife experts on the probability of species occurrence throughout the study region. We collected 3396 probability of occurrence estimates from 46 experts, and used linear mixed-effects methods and landcover variables at multiple spatial extents to develop SDMs. The models were in general agreement with the literature and provided effect sizes for variables that shape species occurrence. With the exception of gray fox, models performed well when validated against crowdsourced empirical data. We applied models to rasters (30 x 30 m cells) of the New England region to map each species' distribution. Average regional occurrence probability was highest for coyote (0.92) and white-tailed deer (0.89) and lowest for gray fox (0.42) and moose (0.52). We then stacked distribution maps of each species to estimate and map focal species richness. Species richness (s) varied across New England, with highest average richness in the least developed states of Vermont (s = 7.47) and Maine (s = 7.32), and lowest average richness in the most developed states of Rhode Island (s = 6.13) and Massachusetts (s = 6.61). Our expert-based approach provided relatively inexpensive, comprehensive information that would have otherwise been difficult to obtain given the spatial extent and range of species being assessed. The results provide valuable information about the current distribution of wildlife species and offer a means of exploring how climate and land-use change may impact wildlife in the future.

AB  - Eco-geographical characterization of aquatic microhabitats used by amphibians in the Mediterranean Basin-Small freshwater ecosystems, whether natural or artificial origin, are aquatic microhabitats for many species and are particularly important in the Mediterranean region. This study characterizes the aquatic microhabitats suitable for amphibian reproduction in the Andalusian Mediterranean Basin and identifies the environmental and geographical features that determine the presence of different amphibian species in these water bodies. Geographical and environmental favourability models were performed to determine the relationship between characteristics of the microhabitats and species presence. The characteristics analysed were geographical location, external environment (climate and topography), surrounding conditions (connectivity and conservation), type of water body, water conditions, and water dimensions. Microhabitats located in the western and central part of the study area were geographically favourable for most species. In descending order, the most common environmental factors characterizing the microhabitats were typology, surrounding conditions, water condition, external environment and size of the water body. The most common variables in the models were the connectivity between water bodies and old wells, a frequent type of microhabitat in areas of traditional cultures. Management plans should take these results into account in efforts to preserve these habitats for wildlife and especially amphibians.

AB  - Rosa arabica Crep. is a perennial shrub belonging to the family Rosaceae. It is endemic to the high mountain area of St. Catherine Protected Area (SCPA) in southern Sinai, Egypt, and is listed as one of the most 100 threatened plants in the world. Recently, it has been listed as critically endangered by IUCN Red List due to its small extent of occurrence and tiny population size. We reported the continuous decline in habitat quality for this species and the urgent need to carry out on-ground conservation actions. So, this research aims to conserve Rosa arabica through in situ practices by implementing the following steps, respectively: a) evaluate the current conservation status through IUCN Red List to extract the environmental factors controlling the species' distribution necessary for establishing the recovery program, b) determine the potential species habitat suitability under the current climate conditions using Maxent, and c) based on the previous two steps, the translocation process for R. arabica in the suitable habitat will be done after the simple layering process as one of the most effective traditional vegetative methods for wild cultivation for this species. These steps aimed to reduce the impact of threats and the risk of extinction through increasing the population size, the Extent of Occurrence (EOO), and the Area of Occupancy (AOO). We extracted the environmental factors controlling the target species' distribution and habitat suitability range using the IUCN Red List assessment and Species Distribution Model (SDM). The most suitable habitat for R. arabica is predicted in the middle northern parts of SCPA, with the highest suitability in the High Mountains. Precipitation of driest quarter, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation of coldest quarter, and aspect are the highest mean contributors determining the distribution of R. arabica in SCPA. Rosa arabica potential distribution covers 324.4 km(2) (7.46%) of the total SCPA area (4350 km(2)). This area is divided into: 18.1 km(2) high probability, 124.3 km(2) moderate probability, and 182 km(2) low probability. After one year of the simple layering process, ten branches rooted and were translocated into three sites that had been previously identified to cover three habitat suitability ranges (high, moderate, and low suitability). After a year of translocation in the wild, the survival rate ranged from 66% to 100%, the geographical range increased by 65%, and the population size by 6.8%. Therefore, if the new individuals continue to grow and adapt it may lead to the expansion of other environmental factors such as climatic and topographical factors that probably increase the resilience of the global population of the species to adverse events. Detailed information is provided in this research about the recovery program, from planning to implementation and monitoring, and recommendations for best practices.

AB  - Little information is available on the winter ecology of the small, geographically isolated, genetically-unique population of great gray owls (Strix nebulosa) in the central Sierra Nevada, California. This population is comprised of facultative, elevational winter migrants and access to winter habitat is an important component of their ecology. Winter observations and remotely sensed habitat variables were used to inform a predictive model of the environmental requirements and geographic distribution of this owl population. Using the modeled distribution map we assessed the distribution of 20% probability of occurrence classes relative to owl habitat associations, ownership, current development, and projected future development patterns. Our findings indicate that high probability class (81-100%) areas and the broader joint medium/medium-high/high probability class (41-100%) areas are uncommon on the landscape (0.2% and 5.0% of study area, respectively). High probability areas were characterized by Sierran Yellow Pine forest surrounding relatively small, flat areas of grassland, wet meadow, and riparian habitats, within the mid-elevation range. Approximately 32% of the high probability areas and 48% of the medium/medium-high/high probability areas occur on private lands. Of the areas on private lands, 32% of the high probability and 42% of the medium/medium-high/high probability areas occur on currently developed lands. Projected future development on private lands indicated that an additional 12% of the high and 18% of medium/medium-high/high suitability areas are slated for development by the year 2040. Future conservation planning efforts for the great gray owl in the Sierra Nevada will need to address management issues on both public and private lands. For future planning of development projects around great gray owl wintering habitat, the results from our study supplement current knowledge of breeding distributions to provide land and wildlife managers guidance on conservation priorities.

AB  - AimUnderstanding the spatial and temporal variation in the distribution of migratory species is critical for management and conservation efforts. However, challenges in observing mobile marine species throughout their migratory pathways can impede the identification of critical habitat, linkages between these habitats and threat-mitigation strategies. This study aimed to gain insight into the long-term residency and movement patterns of the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) and to reveal important habitat in the context of R.typus usage of existing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).
   LocationSouth-eastern Indian Ocean.
   MethodsSatellite telemetry was used to remotely track the long-term movements of 29 R.typus, and to quantify shark usage of the existing MPA network. From the tracking data and environmental predictors, nonlinear models were developed to predict suitable R.typus habitat throughout the south-eastern Indian Ocean.
   ResultsThis study includes the first documented complete return migrations by R.typus to Ningaloo Marine Park, which was found to be an important area for R.typus all year-round. We found that while existing MPAs along Australia's west coast do afford some protection to R.typus, telemetry-based habitat models revealed large areas of suitable habitat not currently protected, particularly along the Western Australian coast, in the Timor Sea, and in Indonesian and international waters.
   Main conclusionsAnimal-borne telemetric devices allowed the gathering of long-term spatial information from the elusive and highly mobile R.typus, revealing the spatial scale of their migration in the south-eastern Indian Ocean. Suitable habitat was predicted to occur inside conservation areas, but our findings indicate that the current MPA network may not sufficiently protect R.typus throughout the year. We suggest that telemetry-based habitat models can be an important tool to inform conservation planning and spatial management efforts for migratory species.

AB  - Aim We play the role of an ice age ecologist (IAE) charged with conserving biodiversity during the climate changes accompanying the last deglaciation. We develop reserve-selection strategies for the IAE and check them against rankings based on modern data. Location Northern and eastern North America. Methods Three reserve-selection strategies are developed. (1) Abiotic: the IAE uses no information about speciesclimate relationships, instead maximizing the climatic and geographic dispersion of reserves. (2) Species distribution models (SDMs): the IAE uses boosted-regression trees calibrated against pollen data and CCSM3 palaeoclimatic simulations from 21 to 15 ka bp to predict modern taxon distributions, then uses these as input to the Zonation reserve-ranking program. (3) Rank-and-regress: regression models are used to identify climatic predictors of zonation rankings. All strategies are assessed against a Zonation ranking based on modern pollen distributions. Analysis units are ecoregions and grid cells. Results The abiotic strategy has a negative or no correlation between predicted and actual rankings. The SDM-based strategy fares better, with a significantly positive area-corrected correlation (r= 0.474, P < 0.001) between predicted and actual rankings. Predictive ability drops when grid cells are the analysis unit (r= 0.217, P = 0.058). Predictive ability for the rank-and-regress strategy is similar to the SDM results. Main conclusions For the IAE, SDMs improve the predictive ability of reserve-selection strategies. However, predictive ability is limited overall, probably due to shifted realized niches during past no-analogue climates, new species interactions as species responded individually to climate change, and other environmental changes not included in the model. Twenty-first-century conservation planning also faces these challenges, and is further complicated by other anthropogenic impacts. The IAE's limited success does not preclude the use of climate scenarios and niche-based SDMs when developing adaptation strategies, but suggests that such tools offer at best only a rough guide to identifying possible areas of future conservation value.

AB  - A time series of data for the demersal elasmobranchs Mustelus mustelus, Raja asterias, Torpedo marmorata and Galeus melastomus obtained from the "MEDITS" experimental surveys carried out in the Aegean Sea from 1998 to 2008 were examined to identify depth preferences, together with the spatial and temporal distribution pattern of the species. Survey data have been modelled by means of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), as functions of depth, sampling position (latitude-longitude interaction) and year. Both depth and geographical coordinates were the key determinants of the presence of all species, while annual abundance fluctuations were found to be either insignificant or without any specific trend. The depth distribution patterns differed between species. M. mustelus, and T. marmorata, were more frequent in continental shelf areas (up to 180-200 m). R. asterias preferred the transitional depth zone between shelf and slope (around 200 m), while depths over 350 m (continental slope) favoured the presence of G. melastomus. Model predictions were used to generate density distributions maps, which could facilitate conservation plans in the area through the identification of abundance hotspots. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The potential distribution of a cryptic, naturally rare large mammal, the giant armadillo Priodontes maximus, was explored in fragments of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (259,641 km(2)) Brazil. Watersheds (N = 344) throughout the state were surveyed for evidence of the species with 164 confirmed presences and 180 absences. A total of 144 independent presence points were used to model the current potential distribution of the species using the Maxent algorithm with 30 possible explanatory variables. Suitable and unsuitable areas, average patch size of suitable habitats and conversion rate of habitat from 1985 to 2018 were also calculated. Results highlight the severe fragmentation level of the suitable areas left for the giant armadillos, with suitable habitat patches (forest and savanna) surrounded by an agricultural matrix. Furthermore, only four suitable patches are larger than 100 km(2) (132.63 + 32.04 km(2)). Due to the species low population growth rate it is possible that individuals recorded are part of declining or functionally extinct populations. Further studies on the density and population trends of giant armadillos within this fragmented landscape will be key to understanding the potential long-term persistence of giant armadillos in the degraded Cerrado of MS.

AB  - Species distribution models provide biologists with insight into species ranges, ecological niches, and spatial predictions of suitable habitat, but require significant training, data, and time for biologists to obtain reliable results. Alternatively, ad hoc inferences from sparse occurrence records leave biologists to face conservation decisions with high uncertainty. Simple predictive models can fill the gap between these two alternatives. One method to predict the probable range of riverine fishes is to add the average distance between occurrences to the most distal occurrence (parametric estimator). However, there are drawbacks to this method when the distances between occurrences deviate from a non-uniform distribution. Herein, estimators that are robust to non-uniformity, a non-parametric and an optimal linear estimator, were adapted and compared to the parametric estimator using simulations. The non-parametric estimator showed the least bias and variance in bias for the probable range endpoint. The optimal linear estimator best balanced type I and type II errors in the maximum probable range estimate (i.e., upper CI). Application of the robust estimators were made to demonstrate how sampling can be planned based on available effort (Gulf Coast walleye, Sander vitreus) and where early detection sampling may be focused (silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). This study provides biologists with a suite of simple options (R code provided as supplementary material) to bridge the gap between ad hoc inference and complex modeling over a range of scenarios. Future studies should focus on accounting for false-positives, variable effort, and develop online apps for accessibility.

AB  - Aim: Human-driven impacts constantly threat amphibians, even in largely protected regions such as the Amazon. The Brazilian Amazon is home to a great diversity of amphibians, several of them currently threatened with extinction. We investigated how climate change, deforestation and establishment of hydroelectric dams could affect the geographic distribution of Amazonian amphibians by 2030 and midcentury.
   Location: The Brazilian Amazon.
   Methods: We overlapped the geographic distribution of 255 species with the location of hydroelectric dams, models of deforestation and climate change scenarios for the future.
   Results: We found that nearly 67% of all species and 54% of species with high degree of endemism within the Legal Brazilian Amazon would lose habitats due to the hydroelectric overlapping. In addition, deforestation is also a potential threat to amphibians, but had a smaller impact compared to the likely changes in climate. The largest potential range loss would be caused by the likely increase in temperature. We found that five amphibian families would have at least half of the species with over 50% of potential distribution range within the Legal Brazilian Amazon limits threatened by climate change between 2030 and 2050.
   Main conclusions: Amphibians in the Amazon are highly vulnerable to climate change, which may cause, directly or indirectly, deleterious biological changes for the group. Under modelled scenarios, the Brazilian Government needs to plan for the development of the Amazon prioritizing landscape changes of low environmental impact and economic development to ensure that such changes do not cause major impacts on amphibian species while reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.

AB  - Bayesian networks are one of the most powerful tools in the design of expert systems located in an uncertainty framework. However, normally their application is determined by the discretization of the continuous variables. In this paper the naive Bayes (NB) and tree augmented naive Bayes (TAN) models are developed. They are based on Mixtures of Truncated Exponentials (MTE) designed to deal with discrete and continuous variables in the same network simultaneously without any restriction. The aim is to characterize the habitat of the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca graeca), using several continuous environmental variables, and one discrete (binary) variable representing the presence or absence of the tortoise. These models are compared with the full discrete models and the results show a better classification rate for the continuous one. Therefore, the application of continuous models instead of discrete ones avoids loss of statistical information due to the discretization. Moreover, the results of the TAN continuous model show a more spatially accurate distribution of the tortoise. The species is located in the Donana Natural Park, and in semiarid habitats. The proposed continuous models based on MTEs are valid for the study of species predictive distribution modelling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In face of increasing anthropogenic disturbance in the deep sea, it is a priority to better understand the regional distribution of cold-water corals (CWC). These organisms create some of the most species-rich habitats in the deep sea and, for this reason, they must be properly protected and managed. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable habitat for multiple CWC taxa off the Brazilian continental margin and compare their environmental niches. Habitat suitability models were developed using the Maxent approach, which allowed for the prediction of species distribution and for the identification of potential 'hot spot' areas that may be important for biodiversity conservation. Ecological niches were determined by a PCA-env approach, and niche similarity and equivalence were evaluated based on niche overlap using the Schoener's D metric. Potentially suitable habitat for Octocorallia covered a broad latitudinal range encompassing nearly the entire Brazilian continental margin, whereas Scleractinia had greater potentially suitable habitat in the Central and Southern areas. Scleractinian species were observed to slightly differ in their environmental niche, with non-reef-forming species being more tolerant to a wider range of environmental conditions in comparison with reef-forming species, inhabiting a wider area of the South American continental margin. Due to the high potential suitability for several CWC species, the Central and Southern parts of the Brazilian continental margin should be considered as potential areas high CWC diversity. Considering the current state of the art and strategic assessment tools, these areas are important targets for conservation, management, and environmental impact assessment. Most reef-forming species had similar but not directly equivalent ecological niches, indicating that mapping efforts and management planning should consider CWCs at the species level.

AB  - Spatial information on the distribution and densities of key species is an important prerequisite for understanding the functioning and management of ecosystem services. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly used in marine environments to assist with spatial management; however, most SDMs only predict occurrence and not density. Here, we use SDMs to predict probability of occurrence and density of two key estuarine bivalve species (Austrovenus stutchburyi and Paphies australis) that differ in habitat usage and distribution, to gain insight into the utility of these methods for management. Boosted regression trees (BRTs) were used to predict occurrence, density, and uncertainty at a fine spatial scale (100 m resolution). Results showed high probability of occurrence for Paphies near the estuary mouth (up to 0.83), where high densities, exceeding 4000 ind m- 2, were also predicted. For Austrovenus, predicted occurrence was high throughout the intertidal area, ranging from 0.5 to 0.87, with no clear spatial patterns. Instead, density models clearly identified spatial patterns for Austrovenus, with high densities exceeding 1000 ind m- 2. Spatially explicit uncertainty was low throughout the estuary for both species, providing confidence in model outcomes. Our study demonstrates that a high probability of occurrence does not necessarily equate to high density and illustrates the need for the transition to more informative species density models. Management that simultaneously considers both density and occurrence probabilities will enable targeted protection of areas that are of greatest ecological value to species of interest.

AB  - In the face of climate change threats, governments are drawing attention to policies for mitigating its effects on biodiversity. However, the lack of distribution data makes predictions at species level a difficult task, mainly in regions of higher biodiversity. To overcome this problem, we use native landcover as a surrogate biodiversity, because it can represent specialized habitat for species, and investigate the effects of future climate change on Brazilian biomes. We characterize the climatic niches of native landcover and use ecological niche modeling to predict the potential distribution under current and future climate scenarios. Our results highlight expansion of the distribution of open vegetation and the contraction of closed forests. Drier Brazilian biomes, like Caatinga and Cerrado, are predicted to expand their distributions, being the most resistant to climate change impacts. However, these would also be affected by losses of their closed forest enclaves and their habitat-specific or endemic species. Replacement by open vegetation and overall reductions are a considerable risk for closed forest, threatening Amazon and Atlantic forest biomes. Here, we evidence the impacts of climate change on Brazilian biomes, and draw attention to the necessity for management and attenuation plans to guarantee the future of Brazilian biodiversity.

AB  - As wildlife populations and habitats continue to diminish at alarming rates all over the world, those responsible for wildlife management recognize that global, integrated, multi-dimensional strategies must be developed to respond to the escalating crisis that the world's biodiversity is facing. It is also recognized that resources available for the preservation of the world's biodiversity are limited and must be carefully apportioned not only where they are most needed but also where they can do the most good. Concomitantly, if current rates of extinction are to be slowed, global cooperation and coordination of efforts for species preservation are essential. In response to these challenges, the Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (CBSG) of IUCN's Species Survival Commission has assisted in the development and application of a series of tools and processes to expedite the development of scientifically-based management strategies for threatened species. These tools, based on small population and conservation biology, are used in intensive, problem-solving workshop processes designed to contribute to the development of realistic and achievable strategies for species conservation. The primary tools used by the CBSG include: (i) providing an objective workshop environment and a facilitation process that supports sharing of available information, reaching agreement on the issues, available information, and useful management recommendations; (ii) the Mace-Lande criteria for evaluation of threat, and, currently their derivative draft IUCN Red List criteria for threat; (iii) VORTEX, a stochastic, small population simulation modelling program (developed by Dr Robert Lacy of the Chicago Zoological Society) that considers genetics, demography, and environmental variation; (iv) topographic maps and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools to organize and visually to present species distribution information in relation to habitat, land use, and local human population distribution; and (v) demographic analysis of the local human populations with projections of growth patterns. The workshop processes employing these tools include: (i) Conservation Assessment and Management Planning (CAMP); and (ii) Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA). These processes have assisted in scientific decisionmaking and setting of priorities for species management activities aimed at halting the on-going decline in the planet's biodiversity. Recommendations for intensive management stemming from CAMP and PHVA workshops are as varied as the species analysed. This paper presents case summaries that demonstrate how these tools and workshop processes have aided in the formulation of holistic and viable conservation strategies for threatened species and lessons that have been learned in the process.

AB  - The Chilean fjord region includes many remote and poorly known areas where management plans for the marine living resources and conservation strategies are urgently needed. Few data are available about the spatial distribution of its marine invertebrate fauna, prevalently influenced by complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors, animal behavior and human activities. Patagonian fjords are a hotspot for finfish aquaculture, elevating Chile to the world's second producer of farmed salmon, after Norway, a condition that emphasizes the necessity to develop strategies for a sustainable aquaculture management. The present study focuses on the emblematic cold-water coral Desmophyllum dianthus, dwelling the Comau Fjord from shallow to deep waters, with the aim to illustrate population structure, demography and adaptation of the species and its potential use for the development of a sustainable conservation and management plan for human activities. The analyses of microsatellite loci of D. dianthus individuals from four sampling localities along horizontal and vertical gradients of Comau Fjord, lead to identify them as a panmictic population. The results also contributed to consider a careful examination of the synchrony between the temporal and spatial variations of environmental factors and the biological cycle of the species as key role player in the inference of autecology of the species. The discussion stresses the importance of molecular analyses as extremely helpful tools for studies focusing on remote areas and non-model organisms, where logistic difficulties and limited scientific knowledge hamper a better management and conservation of marine resources, and in particular the relevance of multidisciplinary approaches to reduce the extensive knowledge gap on the remote fjord ecosystems of Patagonia. This study also highlights the importance of oceanographic information in the entire process of the analyses and interpretation of genetic results.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be an effective spatial approach to conservation, especially when they involve genuine consultation that considers the diversity of stakeholders. Participatory mapping and semi structured interviews were conducted with 52 stakeholders and 22 managers and scientists to identify ecological priorities and concerns across a large temperate MPA in Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park, Australia. There were 19 iconic species of fish, dolphins, whales, and sea turtles that were the focus of ecological priorities and stakeholder interactions with the marine environment. Effectiveness of the current MPA management plan for addressing stakeholder priority and concerns, was assessed using GIS spatial modelling that created fuzzy-set species distribution models (SDMs) based on Traditional and Local Ecological Knowledge as well as scientific and citizen-science survey data. These spatial models for the iconic species across the MPA were then overlaid with ecological concerns of the stakeholders to create a spatial understanding of local threats, and priority areas for targeted management. Poor water quality from terrestrial primary sources was the main concern of stakeholders, more so than in-water threats such as poor fishing practices or impacts to iconic species. While local managers and scientists were relatively reluctant to answer interview questions, there was a general misalignment in approaches to iconic species management, especially for mobile and migratory species, and misunderstanding of stakeholder perceptions of threats. Participatory mapping of social-ecological values provides a method for stakeholders and decision-makers to better understand, discuss, and adapt marine spatial management approaches that support a diversity of conservation and management priorities.

AB  - Studies of Great Basin faunas can provide information for landscape-level adaptive management by federal agencies and shed light on potential effects of climate change in continental interior landscapes. To provide such information, we characterized the butterfly fauna of the Toquima Range, a mountain range in the heart of the Great Basin with topography typical of the region. We also compared the butterfly fauna of the Toquima Range to that of the adjacent Toiyabe Range, which is more topographically complex and species rich but less representative of the Great Basin on the whole. We explicitly addressed the effects of area and water availability on butterfly species richness. Butterfly species presence data were compiled for 14 canyons and 1 peak in the Toquima Range. Data from 11 canyons that we inventoried systematically were amenable to statistical analysis. Eighty butterfly species (59 residents) have been recorded from the Toquima Range since 1935. By comparison, 99 species have been recorded from the Toiyabe Range. Mean canyon-level butterfly species richness was significantly lower in the Toquima Range than in the Toiyabe Range. This difference cannot be explained by differences in canyon size between the mountain ranges. Within the Toquima Range water availability seems to have a dominant effect on butterfly species richness. Between mountain ranges species richness is influenced by interactions among area, moisture, and topography. These data should assist managers in developing guidelines for conservation planning in the Great Basin.

AB  - As IUCN critically vulnerable species,the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) have attracted great public attention in recent years. The threats of human disturbance and environmental pollution to this population have been documented extensively. However, research on the sensitivity of this species to climate change is lacking. To understand the effect of climate change on the potential distribution of Sousa chinensis, we developed a weighted ensemble model based on 82 occurrence records and six predictor variables (e.g., ocean depth, distance to shore, mean temperature, salinity, ice thickness, and current velocity). According to the true skill statistic (TSS) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), our ensemble model presented higher prediction precision than most of the single-algorithm models. It also indicated that ocean depth and distance to shore were the most important predictors in shaping the distribution patterns. The projections for the 2050s and 2100s from our ensemble model indicated a severe adverse impact of climate change on the Sousa chinensis habitat. Over 75% and 80% of the suitable habitat in the present day will be lost in all representative concentration pathway emission scenarios (RCPS) in the 2050s and 2100s, respectively. With the increased numbers of records of stranding and deaths of Sousa chinensis in recent years, strict management regulations and conservation plans are urgent to safeguard the current suitable habitats. Due to habitat contraction and poleward shift in the future, adaptive management strategies, including designing new reserves and adjusting the location and range of reserves according to the geographical distribution of Sousa chinensis, should be formulated to minimize the impacts of climate change on this species.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services, such as the enjoyment and satisfaction of viewing a species in the wild, are often underrepresented in conservation planning. Understanding the spatial distribution of wildlife-related services can inform management, which is especially important for declining species. We examined how natural and human features of a landscape influence the distribution of argali sheep in Itch Nart Nature Reserve, Mongolia, a popular destination for tourists seeking the opportunity to see and experience this declining species. We collected 1999 argali locations from 2009 to 2011 and developed an occupancy model for each season and across seasons. Occupancy probability equates to the chance of seeing the species, and provides a measure that not only describes the distribution of argali, but also the cultural service they provide. We developed a set of 67 candidate models and the top-ranking model each season and across seasons was the interaction of proximity to water and proportion of rocky outcrop at a site. Argali occupancy increased as distance to water decreased and amount of rocky outcrop increased. The simulated removal of water sources resulted in a 98% loss in landscape quality. Our results provide among the first occupancy models for argali, which can inform decision-making at multiple spatial scales. They also reveal the importance of water sources, which are intensively used by people and livestock, and indicate that careful management of these resources will be important to sustaining argali in the landscape.

AB  - Habitat classes are often used as surrogates to represent or capture species assemblages in the design of spatial conservation strategies, such as multi-use marine protected areas (MPAs). Little research, however, has critically evaluated how well habitat classes can reliably predict species distributions and abundances over scales relevant to spatial planning. In this study, we used hierarchical models to quantify spatial variability in demersal and mid-water fishes at multiple scales to determine whether habitat classes are appropriate surrogates for temperate fishes. Baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS) and mid-water BRUVS were used to sample fish assemblages in Jervis Bay, NSW, Australia, over rocky reef, seagrass Posidonia australis and unvegetated sediment among locations (>3 km), habitat classes (similar to 400 m) and sites within habitats (similar to 200 m). Each habitat class displayed a distinct assemblage of demersal fish driven by many species and families showing strong habitat associations (e.g. platycephalids and labrids). In contrast, the mid-water fish assemblage and certain demersal families, such as habitat generalists (e.g. sparids), showed no differentiation among habitat class. Considerable variation in the fish assemblage was also observed among locations. Seascape connectivity explained much of this variability, as reefs surrounded by large areas of seagrass harboured a greater abundance and diversity of fishes. Overall, we provide quantitative support for the use of habitat classes as surrogates for most temperate fishes. Spatial planners, however, need to be aware of species-specific relationships with habitat and the importance of seascape patterning when using habitat-based surrogates for MPA design.

TI  - Adequacy of wildlife habitat relation models for estimating spatial distributions of terrestrial vertebrates
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - In the U.S. National Biological Service's gap analysis, potential distributions of terrestrial vertebrate species are based on the synthesis of wildlife habitat relation data and then modeled using a vegetation cover map derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. Using long-term species lists from eight National Parks in Utah we evaluated the adequacy of the wildlife habitat relations data generated by gap analysis in predicting species distributions at landscape scales. Omission and commission error rates were estimated for major taxonomic groups and for each national park. Depending on the taxonomic group, omission error ranged from 0 to 25%, whereas commission error ranged from 4 to 33%. Error rates were highest in amphibians and reptiles and lowest for birds and mammals. In general the error rate declined as the size of the park increased. The Utah wildlife habitat relation models performed well when used to predict the presence or absence of terrestrial vertebrates in eight national parks in Utah and should provide valuable information for making conservation decisions. They also provide a measure of support for the use of these models within the gap analysis framework. Although it is likely that accuracy of wildlife habitat relation models will vary from state to state, and even considerably within a state, the modeling process seems robust enough to provide a reasonably high level of accuracy for use in conservation planning at the ecoregion level.

AB  - We investigated the effects of geographic distance and environmental heterogeneity on Asteraceae communities in the rupestrian grasslands of the Espinhaco Range, southeastern Brazil. Asteraceae species composition and relative abundance were sampled in 21-1 ha plots distributed across park conservation units, comprising an environmental gradient in soils and relief (elevation and slope). We found high levels of heterogeneity overall in assemblages of herbaceous and woody Asteraceae species at the intermediate spatial scale of this study (10-100 km). We found that both relief and soil properties (texture and total exchangeable bases) explained significant proportions of variation in community composition, suggesting that definitions or expansions of conservation units should span the highest possible variability in observed relief and soil values. We also found that Asteraceae distribution exhibited strong spatial structure independent of environmental variation, reinforcing the need to consider conservation across larger areas. Considering the dystrophic character of the soils found in the Espinhaco Range and the few differences in the fertility observed between the sampling units, our results also support the hypothesis that plant distributions in the tropics are controlled by a hierarchy of environmental gradients, where variables such as altitude and exchangeable bases and Al texture are important predictors in low-fertility soils. We suggest that Asteraceae could be a model family for conservation planning in other countries and regions because it is particularly well represented in open and montane areas of the Neotropics in general. in Portuguese is available with online material.

AB  - As native ecosystems are degraded throughout the world, the importance of managing, conserving, and restoring wildlife habitat escalates. We must carefully consider which approach to habitat conservation is optimal, given that resources for habitat conservation are limited. One enticing option involves channeling limited resources to manage for a single umbrella species, assuming that a number of other species within the same ecosystem would also benefit. The danger inherent to this approach is that care must be taken when selecting an umbrella species that maximizes ecosystem-wide benefits. This paper presents a combination of methods to quantitatively evaluate if keystone species, given their integral role in affecting the ecosystem where they reside, can also function as effective umbrellas for habitat management. In a case study, we evaluate two imperiled keystone species, the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) and the red-cockaded woodpecker (Leucontopicus borealis), within a global biodiversity hotspot, the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem of North American coastal plain. We 1) develop spatial habitat models in MaxEnt for 10 terrestrial vertebrate wildlife species of conservation interest across an 11 million hectare region, 2) identify the preferred umbrella candidate with spatially-explicit correlation and range overlap analyses using ENMTools, and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen umbrella species with a testof niche similarity and quantitative habitat suitability comparisons in ArcGIS. Our results suggest the potential for an endemic keystone species to effectively function as an umbrella species. Specifically, we identified the gopher tortoise as the preferred umbrella, given the overlap in suitable habitat for 9 of 10 species evaluated in this ecosystem. These results are significant for habitat management within this region, but most importantly, this application of spatially-explicit modeling to quantitatively measure habitat suitability is an advance in approaches to habitat conservation planning. We encourage others to use these accessible methods and consider evaluating keystone species as umbrellas to optimize their approach for managing, conserving, and restoring ecosystems.

AB  - We investigated the impact of past changes in habitat suitability on the current patterns of genetic diversity of two southern beeches (Nothofagus nervosa and Nothofagus obliqua) in their eastern fragmented range in Patagonian Argentina, and model likely future threats to their population genetic structure. Our goal was to develop a spatially-explicit strategy for guiding conservation and management interventions in light of climate change. We combined suitability modelling under current, past (Last Glacial Maximum similar to 21,000 BP), and future (2050s) climatic conditions with genetic characterization data based on chloroplast DNA, isozymes, and microsatellites. We show the complementary usefulness of the distribution of chloroplast haplotypes and locally common allelic richness calculated from microsatellite data for identifying the locations of putative glacial refugia. Our findings suggest that contemporary hotspots of genetic diversity correspond to convergence zones of different expansion routes, most likely as a consequence of admixture processes. Future suitability predictions suggest that climate change might differentially affect both species. All genetically most diverse populations of N. nervosa and several of N. obliqua are located in areas that may be most severely impacted by climate change, calling for forward-looking conservation interventions. We propose a practical spatially-explicit strategy to target conservation interventions distinguishing priority populations for (1) in situ conservation (hotspots of genetic diversity likely to remain suitable under climate change), (2) ex situ conservation in areas where high genetic diversity overlaps with high likelihood of drastic climate change, (3) vulnerable populations (areas expected to be negatively affected by climate change), and (4) potential expansion areas under climate change.

AB  - Knowledge of abundance, trends and distribution of cetacean populations is needed to inform marine conservation efforts, ecosystem models and spatial planning. We compiled a geo-spatial database of published data on cetacean abundance from dedicated visual line-transect surveys and encoded >1100 abundance estimates for 47 species from 430 surveys conducted worldwide from 1975-2005. Our subsequent analyses revealed large spatial, temporal and taxonomic variability and gaps in survey coverage. With the exception of Antarctic waters, survey coverage was biased toward the northern hemisphere, especially US and northern European waters. Overall, <25% of the world's ocean surface was surveyed and only 6% had been covered frequently enough (>= 5 times) to allow trend estimation. Almost half the global survey effort, defined as total area (km(2)) covered by all survey study areas across time, was concentrated in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Neither the number of surveys conducted nor the survey effort had increased in recent years. Across species, an average of 10% of a species' predicted range had been covered by at least one survey, but there was considerable variation among species. With the exception of three delphinid species, <1% of all species' ranges had been covered frequently enough for trend analysis. Sperm whales emerged from our analyses as a relatively data-rich species. This is a notoriously difficult species to survey visually, and we use this as an example to illustrate the challenges of using available data from line-transect surveys for the detection of trends or for spatial planning. We propose field and analytical methods to fill in data gaps to improve cetacean conservation efforts.

AB  - Understanding and predicting animal distribution is one of the most elementary objectives in ecology and conservation biology. Various environmental factors, such as habitat area, habitat quality, and climatic factors, play important roles in shaping animal distribution. However, the mechanism underlying animal distribution remains unclear. Using generalized additive mixed models, we analyzed the effects of environmental factors and years on the population of five Anatidae species: Tundra swan, swan goose, bean goose, greater and lesser white-fronted goose, across their wintering grounds along the Middle and Lower Yangtze River floodplain (MLYRF) during 2001-2016. We found that: (1) All populations decreased except for that of the bean goose. (2) The patch area was not included in any of the best models. (3) NDVI was the most important factor in determining the abundance of grazing geese. (4) Climatic factors had no significant effect on the species in question. Our results suggest that, when compared to habitat area, habitat quality is better in predicting Anatidae distribution on the basin scale. Thus, to better conserve wintering Anatidae, we should keep a sufficiently large area at the single lake, as well as high quality habitat over the whole basin. This might be achieved by developing a more strategic water plan for the MLYRF.

AB  - The effects of climate change on species can influence the delicate balance in ecosystems. For this reason, conservation planning needs to take account of connectivity and the related ecological processes within the framework of climate change. In this study, we focus on the change in the ecological connectivity of the Lebanon cedar (Cedrus libani A. Rich.), which is widely distributed in the Mediterranean, particularly in the Amanus and Taurus Mountains. To this end, we evaluated the changes in spatial units providing connectivity in the potential and future distributions of the species through ecological niche modelling, morphological spatial pattern analysis, and landscape metrics. The results suggest that the species is moving to the northeast. According to the future projections, we predict that the potential habitat suitability of the species will shrink significantly and that, in the case of pessimistic scenarios, the extent of the suitable habitats will decrease, particularly in the western and central Taurus Mountain chains. A comparison of potential and future cores indicates that there will be a slight increase under the RCP 4.5 2050 scenario, whereas core areas will decrease in the RCP 4.5 2070, RCP 8.5 2050, and RCP 8.5 2070 scenarios. In addition, it is predicted that bridges would increase in the RCP 4.5 2070 and RCP 8.5 2050 scenarios but decrease in other scenarios.

AB  - To facilitate conservation planning, there is a need for improved confidence in forecasts of climate change impacts on species distributions. Towards that end, there have been calls for the development of process-based models to test hypotheses concerning the mechanisms by which temperature shapes distribution and to corroborate forecasts of correlative models. Models of temperature-dependent growth (TDG) were developed for two Australian riverine blackfishes with disjunct longitudinal distributions:Gadopsis marmoratus(occupies lower, warmer elevations) andGadopsis bispinosus(occupies higher, cooler elevations). The models were used to (a) predict blackfish monthly and annual growth dynamics under current and future climate scenarios within different elevation bands of their current distribution, and (b) test the hypothesis that, under the current climate, the distributions of each species would be positively correlated with predicted TDG. Increases in mean annual growth were forecast for both species under all warming scenarios, across all elevation bands. Both species currently occupy annual habitat temperatures below those optimal for growth. Under certain warming scenarios, the predicted increases in annual growth belie forecasts of within-year dynamics that may interact with the phenology of blackfish to impair recruitment. There was not a significant positive linear relationship between predicted TDG and observed abundance among river segments for either species. Both species were strongly under-represented where annual growth rates were forecast to be optimal and over-represented where growth rates were forecast to be intermediate. Confidence in forecasts of climate change impacts based on correlative models will increase when those forecasts are consistent with a mechanistic understanding of how specific drivers (e.g. water temperature) affect processes (e.g. growth). This process-based study revealed surprises concerning how future climates may affect fish growth dynamics, showing that although the blackfish distributions are correlated with temperature the temperature-dependent mechanisms underpinning that correlation require further investigation.

AB  - The Comoro Islands are a hotspot of endemicity and are of global conservation importance. However, despite rapid and ongoing loss of the remaining natural forest habitats, no terrestrial protected areas have been established. Here, we investigate the distribution patterns of birds and butterflies on the island of Anjouan to identify areas important for the persistence of endemic species. Two components of the bird and butterfly communities were investigated: species richness (alpha-diversity) and community dissimilarity (beta-diversity). We recorded the community composition of each taxon at multiple sites and modelled species richness as a function of seven environmental predictors. Endemic bird richness was greatest in mature forest at high altitudes whereas endemic butterfly richness peaked at mid-altitudes in disturbed forest. There was low cross-taxon congruence between areas with high endemic richness: less than 2% of the island represented areas of overlap between endemic bird and butterfly diversity hotspots. Richness of both non-endemic birds and non-endemic butterflies was highest in non-forest habitats. Using Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling, we found a strong distinction between mid and high altitude communities for butterflies, and between forest and non-forest communities for birds, although butterflies exhibited higher beta-diversity than birds. Our data represent the first description of the distributions of taxa of any kind for Anjouan, and will be used to inform current plans to implement the country's first terrestrial protected area.

AB  - In the coming century, anthropogenic climate change will threaten the persistence of restricted endemic species, complicating conservation planning. Although most efforts to quantify potential shifts in species' ranges use global climate model (GCM) output, regional climate model (RCM) output may be better suited to predicting shifts by restricted species, particularly in regions with complex topography or other regionally important climate-forcing factors. Using a RCM-based future climate scenario, we found that potential ranges of two California endemic oaks, Quercus douglasii and Quercus lobata, shrink considerably (to 59% and 54% of modern potential range sizes, respectively) and shift northward. This result is markedly different from that obtained by using a comparable GCM-based scenario, under which these species retain 81% and 73% of their modern potential range sizes, respectively. The difference between RCM- and GCM-based scenarios is due to greater warming and larger precipitation decreases during the growing season predicted by the RCM in these species' potential ranges. Based on the modeled regional climate change, < 50% of protected land area currently containing these species is expected to contain them under a future midrange "business-as-usual" path of greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Aim Common species contribute more to species richness patterns (SRPs) than rare species in most studies. Our aim was to test this hypothesis using a novel model system, species living exclusively in subterranean habitats. They consist of mainly rare species (small ranges), only a few of them being common (large ranges), and challenge whether rare species are less important for the development of SRPs in this environment. We separately analyzed aquatic and terrestrial species. Location Western Balkans in southeastern Europe. Methods We assembled two datasets comprising 431 beetle and 145 amphipod species, representing the model groups of subterranean terrestrial and aquatic diversity, respectively. We assessed the importance of rare and common species using the stepwise reconstruction of SRPs and subsequent correlation analyses, corrected also for the cumulative information content of the subsets based on species prevalence. We applied generalized linear regression models to evaluate the importance of rare and common species in forming SRPs. Additionally, we analyzed the contribution of rare and common species in species-rich cells. Results Patterns of subterranean aquatic and terrestrial species richness overlapped only weakly, with aquatic species having larger ranges than terrestrial ones. Our analyses supported higher importance of common species for forming overall SRPs in both beetles and amphipods. However, in stepwise analysis corrected for information content, results were ambiguous. Common species presented a higher proportion of species than rare species in species-rich cells. Main Conclusion We have shown that even in habitats with the domination of rare species, it is still common species that drive SRPs. This may be due to an even spatial distribution of rare species or spatial mismatch in hotspots of rare and common species. SRPs of aquatic and terrestrial subterranean organisms overlap very little, so the conservation approaches need to be habitat specific.

AB  - With the expansion of urban areas, promoting urban biodiversity is now a priority. Many municipalities are implementing greening strategies to improve and increase green space within city boundaries. The effectiveness of these strategies, while rarely assessed, likely depends on the landscape and on relevant species intrinsic traits such as dispersal ability. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we evaluated the effect of the urban landscape on the projected distribution of three butterfly species with contrasting dispersal abilities, and assessed the effectiveness of the Barcelona greening strategy as a case study. Species distribution (in terms of patch occupancy) and effectiveness (in terms of population size and number of occupied gardens) were analysed using generalised linear models. The percentage of (semi) natural source area around each urban green space (garden hereafter) was the most important variable for the distribution of all three types of species, followed by the percentage of neighbouring gardens and by the garden carrying capacity, although the effect of neighbouring gardens was negative in the early phase of colonisation. The planned Barcelona greening strategy increased the number of gardens occupied by high and medium, but not by low dispersive species. Increasing the carrying capacity of the gardens improved colonisation for all three species types. While the best strategies can be context dependent, our results indicated that increasing garden area might be more effective in the long term but it can be overridden by garden capacity in the short term, especially if there are constraints to increasing garden area.

AB  - Conservation planners need reliable information on spatial patterns of biodiversity. However, existing data sets are skewed because some ecosystems, taxa, and locations are underrepresented. We determined how many articles have been published in recent decades on the biodiversity of different countries and their constituent provinces. We searched the Web of Science catalogues Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for biodiversity-related articles published from 1993 to 2016 that included country and province names. We combined data on research publication frequency with other provincial-scale factors hypothesized to affect the likelihood of research activity (i.e., economic development, human presence, infrastructure, and remoteness). Areas that appeared understudied relative to the biodiversity expected based on site climate likely have been inaccessible to researchers for reasons, notably armed conflict. Geographic publication bias is of most concern in the most remote areas of sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Our provincial-scale model may help compensate for publication biases in conservation planning by revealing the spatial extent of research needs and the low cost of redoing this analysis annually.

AB  - Urbanization deletes and degrades natural ecosystems, threatens biodiversity, and alienates people from the experience of nature. Nature-based solutions (NbS) that are inspired and supported by nature have the potential to deliver multifunctional environmental and social benefits to address these challenges in urban areas under context-specific conditions. NbS implementation often relies on a one-size-fits-all approach, although interventions that maximize one benefit (e.g., biodiversity conservation) may have no influence on, or even negatively affect, others (e.g., social justice). Furthermore, the current pathways from NbS to various benefits do not rely on a deep understanding of the underlying processes, prohibiting the identification of optimal solutions that maximize synergies across pathways. We present a comprehensive socio-ecological framework that addresses these issues by recognizing that cities are human-dominated environments that are foremost built and maintained to support humans. Our framework demonstrates how we can use experiments and niche species models to understand and predict where species will be and where people will be healthy and happy in a comparable manner. This knowledge can then be integrated into decision support tools that use optimization algorithms to understand trade-offs, identify synergies, and provide planners with the tools needed to tailor context-specific NbS to yield greener, more resilient cities with happier people and reduced inequality.

AB  - Understanding spatial distribution, habitat use, and temporal activity patterns is important for species conservation planning. This information especially is crucial for mega herbivores like elephants as their ranging patterns encompass a myriad of habitats types. Churia habitat is geological fragile yet important for wildlife in Nepal and India. We used camera trapping and sign surveys covering 536 km(2) of Churia and surrounding areas within Chitwan National Park. Across 152 trapping locations, we accumulated 2,097 trap nights in a 60-day survey during the winter season of 2010-11. We used a non-parametric kernel density function to analyze winter activity patterns of elephants detected in camera-traps. Additionally, we walked 643 km over 76 grid cells in two surveys (winter and summer) to estimate elephant distribution and intensity of habitat use using an occupancy framework. Multi-season models allowed us to make seasonal (winter versus summer) inferences regarding changes in habitat use based on covariates influencing use and detection. We photographed 25 mammalian species including elephants with calves with a trapping rate of 2.72 elephant photos events per 100 trap nights. Elephant winter activity pattern was found to be mainly nocturnal, with crepuscular peaks. Covariates such as normalized differential vegetation index and terrain ruggedness positively influenced elephant spatial distribution and habitat use patterns within the Churia habitat. We also found lower elephant habitat use ((Psi) over cap SE((Psi) over cap)) of Churia in winter 0.51 (0.02) than in summer 0.57 (0.02). Elephants heavily used the eastern portion of Churia in both seasons (67-69%). Overall, Churia habitat, which is often ignored, clearly is used by elephants, with increases in summer use in the west and high use year-round in the east, and thus should no longer be neglected or forgotten in species conservation planning.

AB  - During recent years, predictive modelling techniques have been increasingly used to identify regional patterns of species spatial occurrence, to explore species-habitat relationships and to aid in biodiversity conservation. In the case of birds, predictive modelling has been mainly applied to the study of species with little variable interannual patterns of spatial occurrence (e.g. year-round resident species or migratory species in their breeding grounds showing territorial behaviour). We used predictive models to analyse the factors that determine broad-scale patterns of occurrence and abundance of wintering Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsoni). This species has been the focus of field monitoring in its wintering ground in Argentina due to massive pesticide poisoning of thousands of individuals during the 1990s, but its unpredictable pattern of spatial distribution and the uncertainty about the current wintering area occupied by hawks led to discontinuing such field monitoring. Data on the presence and abundance of hawks were recorded in 30 x 30 km squares (n = 115) surveyed during three austral summers (2001-03). Sixteen land-use/land-cover, topography, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) variables were used as predictors to build generalized additive models (GAMs). Both occurrence and abundance models showed a good predictive ability. Land use, altitude, and NDVI during spring previous to the arrival of hawks to wintering areas were good predictors of the distribution of Swainson's hawks in the Argentine pampas, but only land use and NDVI were entered into the model of abundance of the species in the region. The predictive cartography developed from the models allowed us to identify the current wintering area of Swainson's hawks in the Argentine pampas. The highest occurrence probability and relative abundances for the species were predicted for a broad area of south-eastern pampas that has been overlooked so far and where neither field research nor conservation efforts aiming to prevent massive mortalities has been established.

AB  - Threatened and endangered species are more vulnerable to climate change due to small population and specific geographical distribution. Therefore, identifying and incorporating the biological processes underlying a species' adaptation to its environment are important for determining whether they can persist insitu. Correlative models are widely used to predict species' distribution changes, but generally fail to capture the buffering capacity of organisms. Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) live in topographically complex mountains and are known to avoid heat stress. Although many studies have found that climate change will lead to severe habitat loss and threaten previous conservation efforts, the mechanisms underlying panda's responses to climate change have not been explored. Here, we present a case study in Daxiangling Mountains, one of the six Mountain Systems that giant panda distributes. We used a mechanistic model, Niche Mapper, to explore what are likely panda habitat response to climate change taking physiological, behavioral and ecological responses into account, through which we map panda's climatic suitable activity area (SAA) for the first time. We combined SAA with bamboo forest distribution to yield highly suitable habitat (HSH) and seasonal suitable habitat (SSH), and their temporal dynamics under climate change were predicted. In general, SAA in the hottest month (July) would reduce 11.7%-52.2% by 2070, which is more moderate than predicted bamboo habitat loss (45.6%-86.9%). Limited by the availability of bamboo and forest, panda's suitable habitat loss increases, and only 15.5%-68.8% of current HSH would remain in 2070. Our method of mechanistic modeling can help to distinguish whether habitat loss is caused by thermal environmental deterioration or food loss under climate change. Furthermore, mechanistic models can produce robust predictions by incorporating ecophysiological feedbacks and minimizing extrapolation into novel environments. We suggest that a mechanistic approach should be incorporated into distribution predictions and conservation planning.

AB  - Research dedicated to rare endemic plants is usually focused on one given aspect. However, holistic studies, addressing several key issues, might be more useful, supporting management programmes while unravelling basic knowledge about ecological and population-level processes. A more comprehensive approach to research is proposed, encompassing: phylogenetics/systematics, pollination biology and seed dispersal, propagation, population genetics, species distribution models (SDMs), threats and monitoring. We present a holistic study dedicated to Veronica dabneyi Hochst. ex Seub., an endangered chamaephyte endemic to the Azores. Veronica dabneyi was mainly found associated with other endemic taxa; however, invasive plants were also present and together with introduced cattle, goats and rabbits are a major threat. Most populations grow at somewhat rocky and steep locations that appeared to work as refuges. Seed set in the wild was generally high and recruitment of young plants from seed seemed to be frequent. In the laboratory, it was possible to germinate and fully develop V. dabneyi seedlings, which were planted at their site of origin. No dormancy was detected and time for 50 % germination was affected by incubation temperature. Eight new microsatellite markers were applied to 72 individuals from 7 sites. A considerable degree of admixture was found between samples from the two islands Flores and Corvo, with 98 % of the genetic variability allocated within populations. Levels of heterozygosity were high and no evidence of inbreeding was found. Species distribution models based on climatic and topographic variables allowed the estimation of the potential distribution of V. dabneyi on Flores and Corvo using ecological niche factor analysis and Maxent. The inclusion of land-use variables only slightly increased the information explained by the models. Projection of the expected habitat in Faial largely coincided with the only historic record of V. dabneyi on that island. This research could be the basis for the design of a recovery plan, showing the pertinence of more holistic research approaches to plant conservation.

AB  - This study was designed to examine the entire species description process of limnoterrestrial tardigrades up until the present, and to establish the effects of several variables on this process. Information from monographs, revisions and published papers related to limnoterrestrial tardigrades was assessed using generalized linear models (GLM) and variance partition. Our findings reveal the tardigrade species description process fails to show an asymptotic tendency. That is, at the current description rate, we will not get to know all the species in the short- or mid-term. The variables examined served to explain about half of the process variance. Species distribution areas and variables related to their presence in each region were the factors found to have the greatest explanatory capacity. Our analysis indicates that insufficient efforts have been invested in the tardigrades compared to other invertebrates (such as Insecta: Coleoptera), and that there is a need for more taxonomists and more extensive sampling areas. Studies such as this will be useful for planning future species sampling campaigns, and help us to improve our methodological approach to investigations aimed at conservation and the preservation of biodiversity.

AB  - Tropical forests are facing constant degradation and destruction as a result of multiple threats, mostly from land use, and increasingly from climate change. Understanding the effects of these threats, and the role of Protected Areas in buffering their impacts, is becoming an essential task to prevent the loss of species. In this study, we used the woolly monkey, a keystone species with seed dispersal functions, as a surrogate to assess the future conservation potential of the Protected Areas in Colombia, a megadiverse country where important tropical forests remain. We modelled the ecological niche of the woolly monkey using an ensemble forecasting approach to assess potential distribution changes resulting from climate change and deforestation. Distribution changes in 2050 were estimated for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), three Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and one deforestation projection. Additionally, we evaluated the current and future suitable area for the species located within Protected Areas. For the year 2016, we estimated a potential distribution area for the woolly monkey of 413,533 km2 after accounting for deforestation. The future synergistic effect of climate change and deforestation could cause a reduction of up to-13 % in the species potential distribution in Colombia, mainly in the Andean-Amazonian foothills and the Amazon region. The distribution area lost due to climate change was exceeded by losses due to deforestation in all scenarios, where up to 65,356 km(2) could be lost as a result of forest clearance. The current Protected Area system will not be able to mitigate the impacts of climate and land-use changes, since-26 % of the woolly monkey's range is currently located within National Parks and Indigenous Reserves. This range could decrease by-18 % in the most drastic future scenario. Based on these results, we emphasize the need of an integrated approach of land-use planning that encompasses the creation, expansion and connectivity of Protected Areas, along with the strengthening of law enforcement capacity and restoration efforts to halt increasing deforestation. The effective implementation of these strategies is necessary to assist species to track their suitable climatic conditions, especially through the Andean-Amazonian foothills, and will contribute to the conservation of tropical biodiversity.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are statistical tools used to develop continuous predictions of species occurrence. 'Integrated SDMs' (ISDMs) are an elaboration of this approach with potential advantages that allow for the dual use of opportunistically collected presence-only data and site-occupancy data from planned surveys. These models also account for survey bias and imperfect detection through the use of a hierarchical modelling framework that separately estimates the species-environment response and detection process. This is particularly helpful for conservation applications and predictions for rare species, where data are often limited and prediction errors may have significant management consequences. Despite this potential importance, ISDMs remain largely untested under a variety of scenarios. We performed an exploration of key modelling decisions and assumptions on an ISDM using the endangered Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) as a test species. We found that site area had the strongest effect on the magnitude of population estimates and underlying intensity surface and was driven by estimates of model intercepts. Selecting a site area that accounted for the individual movements of the species within an average home range led to population estimates that coincided with expert estimates. ISDMs that do not account for the individual movements of species will likely lead to less accurate estimates of species intensity (number of individuals per unit area) and thus overall population estimates. This bias could be severe and highly detrimental to conservation actions if uninformed ISDMs are used to estimate global populations of threatened and data-deficient species, particularly those that lack natural history and movement information. However, the ISDM was consistently the most accurate model compared to other approaches, which demonstrates the importance of this new modelling framework and the ability to combine opportunistic data with systematic survey data. Thus, we recommend researchers use ISDMs with conservative movement information when estimating population sizes of rare and data-deficient species. ISDMs could be improved by using a similar parameterization to spatial capture-recapture models that explicitly incorporate animal movement as a model parameter, which would further remove the need for spatial subsampling prior to implementation.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has caused drastic changes in urban ecosystems, resulting in various urgent management needs from mitigating biodiversity loss to preventing human-wildlife conflicts. Using species distribution modeling to understand urban species??? distributional patterns and predict their future changes is thus important to support decision-making. Raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) that previously inhabited Shanghai had been extirpated from the metropolitan area but recently returned to and expanded in almost all districts, causing hundreds of human-raccoon dog conflicts. In this study, we initiated a citizen science project, identified factors associated with raccoon dog habitat selection, and predicted its current suitable habitat as well as potential future ranges under different city development scenarios. By constructing an ensemble modeling using data from camera trap surveys, interviews and rescuing records, we found that raccoon dog distribution was positively associated with several anthropogenic factors including nighttime light, human population, and percentage area of buildings. We predicted a 156,024 ha suitable habitat for raccoon dogs throughout Shanghai, among which only 5,811 ha (3.72 %) was currently occupied. Our results indicated considerable potential of raccoon dogs??? future expansion, which had been consistently ignored in previous management plans. To alleviate the increasing human-raccoon dog conflicts, we found strategies to slow down raccoon dog movement effective tools, and suggest adaptive management to provide fast response and flexible solutions. This is the first study to investigate human-wildlife conflict in China???s urban environment, and our approach has substantial implications for Shanghai as well as other regions where urban species are undergoing rapid expansion.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are often considered the most important biodiversity conservation areas in national plans, but PAs often do not represent national-scale biodiversity. We evaluate the current conservation status of plant biodiversity within current existing PAs, and identify potential additional PAs for South Korea. We modeled species ranges for 2,297 plant species using Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and compared the level of mean range representation in South Korea's existing PAs, which comprise 5.7% of the country's mainland area, with an equal-area alternative PA strategy selected with the reserve algorithm Marxan. We also used Marxan to model two additional conservation scenarios that add lands to approach the Aichi Biodiversity Target objectives (17% of the country). Existing PAs in South Korea contain an average of 6.3% of each plant species' range, compared to 5.9% in the modeled equal-area alternative. However, existing PAs primarily represent a high percentage of the ranges for high-elevation and small range size species. The additional PAs scenario that adds lands to the existing PAs covers 14,587.55 km(2), and would improve overall plant range representation to a mean of 16.8% of every species' range. The other additional PAs scenario, which selects new PAs from all lands and covers 13,197.35 km(2), would improve overall plant range representation to a mean of 13.5%. Even though the additional PAs that includes existing PAs represents higher percentages of species' ranges, it is missing many biodiversity hotspots in non-mountainous areas and the additional PAs without locking in the existing PAs represent almost all species' ranges evenly, including low-elevation ones with larger ranges. Some priority conservation areas we identified are expansions of, or near, existing PAs, especially in northeastern and southern South Korea. However, lowland coastal areas and areas surrounding the capital city, Seoul, are also critical for biodiversity conservation in South Korea.

AB  - Climate change is affecting the spatio-temporal distribution of environmental conditions, forcing species to shift their range in response. Species not capable of dispersing naturally may benefit from conservation translocations. A key aspect of translocation planning is release site selection: under the 2012 IUCN guidelines for reintroductions and other conservation translocations, selected sites are expected to match the biotic and abiotic needs of the candidate species now and in the future. Here we present a methodological framework to identify optimal translocation sites under climate change. Our method is the first to explicitly combine statistical and predictive population modelling to understand the relationship between climate, climate change and population dynamics, in order to perform robust habitat suitability analyses for conservation decision-making. We use the hihi Notiomystis cincta, a bird endemic to New Zealand, as a case study. We focus on the population of Tiritiri Matangi Island, which has been provided with ad libitum supplementary food since 1996. This offers the unique opportunity to study the direct impact of climate and future change in climatic conditions on a population free of confounding constraints. Climate is found to drive hihi population dynamics, even though they are not limited by the availability of food. Thus, despite the current management of the species, climate change remains a major threat to its long-term persistence. Moreover, under predicted climate change for the country, hihi suitable habitat will shift southward: the two current largest hihi populations will face unsuitable climatic conditions in the coming decades, and habitat that was not part of the species' historical range may become suitable.Synthesis and applications. Assisted colonization is increasingly being considered as an adaptation tool for species threatened by climate change. Justifying the use of this extreme conservation action, however, requires robust evidence that it is necessary and clear guidance on where to translocate individuals of threatened populations. We show how both requirements can be met using habitat suitability modelling if knowledge of the relationship between climate, climate change and the species' population dynamics is systematically used to guide the modelling process.

AB  - The success of marine spatial management and, in particular, the zonation of marine protected areas (MPAs), largely depends on the good understanding of species' distribution and habitat preferences. Yet, detailed knowledge of fish abundance is often reduced to a few sampled locations and a reliable prediction of this information across broader geographical areas is of major relevance. Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to describe species-environment relationships and identify environmental parameters that determine the abundance or presence-absence of 11 reef fishes with contrasting life histories in shallow habitats of the Azores islands, Northeast Atlantic. Predictive models were mapped and visualised in a geographic information system (GIS) and areas with potential single or multi-species habitat hotspots were identified. Schooling, pelagic species typically required presence-absence models, whereas abundance models performed well for benthic species. Depth and distance to sediment significantly described the distribution for nearly all species, whereas the influence of exposure to swell or currents and slope of the seafloor depended on their trophic ecology. Potential presence of single species was widespread across the study area but much reduced for multiple species. There were no habitats shared by high abundances of all species in a given trophic group, and areas shared by minimal abundances were smaller than expected. Potential habitat hotspots should be considered as priority sites for conservation, but were only partially included in the existing MPA network. These findings highlight the potential of this methodology to support scientifically sound conservation planning, including but not restricted to fragmented and constrained habitats, such as those of oceanic archipelagos.

AB  - Understanding metapopulation dynamics is critical for effective species conservation, but they are not always considered for marine species due to difficulties in assessing connectivity in marine environments. This is particularly true for species that are rare or threatened, as demographic and life history data are usually sparse. We employ Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) to assess metapopulation dynamics and inform spatial management measures for the Atlantic Mud Piddock (AMP; Barnea truncata), a poorly studied and threatened marine bivalve mollusk in Canada, whose distribution in the country is limited to a single population in the Minas Basin, Nova Scotia. In a series of simulations designed to account for uncertainty in biological attributes of AMP, we identified that sub-populations along the southern coastline of the Minas Basin were the most strongly connected to other sub-populations by acting as the greatest sources and sinks of simulated larvae. Propagules released from the Minas Basin dispersed as far as the US coast of the Gulf of Maine, which harbors the closest known population of AMP outside of the Minas Basin. However, there was no exchange of larvae in the opposite direction, from the US population of AMP in the Gulf of Maine to the Minas Basin. These results suggest that sub-populations in the Minas Basin are self-sustaining (i.e., sub-populations that exchange larvae and ultimately act as a meta-population), supporting the need to protect critical source sites along the southern coastline for the regional persistence of this species. More generally, these results show how LPT outputs can be directly applied to conservation planning, and used to identify key knowledge gaps to address with future work to reduce uncertainty in model predictions.

AB  - Primary freshwater crabs represent a culturally and ecologically significant component of freshwater habitats globally that has a high percentage of threatened species. Invasive species (especially non-indigenous crayfish) and climate change are not only important standalone threats, but are also expected to compound existing threats (e.g., habitat loss/modification, pollution) and challenge the long-term survival of these decapod crustaceans. This study illustrates the importance of considering these two emerging and growing threats in conservation or management strategies by quantifying (via species distribution models) the individual and aggregated risks of these threats in Southeast Asia, a region with the highest diversity of primary freshwater crabs and a high proportion of imperiled species. Results predicted that most species of crabs (82.1%) will co-occur (and hence interact) with invasive crayfish to a moderate to high degree, and most species (69.2%) will also experience a reduction in suitable climate conditions in the future. In terms of aggregated risk, the results also predict an increased overlap between invasive crayfish and native crabs for three out of the seven species analyzed (namely Procambarus virginalis, Cherax destructor and Orconectes rusticus). Findings from this study provide a quantitatively derived rationale for the development of adaptive regulations and conservation plans in the region to minimize the risk of invasive species in a cost-effective way, thereby enabling the protection of Southeast Asia's natural heritage and its vital ecosystem services.

AB  - In Chinese and South-east Asian waters, the coastal and estuarine environments are important habitats for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis). Coastal and estuarine maritime engineering (CEME), including land reclamation, embankment or shoreline armouring, harbour construction and marine farming, permanently changes coastal environments and threatens the long-term persistence of marine biota and ecosystems. Such impacts on humpback dolphin viability, however, are rarely discussed. Likely core habitat of the humpback dolphin was extrapolated based on present understanding of habitat characteristics, which is much narrower than present data describing the species' range. Some uninvestigated habitats near densely populated landscapes may be prone to intense CEME impacts. CEME impacts compromise humpback dolphin survival through habitat loss, population fragmentation, alteration of ecological regimes and deterioration of ecosystem functionality. A 30% loss of core habitat can catastrophically reduce the population viability of this species. The best strategy to avoid CEME impacts on humpback dolphin viability is to adopt a conservative planning regime from the outset. To inform habitat protection planning, current and past habitat configuration and habitat characteristics of the humpback dolphin can be clarified by systematically designed surveys, local ecological knowledge investigation, long-term satellite remote-sensing data and species distribution modelling exercises. Sound habitat protection planning includes mapping hierarchical marine protected area (MPA) networks using spatial planning algorithms and carefully examining CEME impacts from an ecosystem perspective. To prevent inappropriate CEME planning, the inclusion of citizen science, local community participation, marine environmental education and effective information delivery is proposed. Questions relating to the proposed areas of habitat loss, the extent of environmental change and the status of population-habitat viability under the scenario of CEME impacts are proposed in order to examine and re-examine the environmental impacts of any CEME project.

AB  - Conservation efforts must be evidence-based, so rapid and economically feasible methods should be used to quantify diversity and distribution patterns. We have attempted to overcome current impediments to the gathering of biodiversity data by using integrative phylogenomic and three mtDNA fragment analyses. As a model, we sequenced the Metriorrhynchini beetle fauna, sampled from similar to 700 localities in three continents. The species-rich dataset included similar to 6500 terminals, similar to 1850 putative species delimited at 5% uncorrected pairwise threshold, possibly similar to 1000 of them unknown to science. Neither type of data could alone answer our questions on biodiversity and phylogeny. The phylogenomic backbone enabled the integrative delimitation of robustly defined natural genus-group units that will inform future research. Using constrained mtDNA analysis, we identified the spatial structure of species diversity, very high species-level endemism, and a biodiversity hotspot in New Guinea. We suggest that focused field research and subsequent laboratory and bioinformatic workflow steps would substantially accelerate the inventorying of any hyperdiverse tropical group with several thousand species. The outcome would be a scaffold for the incorporation of further data from environmental sequencing and ecological studies. The database of sequences could set a benchmark for the spatiotemporal evaluation of biodiversity, would support evidence-based conservation planning, and would provide a rob ust framework for systematic, biogeographic, and evolutionary studies.

AB  - Conservation planning in estuaries has lagged behind that in terrestrial and marine areas, despite these valuable ecosystems being among the most degraded. The core of any such approach is a reliable habitat classification and inventory of target biota. These data, and particularly the latter, are often lacking at the local-regional scales most relevant to estuarine management. This study presents a quantitative approach for predicting the likely fish and benthic invertebrate assemblages at any unsampled estuarine site using readily-obtainable and enduring biophysical attributes. We apply this scheme to an urbanised estuary and predict the above faunas throughout its entire nearshore zone. These data are then used to systematically design an exploratory spatially-efficient reserve that meets representation targets for numerous faunal conservation features, and test the ability of an existing, unsystematically-derived Marine Park to do the same.
   Spatial patterns in the enduring biophysical attributes of local-scale habitats provided good to excellent surrogates for those in the fish and invertebrate faunas. All unsampled sites were then successfully assigned to their respective habitat and correlated fauna using biophysical measurements and a predictive decision tree. The resultant spatially-continuous 'faunal map' enabled quantification of 67 conservation features, from which reserves aimed at representing 10-30% of each feature were systematically derived. All reserves were highly efficient and almost always met representation targets, contrasting with the existing Marine Park which underrepresented 40-80% of features. Reserve designs were, however, spread throughout the system, highlighting the complexities in designing representative reserves for estuarine environments that capture their spatiotemporal diversity.

AB  - Global warming has negative impacts on the distribution of large ungulates, particularly for species occupying narrow distributional ranges. Knowledge of how climate change will affect future distributions is imperative for designing effective conservation action plans for at risk species such as the Himalayan gray goral (HGG), a cliff-dwelling mountainous goat. We sought to evaluate the potential distribution of Himalayan gray goral (HGG) under future climate change scenarios using ensemble modeling approaches. HGG data were obtained from previous published surveys, publications, and occurrence records ranging from 1985 to 2018. we also conducted survey in 2017-2018 using double observer method based on capture mark recapture. (Suryawanshi et al., 2012; Tumursukh et al., 2015). Later on we double check the record and remove double observation. After quality control screening, 139 records remained for analysis. Resulting species distribution models (SDMs) results showed sufficient internal evaluation metrics, with all TSS values being > 0.7. The random forest (RF) modelling technique had on average the lowest true skill statistics (TSS) value, However the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) modelling technique had the highest. The ensemble modelling internal evaluation metrics indicated adequate results with values ranging from 0.827 to 0.843. Annual mean temperature (Bio1) and annual precipitation (Bio12) were found to be the most important climatic variables impacting the potential distribution of HGG. HGG habitat determined to be suitable in both current and future climate scenarios decreased in all Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios with the exception of RCPs 2.6. Suitable habitat in both current and future climate scenarios remained consistent in the time periods of 2050 and 2070 under RCP4.5 while fluctuating in 2030, 2050 and 2070 under RCP 2.6. However, the suitable habitat under current and future scenarios declined in 2030 under RCPs 4.5 and in 2030, 2050, and 2070 in scenarios RCPs 8.5. Currently suitable HGG habitat was located in an area where the species is known to be locally extinct. Further work is necessary to determine the key drivers of local extinction events in an effort to mitigate population crashes. Our work will assist in formulating conservation actions for the HGG in the context of climate change, and provide a platform for continued monitoring efforts of the species.

AB  - 1. Regions of the world with highest biodiversity and greatest conservation needs are often simultaneously data poor. An effective surrogate strategy would be invaluable for conservation prioritization in such regions. Large-scale environmental data are readily available, but the effectiveness of environmental surrogate strategies for conservation planning has not been confirmed. In this study, we compare a range of such strategies.
   2. Environmental surrogacy is based on the idea that by covering a wide range of different environmental conditions, one also achieves high species representation. The effectiveness of this strategy may be enhanced by using community-level modelling techniques, in conjunction with best-available biological (species distribution) data, to calibrate the relationship between environmental gradients and community richness and composition. We develop a novel approach, called maximization of complementary richness, which accounts for gradients in species richness and non-constant turnover rates of community composition in environmental space.
   3. We show that our novel technique can achieve notably higher species representation than what is achieved using past approaches. Simple strategies, such as direct use of environmental data only or environmental clustering, achieved species representation only slightly better than random selection of sites. P-median selection from ordinations of community composition had intermediate performance. Performance of our new maximization of complementary richness technique was closer to the representation levels of optimal reserve networks than to random selection of sites.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We found that there are three critical components that are relevant for success: a good model for community turnover (compositional dissimilarity), a good model for species richness, and a selection procedure that appropriately utilizes both turnover and richness information. By taking these into account, one can achieve reasonable levels of species representation. We conclude that using surrogates based on community-level modelling is a highly promising strategy for cost-effective conservation prioritization.

AB  - A mosaic of intact native and human-modified vegetation use can provide important habitat for top predators such as the puma (Puma concolor), avoiding negative effects on other species and ecological processes due to cascade trophic interactions. This study investigates the effects of restoration scenarios on the puma's habitat suitability in the most developed Brazilian region (Sao Paulo State). Species Distribution Models incorporating restoration scenarios were developed using the species' occurrence information to (1) map habitat suitability of pumas in Sao Paulo State, Southeast, Brazil; (2) test the relative contribution of environmental variables ecologically relevant to the species habitat suitability and (3) project the predicted habitat suitability to future native vegetation restoration scenarios. The Maximum Entropy algorithm was used (Test AUC of 0.84 +/- 0.0228) based on seven environmental non-correlated variables and non-autocorrelated presence-only records (n = 342). The percentage of native vegetation (positive influence), elevation (positive influence) and density of roads (negative influence) were considered the most important environmental variables to the model. Model projections to restoration scenarios reflected the high positive relationship between pumas and native vegetation. These projections identified new high suitability areas for pumas (probability of presence >0.5) in highly deforested regions. High suitability areas were increased from 5.3% to 8.5% of the total State extension when the landscapes were restored for >= the minimum native vegetation cover rule (20%) established by the Brazilian Forest Code in private lands. This study highlights the importance of a landscape planning approach to improve the conservation outlook for pumas and other species, including not only the establishment and management of protected areas, but also the habitat restoration on private lands. Importantly, the results may inform environmental policies and land use planning in Sao Paulo State, Brazil.

AB  - Across North America, grassland songbirds have undergone steep population declines over recent decades, commonly attributed to agricultural intensification. Understanding the potential interactions between the impacts of climate change on the future distributions of these species and the availability of suitable vegetation for nesting can support improved risk assessments and conservation planning for this group of species. We used North American bioclimatic niche models to examine future changes in suitable breeding climate for 15 grassland songbird species at their current northern range limits along the boreal forest-prairie ecotone in Alberta, Canada. Our climate suitability projections, combined with the current distribution of native and tame pasture and cropland in Alberta, suggest that some climate-mediated range expansion of grassland songbirds in Alberta is possible. For six of the eight species projected to experience expansions of suitable climate area in Alberta, this suitable climate partly overlaps the current distribution of suitable land cover. Additionally, for more than half of the species examined, most of the area of currently suitable climate was projected to remain suitable to the end of the century, highlighting the importance of Alberta for the long-term persistence of these species. Some northern prairie-endemic species exhibited substantial projected northward shifts of both the northern and southern edges of the area of suitable climate. Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), both at-risk grassland specialists, are predicted to have limited climate stability within their current ranges, and their expansion into new areas of suitable climate may be limited by the availability of suitable land cover. Our results highlight the importance of the preservation and restoration of remaining suitable grassland habitat within areas of projected climate stability and beyond current northern range limits for the long-term persistence of many grassland songbird species in the face of climate change.

AB  - Disentangling the relative importance of different biodiversity drivers (i.e., climate, edaphic, historical factors, or human impact) to predict plant species richness at the local scale is one of the most important challenges in ecology. Biodiversity modelling is a key tool for the integration of these drivers and the predictions generated are essential, for example, for climate change forecast and conservation planning. However, the reliability of biodiversity models at the local scale remains poorly understood, especially in tropical species-rich areas, where they are required. We inventoried all woody plants with stems >= 2.5 cm in 397 plots across the Andes-Amazon gradient. We generated and mapped 19 uncorrelated biodiversity drivers at 90 m resolution, grouped into four categories: microclimatic, microtopographic, anthropic, and edaphic. In order to evaluate the importance of the different categories, we grouped biodiversity drivers into four different clusters by categories. For each of the four clusters of biodiversity drivers, we modelled the observed species richness using two statistical techniques (random forest and Bayesian inference) and two modelling procedures (including or excluding a spatial component). All the biodiversity models produced were evaluated by cross-validation. Species richness was accurately predicted by random forest (Spearman correlation up to 0.85 and explained variance up to 67%). The results suggest that precipitation and temperature are important driving forces of species richness in the region. Nonetheless, a spatial component should be considered to properly predict biodiversity. This could reflect macroevolutionary underlying forces not considered here, such as colonization time, dispersal capacities, or speciation rates. However, the proposed biodiversity modelling approach can predict accurately species richness at the local scale and detailed resolution (90 m) in tropical areas, something that previous works had found extremely challenging. The innovative methodology presented here could be employed in other areas with conservation needs.

AB  - Species distribution models are important tools to explore the effects of future global change on biodiversity. Specifically, AquaMaps, Maxent and the Sea Around Us Project algorithm are three approaches that have been applied to predict distributions of marine fishes and invertebrates. They were designed to cope with issues of data quality and quantity common in species distribution modelling, and especially pertinent to the marine environment. However, the characteristics of model projections for marine species from these different approaches have rarely been compared. Such comparisons provide information about the robustness and uncertainty of the projections, and are thus important for spatial planning and developing management and conservation strategies. Here we apply the three commonly used species distribution modelling methods for commercial fish in the North Sea and North Atlantic, with the aim of drawing comparisons between the approaches. The effect of different assumptions within each approach on the predicted current relative habitat suitability was assessed. Predicted current distributions were tested following data partitioning and selection of pseudoabsences from within a specified distance of occurrence data. As indicated by the test statistics, each modelling method produced plausible predictions of relative habitat suitability for each species, with subsequent incorporation of expert knowledge generally improving predictions. However, because of the differences between modelling algorithms, methodologies and patterns of relative suitability, comparing models using test statistics and selecting a 'best' model are not recommended. We propose that a multi-model approach should be preferred and a suite of possible predictions considered if biases due to uncertainty in data and model formulation are to be minimised.

AB  - Context Changing global environmental conditions, especially at northern latitudes, are threatening to shift species distributions and alter wildlife communities.
   Objective We aimed to establish current distributions and community arrangements of small mammals to provide important baselines for monitoring and conserving biodiversity into the future.
   Methods We used 4,408 archived museum and open-access records and the machine learning algorithm, RandomForests, to create high-resolution spatial niche models for 17 species of rodents and shrews in Alaska. Models were validated using independent trapping results from 20 locations stratified along statewide mega-transects, and an average species richness curve was calculated for field samples. Community cluster analyses (varclus) identified geographic patterns of sympatry among species. Species models were summed to create the first small-mammal species richness map for Alaska.
   Results Species richness increased logarithmically to a mean of 3.3 species per location over 1,500 trapnights. Distribution models yielded mean accuracies of 71 % (45-90 %), and maps correctly predicted a mean of 75 % (60-95 %) of occurrences correctly in the field. Top predictors included Soil Type, Eco-region, Landfire Land-cover, December Sea Ice, and July Temperature at the geographic scale. Cluster analysis delineated five community groups (3-4 species/group), and species richness was highest (11-13 species) over the Yukon-Tanana Uplands.
   Conclusions Models presented here provide spatial predictions of current small mammal biodiversity in Alaska and an initial framework for mapping and monitoring wildlife distributions across broad landscapes into the future.

AB  - Climate change is recognized as a major threat to global biodiversity and has already caused extensive regional extinction. In particular danger are the plant habitats in subalpine zones, which are more vulnerable to climate change. Evergreen coniferous trees in South Korean subalpine zones are currently designated as a species that need special care given their conservation value, but the reason for their decline and its seriousness remains unclear. This research estimates the potential land suitability (LS) of the subalpine zones in South Korea for six coniferous species vulnerable to climate change in the current time (1970-2000) and two future periods, the 2050s (2041-2060) and the 2070s (2061-2080). We analyze the ensemble-averaged loss of currently suitable habitats in the future, using nine species distribution models (SDMs). Korean arborvitae (Thuja koraiensis) and Khingan fir (Abies nephrolepis) are two species expected to experience significant habitat losses in 2050 (-59.5% under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 to -65.9% under RCP 8.5 and -56.3% under RCP 4.5 to -57.7% under RCP 8.5, respectively). High extinction risks are estimated for these species, due to the difficulty of finding other suitable habitats with high LS. The current habitat of Korean fir (Abies koreana), listed as a threatened species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, is expected to decrease by -23.9% (RCP 4.5) to -28.4% (RCP 8.5) and -36.5% (RCP 4.5) to -36.7% (RCP 8.5) in the 2050s and 2070s, respectively.

AB  - Broad-scale assessments of how climate change might impact mountain ecosystems, especially in areas of high biodiversity and endemism, are compromised by the lack of localised climate feedback in global circulation models. Here, we use regionally downscaled climate models to highlight how spatial variation in forecast change could impact rare plant distributions differentially across the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and Kenya, part of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot. Concordant with the theory that climatic stability facilitates the accumulation of rare species, we find significant positive correlations between endemic plant richness and future climatic persistence within the dispersal-limiting sky islands of this mountain archipelago. Further, we explore the hypothesis that mountain plants will move upslope in response to climate change and find that, conversely, some species are predicted to tend downslope, despite warmer annual conditions, driven by changes in seasonality and water availability. Importantly, two thirds of the modelled plant species are predicted to respond in different directions in different parts of their ranges, exemplifying the potential for individualistic responses of species and disjunct populations to environmental change, and the need for regional focus in climate change impact assessment. Conservation planners, and more broadly those charged with developing climate adaption policy, are advised to take caution in inferring local patterns of change from zoomed perspectives of broad-scale models. Moreover, a preoccupation with mean annual temperature as the principal driver of ecosystem change is misguided and could compromise efforts to make conservation plans resilient to future climate change. Faced with spatially complex and inherently uncertain future conditions, sensible priorities are to restore forest connectivity and to underpin adaption strategies with knowledge of how ecosystems and people have adapted to previous episodes of rapid change.

AB  - Habitat loss is widely regarded as one of the most destructive factors threatening native biodiversity. Because migratory waterbirds include some of the most globally endangered species, information on their sensitivity to landscape would benefit their conservation. While citizen science data on waterbird species occurrence are subjected to various biases, their appropriate interpretation can provide information of benefit to species conservation. We apply a bootstrapping procedure to citizen science data to reduce sampling biases and report the relative sensitivity of waterbird species to natural versus human-dominated landscapes. Analyses are performed on 30,491 data records for 69 waterbird species referred to five functional groups observed in China between 2000 and 2018. Of these taxa, 30 species (43.5%) are significantly associated with natural landscapes, more so for cranes, geese, and ducks than for shorebirds and herons. The relationship between land association and the threat status of waterbirds is significant when the range size of species is considered as the mediator, and the higher the land association, the higher the threat status. Sensitive species significantly associated with natural landscapes are eight times more likely to be classified as National Protected Species (NPS) Classes I or II than less sensitive species significantly associated with human-dominated landscapes. We demonstrate the potential for citizen science data to assist in conservation planning in the context of landscape changes. Our methods might assist others to obtain information to help relieve species decline and extinction.

AB  - Predictive species distributional models are a cornerstone of wildlife conservation planning. Constructing such models requires robust underpinning science that integrates formerly disparate data types to achieve effective species management. Greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus, hereafter sage-grouse' populations are declining throughout sagebrush-steppe ecosystems in North America, particularly within the Great Basin, which heightens the need for novel management tools that maximize the use of available information. Herein, we improve upon existing species distribution models by combining information about sage-grouse habitat quality, distribution and abundance from multiple data sources. To measure habitat, we created spatially explicit maps depicting habitat selection indices (HSI) informed by >35500 independent telemetry locations from >1600 sage-grouse collected over 15years across much of the Great Basin. These indices were derived from models that accounted for selection at different spatial scales and seasons. A region-wide HSI was calculated using the HSI surfaces modelled for 12 independent subregions and then demarcated into distinct habitat quality classes. We also employed a novel index to describe landscape patterns of sage-grouse abundance and space use (AUI). The AUI is a probabilistic composite of the following: (i) breeding density patterns based on the spatial configuration of breeding leks and associated trends in male attendance; and (ii) year-round patterns of space use indexed by the decreasing probability of use with increasing distance to leks. The continuous AUI surface was then reclassified into two classes representing high and low/no use and abundance.Synthesis and applications. Using the example of sage-grouse, we demonstrate how the joint application of indices of habitat selection, abundance and space use derived from multiple data sources yields a composite map that can guide effective allocation of management intensity across multiple spatial scales. As applied to sage-grouse, the composite map identifies spatially explicit management categories within sagebrush steppe that are most critical to sustaining sage-grouse populations as well as those areas where changes in land use would likely have minimal impact. Importantly, collaborative efforts among stakeholders guide which intersections of habitat selection indices and abundance and space use classes are used to define management categories. Because sage-grouse are an umbrella species, our joint-index modelling approach can help target effective conservation for other sagebrush obligate species and can be readily applied to species in other ecosystems with similar life histories, such as central-placed breeding.

AB  - Although the conversion of natural vegetation to agriculture threatens biodiversity, post-agricultural lands may provide an opportunity to preserve biodiversity if they are allowed to regenerate. We develop a framework for incorporating abandoned agricultural fields into the design of a Biosphere Reserve using former cocoa plantations on Bioko, Equatorial Guinea, as a case study. First, we used BIOCLIM to model the potential distribution of 62 ferns, 327 monocotyledons, 749 dicotyledons, seven primates, and 104 birds on Bioko. Next, we quantitatively assessed the representation of these distributions in conservation areas proposed by the Equatoguinean administration (hereafter "EPAs"). In addition, we used an area prioritization algorithm implemented in the ResNet software package to select an initial set of sites to serve as the Biosphere Reserve's core areas, that is, intact forest in Bioko's montane regions. Then, to augment the beta-diversity of the Reserve, we used the area prioritization algorithm to prioritize buffer zones in lowland sites including rainforest remnants and abandoned plantations that have partially regenerated to forest. We also compared the representation of biodiversity in the EPAs to its representation in Biosphere Reserves designed with ResNet. The representation of vegetation types and species in Reserves selected by ResNet that occupy 25% of the land on Bioko is equivalent to the representation achieved by the EPAs, which would cover 42% of Bioko. To conclude, we propose a conservation plan for Bioko. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Palms are an ecologically and societally important plant group, with high diversity in the Neotropics. Here, we estimated the impacts of future climate change on phylogenetic diversity (PD) of Neotropical palms under varying climatic and dispersal scenarios, assessed the effectiveness of the established network of protected areas (PAs) for conserving palms PD today and in 2070, and identified priority areas for the conservation of palm species and their evolutionary history in the face of climate change.
   Location Neotropics.
   Methods We used ecological niche modelling to estimate the distribution of 367 species in the present and for 2070 based on two greenhouse gas emission and two dispersal scenarios. We calculated Faith's PD within each five arc-minute grid cell to evaluate the effectiveness of PAs relative to null models and used phylogenetic spatial prioritisation analysis to detect priority areas.
   Results We found that even under the most optimistic climatic and dispersal scenarios, the established network of PAs performed poorly in safeguarding palms PD under both current conditions and those projected for 2070. Significant losses in PD inside PAs are expected under future climate conditions, especially if species are unable to disperse to suitable areas. Nevertheless, a modest and strategic increase in the number of PAs could considerably improve the protection of palms PD in the present and 2070.
   Main conclusions The PD of Neotropical palms is poorly represented within the established network of PAs, at both present and in 2070. A higher realised dispersal rates would diminish PD losses inside the network of PAs. The conservation of palm PD can be improved through the expansion of PAs in strategic regions such as the upper portion of the Amazon Basin, Tropical Andes and Mesoamerica.

AB  - We used birds, butterflies, tiger beetles, mean annual precipitation, and spatial statistical models to investigate the applicability of using indicators of species richness for conservation planning on a continental scale. The models were applied to data collected on three grids of squares (each square 275 or 350 km on a side) covering North America, the Indian subcontinent, and Australia. We applied spatial statistical modeling techniques to determine the viability of using a single or multiple indicators to predict spatial patterns of species diversity of ecologically and phylogenetically unrelated taxa. Spatial models are optimal for these analyses because species data typically are not spatially independent, primarily owing to dispersion effects. Furthermore, spatial models can be used to predict species numbers in areas where no observed data are available. We found that the number of tiger beetle species is a useful indicator of the number of butterfly species in North America and of the number of bird species on the Indian subcontinent, but it is not so useful as an indicator of either the number of bird or butterfly species in Australia or of the number or bird species in North America. We also found that the number of butterfly species is a useful indicator of the number of bird species in North American and Australia and that mean annual precipitation is useful for predicting the number of butterfly species in Australia. Although the general model used on all three continental areas is the same, the relative importance of potential indicators in predicting spatial patterns of other taxa changes from continent to continent. We attribute this change largely to differential biogeographical and ecological history, which must be taken into account in the selection and testing of potential indicators.

AB  - Biological invasions by cryptic ecosystem engineers can alter the ecological and socio-economic values of ecosystems in ways that may take decades to detect. The invasion of North American glacial refuges by non-native earthworms offers a prominent but understudied example of a cryptic invasion. Non-native earthworms are known to alter carbon sequestration, disrupt mycorrhizal networks and homogenize plant communities, but natural resource managers still lack robust protocols to identify and safeguard high conservation value communities (HCVCs) from such invasions. In the absence of such protocols, or reliable methods to eradicate non-native earthworm populations once established, there is an urgent need for methods to identify HCVCs at risk of or potentially shielded from earthworm invasion by the existence of abiotic barriers to their dispersal or persistence in such sites. We developed species distribution models (SDMs) using in situ field surveys and remotely sensed data to (1) identify factors limiting the occurrence of non-native Lumbricus earthworms in imperilled coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest and Garry oak (Quercus garryana) and maritime meadow ecosystems endemic to glacial refugia of the Pacific Northwest of North America and to (2) evaluate their influence on plant species diversity and identify abiotic factors capable of preventing their dispersal or persistence at a site. As predicted, shallow, drier soils and steeper terrain limited earthworm occurrence and abundance in our highly heterogeneous study area, and earthworm presence appeared to reduce plant species richness. Our results indicated that HCVCs endemic to shallow-soil (< 12 +/- 3 cm) sites that experience regular summer drought appear to act as refuges from invasion by non-native earthworms. Our results also elevate concerns for the conservation of deep-soil habitats not isolated from earthworm invasions by shallow soil, saltwater or other barriers to earthworm dispersal. The SDMs developed here offer guidance to the identification of potential refuges for the conservation of imperilled native species and communities from the detrimental effects non-native earthworms in glacial refugia of western North America and should thereby facilitate proactive planning by conservation practitioners.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) have become integral tools in scientific research and conservation planning. Despite progress in the assessment of various statistical models for use in SDMs, little has been done in way of evaluating appropriate ecological models. In this paper, we evaluate the multiscale filter framework as a suitable theoretical model for predicting freshwater fish distributions in the upper Green River system (Ohio River drainage), USA. The spatial distributions of six fishes with contrasting biogeographies were modeled using boosted regression trees and multiscale landscape data. Species biogeography did not appear to affect predictive performance and all models performed well statistically with receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.87 to 0.98. Predictive maps show accurate estimations of ranges for five of six species based on historical collections. The relative influence of each type of environmental feature and spatial scale varied markedly with between species. A hierarchical effect was detected for narrowly distributed species. These species were highly influenced by soil composition at larger spatial scales and land use/land cover (LULC) patterns at more proximal scales. Conversely, WLC pattern was the most influential feature for widely distributed at all spatial scales. Using multiscale data capable of capturing hierarchical landscape influences allowed production of accurate predictive models and provided further insight into factors controlling freshwater fish distributions.

AB  - There are few quantitative predictions for the impacts of climate change on freshwater fish in Australia. We developed species distribution models (SDMs) linking historical fish distributions for 43 species from Victorian streams to a suite of hydro-climatic and catchment predictors, and applied these models to explore predicted range shifts under future climate-change scenarios. Here, we present summary results for the 43 species, together with a more detailed analysis for a subset of species with distinct distributions in relation to temperature and hydrology. Range shifts increased from the lower to upper climate-change scenarios, with most species predicted to undergo some degree of range shift. Changes in total occupancy ranged from -38% to +63% under the lower climate-change scenario to -47% to +182% under the upper climate-change scenario. We do, however, caution that range expansions are more putative than range contractions, because the effects of barriers, limited dispersal and potential life-history factors are likely to exclude some areas from being colonised. As well as potentially informing more mechanistic modelling approaches, quantitative predictions such as these should be seen as representing hypotheses to be tested and discussed, and should be valuable for informing long-term strategies to protect aquatic biota.

AB  - White-clawed crayfish, bullhead, and freshwater pearl mussel are different model organisms in terms of biological traits. Analysing their distribution patterns, habitat demands, and causes of decline may thus help to derive broader frameworks for conservation projects. This paper includes a wide-ranging literature review for these three threatened freshwater animals, then uses general patterns to make suggestions about broader protection measures for freshwater species. Each species has a patchy distribution, from local to broad spatial scales. However, we point out the difficulty to summarise such knowledge, because many variables were no( consistently and/or accurately recorded by workers, and because the range of colonised habitats depends on the environmental heterogeneity within study areas. Causes of decline are chiefly related to human activities which modify the biological, chemical, and physical features of the aquatic environment, and can be classified into four types: physical habitat alterations, interspecific interactions, overfishing and poaching, and natural disturbance. By analysing causes of decline and possible actions, we develop seven general trends that could be adopted for a wider array of species. However, protection plans cannot be effective without actual collaborations between river managers, local inhabitants, and authorities. Finally, the re-introduction procedure itself (if needed) depends oil the biology of the species under survey, and remains specific. At the same time, further fundamental research is needed to generalise relationships between population and habitat dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - 1. Biogeographical models of species' distributions are essential tools for assessing impacts of changing environmental conditions on natural communities and ecosystems. Practitioners need more reliable predictions to integrate into conservation planning (e.g. reserve design and management).
   2. Most models still largely ignore or inappropriately take into account important features of species' distributions, such as spatial autocorrelation, dispersal and migration, biotic and environmental interactions. Whether distributions of natural communities or ecosystems are better modelled by assembling individual species' predictions in a bottom-up approach or modelled as collective entities is another important issue. An international workshop was organized to address these issues.
   3. We discuss more specifically six issues in a methodological framework for generalized regression: (i) links with ecological theory; (ii) optimal use of existing data and artificially generated data; (iii) incorporating spatial context; (iv) integrating ecological and environmental interactions; (v) assessing prediction errors and uncertainties; and (vi) predicting distributions of communities or collective properties of biodiversity.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Better predictions of the effects of impacts on biological communities and ecosystems can emerge only from more robust species' distribution models and better documentation of the uncertainty associated with these models. An improved understanding of causes of species' distributions, especially at their range limits, as well as of ecological assembly rules and ecosystem functioning, is necessary if further progress is to be made. A better collaborative effort between theoretical and functional ecologists, ecological modellers and statisticians is required to reach these goals.

AB  - The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) was listed as threatened under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1990. We applied modern spatial conservation theory and models to evaluate several candidate critical habitat networks, and sought an efficient conservation solution that encompassed the highest value lands for spotted owl recovery rather than maximizing the total area of potential critical habitat. We created a map of relative habitat suitability, which served as input to the spatial conservation prioritization program Zonation. We used the spatially-explicit individual-based population model HexSim to estimate and compare simulated spotted owl population outcomes among a suite of candidate critical habitat networks that varied in size and spatial arrangement under alternative scenarios of future habitat suitability and barred owl (S. varia) effects. We evaluated simulated spotted owl population outcomes, including total population size, and extinction and quasi-extinction likelihoods for 108 combinations of candidate critical habitat networks by habitat change by barred owl scenarios, both range-wide and within 11 distinct portions of the owl's range. Barred owl encounter rates and the amount and suitability of habitat had substantial effects on simulated spotted owl populations. When barred owl encounter rates were high, changes in the amount and suitability of habitat had minimal impacts on population performance. Under lowered barred owl encounter rates, candidate critical habitat networks that included most existing high suitability habitat supported a high likelihood of long-term population persistence. Barred owls are currently the primary driving force behind poor population performance of NSOs; however, our models demonstrated that a sufficient area of high suitability habitat remains essential for recovery when effects of barred owls can be reduced. The modeling approach we employed is sufficiently flexible to incorporate new information about spotted owls as it becomes available and could likely be applied to conservation planning for other species.

AB  - Himalaya, the highest mountain system in the world and house of important biodiversity hotspot, is sensitive to projected warming by climate change. Rhizocarpon geographicum (map lichen), a crustose lichen, grows in high mountain ranges, is a potential indicator species of climate change. In the present study, MaxEnt species distribution modeling algorithm was used to predict the suitable habitat for R. geographicum in current and future climate scenarios. Nineteen bioclimatic variables from WorldClim database, along with elevation, were used to predict the current distribution and three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios by integrating three general circulation models (GCMs) for future distribution of species covering years 2050 and 2070. Furthermore, we performed change analysis to identify the precise difference between the current and future distribution of suitable areas of the species for delineating habitat range expansion (gain), habitat contraction (loss), and stable habitats. The final ensemble model obtained had average test value 0.968, and its predicted similar to 27.5% of the geographical area in the Indian Himalayan Region is presently climatically suitable for the species. The predicted highly suitable area for R. geographicum is observed to be declining in Northwestern Himalaya, and it is shifting towards the higher elevation areas of the Eastern Himalaya. The projected distribution in future under the RCP scenarios (RCP 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) showed the range expansion towards higher elevations, and it is more pronounced for the extreme future scenarios (RCP 8.5) than for the moderate and intermediate climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0). However, assuming that species can migrate to previously unoccupied areas, the model forecasts a habitat loss of 10.86-16.51% for R. geographicum, which is expected due to increase in mean annual temperature by 1.5-3.7 degrees C. The predictive MaxEnt modeling approach for mapping lichen will contribute significantly to the understanding of the impact of climate change in Himalayan ecosystems with wide implications for drawing suitable conservation plans and to take adaptation and mitigation measures.

AB  - The increasing interest in biodiversity conservation has led to the development of new approaches to facilitate ecologically based conservation policies and management plans. in this context, the development of effective methods for the classification of forest types constitutes a crucial issue as forests represent the most widespread vegetation structure and play a key role in ecosystem functioning. In this study a maximum entropy approach (Maxent) to forest type classification in a complex Mediterranean area, has been investigated. Maxent, a niche-based model of species/habitat distribution, allowed researchers to estimate the potential distribution of four forest types: Holm oak, Mixed oak, Mixed broadleaved and Riparian forests. The Maxent model's internal tests have proved a powerful tool for estimating the model's accuracy and analyzing the effects of the most important variables in the produced models. Moreover the comparison with a spectral response-based fuzzy classification, showed a higher accuracy in the Maxent outputs, demonstrating how the use of environmental variables, combined with spectral information in the classification of natural or semi-natural land cover classes, improves map accuracies. The modeling approach followed by this study, taking into account the uncertainty proper of the natural ecosystems and the use of environmental variables in land cover classification, can represent a useful approach to making more efficient and effective field inventories and to developing effective conservation policies.

AB  - Species distribution models provide habitat mapping tools and produce scalable information to inform policy decisions. Integrating spatial statistical modelling with bioclimatic information identifies the contribution of the most critical variable in species occurrence and distribution. In the present study a suitable bioclimatic model, MaxEnt modelling algorithm is used for Dipterocarpus indicus, an endemic and endangered species by incorporating field inventory data.This model predicted a high probability of potential distribution area in the forests of Uttara Kannada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga and Kannur. The highly suitable habitats are distributed in protected areas, namely Kudremukh, Mookambika, Pushpagiri, Sharavathi Valley, Shettihalli, Someshwara, Parambikulam, Peechi-Vazhani, Shendurney, Thattekadu Bird, Indira Gandhi (Anamalai), Kalakad, Mundanthurai and Kanyakumari. The Area Under Curve value for the potential distribution of species is observed at 0.894 for training data. The highest fractional predicted area was in the low elevation tropical wet evergreen forest region between 50 and 700 m. The contributions of the climatic variables in the model showed that precipitation in the coldest quarter was the most influential, followed by annual mean temperature and annual precipitation. This study aids in long-term conservation planning, monitoring, and managing potential habitats of endemic and endangered tree species.

Integrating ecosystem services into effective policies and planning at the regional scale to achieve sustainable urban development is still a challenge. The goal of this research is to optimize spatial patterns of urban development by assessing and comparing multiple trade-off scenarios between ecological processes and urban expansion, incorporating planning and design into spatially explicit methods, and integrating ecosystem services into decision-making procedures. We develop a conceptual framework for regional urban-ecological sustainability with six steps: pattern recognition, landscape process, problem diagnosis, integrated ecological network, urbanization simulation, and decision-support. We apply this framework to a case in which planning and design have followed the rational-comprehensive approach. Results demonstrate that landscape multi-functionality and regional ecological networks are significantly improved using our integrated approach to planning and design, because it provides vital information for regional planning to cope with the urgent need for ecological protection and urban development. By comparing urban growth under three scenarios, we found that the trade-off scenario based on ecological conservation and restoration (medium security level) resolved conflict more effectively, which restricted urban expansion on land of high ecological importance by constructing regional ecological networks. In addition, using field survey and species distribution model approaches, we design plant community types with complementary tree, shrub, and herb species as part of the decision-making procedure, which can restore zonal vegetation and the hydrological cycle in rugged mountain regions. The research concludes that regional urban-ecological sustainability based on scientific assessment, planning, and design provides a rational basis for sustainable urban development and landscape management.

AB  - Contemporary landscapes are subject to a multitude of human-derived stressors. Effects of such stressors are increasingly realized by population declines and large-scale extirpation of taxa worldwide. Most notably, cumulative effects of climate and landscape change can limit species' local adaptation and dispersal capabilities, thereby reducing realized niche space and range extent. Resolving the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on species persistence is a pressing challenge in ecology, especially for declining species. For example, wolverines (Gulo gulo L.) persist on only 40% of their historic North American range. While climate change has been shown to be a mechanism of range retractions, anthropogenic landscape disturbance has been recently implicated. We hypothesized these two interact to effect declines. We surveyed wolverine occurrence using camera trapping and genetic tagging at 104 sites at the wolverine range edge, spanning a 15,000 km(2) gradient of climate, topographic, anthropogenic, and biotic variables. We used occupancy and generalized linear models to disentangle the factors explaining wolverine distribution. Persistent spring snow pack-expected to decrease with climate change-was a significant predictor, but so was anthropogenic landscape change. Canid mesocarnivores, which we hypothesize are competitors supported by anthropogenic landscape change, had comparatively weaker effect. Wolverine population declines and range shifts likely result from climate change and landscape change operating in tandem. We contend that similar results are likely for many species and that research that simultaneously examines climate change, landscape change, and the biotic landscape is warranted. Ecology research and species conservation plans that address these interactions are more likely to meet their objectives.

AB  - Context. Mapping the habitat and distribution of a species is critical for developing effective conservation plans. Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, Phascolarctidae) distribution is constrained by the nutritional and shelter requirements provided by a relatively small number of key tree species in any given area. Identifying these key species provides a practical foundation for mapping koala habitat and prioritising areas for conservation.
   Aims. To determine key tree species for koalas in Noosa Shire (south-eastern Queensland, Australia) as a basis for mapping koala habitat quality.
   Methods. We applied a faecal-pellet survey methodology in 1996/97 to assess evidence of use by koalas of 4031 trees from 96 randomly stratified survey sites across different eucalypt-forest and woodland communities. Results were compared with those from a later survey undertaken in 2001/02 involving 5535 trees from 195 sites that were distributed across broadly similar areas with the aim to investigate aspects of koala landscape ecology.
   Key results. A total of 66.7% of the 1996/97 survey sites contained koala faecal pellets, recorded under 953 eucalypt trees (14 species) and 1670 non-eucalypt trees (27 species). The proportion of trees at a given survey site that had koala faecal pellets at the base ranged from 2.2% to 94.7% (mean = 31.13 +/- 2.59% s.e.). For the 2001/02 dataset, koala pellets were found at 55.4% of sites, from 794 eucalypt and 2240 non-eucalypt trees. The proportion of trees with pellets ranged from 3% to 80% (mean = 21.07 +/- 1.77% s.e.). Both the 1996/97 and 2001/02 surveys identified the same three tree species (forest red gum, Eucalyptus tereticornis, swamp mahogany, E. robusta, and tallowwood, E. microcorys) as the highest-ranked for koala use in the study area. Three additional species (red mahogany, E. resinifera, small-fruited grey gum, E. propinqua, and grey ironbark, E. siderophloia) were identified in the 1996/97 surveys as key eucalypt species. Of the non-eucalypts in the 1996/97 dataset, coast cypress pine (Callitris columellaris) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia) ranked highest for use by koalas, followed by pink bloodwood (Corymbia intermedia) and brush box (Lophostemon confertus). White bottlebrush (Callistemon salignus), hard corkwood (Endiandra sieberi), M. quinquenervia and C. intermedia ranked highest in the 2001/02 dataset. The findings showed significantly greater use of larger eucalypts (i.e. 300-mm to >600-mm diameter at breast height).
   Conclusions. The identified key eucalypt species, being the critical limiting resource for koalas, were used to assign koala habitat-quality classes to mapped regional ecosystem types to create a Koala Habitat Atlas (KHA) for Noosa Shire. The combined two highest quality classes based on abundance of the key eucalypt species comprised only 15.7% of the total land area of the Shire.
   Implications. The KHA approach provides a practical and repeatable method for developing koala habitat-suitability mapping for national-, regional- and local-scale conservation and recovery planning purposes.

AB  - The distribution and future fate of ectothermic organisms in a warming world will be dictated by thermalscapes across landscapes. That is particularly true for stream fishes and cold-water species like trout, salmon, and char that are already constrained to high elevations and latitudes. The extreme climates in those environments also preclude invasions by most non-native species, so identifying especially cold habitats capable of absorbing future climate change while still supporting native populations would highlight important refugia. By coupling crowd-sourced biological datasets with high-resolution stream temperature scenarios, we delineate network refugia across >250000 stream km in the Northern Rocky Mountains for two native salmonidsbull trout (BT) and cutthroat trout (CT). Under both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios, refugia with high probabilities of trout population occupancy (>0.9) were predicted to exist (33-68 BT refugia; 917-1425 CT refugia). Most refugia are on public lands (>90%) where few currently have protected status in National Parks or Wilderness Areas (<15%). Forecasts of refuge locations could enable protection of key watersheds and provide a foundation for climate smart planning of conservation networks. Using cold water as a climate shield' is generalizable to other species and geographic areas because it has a strong physiological basis, relies on nationally available geospatial data, and mines existing biological datasets. Importantly, the approach creates a framework to integrate data contributed by many individuals and resource agencies, and a process that strengthens the collaborative and social networks needed to preserve many cold-water fish populations through the 21st century.

AB  - There is increased evidence that incorporating evolutionary history directly in conservation actions is beneficial, particularly given the likelihood that extinction is not random and that phylogenetic diversity (PD) is lost at higher rates than species diversity. This evidence is even more compelling in biodiversity hotspots, such as Madagascar, where less than 10% of the original vegetation remains. Here, we use the Leguminosae, an ecologically and economically important plant family, and a combination of phylogenetics and species distribution modelling, to assess biodiversity patterns and identify regions, coevolutionary processes and ecological factors that are important in shaping this diversity, especially during the Quaternary. We show evidence that species distribution and community PD are predicted by watershed boundaries, which enable the identification of a network of refugia and dispersal corridors that were perhaps important for maintaining community integrity during past climate change. Phylogenetically clustered communities are found in the southwest of the island at low elevation and share a suite of morphological characters (especially fruit morphology) indicative of coevolution with their main dispersers, the extinct and extant lemurs. Phylogenetically over-dispersed communities are found along the eastern coast at sea level and may have resulted from many independent dispersal events from the drier and more seasonal regions of Madagascar.

AB  - It is difficult to map and quantify biodiversity at landscape level in areas with low data availability, despite demand from decision-makers. We propose a methodology to determine potential biodiversity pattern using habitat suitability maps of the understory plant species with highest cover and occurrence frequency in the three different forests types of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina). We used a database of vascular plants from 535 surveys from which we identified 35 indicative species. We explored more than 50 potential explanatory variables to develop habitat suitability maps of the indicative species, which were combined to develop a map of the potential biodiversity. Correlation among environmental, topographic and forest landscape variables were discussed, as well as the marginality and the specialization of the indicative species. We detected differences in the niches of the species prevailing in the three forest types. The developed map of potential biodiversity uncovered hotspots of biodiversity in the ecotone of Nothofagus pumilio and N. antarctica as well as in the wettest part of the mixed N. pumilio-N. betuloides forests. It allowed thus to identify forest areas with different conservation potential and can be readily used as a decision support system for conservation and management strategies at different scales including the identification of land-use conflicts (e.g. of biodiversity with timber production and livestock) and the development of a network of protected areas, which currently does not cover the forests of highest conservation value.

AB  - Mountain ecosystems have been less adversely affected by invasions of non-native plants than most other ecosystems, partially because most invasive plants in the lowlands are limited by climate and cannot grow under harsher high-elevation conditions. However, with ongoing climate change, invasive species may rapidly move upwards and threaten mid-, and then high-elevation mountain ecosystems. We evaluated this threat by modeling the current and future habitat suitability for 48 invasive plant species in Switzerland and New South Wales, Australia. Both regions had contrasting climate interactions with elevation, resulting in possible different responses of species distributions to climate change. Using a species distribution modeling approach that combines data from two spatial scales, we built high-resolution species distribution models (<= 250 m) that account for the global climatic niche of species and also finer variables depicting local climate and disturbances. We found that different environmental drivers limit the elevation range of invasive species in each of the two regions, leading to region-specific species responses to climate change. The optimal suitability for plant invaders is predicted to markedly shift from the lowland to the montane or subalpine zone in Switzerland, whereas the upward shift is far less pronounced in New South Wales where montane and subalpine elevations are already suitable. The results suggest that species most likely to invade high elevations in Switzerland will be cold-tolerant, whereas species with an affinity to moist soils are most likely to invade higher elevations in Australia. Other plant traits were only marginally associated with elevation limits. These results demonstrate that a more systematic consideration of future distributions of invasive species is required in conservation plans of not yet invaded mountainous ecosystems.

AB  - Aim Ecological data collected by the general public are valuable for addressing a wide range of ecological research and conservation planning, and there has been a rapid increase in the scope and volume of data available. However, data from eBird or other large-scale projects with volunteer observers typically present several challenges that can impede robust ecological inferences. These challenges include spatial bias, variation in effort and species reporting bias.
   Innovation We use the example of estimating species distributions with data from eBird, a community science or citizen science (CS) project. We estimate two widely used metrics of species distributions: encounter rate and occupancy probability. For each metric, we critically assess the impact of data processing steps that either degrade or refine the data used in the analyses. CS data density varies widely across the globe, so we also test whether differences in model performance are robust to sample size.
   Main conclusions Model performance improved when data processing and analytical methods addressed the challenges arising from CS data; however, the degree of improvement varied with species and data density. The largest gains we observed in model performance were achieved with 1) the use of complete checklists (where observers report all the species they detect and identify, allowing non-detections to be inferred) and 2) the use of covariates describing variation in effort and detectability for each checklist. Occupancy models were more robust to a lack of complete checklists. Improvements in model performance with data refinement were more evident with larger sample sizes. In general, we found that the value of each refinement varied by situation and we encourage researchers to assess the benefits in other scenarios. These approaches will enable researchers to more effectively harness the vast ecological knowledge that exists within CS data for conservation and basic research.

AB  - In many countries, bats have high conservation prioritisation owing to their trophic position, habitat associations and threat level, and many have dedicated management plans. However, poor knowledge of species' ecology, identification issues and surveying challenges mean that large-scale monitoring to produce required distribution and abundance information is less developed than for some other taxa. Static detectors deployed to record bats throughout whole nights have been recommended for standardised acoustic monitoring but to date their cost has prohibited wide uptake. Here we describe an extensive survey approach in which members of the public borrowed detectors to participate in a large-scale monitoring and mapping project. Covering a 15% sample of the study area over two years, the survey generated over 600,000 bat recordings. We describe a semi-automated step-wise method for processing this large volume of recordings to assign identity to species or genus level with low error rates. Twelve species were recorded during the survey, ranging from the near ubiquitous Common Pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus to the locally scarce Leisler's bat Nyctalus leisleri. We show pronounced patterns of seasonality consistent with post-breeding dispersal and new information on nocturnal activity patterns. Using regression trees we generate new maps of standardised variation in activity which is likely to reflect underlying spatial variation in relative abundance. These reveal hitherto unknown patterns for species of superficially similar status. We conclude that with logistical support and centralised automated species identification it is now possible for the public to contribute to acoustic bat monitoring at an unprecedented scale.

AB  - Old forest stands comprise a very small proportion of the managed forested landscapes of Scandinavia today compared with the preindustrial era. Therefore, it is important to develop conservation measures for old forest remnants and temporarily available old stands in managed forests in the most optimal way. This study examines the spatial functionality of old spruce-dominated forest in several regions of Sweden through the perspective of organisms with different ecologies, in terms of their area requirements and mobility. Instead of real species, virtual species were used representing a gradient of these two ecological traits. The main tool was habitat suitability modelling. Countrywide estimates of forest variables derived from the satellite data and field data from the National Forest Inventory using the k-nearest neighbour method were used as sources of habitat distribution data. There was large regional variation in old spruce forest functionality depending on natural conditions and forest history. The relationship between functionality and amount was largely curvilinear. Areas with > 10% of old spruce forest generally had high levels of spatial functionality, whereas high variation in functionality was observed in areas with little old spruce forest cover. This method for multiple-scale assessment of old forest functionality, using virtual species, may be helpful in regional forest biodiversity planning.

AB  - Medicinal and aromatic plants, such as Salvia hydrangea DC. Ex Benth., have been highly popular all over the world throughout the time. Future climate change is believed to be one of the great threats to the range and resilience of these species. Therefore, recognizing the extensive spatial distribution and potential effects of global climate change on S. hydrangea in its major habitats (Chaharmahal Va Bakhtiari province: CVBP, Central Zagros Mountains: CZMs, Iran) is of considerable importance. We recorded the data concerning occurrence points data using the global positioning system (GPS). We also collected bioclimatic and topographic variables from the WorldClim-global climate dataset to model the current and future (under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 within two global circulation models HadGEM2-CC and MRI-CGCM3 for 2050 and 2070) habitat suitability for S. hydrangea employing an ensemble species distribution modeling (ESDM) on BIOMOD2 package. The visualization of an ensemble forecasting model of the true skill statistic (TSS) > 0.8 models revealed that the majority of suitable habitats for this species were situated in the east and southeast of this province. Generally, precipitation of coldest season, temperature annual range, and elevation variables were of great importance for our study model. Comparing the current and future habitat suitability distribution of S. hydrangea, it could be concluded that the plant distribution is migrating between different latitudes and altitudes. The results suggested that the scenarios of MIRI-CGCM3 probably create serious effects and implications on the future distribution of S. hydrangea habitats. The loss of habitat of this species in the southeast of this province was considerably more visible, indicating a significant diminution in the distribution area. However, the potential distribution of S. hydrangea in this province would face alarming conditions between 2050 and 2070. Consequently, S. hydrangea could be particularly in need of conservation plans, which is urgently needed in order to reduce climate change-associated impacts.

AB  - Aim Protected areas are frequently defined on the basis of biological importance. Ecosystem services are expected to be under protection when biodiversity is preserved; however, new approaches are needed to confirm this statement. We evaluated how spatial associations between ecosystem services and plant biodiversity on a large spatial scale influence their representativeness in current protected areas.
   Location Brazilian seasonally tropical dry forest (Caatinga).
   Methods We produced woody plant biodiversity maps (species richness, narrow- range species richness and beta diversity) using species distribution modelling. We estimated regulating services (water purification, carbon storage and erosion control), provisioning services (water supply, fodder and agriculture) and supporting services (water balance, net primary productivity and soil fertility) using primary data and a proxy-based approach. We performed spatial correlation analyses between biodiversity and ecosystem services using Pearson's correlation test. After estimating the percentage of hotspot areas of biodiversity and ecosystem services presented in two types of protected areas (strict protection and sustainable use), we compared it to expected distribution by null model.
   Results Mostly weak and intermediary positive correlations arose among biodiversity and ecosystem services (beta diversity with water balance and species richness with water purification and carbon storage). Negative correlations occurred among water balance with both species richness and narrow- range species richness. Strict protection areas were well represented in terms of carbon storage and underrepresented for fodder and agriculture. Sustainable use protected areas were important for water balance. Plant biodiversity variables were not represented in current protected areas.
   Main conclusions Positive correlations between biodiversity and ecosystem services do not assure the protection of these targets in protected areas. Surrogates choice based only on spatial correlations might not effectively protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. Selection of priority areas must include biodiversity and ecosystem services as distinct conservation targets.

AB  - The realms of rare species conservation and metapopulation biology theory are often interrelated, and hence share several basic challenges. Two of the most important are the critical and frequently difficult tasks of distinguishing a priori between habitat and nonhabitat, and then delimiting suitable habitat patches in a study area. We combined classification tree analysis, a subset of classification and regression tree (CART) modeling, with digital data layers of environmental variables in a geographic information system (GIS) to predict suitable habitat and potential new population occurrences for turkeybeard (Xerophyllum asphodeloides), a rare liliaceous understory herb associated with southern Appalachian pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) forests, in northwestern Virginia. Sample values from eight environmental data layers and population survey data were used in the modeling process to produce a cross-validated classification tree that predicted suitable habitat in the study area. Elevation, slope, forest type, and fire frequency were the four main explanatory variables in the model. Approximately 4% of the study area was classified into five suitable habitat classes, with a misclassification error rate of 4.74%. The final 13-leaf tree correctly classified 74% of the known presence areas and 90% of the known absence areas, and ground-truthing surveys resulted in the discovery of eight new occupied habitat patches. Results of this study are important for conservation and management of X. asphodeloides, as well as for the applicability of the habitat modeling techniques to enhancing the study of metapopulations and disturbance regimes in Appalachian forests. In addition, they confirm the potential and value of CART and GIS-based modeling approaches to species distribution problems. Our model was successful at defining suitable habitat and discovering new populations of a rare species at the landscape scale. Similar application to other rare species could prove very useful for addressing these and other ecological and conservation issues, such as planning transplantation or reintroduction experiments, identifying metapopulation fragmentation thresholds, and formulating conservation strategies.

AB  - We analysed more than 25 years of change in passerine bird distribution in South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho, to show that species distributions can be influenced by processes that are at least in part independent of the local strength and direction of climate change: land use and ecological succession. We used occupancy models that separate species' detection from species' occupancy probability, fitted to citizen science data from both phases of the Southern African Bird Atlas Project (1987-1996 and 2007-2013). Temporal trends in species' occupancy probability were interpreted in terms of local extinction/colonization, and temporal trends in detection probability were interpreted in terms of change in abundance. We found for the first time at this scale that, as predicted in the context of bush encroachment, closed-savannah specialists increased where open-savannah specialists decreased. In addition, the trend in the abundance of species a priori thought to be favoured by agricultural conversion was negatively correlated with human population density, which is in line with hypotheses explaining the decline in farmland birds in the Northern Hemisphere. In addition to climate, vegetation cover and the intensity and time since agricultural conversion constitute important predictors of biodiversity changes in the region. Their inclusion will improve the reliability of predictive models of species distribution.

AB  - Climate change is a major threat to global biodiversity that will produce a range of new selection pressures. Understanding species responses to climate change requires an interdisciplinary perspective, combining ecological, molecular and environmental approaches. We propose an applied integrated framework to identify populations under threat from climate change based on their extent of exposure, inherent sensitivity due to adaptive and neutral genetic variation and range shift potential. We consider intraspecific vulnerability and population-level responses, an important but often neglected conservation research priority. We demonstrate how this framework can be applied to vertebrates with limited dispersal abilities using empirical data for the bat Plecotus austriacus. We use ecological niche modelling and environmental dissimilarity analysis to locate areas at high risk of exposure to future changes. Combining outlier tests with genotype-environment association analysis, we identify potential climate-adaptive SNPs in our genomic data set and differences in the frequency of adaptive and neutral variation between populations. We assess landscape connectivity and show that changing environmental suitability may limit the future movement of individuals, thus affecting both the ability of populations to shift their distribution to climatically suitable areas and the probability of evolutionary rescue through the spread of adaptive genetic variation among populations. Therefore, a better understanding of movement ecology and landscape connectivity is needed for predicting population persistence under climate change. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating genomic data to determine sensitivity, adaptive potential and range shift potential, instead of relying solely on exposure to guide species vulnerability assessments and conservation planning.

AB  - Taxus wallichianaZucc. (Himalayan yew) is subject to international and national conservation measures because of its over-exploitation and decline over the last 30 years. Predicting the impact of climate change onT. wallichiana's distribution might help protect the wild populations and plan effective ex situ measures or cultivate successfully. Considering the complexity of climates and the uncertainty inherent in climate modeling for mountainous regions, we integrated three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) based on datasets from 14 Global Climate Models of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 to: (1) predict the potential distribution ofT. wallichianaunder recent past (1960-1990, hereafter "current") and future (2050s and 2070s) scenarios with the species distribution model MaxEnt.; and (2) quantify the climatic factors influencing the distribution. In respond to the future warming climate scenarios, (1) highly suitable areas forT. wallichianawould decrease by 31-55% at a rate of 3-7%/10a; (2) moderately suitable areas would decrease by 20-30% at a rate of 2-4%/10a; (3) the average elevation of potential suitable sites forT. wallichianawould shift up-slope by 390 m (15%) to 948 m (36%) at a rate of 42-100 m/10a. Average annual temperature (contribution rate ca. 61%), isothermality and temperature seasonality (20%), and annual precipitation (17%) were the main climatic variables affectingT. wallichianahabitats. Prior protected areas and suitable planting areas must be delimited from the future potential distributions, especially the intersection areas at different suitability levels. It is helpful to promote the sustainable utilization of this precious resource by prohibiting exploitation and ex situ restoring wild resources, as well as artificially planting considering climate suitability.

AB  - Habitat suitability assessment is critical for wildlife population conservation and management planning. The MaxEnt model is widely used in species habitat suitability modeling. In order to investigate the habitat status of the black-necked crane in the Zoige grassland wetland ecological function area, this study evaluated the habitat suitability of the black-necked crane using the MaxEnt model with 152 occurrence records and 13 environmental variables. Based on the Akaike information criterion corrected for the small sample size, the best optimal parameter combination (feature class LQPHT, regularization multiplier 3.0) was selected. The results show that the Maxent model had good accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.895. Distance to roads, average summer precipitation, distance to lakes, and altitude are the dominant environmental variables affecting the potential distribution of black-necked cranes, with the contribution rates of 31.6%, 29.8%, 14.3%, and 8.2%, respectively. The suitable habitat area of black-necked cranes is mainly distributed in and around the Zoige Wetland National Nature Reserve, accounting for 46.49% of the Zoige Grassland Wetland National Key Ecological Function Zone. The potential distribution area has a tendency to spread to Hongyuan County in the south of the functional zone, and the unsuitable habitat is mainly distributed in the high-altitude area in the southwest of the functional zone. This study recommends focusing on the distribution area of black-necked cranes around Zoige Wetland National Nature Reserve and Hongyuan County to improve conservation strategies and strengthen protection efforts.

AB  - Suitable habitat is vital for the survival and restoration of a species. Understanding the suitable habitat range for lycophytes and ferns is prerequisite for effective species resource conservation and recovery efforts. In this study, we took Athyrium brevifrons as an example, predicted its suitable habitat using a Maxent model with 67 occurrence data and nine environmental variables in Northeast China. The area under the curve (AUC) value of independent test data, as well as the comparison with specimen county areal distribution of A. brevifrons exhibited excellent predictive performance. The type of environmental variables showed that precipitation contributed the most to the distribution prediction, followed by temperature and topography. Percentage contribution and permutation importance both indicated that precipitation of driest quarter (Bio17) was the key factor in determining the natural distribution of A. brevifrons, the reason could be proved by the fern gametophyte biology. The analysis of high habitat suitability areas also showed the habitat preference of A. brevifrons: comparatively more precipitation and less fluctuation in the driest quarter. Changbai Mountains, covering almost all the high and medium habitat suitability areas, provide the best ecological conditions for the survival of A. brevifrons, and should be considered as priority areas for protection and restoration of the wild resource. The potential habitat suitability distribution map could provide a reference for the sustainable development and utilisation of A. brevifrons resource, and Maxent modelling could be valuable for conservation management planning for lycophytes and ferns in Northeast China.

AB  - The process of niche construction can alter the trajectory of natural selection through organism-environment feedback. As such, the mechanism and impact of niche construction can be better investigated along environmental gradients. Here we investigate how the process of niche construction affects the distribution of genotypes and fitness landscape along an environmental gradient under three selection regimes, namely heterozygote superiority, genetic loci which dictates niche construction ability being either selectively neutral or non-neutral. Using a spatially explicit cellular automaton, we show that niche construction can stratify genetic diversity by forming band-like distributions consisting of different genotypic compositions and promote reproduction isolation by forming a divide with reduced average fitness along the gradients, termed a fitness valley. The band structure and the presence of a fitness valley depend on heterogeneous environments, resource-dependent fitness and the selection acting on the gene loci affecting the niche-constructing ability. Our work adds to the growing body of evidence on criticizing species distribution models which assume that the environment alone can determine species distributions. Based on the results, we argue that conservation planning should target preserving or restoring environmental gradients.

AB  - Since 1980, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) range-wide populations declined 3.9% annually. Within the West Gulf Coastal Plain Bird Conservation Region in the south-central United States, populations of this quail species have declined 6.8% annually. These declines sparked calls for land use change and prompted implementation of various conservation practices. However, to effectively reverse these declines and restore northern bobwhite to their former population levels, habitat conservation and management efforts must target establishment and maintenance of sustainable populations. To provide guidance for conservation and restoration of habitat capable of supporting sustainable northern bobwhite populations in the West Gulf Coastal Plain, we modeled their spatial distribution using landscape characteristics derived from 1992 National Land Cover Data and bird detections, from 1990 to 1994, along 10-stop Breeding Bird Survey route segments. Four landscape metrics influenced detections of northern bobwhite: detections were greater in areas with more grassland and increased aggregation of agricultural lands, but detections were reduced in areas with increased density of land cover edge and grassland edge. Using these landscape metrics, we projected the abundance and spatial distribution of northern bobwhite populations across the entire West Gulf Coastal Plain. Predicted populations closely approximated abundance estimates from a different cadre of concurrently collected data but model predictions did not accurately reflect bobwhite detections along species-specific call-count routes in Arkansas and Louisiana. Using similar methods, we also projected northern bobwhite population distribution circa 1980 based on Land Use Land Cover data and bird survey data from 1976 to 1984. We compared our 1980 spatial projections with our spatial estimate of 1992 populations to identify areas of population change. Additionally, we used our projection of the spatial distribution and abundance of bobwhite to predict areas of population sustainability. Our projections of population change and sustainability provide guidance for targeting habitat conservation and rehabilitation efforts for restoration of northern bobwhite populations in the West Gulf Coastal Plain.

AB  - The eastern hoolock gibbon, Hoolock leuconedys, is categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List and assessed as a Schedule I species of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 in India. We predict the potential habitat of H. leuconedys in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, India, using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. The model was developed using 90 known localities of H. leuconedys in the state. Nineteen environmental parameters along with 12 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) layers, elevation and land use and land cover (LULC) were used in the modelling. Amongst the environmental input variables, the precipitation of the coldest quarter (BIO 19) had the highest contribution to the model (26.03%) and the twelve NDVI layers collectively contributed 60.91%. Two districts, Lower Dibang Valley and Lohit, which are known to contain H. leuconedys, occupied 64.75% of the predicted distribution area of the species. Thus, we aid in the identification of suitable areas for the reintroduction program of H. leuconedys that is planned by the Gibbon Conservation Breeding Centre, Biological Park, Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh, India.

AB  - Predicting the distribution of future climatically suitable habitat areas is crucial for the long-term success of species conservation and management plans. However, generating accurate predictions may be difficult as the assumptions and variables used in the construction of different climate scenarios may result in divergent trajectories of change. Nevertheless, generating species distribution models under multiple scenarios is helpful in selecting an optimal solution for practical applications. In this study, we compare the current distribution of climatically suitable areas of a threatened medicinally important tree, Boswellia serrata Roxb. in India with its distribution in the year 2050 modeled using two climate change scenarios IPSL-CM5A-LR and NIMR-HADGEM2-AO each represented by four representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Maximum entropy modeling with 19 bioclimatic variables was used to construct the climatic niche of B. serrata for predictions of present and future climatically suitable areas within India. The study revealed that annual mean temperature, mean temperature of wettest quarter and driest quarter, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of wettest quarter potentially influence the distribution of the species. After thresholding, the model showed that similar to 21.95% of the geographical area in India is presently climatically suitable for the species. The IPSL-CM5ALR and NIMR-HADGEM2-AO climate models revealed contrasting distribution scenarios of climatically suitable areas in India. However, irrespective of these climate models, the four RCPs predict a consistent decrease in suitable area with increases in climatic harshness. Substantial area in peninsular India is expected to lose climatic suitability in 2050, though new areas are also predicted to become climatically suitable. We suggest long-term conservation strategies for B. serrata be prioritized within future areas that are projected to retain climatic suitability. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim The assumption that the native distributions of species are in equilibrium with climate has been shown to be frequently violated, despite its centrality to many niche model applications. We currently lack a framework that predicts these violations. Here, we examine whether variation in climatic disequilibrium is structured by properties of species' native distributions and climatic niches. Location Global. Methods We built climatic niche models for 106 pine (Pinus L.) species, including 25 that have naturalized outside their native range. We measured the extent of climate space occupied exclusively by naturalized populations and considered what fraction of this space was available within the native continent and near the native range. We examined the consequences of disequilibrium for estimates of potential range filling and sister species niche conservatism. Results Most species (23 of 25) have naturalized in climate conditions outside the native niche, leading to increases in the total known suitable climate space. Increases in niche size were negatively related to native niche size. Increases were often large; one species expanded its niche by almost 10% of the global climate space. These increases were associated primarily with cooler, wetter and less seasonal climates. Increases in known niche size lowered potential range filling estimates within species' native continent and ecoregion. Naturalized data did not strengthen support for niche conservatism among sister species. Main conclusions Among pines, climatic disequilibrium is the norm and not the exception. The magnitude of this disequilibrium can be vast, such that the native range greatly under-represents the true climatic tolerances of some species. Fortunately, this disequilibrium can be predicted largely by the size of a species' native niche. Accounting for this disequilibrium can improve our ability to characterize ecological phenomena, including potential range filling. This is an essential step towards improving the conservation value of ecological niche models.

AB  - Climate change is a global concern, requiring international strategies to reduce emissions, however, climate change vulnerability assessments are often local in scope with assessment areas restricted to jurisdictional boundaries. In our study we explored tools and impediments to understanding and responding to the effects of climate change on vulnerability of migratory birds from a binational perspective. We apply and assess the utility of a Climate Change Vulnerability Index on 3 focal species using distribution or niche modeling frameworks. We use the distributional forecasts to explore possible changes to jurisdictional conservation responsibilities resulting from shifting distributions for: eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and hooded warbler (Setophaga citrina). We found the Climate Change Vulnerability Index to be a well-organized approach to integrating numerous lines of evidence concerning effects of climate change, and provided transparency to the final assessment of vulnerability. Under this framework, we identified that eastern meadowlark and wood thrush are highly vulnerable to climate change, but hooded warbler is less vulnerable. Our study revealed impediments to assessing and modeling vulnerability to climate change from a binational perspective, including gaps in data or modeling for climate exposure parameters. We recommend increased cross-border collaboration to enhance the availability and resources needed to improve vulnerability assessments and development of conservation strategies. We did not find evidence to suggest major shifts in jurisdictional responsibility for the 3 focal species, but results do indicate increasing responsibility for these birds in the Canadian Provinces. These Provinces should consider conservation planning to help ensure a future supply of necessary habitat for these species.

AB  - An alluvial river channel typically meanders by eroding its outer banks and depositing sediments on the inside of bends, producing new land surfaces. Over time the landscape pattern created by these processes is important to the understanding of riparian plant ecology and the spatial structure of riparian forest development for restoration planning and design as well as other purposes. The middle sector of the Sacramento River is an actively meandering channel that deposits sediments in discrete new areas from fluvial geomorphic events creating a land age gradient. Newly formed land undergoes a primary succession by woody species such as willow and cottonwood communities that provide habitat for important conservation target species in California. Conservation and restoration of primary and secondary successional processes is an important management goal on the Sacramento River. The objectives of this paper were: (1) to develop and codify new methods to track the surficial chronological patterns of floodplain land age in a meandering river system, and (2) to analyze land production and the spatial distributions of gravel bars, riparian vegetation communities, and forest structure in relation to the land age gradient. Results from the ecological analysis indicate 71% of extant riparian vegetation was located within the 101-year meander zone; willow (18%) and cottonwood (31-43%) had the highest proportional canopy cover on lands aged 1-9 and 10-44 years, respectively. Potential applications of this approach for conservation and restoration planning and design of alluvial river floodplains are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many of the world's shark populations are in decline, indicating the need for improved conservation and management. Well managed and appropriately located marine parks and marine protected areas (MPAs) have potential to enhance shark conservation by restricting fisheries and protecting suitable habitat for threatened shark populations. Here, we used shark occurrence records collected by commercial fisheries to determine suitable habitat for pelagic sharks within the Australian continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and to quantify the amount of suitable habitat contained within existing MPAs. We developed generalised linear models using proportional occurrences of pelagic sharks for three families: Alopiidae (thresher), Carcharhinidae (requiem), and Lamnidae (mackerel) sharks. We also considered aggregated species from the Lamnidae and Carcharhinidae families ('combined sharks' in the models). Using a set of environmental predictors known to affect shark occurrence, including chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, sea surface temperature, and turbidity, as well as geomorphological, geophysical, and sedimentary parameters, we found that models including sea surface temperature and turbidity were ranked highest in their ability to predict shark distributions. We used these results to predict geographic regions where habitat was most suitable for pelagic sharks within the Australian EEZ, and our results revealed that suitable habitat was limited in no-take zones within MPAs. For all shark groupings, suitable habitats were found mostly at locations exposed to fishing pressure, potentially increasing the vulnerability of the pelagic shark species considered. Our predictive models provide a foundation for future spatial planning and shark management, suggesting that strong fisheries management in addition to MPAs is necessary for pelagic shark conservation.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are statistical models suited for learning complex visual patterns. In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted "punctual models"). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure ("ablation experiments"). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.
   Author summary
   Species distribution models aim at linking species spatial distribution to the environment. They can highlight the ecological preferences of species and thus predict which species are likely to be present in a given environment. These models are used in many scenarios such as conservation plans or monitoring of invasive species. The choice of model and the environmental data used have a strong impact on the model's ability to capture important information. Specificaly, state-of-the-art models generally use a punctual environment and do not take into account the environmental context or neighbourhood. Here we present a species distribution model based on a convolutional neural network that allows the use of large scale data such as spatialized environmental data including the environmental neighbourhood in addition to the punctual environment. We highlight the interests and limitations of this method as well as the importance of the environmental context in learning about species distributions.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures in human-dominated landscapes often contribute to wildlife mortality. Carnivores are especially vulnerable to human-induced mortality due to the perceived threat to livestock and humans. Despite having widespread conservation implications, carnivore mortality data have been largely underutilized within Nepal. This study utilized Maxent to identify high-risk areas and explore the contribution of habitat attributes associated with carnivore mortality using the casualty database within the Gandaki province of central Nepal. We categorized the risk to carnivore species in three taxonomic groups, Felid, Viverridae, and Herpestidae, and identified a 3704-km(2) area within the province at high risk for carnivore casualty. The middle mountains were the riskiest physiographic zone, and the Annapurna Conservation Area represented the largest risk zone among the four protected areas. Agricultural land was the most problematic area in terms of carnivore casualty. The human population was positively associated with high-risk areas and the number of casualties, whereas protected area cover had a negative association. This study identified that the common leopard was at the highest risk of mortality and therefore would benefit from the implementation of an action plan and species-specific conservation strategies, especially within identified high-risk zones. An expansion of protected areas in the middle mountain region would serve to greatly reduce carnivore casualty. Species distribution modeling can be further used with national-level spatial and temporal mortality data to identify the most prominent casualty times and pinpoint potential casualty locations throughout the country.

AB  - Microbiomes can dramatically alter individual plant performance, yet how these effects influence higher-order processes is not well resolved. In particular, little is known about how microbiome effects on individual plants alter plant population dynamics, a question critical to imperiled species conservation. Here we integrate bioassays, multidecadal demographic data, and integral projection modeling to determine how the presence of the natural soil microbiome underlies plant population dynamics. Simulations indicated that the presence of soil microbiomes boosted population growth rates (lambda) of the endangered Hypericum cumulicola by 13% on average, the difference between population growth versus decline in 76% of patches. The greatest benefit (47% increase in lambda) occurred in low-nutrient, high-elevation habitats, suggesting that the soil microbiome may help expand H. cumulicola's distribution to include these stressful habitats. Our results demonstrate that soil microbiomes can significantly affect plant population growth and persistence and support the incorporation of soil microbiomes into conservation planning.

AB  - Although a large number of rivers stretches in Southeast Europe (SEE) have a pristine status compared to the rest of Europe, these ecosystems and their freshwater biodiversity are perceptibly threatened. Since crayfish species are known to cover a wide spectrum of ecological functions they are considered as keystone species and ecosystem engineers. Therefore, their decline may substantially impair local biodiversity and ecosystem services. In this manuscript we present a brief overview of the status of the native freshwater crayfish and their habitats in SEE. Different forms of physical habitat degradation as well as invasive alien crayfish species and their pathogens (e.g., Aphanomyces astaci) are simultaneously threatening endangered populations all over SEE. Even though all native crayfish species are listed in the IUCN Red List, so far none of the 33 LIFE rehabilitation projects performed in SEE, has crayfish as target species in their agenda. Furthermore, SEE countries rarely designated Natura 2000 sites for native crayfish. We propose future studies to assess the distribution and functional role of crayfish species in SEE, as well as to develop habitat suitability models for these species during future conservation projects.

AB  - Closing yield gaps within existing croplands, and thereby avoiding further habitat conversions, is a prominently and controversially discussed strategy to meet the rising demand for agricultural products, while minimizing biodiversity impacts. The agricultural intensification associated with such a strategy poses additional threats to biodiversity within agricultural landscapes. The uneven spatial distribution of both yield gaps and biodiversity provides opportunities for reconciling agricultural intensification and biodiversity conservation through spatially optimized intensification. Here, we integrate distribution and habitat information for almost 20,000 vertebrate species with land-cover and land-use datasets. We estimate that projected agricultural intensification between 2000 and 2040 would reduce the global biodiversity value of agricultural lands by 11%, relative to 2000. Contrasting these projections with spatial land-use optimization scenarios reveals that 88% of projected biodiversity loss could be avoided through globally coordinated land-use planning, implying huge efficiency gains through international cooperation. However, global-scale optimization also implies a highly uneven distribution of costs and benefits, resulting in distinct winners and losers in terms of national economic development, food security, food sovereignty or conservation. Given conflicting national interests and lacking effective governance mechanisms to guarantee equitable compensation of losers, multinational land-use optimization seems politically unlikely. In turn, 61% of projected biodiversity loss could be avoided through nationally focused optimization, and 33% through optimization within just 10 countries. Targeted efforts to improve the capacity for integrated land-use planning for sustainable intensification especially in these countries, including the strengthening of institutions that can arbitrate subnational land-use conflicts, may offer an effective, yet politically feasible, avenue to better reconcile future trade-offs between agriculture and conservation. The efficiency gains of optimization remained robust when assuming that yields could only be increased to 80% of their potential. Our results highlight the need to better integrate real-world governance, political and economic challenges into sustainable development and global change mitigation research.

AB  - Global climate change poses a new challenge for species and can even push some species toward an extinction vortex. The most affected organisms are those with narrow tolerance to the climatic factors but many large mammals such as ungulates with a wider ecological niche are also being affected indirectly. Our research mainly used wild sheep in central Iran as a model species to explore how the suitable habitats will change under different climatic scenarios and to determine if current borders of protected areas will adequately protect habitat requirements. To create habitat models we used animal-vehicle collision points as an input for species presence data. We ran habitat models using MaxEnt modeling approach under different climatic scenarios of the past, present and future (under the climatic scenarios for minimum (RCP2.6) and maximum (RCP8.5) CO2 concentration trajectories). We tried to estimate the overlap and the width of the ecological niche using relevant metrics. In order to analyze the effectiveness of the protected areas, suitable maps were concerted to binary maps using True Skill Statistic (TSS) threshold and measured the similarity of the binary maps for each scenario using Kappa index. In order to assess the competence of the present protected areas boundary in covering the distribution of species, two different scenarios were employed, which are ensemble scenario 1: an ensemble of the binary maps of the species distribution in Mid-Holocene, present, and RCP2.6; and ensemble scenario 2: an ensemble of binary suitability maps in Mid-Holocene, present, and RCP8.5. Then, the borders of modeled habitats with the boundaries of 23 existing protected areas in two central provinces in Iran were compared. The predicted species distribution under scenario 1 (RCP2.6) was mostly similar to its current distribution (Kappa = 0.53) while the output model under scenario 2 (RCP8.5) indicated a decline in the species distribution range. Under the first ensemble scenario, current borders of the protected areas in Hamedan province showed better efficiency to cover the model species distribution range. Analyzing MaxEnt spatial models under the second climatic scenario suggested that protected areas in both Markazi and Hamedan provinces will not cover "high suitability" areas in the future. Modeling the efficiency of the current protected areas under predicted future climatic scenarios can help the related authorities to plan conservation activities more efficiently.

AB  - Human activity puts our oceans under multiple stresses, whose impacts are already significantly affecting biodiversity and physicochemical properties. Consequently, there is an increased international focus on the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, including the protection of fragile benthic biodiversity hotspots in the deep sea, identified as vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs). International VME risk assessment and conservation efforts are hampered because we largely do not know where VMEs are located. VME distribution modelling has increasingly been recommended to extend our knowledge beyond sparse observations. Nevertheless, the adoption of VME distribution models in spatial management planning and conservation remains limited. This work critically reviews VME distribution modelling studies, and recommends promising avenues to make VME models more relevant and impactful for policy and management decision making. First, there is an important interplay between the type of VME data used to build models and how the generated maps can be used in making management decisions, which is often ignored by model-builders. Overall, there is a need for more precise VME data for production of reliable models. We provide specific guidelines for seven common applications of VME distribution modelling to improve the matching between the modelling and the user need. Second, the current criteria to identify VME often rely on subjective thresholds, which limits the transparency, transferability and effective applicability of distribution models in protection measures. We encourage scientists towards founding their models on: (i) specific and quantitative definitions of what constitute a VME, (ii) site conservation value assessment in relation to VME multi-taxon spatial predictions, and (iii) explicitly mapping vulnerability. Along with the recent increase in both deep-sea biological and environmental data quality and quantity, these modelling recommendations can lead towards more cohesive summaries of VME's spatial distributions and their relative vulnerability, which should facilitate a more effective protection of these ecosystems, as has been mandated by numerous international agreements.

AB  - Red panda Ailurus fulgens, an endangered habitat specialist, inhabits a narrow distribution range in bamboo abundance forests along mountain slopes in the Himalaya and Hengduan Mountains. However, their habitat use may be different in places with different longitudinal environmental gradients, climatic regimes, and microclimate. This study aimed to determine the habitat variables affecting red panda distribution across different longitudinal gradients through a multivariate analysis. We studied habitat selection patterns along the longitudinal gradient in Nepal's Himalaya which is grouped into the eastern, central, and western complexes. We collected data on red panda presence and habitat variables (e.g., tree richness, canopy cover, bamboo abundance, water availability, tree diameter, tree height) by surveys along transects throughout the species' potential range. We used a multimodal inference approach with a generalized linear model to test the relative importance of environmental variables. Although the study showed that bamboo abundance had a major influence, habitat selection was different across longitudinal zones. Both canopy cover and species richness were unimportant in eastern Nepal, but their influence increased progressively toward the west. Conversely, tree height showed a decreasing influence on habitat selection from Eastern to Western Nepal. Red panda's habitat selection revealed in this study corresponds to the uneven distribution of vegetation assemblages and the dry climatic gradient along the eastern-western Himalayas which could be related to a need to conserve energy and thermoregulate. This study has further highlighted the need of importance of bamboo conservation and site-specific conservation planning to ensure long-term red panda conservation.

AB  - The Sierras Pampeanas Centrales, one of the most important extra-Andean mountain systems of Argentina, harbour endemic and threatened amphibian species. In the past century, two alien predatory fish species (brook trout and rainbow trout) were introduced into rivers and streams of the area where amphibian species breed. We hypothesized that the presence of trout would adversely affect the distribution of native amphibians in streams of the area. To test this hypothesis, the habitat requirements of trout and native amphibians were compared, and the effect of trout presence on amphibian occurrence was evaluated. Transects (n= 126) were surveyed along rivers and streams in high-altitude grasslands of the area, and the occurrences of trout and amphibians and habitat variables were recorded. The habitat requirements of each species were compared using multivariate methods. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate whether the occurrence of amphibians depends on trout, habitat variables or both. The distribution of each species between streams orders was assessed. The results showed that the presence of trout was the main factor conditioning the distribution of two endemic amphibian species (Boana cordobaeandOdontophrynus achalensis) in basins of the study area. This threat needs to be incorporated urgently into action plans to guide conservation efforts towards the management of trout populations.

AB  - Conservation of marine biodiversity requires understanding the joint influence of ongoing environmental change and fishing pressure. Addressing this challenge requires robust biodiversity monitoring and analyses that jointly account for potential drivers of change. Here, we ask how demersal fish biodiversity in Canadian Pacific waters has changed since 2003 and assess the degree to which these changes can be explained by environmental change and commercial fishing. Using a spatiotemporal multispecies model based on fisheries independent data, we find that species density (number of species per area) and community biomass have increased during this period. Environmental changes during this period were associated with temporal fluctuations in the biomass of species and the community as a whole. However, environmental changes were less associated with changes in species occurrence. Thus, the estimated increases in species density are not likely to be due to environmental change. Instead, our results are consistent with an ongoing recovery of the demersal fish community from a reduction in commercial fishing intensity from historical levels. These findings provide key insight into the drivers of biodiversity change that can inform ecosystem-based management.

AB  - The potential distribution of Olea ferruginea was predicted by Maxent model for present and the upcoming hypothetical (2050) climatic scenario. O. ferruginea is an economically beneficial plant species. For predicting the potential distribution of O. ferruginea in Pakistan, Worldclim variables for current and future climatic change scenarios, digital elevation model (DEM) slope, and aspects with the occurrence point were used. Pearson correlation was used to reject highly correlated variables. A total of 219 sighting points were used in the Maxent modeling. The area under curve (AUC) value was higher than 0.98. The approach used in this study is considered useful in predicting the potential distribution of O. ferruginea species, and can be an effective tool in the conservation and restoration planning for human welfare. The results show that there is a significant impact under future bioclimatic scenarios on the potential distribution of O. ferruginea in Pakistan. There is a significant decrease in the overall distribution of O. ferruginea due to loss of habitats under current distribution range, but this will be compensated by gain of habitat at higher altitudes in the future climate change scenario (habitat shift). It is recommended that the areas predicted suitable for the O. ferruginea may be used for plantation of this species while the deforested land should be restored for human welfare.

AB  - Conservation planning for protected species often relies on estimates of life-history parameters. A commonly used parameter is the instantaneous maximum population growth rate (r(max)) that can be used to limit removals and design recovery targets. Estimation of r(max) can be challenging because of limited availability of species- and population-specific data and life-history information. We applied a method proposed by Neil and Lebreton, originally developed for birds, to loggerhead turtles. The method uses age-at-first-reproduction and adult survival to estimate r(max). We used a variety of datasets and matrix population models to confirm an allometric assumption required by the method, and to generate estimates of age-at-first-reproduction and adult survival. A meta-analysis was applied to parameters from reported growth curves, which were then combined with the size distribution of neophyte nesters to derive estimates of age-at-first-reproduction. Adult survival rates were obtained from an existing matrix population model. Monte Carlo simulation was then used to combine the estimates of the allometric coefficients, age-at-first-reproduction, and adult survival to obtain a probability distribution of approximate r(max) values. Estimated annual maximum population growth rates averaged 0.024, with a mode of 0.017 and a 95% highest density interval of 0.006-0.047. These estimates were similar to values reported by others using different methods and captured the variability in positive, annual change estimates across nesting beach sites for the northwest Atlantic loggerhead population. The use of life-history parameters has a long history in wildlife and fisheries management and conservation planning. Our estimates of r(max), while having some biases and uncertainty, encompassed values presently used in recovery planning for loggerhead turtles and offer additional information for the management of endangered and threatened species.

AB  - Integrated regional planning aims to achieve sustainable development by considering multiple socio-economic, environmental, and ecological goals. However, determining the synergies and trade-offs between sustainability goals is a challenging task that requires an in depth analysis of the system-level effects of the implementation of planning policies. For example, polycentricity (i.e. multiple urban centres) is a common regional urban planning goal, which has shown to be beneficial for a region's socio-economic conditions, but may also change the configuration of the settlement network (i.e. settlements connected by roads and traffic). Given the dependency of animal species on well-connected habitat networks, another possible planning goal is to maximise habitat availability (i.e. the total amount of habitat that is accessible for an individual animal). However, changes to a region's settlement network can have a variety of impacts on the region's habitat networks. Due to these interactions, it is unclear whether maximising polycentricity and habitat availability are compatible planning goals. To address this question, we developed a mathematical model of interacting settlement and habitat networks in a region of Switzerland. The settlement network model allowed us to predict commuter and traffic flows in our study region under a certain distribution of jobs and people across the municipalities. The level of polycentricity in our region was measured by calculating the hierarchy in the commuter flow network. The traffic flow network was linked to the habitat network, which was used to calculate the mean habitat availability. With multi-objective optimisations, both polycentricity and habitat availability were maximised by changing the distributions of jobs and people. Although both goals could be improved compared to the current situation, there was a trade-off between polycentricity and habitat availability along the Pareto front. Developing the region towards either of the planning goals could be achieved by changing the distribution of jobs and people mainly in mid-sized municipalities and by a strong collaboration between municipalities. Our results increase the understanding of the complex interactions in urban regions and can lead to recommendations for integrated urban and conservation planning.

AB  - The black vanilla orchid (Nigritella nigra s.l.) is a perennial plant found in the main European mountain ranges. It occurs in large numbers in the Alps, but it has become a rare and endangered species in Scandinavia due to the loss of suitable habitats. Here we present occurrence data on the occurrence of N. nigra s.l. and pollinators of this species which were used to evaluate the impact of climate change on the future distribution of the black vanilla orchid and its pollen vectors. Moreover, the values of bioclimatic variables for each locality are provided. The binary distribution models of both, orchids and insects, created using ecological niche modeling (ENM) technique are presented together with the information about changes in the coverage of suitable niches of studied organisms. Our data were used to evaluate the impact of climate change on orchid and its pollinator (https://doi.org/10.1016/ j.gecco.2021.e01560) and datasets can be reused in other research on past and future distribution of suitable niches of the black vanilla orchid and its pollinators as well as in other biogeographical studies. Moreover, presented outcomes of research can be useful in establishing conservation plans for montane orchids and their pollinators. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Rosa odorata var. gigantea is one of the most important ancestors of modern roses, which owns many merit traits including large flower, early flowering, and tea scent. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it has been listed as a rare and endangered species in China. In this study, a total of 424 accessions from 27 locations across its major distribution range were sampled. Its genetic diversity and population structure were assessed using a combination of seven nuclear microsatellite markers and one single-copy nuclear gene. Moderate to high within-population genetic diversity and moderate differentiation among populations were revealed despite its narrow distribution. The sampled 27 populations were resolved into two genetic clusters with limited contemporary and historical gene flows. The Red River Fault Zone was inferred to be a physical or geographical barrier to gene flow between these two genetic clusters. Genetic distances were significantly associated with geographic distances, indicating the isolation-by-distance model. Our ecological niche modeling indicated that R. odorata var. gigantea had high current potential areas in the central Yunnan province and substantial losses of high potential distribution areas in the western Yunnan in the future. Two detected clusters showed significant genetic differentiation and represented two separate evolutionary lineages, which should be recognized as two evolutionary significant units ( ESUs) for conservation concerns. These results could be applied for the decision-making and conservation planning for this important species.

AB  - This study presents a quantitative approach to mapping benthophagous fish feeding grounds. This approach combines the spatial biomass distribution of benthic prey items and their importance for the diets of predators. A point based biomass data of macrozoobenthos together with a, set of environmental factors was used to develop Random Forests models that produce continuous biomass distribution layers for individual prey species. Depending on the diet composition and the importance of prey for fish feeding, these layers are overlaid and an integrated GIS map of the seabed showing the quality of feeding grounds is generated. These maps provide a useful basis for conservation and marine spatial planning. In addition, this method could be applied to the mapping of resources used by other benthophagous organisms. The method is presented using the example of three common Baltic fish species: cod, flounder and viviparous eelpout.

AB  - Revegetation of massively altered landscapes for multiple benefits (including biodiversity and ecological function) has accelerated over the past two decades in southern Australia. However, much of the action has been conducted piecemeal, with little apparent strategy. We consider here replanted woodlands on the floodplain of the Murray River, northern Victoria, Australia. All are small in area (< 18 ha) and recent (< 30 years) and have been planted with appropriate trees and shrubs. We employed a scoring system devised to rapidly measure bird breeding success and linked these results to in-site and landscape variables. Most bird species using the replantings were those that are tolerant of much disturbed landscapes and of open country. Factors related to breeding success were different for each of the six species for which inferences could be made, indicating that it would be difficult to simultaneously plan for all species. Birds characteristic of the major forest floodplain remnants were poorly represented and there was little evidence of their breeding in the replantings. The value of the replanted sites for birds is marginal at present, although it may be that the sites are still too young to have realized their usefulness for species of conservation concern. We believe that most production landscapes in this region have far too little native vegetation to support the many species that are declining, and more strategic planning is necessary to overcome these deficiencies.

AB  - 1. Under the effects of rapid environmental change, such as climate change and land degradation, assessment of plant species potential distribution is becoming increasingly important for conservation purposes. Moreover, land administrators need reliable predictions of species suitability for planning a wide range of management activities.
   2. In this study, we used the recent Maxent algorithm for modelling the niche of Arnica montana within a Site of Community Importance in the Alps, with the ultimate aim of providing a rigorous evidence base for management of this locally threatened species. We built a final suitability map taking into account (i) the minimization of spatial autocorrelation through the use of a constrained random split of sampled data; (ii) the use of a stepwise selection of predictors in order to obtain a reduced model containing only meaningful variables; (iii) the comparison of the predictive power of three sets of environmental predictors; (iv) the identification of the most suitable areas by overlaying predictions of three competing models; (v) the use of divergence maps as a complement to conventional performance comparison assessments.
   3. Maxent improved accuracy both on training and test data sets. Elevation, geomorphology and hosting habitats performed as effective primary predictors. A reduced model based on the outcomes of a preliminary stepwise selection analysis of predictors gave the best accuracy score on test data. Two parts of the study area have been selected for management as a result of areas of agreement between the three competing models.
   4. Synthesis and applications. There remain important methodological issues that need to be improved in order to increase confidence in niche modelling and ensure that reintroduction and management activities for threatened or rare plant species are based on reliable distribution models. Modellers can improve predictions of plant distribution by addressing methodological topics that are often overlooked, as demonstrated for A. montana in this study.

AB  - For the design and declaration of conservation areas as well as for planning habitat management it is important to quantitatively know the habitat preferences of the focal species. To take into account the requirements of as many species as possible, it would be of great advantage if one would either (i) find one or several species whose habitat requirements cover those of a large number of other species or if one could (ii) identify a common set of habitat parameters that is important for the occurrence of many species. Ideally such common habitat parameters should be easy to measure. Only then they may be of practical value in applied conservation biology.
   In this study, we compared the habitat preferences of different insect species (grasshoppers, bush crickets, butterflies, moths) in the same region by applying identical methods. To identify common explanatory variables that predict the occurrence probability of these species, we first tested the transferability of the specific 'species models' to other species within the same insect group. We tested how well the incidence of one species can be predicted by the occurrence probability of another species. The 'best' models within each group were then tested for transferability between the different groups. Additionally, we tested the predictive power of the predictor variable 'habitat type' as an easy and often available measure for conservation practice.
   Although in the different 'species models' different key factors determine habitat suitability, some models were successfully transferred and were able to reasonably predict the distribution of other species. The habitat preferences of the burnet moth Zygaena carniolica were particularly well suited for the prediction of suitable habitats for all other species. In addition, the predictor variable 'habitat type' played a dominant role in all models. Models using this aggregated predictor variable may well predict suitable habitat for all species.

AB  - Habitat availability ultimately limits the distribution and abundance of wildlife species. Consequently, it is paramount to identify where wildlife habitat is and understand how it changes over time in order to implement large-scale wildlife conservation plans. Yet, no work has quantified the degree of change in range-wide breeding habitat for the Golden-cheeked Warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia), despite the species being listed as endangered by the U. S. Federal Government. Thus, using available GIS data and Landsat imagery we quantified range-wide warbler breeding habitat change from 1999-2001 to 2010-2011. We detected a 29% reduction in total warbler breeding habitat and found that warbler breeding habitat was removed and became more fragmented at uneven rates across the warbler's breeding range during this time period. This information will assist researchers and managers in prioritizing breeding habitat conservation efforts for the species and provides a foundation for more realistic carrying capacity scenarios when modeling Golden-cheeked Warbler populations over time. Additionally, this study highlights the need for future work centered on quantifying Golden-cheeked Warbler movement rates and distances in order to assess the degree of connectivity between increasingly fragmented habitat patches.

AB  - Species Distribution Models (SDMs) constitute an important tool to assist decision-making in environmental conservation and planning in the context of climate change. Nevertheless, SDM projections are affected by a wide range of uncertainty factors (related to training data, climate projections and SDM techniques), which limit their potential value and credibility. The new package mopa provides tools for designing comprehensive multi-factor SDM ensemble experiments, combining multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g. baseline climate, pseudo-absence realizations, SDM techniques, future projections) and allowing to assess their contribution to the overall spread of the ensemble projection. In addition, mopa is seamlessly integrated with the climate4R bundle and allows straightforward retrieval and post-processing of state-of-the-art climate datasets (including observations and climate change projections), thus facilitating the proper analysis of key uncertainty factors related to climate data.

AB  - Wildfire-generated snags provide key habitat for wildlife associated with recently disturbed forests, offering nesting and foraging resources for several woodpecker species. Snag harvest through post-fire salvage logging provides economic value but reduces habitat in recently burned forests. Managers of recently burned forests often must identify suitable woodpecker habitat within timeframes precluding field surveys. We developed nesting habitat suitability models for the Lewis's woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis)-a species of conservation concern potentially impacted by salvage logging-to inform post-fire management planning that includes habitat conservation objectives. Using weighted logistic regression, we selected models that maximized predictive performance measured by spatial cross-validation to verify model applicability to novel wildfire locations. From 1994 to 2018, we monitored 348 nest sites, <= 5 years post-fire, at four wildfire locations across the Inland Pacific Northwest, USA. We used both exclusively remotely sensed covariates (to support habitat mapping) and a combination of remotely sensed and field collected covariates (to inform logging prescriptions). Top models proved predictive of nest distribution across novel wildfire locations, describing positive relationships with local and landscape-scale burn severity, landscape-scale open (0-10%) and low (10-40%) canopy cover, large nest tree diameters, locally high snag densities, and southeast-facing slopes. The top combination model was more discriminating of nest from non-nest sites compared to the top remotely sensed model (RPI = 0.976 vs. 0.733, AUC= 0.794 vs. 0.716), indicating the value of vegetation field measurements for quantifying habitat. Herein is exemplified an effective process for developing and evaluating predictive habitat models, broadly applicable, and useful for prioritization of post-fire forest management objectives.

AB  - Long-term monitoring programs must use informative yet cost-effective methods. Occupancy estimates that incorporate detection probabilities are used with increasing frequency to describe species status and make management recommendations. Estimating changes in the occupancy of points over time in response to management actions or environmental changes may be especially useful for management of the Palm Springs round-tailed ground squirrel (Spermophilus tereticaudus chlorus), a subspecies covered under the Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan and Natural Community Conservation Plan. In 2002 and 2003, we estimated occupancy and detection probability of ground squirrels across lands modeled as ground squirrel habitat by the Scientific Advisory Committee for the Habitat Conservation Plan and tested a priori hypotheses about how occupancy varied among vegetation and substrate types. In the 2003 study, we asked whether these associations were affected by winter rains after the 2002 drought year. Occupancy in 2003 was estimated at 0.99 (SE = 0.01) in Western honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) on dunes and hummocks, and occupancy of the remaining modeled habitat was best described by distance to mesquite, with the occupancy probability decreasing with increasing distance from mesquite on dunes or hummocks. The best-supported model in 2002 described the distribution of ground squirrels as a function of only vegetation and substrate type. However, the best-supported models in 2003 suggested that distance to mesquite was a component of the occupancy of non-mesquite vegetation. Mesquite seems to provide high-quality habitat that can support ground squirrels at high occupancy probabilities that may breed successfully every year. In contrast, other vegetation types provide low-quality habitat that can only support ground squirrels at low occupancy probabilities that may only breed occasionally. Mesquite could be an essential refugium during drought years, and the 4 best-supported models in 2003 suggest that restoration of mesquite beginning near currently occupied mesquite patches could be critical for maintaining ground squirrel populations on the preserves.

AB  - Mediterranean islands (MI) are hotspots of global biodiversity and lie in one of the most susceptible to climate change (CC) areas of the world; a big challenge for any conservation strategy. In fact, there is already increasing evidence for CC in the region and associated biological responses in MI ecosystems. These include phenological changes and upward elevation shifts of species and plant communities; although evidence is frequently contrasting for different taxa. Threats are also evident, mainly for endemic species from most taxonomic groups, while communities in mountain and coastal regions are likely to be affected most. For MI conservation under CC additional factors need to be considered: (i) their position at the crossroads of three continents; with which they share common environmental characteristics, (ii) their great variability in sizes and topography and (iii) their climatic differences; with a clear west-east basin divide. CC synergies with changing tourist aspiration and agricultural practices will, in the medium term, modify island landscapes and provide further challenges for biodiversity conservation. Such a combined impact from CC, land-use change, fragmentation of habitats and tourism is difficult to predict. Furthermore, the limited space on islands (especially habitat availability and climatic range limitations) imposes a barrier to species range expansion. Thus, conservation of MI biodiversity under CC requires: (i) future research to focus on improved climate predictions linked to improved understanding of ecological (climate-biotic) responses, incorporating lessons learnt from (island) biogeography, (ii) specific adaptation measures for spatial planning and improvement in regional institutional capacities.

AB  - Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies to reduce emerging climate-related threats. We used the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt model) to assess potential changes in suitable snow leopard (Panthera uncia) habitat in Qinghai Province, China, under a mild climate change scenario. Our results showed that the area of suitable snow leopard habitat in Qinghai Province was 302,821 km(2) under current conditions and 228,997 km(2) under the 2050s climatic scenario, with a mean upward shift in elevation of 90 m. At present, nature reserves protect 38.78% of currently suitable habitat and will protect 42.56% of future suitable habitat. Current areas of climate refugia amounted to 212,341 km(2) and are mainly distributed in the Sanjiangyuan region, Qilian mountains, and surrounding areas. Our results provide valuable information for formulating strategies to meet future conservation challenges brought on by climate stress. We suggest that conservation efforts in Qinghai Province should focus on protecting areas of climate refugia and on maintaining or building corridors when planning for future species management.

AB  - Many studies have estimated the parameters of metapopulation dynamics by assuming a steady-state habitat-occupation pattern by organisms. However, metapopulations of woody plants in suburban landscapes rarely attain a steady state owing to the long life spans of individuals. We constructed a colonization model for woody plants based on the distance from a seed-source patch containing mother trees. It is easy to determine colonization parameters with this method, which makes the method useful for conservation planning. Distance from the seed source was the most important factor for predicting the presence of juveniles in a destination patch. The probability of colonization was estimated as a logistic function of the distance from the nearest seed source. Patch-level simulations using actual colonization parameters and forest distributions (based on field measurements) showed that about half the species studied in Yokohama (Japan) would fail to recolonize the studied region for at least 20 generations. Moreover, patch density was too sparse for 30% of the studied species, which will thus be unable to expand their distributions and reverse local extinctions. Dominant species of the region's climax forest will not reach vacant patches, and normal vegetation succession will be obstructed.

AB  - Aim Rare aquatic species are a substantial component of biodiversity, and their conservation is a major objective of many management plans. However, they are difficult to assess, and their optimal habitats are often poorly known. Methods to effectively predict the likely locations of suitable rare aquatic species habitats are needed. We combine two modelling approaches to predict occurrence and general abundance of several rare fish species. Location Allegheny watershed of western New York State (USA) Methods Our method used two empirical neural network modelling approaches (species specific and assemblage based) to predict stream-by-stream occurrence and general abundance of rare darters, based on broad-scale habitat conditions. Species-specific models were developed for longhead darter (Percina macrocephala), spotted darter (Etheostoma maculatum) and variegate darter (Etheostoma variatum) in the Allegheny drainage. An additional model predicted the type of rare darter-containing assemblage expected in each stream reach. Predictions from both models were then combined inclusively and exclusively and compared with additional independent data. Results Example rare darter predictions demonstrate the method's effectiveness. Models performed well (R20.79), identified where suitable darter habitat was most likely to occur, and predictions matched well to those of collection sites. Additional independent data showed that the most conservative (exclusive) model slightly underestimated the distributions of these rare darters or predictions were displaced by one stream reach, suggesting that new darter habitat types were detected in the later collections. Main conclusions Broad-scale habitat variables can be used to effectively identify rare species' habitats. Combining species-specific and assemblage-based models enhances our ability to make use of the sparse data on rare species and to identify habitat units most likely and least likely to support those species. This hybrid approach may assist managers with the prioritization of habitats to be examined or conserved for rare species.

AB  - Malaysia is a megadiverse country and listed as one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. Land use changes and deforestation have led to the threat of, and extinction of plant species. In order to mitigate loss in population numbers, and to prevent species extinction events, Important Plant Areas (IPA) for Malaysia shall be identified. The identification of IPA is important to ensure that key natural areas are adequately protected and managed to preserve the species and its habitats. Currently, there are 1771 IPA identified globally and only seven tropical countries are actively involved excluding Malaysia. Inventory and biodiversity research are actively conducted in Malaysia, however, the initiative to identify IPA is still in its infancy. The first attempt for IPA identification was in the state of Terengganu by using herbarium database through scoring technique. In this paper, we discussed methods and criteria used in IPA identification globally. We also deliberated current IPA development in Terengganu and challenges such as collections biases and the need for a robust scoring technique to reduce judgement uncertainty. We suggested GIS based multi-criteria decision making, analytical hierarchy process and species distribution for Malaysian IPA. These strategies were considered to be effective tools in providing decision support for spatial planning aimed at plant conservation in Malaysia.

AB  - Appropriate field survey methods and robust modeling approaches play an important role in wildlife protection and habitat management because reliable information on wildlife distribution and abundance is important for conservation planning and actions. However, accurately estimating animal abundance is challenging in most species, as usually only a small proportion of the population can be detected during surveys. Species distribution models can predict the habitat suitability index, which differs from species abundance. We designed a method to adjust the results from species distribution models to achieve better accuracy for abundance estimation. This method comprises four steps: (1) conducting distance sampling, recording species occurrences, and surveying routes; (2) performing species distribution modeling using occurrence records and predicting animal abundance in each quadrat in the study area; (3) comparing the difference between field survey results and predicted abundance in quadrats along survey routes, adjusting model prediction, and summing up to obtain total abundance in the study area; (4) calculating uncertainty from three sources, i.e., distance sampling (using detection rate), species distribution models (using R squared), and differences between the field survey and model prediction [using the standard deviation of the ratio (observation/prediction) at different zones]. We developed an R package called abundanceR to estimate wildlife abundance and provided data for the Tibetan wild ass (Equus kiang) based on field surveys at the Three-River-Source National Park, as well as 29 layers of environmental variables covering the terrestrial areas of the planet. Our method can provide accurate estimation of abundance for animals inhabiting open areas that can be easily observed during distance sampling, and whose spatial heterogeneity of animal density within the study area can be accurately predicted using species distribution models.

AB  - Determining the spatial scale at which landscape features influence population persistence is an important task for conservation planning. One challenge is that sampling biases confound factors that influence species occurrence and survey effort. Recent developments in Point Process Models (PPMs) enable researchers to disentangle the sampling process from ecological drivers of species' distributions. Land-cover change is a driver of decline for the western spadefoot (Spea hammondii), which has been extirpated from much of its range in California. Assessing this species' status requires information on the current distribution of suitable habitat within its historical range, but little is known about the effect of the landscape surrounding breeding ponds on spadefoot occurrence. Critically, surveys for western spadefoots often occur along roads, potentially biasing data used to fit species distribution models. We created PPMs integrating historical presence/non-detection and presence-only data for western spadefoots and land-cover data at multiple spatial scales to model the distribution of this species while removing the influence of sampling bias. There was spatial sampling bias in presence-only data; records were more likely to be reported near roads and urban centers and PPMs that removed sampling bias outperformed models that ignored sampling bias. The occurrence of western spadefoots was positively related to the proportion of grassland within a 2000 m buffer. The remaining habitat for western spadefoots is largely found in the foothills surrounding California's Central Valley. Our study illustrates how PPMs can improve projections of habitat suitability and our understanding of the drivers of species' distributions.

AB  - Aim Asian forests are becoming increasingly degraded and fragmented by the extensive intensification of anthropogenic activities; these activities threaten wildlife and ecosystem sustainability. Facing a defaunation crisis, managers need more information on species assemblages to guide conservation efforts. We tested the relative influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on mammalian species richness and occupancy in temperate forests in Northeast Asia.
   Location Northeast China.
   Methods Camera-trapping data and multispecies occupancy models were used to estimate the species richness of a terrestrial mammal community in a working landscape and assess community-, group-, and species-specific responses to natural and anthropogenic features while accounting for imperfect detection. Species were grouped based on body size, diet and activity pattern.
   Results We deployed 138 cameras and photographed 21 mammalian species over 22,976 trap days across the China-Russia border. Both natural and anthropogenic correlates varied in their importance in predicting the presence of different animals. Vegetation cover and cattle were found to have significantly positive and negative influences on community-level mammalian occupancy, respectively. The positive relationship with vegetation cover was most evident for large or diurnal species; the negative relationship with cattle was most evident for diurnal and wild ungulate species. Large species occupancy was also negatively associated with human settlements. The predicted richness across each station varied from 5 to 14 unique species, and species had a mean occupancy probability of 0.45 (95% credible interval = 0.09-0.86). Species richness was generally the lowest in livestock grazing areas and close to human settlements. Human influence is more important than the influences of vegetation and environmental variables.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight that livestock grazing was the primary human disturbance that had a negative impact on species occupancy and richness. Multispecies occupancy models helped to identify drivers of biodiversity declines and will inform conservation strategies in human-dominated landscapes in Northeast Asian forests. We suggest that landscape conservation planning seeks to maximize forest protection and ecosystem services such as biodiversity and carbon storage.

AB  - In this study, we propose a novel strategy for identifying potential hotspots of avian roadkills in Europe. The proposed approach combines information about the spatial distribution of bird species at a comparatively higher risk of roadkill with data on road density. First, using a large dataset collected from several European studies and reports, we extracted the frequency of occurrence of bird casualties for 209 breeding bird species recorded in roadkill events. We standardized the relative frequency of roadkill from 0 (species never recorded in bird casualties' reports) to 1 (species with the higher number of roadkill's), obtaining a continuous variable that indicates the potential risk of roadkill species by species. Second, using published data on the spatial distribution of breeding bird species in Europe, we calculated the cumulative risk of roadkill in each bird assemblages, by considering the sum of the values estimated for each species in the previous step. Third, we calculated the road density in each spatial unit. Finally, we elaborate a forecasting map of potential avian roadkill-risk across Europe, by combining the data on road density and cumulative roadkill risk of bird communities.
   The tool proposed can help to identify potential hotspots at different spatial scales where the risk of avian roadkill is high, offering the possibility to improve conservation measures in road planning. Briefly, the prediction of where there is aligned convergence between communities with highly ranked species and landscapes with dense road networks can be used in procedures modelling wildlife-car collisions, for transportation mitigation projects.

AB  - We conducted a GIS spatial analysis with the aim of providing the first quantitative large-scale overview of the distribution patterns of 1536 type localities (loci classici) of 1216 Italian endemic vascular plants and their relationship with a set of descriptive variables. Whereas some variables were used to model the presence-absence distribution patterns of the type localities for the whole set of endemics as well as for the subset of narrow endemics, others (e.g., presence inside or outside protected areas and Italian Important Plant Areas) were considered with the purpose of assessing potential assets or risks for conservation.
   The largest number of type localities was found within the Mediterranean biogeographic region (1134), followed by the Alpine region (306) and Continental region (96). A total of 670 locations are located on islands, whereas 866 are located on the Italian mainland (139 and 124 in the case of narrow endemics, respectively). A large number of type localities are located in mountainous areas and along the coastline, which can be seen as a potential risk for conservation. On the contrary, we detected a positive correlation with the distance from roads, which might be considered to be an asset. Importantly, 1030 type localities fall inside protected areas, whereas 506 localities fall outside protected areas, with 259 of these unprotected localities on islands.
   We propose considering the results of the analysis of the distribution of type localities of Italian endemics to be a strategic tool for conservation planning and resource management. Application of plant micro-reserves and integration of diverse legislation tools are suggested to strengthen efforts and increase conservation success.

AB  - Simple Summary The lily leaf beetle,Lilioceris liliiScopoli (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an invasive pest of cultivated and native lilies (Liliaceae). This Eurasian beetle was introduced to North America in 1943, and can now be found in nine provinces and 14 states. The lily leaf beetle has already been found feeding and reproducing on several eastern species of native lilies. To help predict whereL. lilliiwill be able to establish in North America and which native Liliaceae species will be vulnerable to attack, a habitat suitability model was created. This model uses specimen location data along with environmental data to produce habitat suitability estimates between 0 (low suitability) and 1 (high suitability). Model results indicate that the beetle should be able to establish throughout the range of most North American Liliaceae, including species of special conservation concern. With the increased utilization of habitat suitability models in conservation management, this model should be consulted, to help plan preemptive monitoring and control efforts forL. liliiin regions, with Liliaceae species of conservation concern. Invasive species are among the leading threats to global ecosystems due to impacts on native flora and fauna through competition and predation. The lily leaf beetle,Lilioceris liliiScopoli (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an invasive pest of lilies (Liliumspp.) and other genera of Liliaceae (Liliales). A habitat suitability model was created using Maxent, to help predict ifL. liliiwill be able to establish in locations were native North American Liliaceae species grow. The model was created using georeferenced occurrence records from the beetle's native, naturalized, and invasive range. Model results indicate that precipitation in the driest quarter and annual average temperatures are most strongly correlated withL. liliidistribution, and suggest that the species will perform poorly in very dry, hot, or cold environments. The model also indicates that the beetle should be able to establish throughout the range of most North American Liliaceae genera, including species of special conservation concern. This model can be used by natural area managers to identify areas of high habitat suitability that overlap with vulnerable North American Liliaceae species, and prioritizeL. liliimonitoring and control activities as the beetle continues to expand its range.

AB  - 1. Visualizing the distribution of rare or threatened species is necessary for effective implementation of conservation initiatives. Generalized linear models and geographical information systems (GIS) are now powerful tools for conservation planning, but issues of data availability, scale and model extrapolation complicate some applications.
   2. Mountain caribou are an endangered ecotype of woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou that occurs across central and southern British Columbia, Canada. Currently, conservation professionals use coarse small-scale maps of important habitats to manage forest harvesting and human access across the northern extent of mountain caribou range. These maps were produced before the advent of readily available digital spatial information and are based on expert opinion and limited empirical data.
   3. With the purpose of refining existing maps, we used survey results, radio-telemetry locations and GIS data to construct resource selection functions (RSF) that quantified the habitat affinities and predicted the relative probability of occurrence of mountain caribou at two spatial scales. At the scale of the patch, the most parsimonious RSF model consisted of covariates for vegetation and aptly predicted the occurrence of caribou across low- to mid-elevation habitats, but performed poorly across steep alpine terrain. At the landscape scale, a model containing Gaussian terms for elevation and slope was effective at predicting the broader distribution of caribou.
   4. We produced a map consisting of the product of the relative probabilities of the patch and landscape RSF. The final map represented the relative probability of occurrence of caribou in vegetative patches weighted by the relative probability of occurrence across the larger study area. We found strong agreement between current definitions of important caribou habitats developed from expert opinion and RSF-based maps generated from empirical data.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Both expert opinion and RSF-based approaches offer unique advantages for conservation mapping. Interpretability of results, documentation and repeatability of methods and data, estimates of precision and costs should all be considered when evaluating a technique. We argue that for some species and geographical locations, RSF is a superior technique, but expert opinion should play a role in model development and interpretation.

AB  - Restoration of the Florida Everglades, a substantial wetland ecosystem within the United States, is one of the largest ongoing restoration projects in the world. Decision-makers and managers within the Everglades ecosystem rely on ecological models forecasting indicator wildlife response to changes in the management of water flows within the system. One such indicator of ecosystem health, the presence of wading bird communities on the landscape, is currently assessed using three species distribution models that assume perfect detection and report output on different scales that are challenging to compare against one another. We sought to use current advancements in species distribution modeling to improve models of Everglades wading bird distribution. Using a joint species distribution model that accounted for imperfect detection, we modeled the presence of nine species of wading bird simultaneously in response to annual hydrologic conditions and landscape characteristics within the Everglades system. Our resulting model improved upon the previous model in three key ways: 1) the model predicts probability of occupancy for the nine species on a scale of 0-1, making the output more intuitive and easily comparable for managers and decision-makers that must consider the responses of several species simultaneously; 2) through joint species modeling, we were able to consider rarer species within the modeling that otherwise are detected in too few numbers to fit as individual models; and 3) the model explicitly allows detection probability of species to be less than 1 which can reduce bias in the site occupancy estimates. These improvements are essential as Everglades restoration continues and managers require models that consider the impacts of water management on key indicator wildlife such as the wading bird community.

AB  - Managers require quantitative yet tractable tools that identify areas for restoration yielding effective benefits for targeted wildlife species and the ecosystems they inhabit. As a contemporary example of high national significance for conservation, the persistence of Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in the Great Basin is compromised by strongly interacting stressors of conifer expansion, annual grass invasion, and more frequent wildfires occurring in sagebrush ecosystems. Associated restoration treatments to a sagebrush-dominated state are often costly and may yield relatively little ecological benefit to sage-grouse if implemented without estimating how Sage-grouse may respond to treatments, or do not consider underlying processes influencing sagebrush ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasive species. Here, we describe example applications of a spatially explicit conservation planning tool (CPT) to inform prioritization of: (1) removal of conifers (i.e., pinyon-juniper); and (2) wildfire restoration aimed at improving habitat conditions for the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment of Sage-grouse along the California-Nevada state line. The CPT measures ecological benefits to sage-grouse for a given management action through a composite index comprised of resource selection functions and estimates of abundance and space use. For pinyon-juniper removal, we simulated changes in land-cover composition following the removal of sparse trees with intact understories, and ranked treatments on the basis of changes in ecological benefits per dollar-unit of cost. For wildfire restoration, we formulated a conditional model to simulate scenarios for land cover changes (e.g., sagebrush to annual grass) given estimated fire severity and underlying ecosystem processes influencing resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasion by annual grasses. For both applications, we compared CPT rankings to land cover changes along with sagebrush resistance and resilience metrics. Model results demonstrated how the CPT can be an important step in identifying management projects that yield the highest quantifiable benefit to Sage-grouse while avoiding costly misallocation of resources, and highlight the importance of considering changes in sage-grouse ecological response and factors influencing sagebrush ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasion. This unique framework can be adopted to help inform other management questions aimed at improving habitat for other species across sagebrush and other ecosystems.

AB  - The thermal environment limits species ranges through its influence on physiology and resource distributions and thus affects species richness patterns over broad spatial scales. Understanding how temperature drives species richness patterns is particularly important in the context of global change and for effective conservation planning. Landsat 8's Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) allows direct mapping of temperature at moderate spatial resolutions (100 m, downscaled by the USGS to 30 m), overcoming limitations inherent in coarse interpolated weather station data that poorly capture fine-scale temperature patterns over broad areas. TIRS data thus offer the unique opportunity to understand how the thermal environment influences species richness patterns. Our aim was to develop and assess the ability of TIRS-based temperature metrics to predict patterns of winter bird richness across the conterminous United States during winter, a period of marked temperature stress for birds. We used TIRS data from 2013-2018 to derive metrics of relative temperature and intra-seasonal thermal heterogeneity. To quantify winter bird richness across the conterminous US, we tabulated the richness only for resident bird species, i.e., those species that do not move between the winter and breeding seasons, from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, the most extensive survey of birds in the US. We expected that relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity would have strong positive associations with winter bird richness because colder temperatures heighten temperature stress for birds, and thermal heterogeneity is a proxy for thermal niches and potential thermal refugia that can support more species. We further expected that both the strength of the effects and the relative importance of these variables would be greater for species with greater climate sensitivity, such as small-bodied species and climate-threatened species (i.e., those with large discrepancies between their current and future distributions following projected climate change). Consistent with our predictions, relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity strongly positively influenced winter bird richness patterns, with statistical models explaining 37.3% of the variance in resident bird richness. Thermal heterogeneity was the strongest predictor of small-bodied and climate-threatened species in our models, whereas relative temperature was the strongest predictor of large-bodied and climate-stable species. Our results demonstrate the important role that the thermal environment plays in governing winter bird richness patterns and highlight the previously underappreciated role that intra-seasonal thermal heterogeneity may have in supporting high winter bird species richness. Our findings thus illustrate the exciting potential for TIRS data to guide conservation planning in an era of global change.

AB  - 1. Systematic conservation planning is a process widely used in terrestrial and marine environments. A principal goal is to establish a network of protected areas representing the full variety of species or ecosystems. We suggest considering three key attributes of a catchment when planning for aquatic conservation: irreplaceability, condition and vulnerability.
   2. Based on observed and modelled distributions of 367 invertebrates in the Australian state of Victoria, conservation value was measured by calculating an irreplaceability coefficient for 1854 subcatchments. Irreplaceability indicates the likelihood of any subcatchment being needed to achieve conservation targets. We estimated it with a bootstrapped heuristic reserve design algorithm, which included upstream-downstream connectivity rules. The selection metric within the algorithm was total summed rarity, corrected for protected area.
   3. Condition was estimated using a stressor gradient approach in which two classes of geographical information system Layers were summarised using principal components analysis. The first class was disturbance measures such as nutrient and sediment budgets, salinisation and weed cover. The second class was land use layers, including classes of forestry, agricultural and urban use. The main gradient, explaining 56% of the variation, could be characterised as agricultural disturbance. Seventy-five per cent of the study area was classified as disturbed.
   4. Our definition of vulnerability was the likelihood of a catchment being exposed to a land use that degrades its condition. This was estimated by comparing land capability and current land use. If land was capable of supporting a land use that would have a more degrading effect on a river than its current tenure, it was classified vulnerable (66% of the study area). 79% of catchments contained more then 50% vulnerable land.
   5. When integrating the three measures, two major groups of catchments requiring urgent conservation measures were identified. Seven per cent of catchments were highly irreplaceable, highly vulnerable but in degraded condition. These catchments were flagged for restoration. While most highly irreplaceable catchments in good condition were already protected, 2.5% of catchments in this category are on vulnerable land. These are priority areas for assigning river reserves.

AB  - Fish species richness (FSR) has been widely used as an indicator of both ecological variation and fish biodiversity. On global and local scales, FSR has been declining due to human impact. Species distribution models, such as conventional regression techniques and machine learning methods, have played a critical role in predicting the distribution of FSR in estuarine systems. The Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) is the largest estuarine ecosystem in the western Pacific Ocean. It is a muddy estuary providing many important ecosystem functioning services acting as spawning, feeding, and nursing grounds for a variety of valuable commercial species such as Coilia ectenes and Muraenesox cinereus. Despite this, the spatial distribution of FSR in the YRE has not been estimated. In this study, four modelling approaches (generalized linear model, generalized additive model, regression tree, and boosted regression tree) are applied to predict FSR in the YRE. Model performance was compared by evaluating the fit and predictive performance via deviation explained, root mean squared error, and cross-validation. Finally, the spatial distribution of FSR was estimated by the optimal model. It was shown that a regression tree approach outperformed the other methods. Additionally, regression tree modelling captured the overall distribution pattern of FSR in the YRE. The factors that appear to be contributing to the distribution pattern of FSR in the YRE included environmental conditions, fish migrations, and local physical characteristics (e.g. runoff and tide). The results from this study could provide guidance for the conservation planning and spatial management of the YRE. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The successful management and eradication of invasive species is often constrained by insufficient or inconsistent funding. Consequently, managers are usually forced to select a subset of infested areas to manage. Further, managers may be unaware of the most effective methods for identifying priority areas and so are unable to maximize the effectiveness of their limited resources. To address these issues, we present a spatially explicit decision method that can be used to identify actions to manage invasive species while minimizing costs and the likelihood of reinvasion. We apply the method to a real-world management scenario, aimed at managing an invasive aquatic macrophyte, olive hymenachne (Hymenachne amplexicaulis), which is one of the most threatening invasives in tropical Australia, affecting water quality, freshwater biodiversity, and fisheries.

AB  - Aim
   The aim of this analysis was to identify strategies that will maximize efficiency and effectiveness in conservation planning. As many orchids are threatened with extinction for various reasons, our primary objective was to combine hotspots analyses with stochastic extinction modelling to highlight possible conservation priorities for Lepanthes spp. (Orchidaceae) based on patterns of richness, rarity and threat. Our subsequent objective was to identify potential conservation surrogates and variables that are the best predictors of extinction probabilities. The ultimate goal was to determine which factors should be emphasized in conservation planning to prevent species extinctions.
   Location
   Latin America; the Caribbean.
   Methods
   We used herbarium records and ArcGIS to map the distribution of Lepanthes spp. and to identify hotspots of richness and rarity. We forecasted extinction patterns with Koopowitz's stochastic extinction model and calculated extinction probabilities in each country. We used a randomForest regression model in R to assess the importance of richness, rarity and threat for explaining extinction probabilities.
   Results
   Hotspots of Lepanthes richness and rarity occurred in north-western South America and southern Central America and largely overlapped with each other. The highest extinction probabilities occurred in northern Central America, Haiti and Ecuador, and generally, hotspots of richness and rarity did not correspond with patterns of threat. Habitat loss was the most important variable for explaining extinction probabilities, followed by measures of rarity.
   Main conclusions
   Conservation efforts will be most efficient in richness and rarity hotspots, and because they overlap, rarity hotspots could act as surrogates for protecting overall Lepanthes diversity. Hotspots rarely occurred in the most threatened areas, and therefore, conservation efforts are more urgent in non-hotspot areas. Conservation efforts will be most effective if they combine ex situ strategies in locations with high habitat conversion rates with reservation strategies in rarity and richness hotspots, particularly where they overlap.

AB  - Evolutionary and genetic knowledge is increasingly being valued in conservation theory, but is rarely considered in conservation planning and policy. Here, we integrate phylogenetic diversity (PD) with spatial reserve prioritization to evaluate how well the existing reserve system in Victoria, Australia captures the evolutionary lineages of eucalypts, which dominate forest canopies across the state. Forty-three per cent of remaining native woody vegetation in Victoria is located in protected areas (mostly national parks) representing 48% of the extant PD found in the state. A modest expansion in protected areas of 5% (less than 1% of the state area) would increase protected PD by 33% over current levels. In a recent policy change, portions of the national parks were opened for development. These tourism development zones hold over half the PD found in national parks with some species and clades falling entirely outside of protected zones within the national parks. This approach of using PD in spatial prioritization could be extended to any clade or area that has spatial and phylogenetic data. Our results demonstrate the relevance of PD to regional conservation policy by highlighting that small but strategically located areas disproportionally impact the preservation of evolutionary lineages.

AB  - To achieve a sustainable development, impacts on biodiversity of urbanisation, new infrastructure projects and other land use changes must be considered on landscape and regional scales. This requires that important decisions are made after a systematic evaluation of environmental impacts. Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity components, and for evaluating and visualising the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this paper was to develop methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and strategic environmental assessment in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional levels.
   In order to test developed methods, a case study was conducted in the region of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and the study area embraced the city centre, suburbs and peri-urban areas. Focal species were tested as indicators of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity in the landscape. Predictive modelling of habitat distribution in geographic information systems involved the modelling of focal species occurrences based on empirical data, incorporated in a landscape ecological decision support system. When habitat models were retrieved, they were applied on future planning scenarios in order to predict and assess the impacts on focal species. The scenario involving a diffuse exploitation pattern had the greatest negative impacts on the habitat networks of focal species. The scenarios with concentrated exploitation also had negative impacts, although they were possible to mitigate quite easily. The predictions of the impacts on habitats networks of focal species made it possible to quantify, integrate and visualise the effects of urbanisation scenarios on aspects of biodiversity on a landscape level.

AB  - Background: Steppe-birds face drastic population declines throughout Europe. The Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti is an endangered steppe-bird species whose European distribution is restricted to Spain. This scarce passerine bird could be considered an 'umbrella species', since its population trends may reveal the conservation status of shrub-steppes. However, trends for the Spanish, and thus European, population of Dupont's lark are unknown. In this work, we evaluated Dupont's lark population trends in Europe employing the most recent and largest compiled database to date (92 populations over 12 years). In addition, we assessed the species threat category according to current applicable criteria (approved in March 2017) in the Spanish catalogue of threatened species (SCTS), which have never been applied to the Dupont's lark nor to any other Spanish species. Finally, we compared the resulting threat categories with the current conservation status at European, national and regional levels.
   Methods: We fitted switching linear trend models (software TRIM-Trends and Indices for Monitoring data) to evaluate population trends at national and regional scale (i.e. per Autonomous Community) during the period 2004-2015. In addition, the average finite annual rate of change ((lambda) over bar) obtained from the TRIM analysis was employed to estimate the percentage of population size change in a 10-year period. A threat category was assigned following A1 and A2 criteria applicable in the SCTS.
   Results: Trends showed an overall 3.9% annual decline rate for the Spanish population (moderate decline, following TRIM). Regional analyses showed high inter-regional variability. We forecasted a 32.8% average decline over the next 10 years. According to these results, the species should be listed as 'Vulnerable' at a national scale (SCTS). At the regional level, the conservation status of the species is of particular concern in Andalusia and Castile-Leon, where the species qualifies for listing as 'Endangered'.
   Discussion: Our results highlight the concerning conservation status of the European Dupont's lark population, undergoing a 3.9% annual decline rate. Under this scenario, the implementation of a wide-ranging conservation plan is urgently needed and is vital to ensuring the conservation of this steppe-bird species. The role of administrations in matters of nature protection and the cataloguing of endangered species is crucial to reverse declining population trends of this and other endangered taxa.

AB  - Background: The oak tree (Quercus aegilops) comprises similar to 70% of the oak forests in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Besides its ecological importance as the residence for various endemic and migratory species,Q. aegilopsforest also has socio-economic values-for example, as fodder for livestock, building material, medicine, charcoal, and firewood. In the KRI,Q. aegilopshas been degrading due to anthropogenic threats (e.g., shifting cultivation, land use/land cover changes, civil war, and inadequate forest management policy) and these threats could increase as climate changes. In the KRI and Iraq as a whole, information on current and potential future geographical distributions ofQ. aegilopsis minimal or not existent. The objectives of this study were to (i) predict the current and future habitat suitability distributions of the species in relation to environmental variables and future climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 2070 and RCP8.5 2070); and (ii) determine the most important environmental variables controlling the distribution of the species in the KRI. The objectives were achieved by using the MaxEnt (maximum entropy) algorithm, available records ofQ. aegilops, and environmental variables.
   Results: The model demonstrated that, under the RCP2.6 2070 and RCP8.5 2070 climate change scenarios, the distribution ranges ofQ. aegilopswould be reduced by 3.6% (1849.7 km(2)) and 3.16% (1627.1 km(2)), respectively. By contrast, the species ranges would expand by 1.5% (777.0 km(2)) and 1.7% (848.0 km(2)), respectively. The distribution of the species was mainly controlled by annual precipitation. Under future climate change scenarios, the centroid of the distribution would shift toward higher altitudes.
   Conclusions: The results suggest (i) a significant suitable habitat range of the species will be lost in the KRI due to climate change by 2070 and (ii) the preference of the species for cooler areas (high altitude) with high annual precipitation. Conservation actions should focus on the mountainous areas (e.g., by establishment of national parks and protected areas) of the KRI as climate changes. These findings provide useful benchmarking guidance for the future investigation of the ecology of the oak forest, and the categorical current and potential habitat suitability maps can effectively be used to improve biodiversity conservation plans and management actions in the KRI and Iraq as a whole.

AB  - As an increasingly important resource in ecological research, citizen scientists have proven dynamic and cost-effective in the supply of data for use within habitat suitability models. With predictions critical to the provision of effective conservation measures in cryptic marine species, this study delivers baseline ecological data for the Critically Endangered angelshark (Squatina squatina), exploring: (i) seasonal, sex-differentiated distributions; (ii) environmental distribution predictors; and (iii) examining bias-corrected, imperfect citizen science data for use in coastal habitat suitability models with cryptic species. Citizen science presence data, comprising over 60,000 hours of sampling effort, were used alongside carefully selected open-source predictor variables, with maxent generating seasonal male and female habitat suitability models for angelsharks in the Canary Islands. A biased prior method was used, alongside two model validation measures to ensure reliability. Citizen science data used within maxent suggest that angelshark habitat suitability is low in coastal areas during warmer months, with fewer occurrences despite a negligible change in sampling effort. The prime importance of bathymetry may indicate the importance of depth for reproductive activity and possible diel vertical migration, whereas aspect may act as a proxy for sheltered habitats away from open ocean. Substrate as a predictor of female habitats in spring and summer could imply that soft sediment is sought for birthing areas, assisting in the identification of areas critical to reproductive activity and thus locations that may benefit from spatial protections. Model outputs to inform recovery plan development and ecotourism are identified as plausible safeguards of population recovery, whereas the comparison of biased and bias-corrected models highlights some variance between methodologies, with bias-corrected models producing greater areas of habitat suitability. Accordingly, an adaptive framework is provided for the implementation of citizen science data within the modelling of cryptic coastal species distribution.

AB  - The use of biodiversity surrogates is inevitable in conservation planning due to the frequent lack of consistent data on biodiversity patterns and processes. Top-down environmental classifications (coarse-filter surrogates) are the most common approach to defining surrogates. Their use relies on the assumption that priority areas identified using surrogates will adequately represent biodiversity. There remains no clear understanding about how the combination of different factors might affect the surrogacy value of these classifications. Here, we evaluate the role of three factors that could affect the effectiveness of coarse-filter surrogates: (a) thematic resolution (number of classes), (b) species' prevalence, and (c) the ability of classifications to portray homogeneous communities (classification strength). We explore the role of direct and indirect effects of these factors with a simulated dataset of 10,000 planning units and 96 species and structural equation modelling (SEM).
   The surrogacy value of coarse-filter surrogates depended on the relative match between the extent of classes and species' distributions and the capacity of classifications to portray patterns in species composition (classification strength). Both determine the likelihood of erroneous selection of areas within a class where certain species do not occur. Common species were represented better than random only at high classification strength values (>0.5), while rare species never did. Finer classifications tended to be better surrogates although, when rare species were incorporated, the proportion of species that achieved the target level never exceeded 68%, even for the finest classification. This compromises the suitability of coarse-filter surrogates in areas where biodiversity is patchily distributed or with many rare species. We recommend using composite data sets containing environmental classes and biological data when a high effectiveness for all the species cannot be achieved. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Context Climate refugia-areas that remain suitable for species during periods of climate disruption-have played an important role in species persistence over time. Identifying and protecting these refugia is a key climate change adaptation approach for conservation planning. Objectives To identify climate refugia for Australian tropical/sub-tropical rainforest flora, from the Last Glacial Maximum to 2070. Methods Habitat suitability models were calibrated for 30 species using Maxent, and projected onto climate data for: Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, similar to 22,000 ybp); mid-Holocene (MH, similar to 6000 ybp); current period; and 2070. The intersection of suitable habitat over consecutive periods was assessed, identifying: current refugia (LGM-MH-Current); future refugia (Current-Future); and High Value Refugia (HVR, suitable over all four periods). Refugial hotspots (regions suitable for at least 15 species) were also identified. Results Suitable habitat was generally projected to span the greatest area in the current period. Four current refugial hotspots were identified: Wet Tropics, Central Mackay Coast, South Eastern Queensland, and North Coast (New South Wales). While suitable habitat for most species may decline in the future, HVRs will likely be retained for all species to at least 2070, although restricted in size. Future refugia was also projected in areas beyond species' dispersal ranges. Conclusions HVRs are highly important for the conservation of these rainforest species, given their generation times, limited dispersal capabilities and additional anthropogenic barriers to movement. This study assists in understanding long-term spatial shifts in rainforest flora in response to climate change and in designing future conservation strategies.

AB  - Aim: Niche-based species distribution models (SDMs) have become a ubiquitous tool in ecology and biogeography. These models relate species occurrences with the environmental conditions found at these sites. Climatic variables are the most commonly used environmental data and are usually included in SDMs as averages of a reference period (30-50 years). In this study, we analyse the impact of including inter-annual climatic variability on the estimation of species niches and predicted distributions when assessing plant demographic response to extreme climatic episodes.
   Location: Mediterranean basin, SE Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods: We first characterized species niches with inter-annual and average climate in the same environmental space. We then compare the respective capacities of climatic suitability obtained from averaged climate-based and from inter-annual variability-based niches to explain population demographic responses to extreme drought. Furthermore, we assessed the relative increase in niche size when including climatic variability for a set of Mediterranean species exhibiting a wide range of distribution areas.
   Results: We found that climatic suitability obtained from inter-annual variability-based niches showed higher explanatory capacity than average climate-based suitability, especially for populations living in climatically marginal conditions, although both niches quantifications significantly explained species demographic responses. In addition, species with restricted distribution ranges increased relatively more their niche space when considering climatic variability, probably because in widely distributed species spatial variability compensates for temporal variability.
   Main conclusions: The common use of climatic averages when characterizing species niches could lead to underestimations of species distribution and misunderstanding of demographic behaviour, with implications for conservation plans derived from SDMs, for example, overestimations of species extinction risk under climate change, or underestimations of alien species invasion' risk. We highlight that including climatic variability in niche modelling can be particularly important when dealing with species with restricted distribution and populations at the margin of their species niche.

AB  - Northern crested caracaras (Caracara cheriway) in south-central Florida are threatened by habitat loss, which is ongoing at local and regional scales. A tool capable of predicting effects of habitat loss on caracaras, and whose predictions can inform conservation strategies at multiple scales is imperative. We coupled a resource selection function-based habitat model with a geographic information system to predict the effects on the distribution of caracara nesting habitat as a result of a planned conversion of 143km(2) of agricultural land to sugarcane (local scale), and as a result of projected urbanization through 2060 (regional scale). Our model predicted a 100% decrease in the area classified as having a high or the highest relative probability of caracara nesting habitat (129.39km(2), or 13 average caracara home range equivalents) following completion of the local-scale project, and a 34.9% decrease following urbanization projected by 2060 (3,641.52km(2), or 366 average caracara home range equivalents). Our model can help direct compensatory mitigation at the local scale by predicting the amount of habitat likely to be lost because of land conversion at project sites. Predictions from the model also identify 3 conservation areas within the species range in Florida that collectively contain 6,140km(2) and would aid in region-wide conservation of this threatened raptor. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.
   We developed a resource selection function-based habitat model that can be used reliably to predict the effects of land cover change on the distribution of northern crested caracara habitat in south-central Florida, USA, at multiple spatial scales. In so doing, our habitat model can be used to guide decisions associated with local-scale project planning and mitigation, and landscape-level conservation strategies for this threatened raptor.

AB  - One-third of the world's reef-building corals are facing heightened extinction risk from climate change and other anthropogenic impacts. Previous studies have shown that such threats are not distributed randomly across the coral tree of life, and future extinctions have the potential to disproportionately reduce the phylogenetic diversity of this group on a global scale. However, the impact of such losses on a regional scale remains poorly known. In this study, we use phylogenetic metrics in conjunction with geographical distributions of living reef coral species to model how extinctions are likely to affect evolutionary diversity across different ecoregions. Based on two measures-phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic species variability-we highlight regions with the largest losses of evolutionary diversity and hence of potential conservation interest. Notably, the projected loss of evolutionary diversity is relatively low in the most species-rich areas such as the Coral Triangle, while many regions with fewer species stand to lose much larger shares of their diversity. We also suggest that for complex ecosystems like coral reefs it is important to consider changes in phylogenetic species variability; areas with disproportionate declines in this measure should be of concern even if phylogenetic diversity is not as impacted. These findings underscore the importance of integrating evolutionary history into conservation planning for safeguarding the future diversity of coral reefs.

AB  - Remotely sensed imagery, coupled with wildlife habitat models provide a powerful tool for the implementation, assessment, and monitoring of wildlife conservation/restoration initiatives. Observed, empirical relationships between a species abundance metric and landscape structure/composition are used to structure models. Habitat suitability models always represent a trade off between breadth of applicability and specificity. Large-spatial extent, coarse spatial resolution data sets may be useful for characterizing potential animal distributions at regional or continental scales; however, habitat models developed at this spatial scale may have little applicability for predicting suitability at finer spatial resolutions. Whereas numerous issues related to multi-scale analysis have been acknowledged with respect to wildlife habitat models, only recently have sources of high-resolution imagery been readily available for site-specific analyses. We outline a multi-scale approach to habitat modeling and demonstrate this approach with northern bobwhite. We developed a coarse resolution model appropriate for identifying,focal regions likely to support bobwhite using classified LandSat imagery and relative abundance measures from breeding season call counts. Then we developed a fine resolution model based on 4-m multispectral IKONOS imagery and animal space-use for planning and implementing conservation practices at the local scale. We discuss the application of this hierarchical approach to conservation planning.

AB  - South-East Asia is one of the world's richest regions in terms of biodiversity. An understanding of the distribution of diversity and the factors shaping it is lacking, yet essential for identifying conservation priorities for the region's highly threatened biodiversity. Here, we take a large-scale comparative approach, combining data from nine forest-associated Anopheles mosquito species and using statistical phylogeographical methods to disentangle the effects of environmental history, species-specific ecology and random coalescent effects. Spatially explicit modelling of Pleistocene demographic history supports a common influence of environmental events in shaping the genetic diversity of all species examined, despite differences in species' mtDNA gene trees. Populations were periodically restricted to allopatric northeastern and northwestern refugia, most likely due to Pleistocene forest fragmentation. Subsequent southwards post-glacial recolonization is supported by a north-south gradient of decreasing genetic diversity. Repeated allopatric fragmentation and recolonization have led to the formation of deeply divergent geographical lineages within four species and a suture zone where these intraspecific lineages meet along the Thai-Myanmar border. A common environmental influence for this divergence was further indicated by strong support for simultaneous divergence within the same four species, dating to approximately 900 thousand years ago (kya). Differences in the geographical structuring of genetic diversity between species are probably the result of varying species' biology. The findings have important implications for conservation planning; if the refugial regions and suture zone identified here are shared by other forest taxa, the unique and high levels of genetic diversity they house will make these areas conservation priorities.

AB  - For preserving biodiversity of European-Mediterranean forest ecosystems in current and future scenarios of global change by means of sustainable forest management it is necessary to determine how environment and forest characteristics correlate with biodiversity. For this purpose, neural networks were used to model forest bird species richness as a function of environment and forest structure and composition at the 1 x 1 km scale in Catalonia (NE Spain). Univariate and multivariate models respectively allowed exploring individual variable response and obtaining a parsimonious (ecologically meaningful) and accurate neural network. Forest area (with a canopy cover above 5%), mean forest canopy cover, mean annual temperature and summer precipitation were the best predictors of forest bird species richness. The resultant multivariate network had a good generalization capacity that failed however in the locations with highest species richness. Additionally, those forests with different degrees of canopy closure that were more mature and presented a more diverse tree species composition were also associated with higher bird species richness. This allowed us to provide management guidelines for forest planning in order to promote avian diversity in this European-Mediterranean region.

AB  - Accurate species distribution data across remote and extensive geographical areas are difficult to obtain. Here, we use bioclimatic envelope models to determine climatic constraints on the distribution of the migratory Saker FalconFalco cherrugto identify areas in data-deficient regions that may contain unidentified populations. Sakers live at low densities across large ranges in remote regions, making distribution status difficult to assess. Using presence-background data and eight bioclimatic variables within a species distribution modelling framework, we applied MaxEnt to construct models for both breeding and wintering ranges. Occurrence data were spatially filtered and climatic variables tested for multicollinearity before selecting best fit models using the Akaike information criterion by tuning MaxEnt parameters. Model predictive performance tested using the continuous Boyce index (B) was high for both breeding (B-TEST = 0.921) and wintering models (B-TEST = 0.735), with low omission rates and minimal overfitting. The Saker climatic niche was defined by precipitation in the warmest quarter in the breeding range model, and mean temperature in the wettest quarter in the wintering range model. Our models accurately predicted areas of highest climate suitability and defined the climatic constraints on a wide-ranging rare species, suggesting that climate is a key determinant of Saker distribution across macro-scales. We recommend targeted population surveys for the Saker based on model predictions to areas of highest climatic suitability in key regions with distribution knowledge gaps, in particular the Qinghai-Tibet plateau in western China. Further applications of our models could identify protected areas and reintroduction sites, inform development conflicts, and assess the impact of climate change on distributions.

AB  - Continuing climate change may cause shifts in the adaptive ranges of plant species. But this impact is less understood for many species in the tropics. Here, we examined the distribution of the current and future potential suitable habitats of two native forest spices Piper capense and Aframomum corrorima. We have used MaxEnt software to predict the current and future suitable habitats of these species. Two future climate change scenarios, that is, middle (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP 4.5]) and extreme (RCP 8.5) scenarios for years 2050 and 2070, were used. A total of 60 and 74 occurrence data of P. capense and A. corrorima, respectively, and 22 environmental variables were included. The effects of elevation, solar radiation index (SRI) and topographic position index (TPI) on suitable habitats of these species were tested using linear model in R. Precipitation of the driest quarter, SRI and TPI significantly affect future suitable habitats of P. capense and A. corrorima. Furthermore, there are significant elevational shifts of suitable habitats for both species under future scenarios (P < 0.001). These novel suitable habitats are located in moist Afromontane and Combretum-Terminalia vegetations. Our results suggest that conservation planning for these species should consider climate change factors including assisted migration.

AB  - Highly migratory species (e.g. sharks, tunas, turtles, cetaceans) present unique conservation management challenges due to their wide-ranging movements. Consequently, the extent to which management areas protect habitats for highly migratory species is often unknown. Within the southeast region of the USA's exclusive economic zone, highly migratory sharks are target and/or bycatch species in pelagic and bottom longline fisheries. Here, we developed maximum entropy habitat suitability models for great hammerhead sharks Sphyrna mokarran, tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier, and bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas within the southeast region based on satellite tag (n = 96) and remotely sensed environmental data. Modeled highly suitable habitats were compared to longline gear management areas to determine what proportion of these habitats are protected from, and vulnerable to, longline fisheries. The percentages of highly suitable habitats overlapping with longline management areas varied by species and season (78% warm, 36% cool season for great hammerhead sharks; 48% warm, 79% cool for tiger sharks; and 2% warm, 100% cool for bull sharks). Highly suitable great hammerhead and tiger shark habitats were relatively well protected from pelagic longline fisheries yet vulnerable to bottom longline fisheries. Additionally, both species were vulnerable to pelagic and bottom longline fisheries off southwestern Florida; thus, extending gear restrictions to this area may benefit both species. Bull shark highly suitable habitats were only well protected from longline gear during the cool season. These results demonstrate how habitat suitability modeling can be used to help assess the efficacy of spatial management strategies and inform conservation plans for highly migratory species.

AB  - There is a growing pressure of human activities on natural habitats, which leads to biodiversity losses. To mitigate the impact of human activities, environmental policies are developed and implemented, but their effects are commonly not well understood because of the lack of tools to predict the effects of conservation policies on habitat quality and/or diversity. We present a straightforward model for the simultaneous assessment of terrestrial and aquatic habitat quality in river basins as a function of land use and anthropogenic threats to habitat that could be applied under different management scenarios to help understand the trade-offs of conservation actions. We modify the InVEST model for the assessment of terrestrial habitat quality and extend it to freshwater habitats. We assess the reliability of the model in a severely impaired basin by comparing modeled results to observed terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity data. Estimated habitat quality is significantly correlated with observed terrestrial vascular plant richness (R-2 = 0.76) and diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates (R-2 = 0.34), as well as with ecosystem functions such as in-stream phosphorus retention (R-2 = 0.45). After that, we analyze different scenarios to assess the suitability of the model to inform changes in habitat quality under different conservation strategies. We believe that the developed model can be useful to assess potential levels of biodiversity, and to support conservation planning given its capacity to forecast the effects of management actions in river basins.

AB  - Knowledge on the structure and distribution of genetic diversity is a key aspect to plan and execute an efficient conservation and utilization of the genetic resources of any crop as well as for determining historical demographic inferences. In this work, a large data set of 1,765 accessions of cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill, Annonaceae), an underutilized fruit tree crop native to the Neotropics and used as a food source by pre-Columbian cultures, was collected from six different countries across the American continent and amplified with nine highly informative microsatellite markers. The structure analyses, fine representation of the genetic diversity and an ABC approach suggest a Mesoamerican origin of the crop, contrary to previous reports, with clear implications for the dispersion of plant germplasm between Central and South America in pre-Columbian times. These results together with the potential distribution of the species in a climatic change context using two different climate models provide new insights for the history and conservation of extant genetic resources of cherimoya that can be applied to other currently underutilized woody perennial crops.

AB  - Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, crystal krill E. crystallorophias, and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica are key mid-trophic level species in the Ross Sea, connecting primary production to the upper trophic levels. Distributions of these species were constructed from observations made in the western Ross Sea from 1988 to 2004. Distributions of environmental conditions were obtained from a 5-km resolution circulation model (temperature, mixed layer depth, surface speed) and satellite-derived observations (chlorophyll, sea ice cover). A hierarchy of statistical methods determined correlations and relationships between species and environmental conditions. Each species occupies a localized habitat defined by different environmental characteristics. Antarctic krill are concentrated along the northwestern shelf break in a habitat characterized by deep (>1000 m) bottom depth, warm temperature (1 to 1.25 degrees C), decreased sea ice, and proximity to the shelf break. Crystal krill and Antarctic silverfish are concentrated in Terra Nova Bay. Common characteristics of the habitat for these species are southwesterly location, coastal proximity, and cold temperature (-1.75 to -2 degrees C). The habitat characteristics obtained for the 3 species provide a basis for projecting potential distribution changes in response to environmental change and for delineating regions of the Ross Sea for focused management and selection of marine protected areas that support ecosystem-level conservation plans.

AB  - Zagros Mountains are like an island in the Middle East and they are subjected to changes in climate. Daphne mucronata Royle is an important medicinal plant species preserved in the high elevation regions in these mountains. Maxent species distribution model was used to integrate presence data (2413 points) and environmental variables to model the current and future potential distribution of D. mucronata in Iran. The most important variables were Bio19 with 50.5% contribution, followed by Bio8 and Bio2 with 30% and 11.4% contributions, respectively. The best Maxent model included seven variables, 4 feature types (linear, quadratic, product, and hinge), and had a test AUC value of 0.894. The current potential distribution indicated that 8% of Iran's drylands are suitable for growing D. mucronata and this area could decrease to 5.2% under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5, and 3.1% under RCP 8.5 due to climate change. Our results suggest that D. mucronata may lose overall about 2.8% and 4.9% of its current distribution under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, by 2050. There would be only 0.7 and 0.2% gains under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The species would locally disappear between 1500- and 2000-m elevation under RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The establishment of some stations for monitoring the changes in transition zone or lost areas especially on the southeastern parts of Zagros Mountain can help in detecting changes in the future. Additionally, stable habitats may be good target areas for future conservation planning.

AB  - Conflicts of interests between economic and nature conservation stakeholders are increasingly common in coastal seas, inducing a growing need for evidence-based marine spatial planning. This requires accurate, highresolution habitat maps showing the spatial distribution of benthic assemblages and enabling intersections of habitats and anthropogenic activities. However, such detailed maps are often not available because relevant biological data are scarce or poorly integrated. Instead, physiotope maps, solely based on abiotic variables, are now often used in marine spatial planning. Here, we investigated how pointwise, relatively sparse biological data can be integrated with gridded, high-resolution environmental data into informative habitat maps, using the intensively used southern North Sea as a case-study. We first conducted hierarchical clustering to identify discrete biological assemblages for three faunal groups: demersal fish, epifauna, and endobenthos. Using Random Forest models with high-resolution abiotic predictors, we then interpolated the distribution of these assemblages to high resolution grids. Finally, we quantified different anthropogenic pressures for each habitat. Habitat maps comprised a different number of habitats between faunal groups (6, 13, and 10 for demersal fish, epifauna, and endobenthos respectively) but showed similar spatial patterns for each group. Several of these 'fauna-inclusive' habitats resembled physiotopes, but substantial differences were also observed, especially when few (6; demersal fish) or most (13; epifauna) physiotopes were delineated. Demersal fishing and offshore wind farms (OWFs) were clearly associated with specific habitats, resulting in unequal anthropogenic pressure between different habitats. Natura-2000 areas were not specifically associated with demersal fishing, but OWFs were situated mostly inside these protected areas. We thus conclude that habitat maps derived from biological datasets that cover relevant faunal groups should be included more in ecology-inclusive marine spatial planning, instead of only using physiotope maps based on abiotic variables. This allows better balancing of nature conservation and socioeconomic interests in continental shelf seas.

AB  - Modeling and mapping potential distribution of living organisms has become an important component of conservation planning and ecosystem management in recent years. Various correlative and mechanistic methods can be applied to build predictive distributions of living organisms in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Correlative methods used to predict species' potential distribution have been described as either group discrimination techniques or profile techniques. We attempted to determine whether group discrimination techniques could perform as well as profile techniques for predicting species potential distributions, using elevation (ELVN), parent material (ROCK), slope (SLOP), radiation index (RI) and topographic position index (TPI)) as explanatory variables. We compared potential distribution predictions made for Crimean juniper (Juniperus excelsa Bieb.) in the Yukari gokdere forest district of the Mediterranean region, Turkey, applying four group discrimination techniques (discriminate analysis (DA), logistic regression analysis (LR), generalized addictive model (GAM) and classification tree technique (CT)) and two profile techniques (a maximum entropy approach to species distribution modeling (MAXENT), the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP)). Visual assessments of the potential distribution probability of the applied models for Crimean juniper were performed by using geographical information systems (GIS). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to objectively assess model performance. The results suggested that group discrimination techniques are better than profile techniques and, among the group discrimination techniques, GAM indicated the best performance.

AB  - Understanding the processes related to wildlife recoveries is not only essential in solving human - wildlife conflicts, but also for identifying priority conservation areas and in turn, for effective conservation planning. We used data from a citizen science program to study spatial aspects of the demographic and genetic recovery of brown bears in Greece and to identify new areas for their conservation. We visually compared our data with an estimation of the past distribution of brown bears in Greece and used a point process approach to model habitat suitability. We then compared our results with the current distribution of brown bear records and with that of protected areas. Our results indicate that in the last 15 years bears may have increased their range by as much as 100%, by occupying mainly anthropogenic landscapes and areas with suitable habitat that are currently not legally protected, thus creating a new conservation reality for the species in Greece. This development dictates the re-evaluation of the national management and conservation priorities for brown bears in Greece by focusing in establishing new protected areas that will safeguard their recovery. Our conservation approach is a swift and cheap way of identifying priority conservation areas, while gaining important insights on spatial aspects of population recovery. It will help prioritize conservation actions for brown bears in Greece and may serve as a model conservation approach to countries facing similar financial and logistic constraints in the monitoring of local biodiversity or facing challenges in managing rapid population recoveries. Our conservation approach appeared to be particularly suited to identifying priority areas for conservation in areas with recovering wildlife populations and may therefore be used as an 'early-warning' conservation system.

AB  - Assisted colonization is one way of facilitating range shifts for species that are restricted in their ability to move in response to climate change. Here we conceptualize and apply a new decision framework for modelling assisted colonization of plant species prior to in situ realization. Three questions were examined: a) Is species translocation useful in a certain area? b) where, and c) how long will it be successful in the future? Applying our framework to Carex foetida in Italy at the core of its distribution and its southern edge revealed that assisted colonization could be successful in short-term (2010-2039) climate conditions, partially in medium (2040-2069) but not in long-term (2070-2099) scenarios. We show that, for some species, it is likely that assisted colonization would be successful in some portions of the recipient site under current and short-term climate conditions, but over the mid-and long-term, climate changes will make species translocation unsuccessful. The proposed decision framework can help identify species that will need different conservation actions (seed banks and/or botanical gardens) when assisted colonization is unlikely to be successful. Furthermore it has broad applicability, as it can support planning of assisted migration in mountainous areas in the face of climate change.

AB  - Background: Deserts are biologically rich habitats with a vast array of animals and plants adapted to xeric conditions, and most deserts are among the planet's last remaining areas of total wilderness. Among North American deserts, the Chihuahuan Desert has the highest levels of diversity and endemism. To understand the effect of future climate change on plants distributed in this arid land and propose effective conservation planning, we focused on five endemic shrubby species that characterize the Chihuahuan Desert and used an integrative approach.
   Methods: Ecological niche-based modeling, spatial genetics and ecological resistance analyses were carried out to identify the effect of global warming on the studied five shrubby species. Key areas that need to be preserved were identified taking into account the existing protected areas within the Chihuahuan Desert.
   Results: The extent of future distribution will vary among these species, and on average expansion will occur in the western part of the Chihuahuan Desert. For most species low environmental resistance to gene flow was predicted, while higher future resistance was predicted for one species that would lead to increased population isolation. The highest haplotype diversity was identified in three hotspots. Based on future suitability of habitat and in the haplotype diversity we suggest preserving two hotspots of genetic diversity in the Sierra Madre Oriental, located in areas without protection. The third hotspot was detected in the well preserved Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Man and Biosphere Reserve.
   Conclusion: Global climate change will have an effect in arid adapted plants, favoring expansion in the western of the Chihuahuan Desert however negatively affecting others with high ecological resistance disrupting gene flow. Two hotspots of genetic diversity in the Sierra Madre Oriental should be protected.

AB  - Balancing biodiversity conservation and rural food security is a pressing challenge for developing countries, with tropical agro-grasslands facing particularly high human dependence and species' endangerment. We explored the potential influences of agricultural growth and allocation of multiple landuses on the status of two threatened species inhabiting semiarid agro-grasslands of India. Sampling 1 km(2) cells for flagship lesser florican Sypheotides indica and 0.03 ha plots for spiny-tailed lizard Saara hardwickii, we modeled species' abundances with land-cover, vegetation structure, and disturbances using N-mixture (florican) and poisson (lizard) models. Florican abundance responded unimodally to herbaceous biomass (grassland proportion x ground-vegetation height), wherein, numbers peaked at optimally large combinations of grassland proportion (0.5-1) and ground-vegetation height (35-65 cm). Whereas, lizard abundance was positively influenced by grassland occurrence and ground-vegetation < 50 cm cover but negatively influenced by cropland occurrence. Livestock grazing promoted short vegetation over tall vegetation, partially hindering florican but facilitating lizard. Such inter-specific differences in landuse response invoked multi-criteria planning based on surrogates of ecologically distinct species-groups. Fitting our models to simulated landuse scenarios, we demonstrated that managing florican habitats as grassland interspersed with croplands and pastures spared rotationally provided optimal results at low production-level. However, projected agricultural growth would cause considerable declines of florican (>30%) and lizard (>20%) populations. To prevent this, remaining florican occupied agro-grasslands should be secured as Community/Conservation reserves so that further landuse conversions can be legally restricted. Simultaneously, government schemes like food provisioning to small farmers through public distribution system could be harnessed to compensate for production deficit within/adjoining reserves.

AB  - Emerging methods in habitat and wildlife population modeling promise new horizons in conservation but only if these methods provide robust population-habitat linkages. We used Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data to verify and validate newly developed habitat suitability index (HSI) models for 40 priority landbird species in the Central Hardwoods and West Gulf Coastal Plain/Ouachitas Bird Conservation Regions. We considered a species' HSI model verified if there was a significant rank correlation between mean predicted HSI score and mean observed BBS abundance across the 88 ecological subsections within these Bird Conservation Regions. When we included all subsections, correlations verified 37 models. Models for 3 species were unverified. Rank correlations for an additional 5 species were not significant when analyses included only subsections with BBS abundance > 0. To validate models, we developed generalized linear models with mean observed BBS abundance as the response variable and mean HSI score and Bird Conservation Region as predictor variables. We considered verified models validated if the overall model was an improvement over an intercept-only null model and the coefficient on the HSI variable in the model was > 0. Validation provided a more rigorous assessment of model performance than verification, and models for 12 species that we verified failed validation. Species whose models failed validation were either poorly sampled by BBS protocols or associated with woodland and shrubland habitats embedded within predominantly open landscapes. We validated models for 25 species. Habitat specialists and species reaching their highest densities in predominantly forested landscapes were more likely to have validated models. In their current form, validated models are useful for conservation planning of priority landbirds and offer both insight into limiting factors at ecoregional scales and a framework for monitoring priority landbird populations from readily available national data sets.

AB  - An important factor in fragmented habitats is the connectivity between major occurrence areas of a species. Two corridors were modeled between two validated occurrences of Muscardinus avellanarius based on a habitat suitability map corrected for recent landscape changes. Especially roadside hedges and copse were identified as connecting landscape elements between woodland habitats occupied by neighboring populations of the hazel dormouse. The two corridors differed in total length (10.9 km vs. 15.5 km) but the longer corridor also had the better mean habitat suitability (0.77 vs. 0.80). The corridor usage was supported by field mapping of species' individuals and traces. On both corridors hazel nuts gnawed open by M. avellanarius were found. It can be concluded that roadside hedges and copse with a high tree species diversity, a high proportion of deciduous and mixed forest, and a more open canopy play an important role for conservation management of silvicolous small mammals and improve their habitat connectivity. Therefore, continuous roadside hedges and regular copse as stepping stone habitats should be promoted in environmental planning and landscape preservation. Extensive coppicing of hedges, e.g., at highways due to traffic safety should be avoided to maintain landscape connectivity for small mammals. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowing whether a species has been extirpated, or if it ever inhabited a specific geographic area, has direct importance for planning conservation activities. The taruka (Hippocamelus antisensis) is one of the largest Neotropical mammals; it is distributed in the central Andes, and there are published records of this species in Ecuador. Recently, missing museum specimens have cast doubts on the validity of these Ecuadorian records. Here, we examine whether the taruka ever inhabited Ecuador by analyzing multiple sources of information. Our approach consists of 3 components: 1) we surveyed archaeological collections and literature for any biological remains and cultural artifacts that may represent tarukas, 2) we searched mammal collections for specimens reported in publications, and 3) we generated ecological niche models (ENMs) of current and past climates to determine whether Ecuador offers suitable habitats for the taruka. Our results suggest that the taruka never inhabited Ecuador. We did not find any reliable supporting evidence in the form of specimens nor convincing literature reports. Furthermore, ENMs revealed that Ecuador has not supported suitable climates for the taruka. We suggest that published records of taruka in Ecuador may have been due to improper identifications of specimens. The methods used here may also prove useful in determining the presence of species that are either thought to be extinct, or suspected to be recently introduced into a new geographic area.

AB  - Migratory animals are declining worldwide and coordinated conservation efforts are needed to reverse current trends. We devised a novel genoscape-network model that combines genetic analyses with species distribution modeling and demographic data to overcome challenges with conceptualizing alternative risk factors in migratory species across their full annual cycle. We applied our method to the long distance, Neotropical migratory bird, Wilson's Warbler (Cardellina pusilla). Despite a lack of data from some wintering locations, we demonstrated how the results can be used to help prioritize conservation of breeding and wintering areas. For example, we showed that when genetic, demographic, and network modeling results were considered together it became clear that conservation recommendations will differ depending on whether the goal is to preserve unique genetic lineages or the largest number of birds per unit area. More specifically, if preservation of genetic lineages is the goal, then limited resources should be focused on preserving habitat in the California Sierra, Basin Rockies, or Coastal California, where the 3 most vulnerable genetic lineages breed, or in western Mexico, where 2 of the 3 most vulnerable lineages overwinter. Alternatively, if preservation of the largest number of individuals per unit area is the goal, then limited conservation dollars should be placed in the Pacific Northwest or Central America, where densities are estimated to be the highest. Overall, our results demonstrated the utility of adopting a genetically based network model for integrating multiple types of data across vast geographic scales and better inform conservation decision-making for migratory animals.

AB  - Species distribution models are required for the research and management of biodiversity in the hyperdiverse tropical forests, but reliable and ecologically relevant digital environmental data layers are not always available. We here assess the usefulness of multispectral canopy reflectance (Landsat) relative to climate data in modelling understory plant species distributions in tropical rainforests. We used a large dataset of quantitative fern and lycophyte species inventories across lowland Amazonia as the basis for species distribution modelling (SDM). As predictors, we used CHELSA climatic variables and canopy reflectance values from a recent basin-wide composite of Landsat TM/ETM+ images both separately and in combination. We also investigated how species accumulate over sites when environmental distances were expressed in terms of climatic or surface reflectance variables. When species accumulation curves were constructed such that differences in Landsat reflectance among the selected plots were maximised, species accumulated faster than when climatic differences were maximised or plots were selected in a random order. Sixty-nine species were sufficiently frequent for species distribution modelling. For most of them, adequate SDMs were obtained whether the models were based on CHELSA data only, Landsat data only or both combined. Model performance was not influenced by species' prevalence or abundance. Adding Landsat-based environmental data layers overall improved the discriminatory capacity of SDMs compared to climate-only models, especially for soil specialist species. Our results show that canopy surface reflectance obtained by multispectral sensors can provide studies of tropical ecology, as exemplified by SDMs, much higher thematic (taxonomic) detail than is generally assumed. Furthermore, multispectral datasets complement the traditionally used climatic layers in analyses requiring information on environmental site conditions. We demonstrate the utility of freely available, global remote sensing data for biogeographical studies that can aid conservation planning and biodiversity management.

AB  - Mammals have experienced a massive decline in their populations and geographic ranges worldwide. The sloth bear, Melursus ursinus (Shaw, 1791), is one of many species facing conservation threats. Despite being endangered in Nepal, decades of inattention to the situation have hindered their conservation and management. We assessed the distribution and patterns of habitat use by sloth bears in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal. We conducted sign surveys from March to June, 2020, in 4 x 4 km grids (n = 45). We collected detection/non-detection data along a 4-km trail that was divided into 20 continuous segments of 200 m each. We obtained environmental, ecological, and anthropogenic covariates to understand determinants of sloth bear habitat occupancy. The data were analyzed using the single-species single-season occupancy method, with a spatially correlated detection. Using repeated observations, these models accounted for the imperfect detectability of the species to provide robust estimates of habitat occupancy. The model-averaged occupancy estimate for the sloth bear was 69% and the detection probability was 0.25. The probability of habitat occupancy by sloth bears increased with the presence of termites and fruits and in rugged, dry, open, undisturbed habitats. Our results indicate that the sloth bear is elusive, functionally unique, and widespread in CNP. Future conservation interventions and action plans aimed at sloth bear management must adequately consider their habitat requirements.

AB  - To help conserve biodiversity in coming decades, protected areas need to be located in places that will be important for species as their ranges shift to track suitable climatic conditions. Had past protected areas been optimally targeted to cover today?s biodiversity, then we would expect future coverage to decline. However, past protected area siting was often biased towards higher elevations and, with upslope movements of many species predicted under climate change projections, perhaps future coverage may improve as a result. We examine present and future coverage of species potential ranges by protected areas in the Appalachian Mountains, a critical climate refuge and corridor for the biodiversity of the eastern United States. We parameterize climate niche models using the Maxent algorithm with occurrence records for 258 amphibian, bird, mammal, and reptile species of conservation policy concern that depend on forested habitat. We forecast future range shifts by integrating climate projections from six global circulation models and two representative concentration pathways while making contrasting assumptions about species dispersal. We then examine coverage of the estimated present and future ranges of species by existing protected areas. Most of these policy relevant species (93%) have less than 15% of their present estimated range in the region covered by protected areas. We found that species ranked as high conservation priority would be poorly protected under future climate scenarios. We predicted amphibian and mammal coverages by protected areas would worsen whereas coverages of birds and reptiles improve if species are able to disperse freely to future climatically suitable habitat. If species movements are more restricted, then we predict marked losses of species from protected areas, particularly amphibians and mammals. Our results identify obvious candidate locations for adding new protected areas in places that are currently under-protected and that harbor a high diversity of species across all future climate scenarios we consider.

AB  - 1. Despite the wealth of data available from satellite tracking (ST) studies, such data have rarely been used to model species distributions. Using a novel method, we show how to exploit satellite data to analyse whether and how a migratory species responds to fluctuating environmental conditions in its wintering area. This is particularly crucial for establishing comprehensive conservation measures for rare species in areas that are threatened by increasing land use and climate change. 2. We use ST data of Eleonoras falcon Falco eleonorae, a long-distance migratory raptor that winters in Madagascar, and assess the performance of static species distribution models (SDM) as well as multi-temporal models. ST data were derived from seven falcons tracked during three consecutive wintering periods and for a total of 2410 bearings, of which 512 locations were used in SDMs. We employed environmental predictors (climate, topography and land cover) with a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds (c. 1 km2) to match rigorously filtered ST data with an accuracy of =1 km. 3. We first created a model with low temporal but high spatial resolution (half-year). To predict suitable habitat for each month of the wintering season, we took advantage of the high temporal resolution inherent in ST data and employed temporally corresponding remote sensing data [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 10-day composites] together with other variables to create monthly models. 4. We show that ST data are suited to build robust and transferable SDMs despite a low number of tracked individuals. Multi-temporal SMDs further revealed seasonal responses of the study species to changing environmental conditions in its wintering area. 5. Synthesis and applications. We present a transferable approach to predict the potential distribution of organisms as well as their dynamic response to changing environmental conditions. Future conservation management plans could include the prediction of a species reaction to changing land-use practices or climate change based on the methodology proposed here. This would provide an early warning system for the decline of populations wintering in remote areas that underlie strong climatic fluctuations.

AB  - 1. Although ecosystems are increasingly threatened worldwide, the resources available to set up management actions, such as conservation or restoration, remain severely limited. Methods designed to spatially allocate conservation and restoration actions while maximizing their ecological benefits are urgently needed. Whereas conservation planning methods have been extensively developed in past decades, improvements in restoration planning are still needed to build efficient management tools. This methodological gap may be explained by the difficulties encountered when estimating non-disturbed ecological conditions (i.e. reference conditions) which are usually required to compare past and present ecosystem states.
   2. Here, the species composition of stream fish assemblages in 607 river stretches of the Pas-de-Calais department in the north of France was predicted using species distribution models. Present occurrence was predicted according to four environmental variables, including two related to human-induced disturbances (i.e. proportion of river stretch length affected by hydraulic works and local geomorphological alterations). The fish assemblages potentially present in the absence of such disturbances were then predicted using hindcasting modelling which involves artificially setting to zero the values of the disturbance variables in the models.
   3. A framework based on a multi-faceted approach of diversity was applied to the present-day fish assemblages and those predicted under the two non-disturbed scenarios (i.e. restoration scenarios) to assess their suitability for management.
   4. While the theoretical restoration of the natural flow regimes was likely to result in few changes in fish assemblage composition and consequently in their multi-faceted diversity, the restoration of natural geomorphological characteristics was predicted to reduce the taxonomic diversity but increase the functional diversity, the natural heritage importance and the socio-economic value of the fish assemblages.
   5. This study provides environmental decision-makers with a tool to identify precisely and simultaneously the conservation and restoration actions that have to be undertaken as a priority, by comparing the present and non-disturbed multi-faceted diversity indices.

AB  - Defining population neighbourhood boundaries provides a critical spatial framework for understanding ecological processes and informing species-specific conservation and restoration planning. The population neighbourhood boundary demarcates the total quantity of available habitat across life stages where specific ecological processes (e.g., breeding, foraging, migration) occur for all individuals within a population. For mobile species within dendritic freshwater networks, the population neighbourhood boundary can be defined by the upper limit of occurrence (ULO) of an individual within a population. We sought to define contemporary neighbourhood boundaries across a complex river network in southwestern Washington State, U.S.A. by: (1) identifying ULOs for three anadromous fish (Oncorhynchus spp.); and (2) quantifying the relationship of the ULO with landscape attributes and local features for these species of profound social and ecological importance. Extensive field surveys covering 669 river km across 2 years documented the ULOs for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) as well as any local features, such as natural barriers, that influenced the ULOs. Generalised linear mixed models quantified the relationships between the ULOs and landscape attributes derived from remote sensing data. We identified the ULO for 115 coho salmon terminal streams, 97 steelhead streams, and 57 chum salmon streams. Natural barriers determined the ULO in just 5%-16% of the terminal streams, depending on species. Landscape attributes associated with the ULOs varied among species; however, drainage area, elevation, and geology were important landscape predictors for all species. Models for each species had good to excellent predictive performance (percent correct classification: 78%-89%; AUC: 0.87-0.96). We demonstrated that large-scale landscape attributes can accurately and consistently detect species-specific differences in population neighbourhoods across broad and diverse habitats. In comparison, local scale features (e.g., natural barriers) played a minor role in determining the neighbourhood boundaries in our study catchment. The modelled relationships between landscape attributes and the population neighbourhood provide a framework to guide conservation planning and predict benefits of habitat reconnections.

AB  - We performed a population genomics study of the aye-aye, a highly specialized nocturnal lemur from Madagascar. Aye-ayes have low population densities and extensive range requirements that could make this flagship species particularly susceptible to extinction. Therefore, knowledge of genetic diversity and differentiation among aye-aye populations is critical for conservation planning. Such information may also advance our general understanding of Malagasy biogeography, as aye-ayes have the largest species distribution of any lemur. We generated and analyzed whole-genome sequence data for 12 aye-ayes from three regions of Madagascar (North, West, and East). We found that the North population is genetically distinct, with strong differentiation from other aye-ayes over relatively short geographic distances. For comparison, the average F-ST value between the North and East aye-aye populations separated by only 248 km-is over 2.1-times greater than that observed between human Africans and Europeans. This finding is consistent with prior watershed- and climate-based hypotheses of a center of endemism in northern Madagascar. Taken together, these results suggest a strong and long-term biogeographical barrier to gene flow. Thus, the specific attention that should be directed toward preserving large, contiguous aye-aye habitats in northern Madagascar may also benefit the conservation of other distinct taxonomic units. To help facilitate future ecological- and conservation-motivated population genomic analyses by noncomputational biologists, the analytical toolkit used in this study is available on the Galaxy Web site.

AB  - 1. Identifying the boundary of a species' niche from observational and environmental data is a common problem in ecology and conservation biology and a variety of techniques have been developed or applied to model niches and predict distributions. Here, we examine the performance of some pattern-recognition methods as ecological niche models (ENMs). Particularly, one-class pattern recognition is a flexible and seldom used methodology for modelling ecological niches and distributions from presence-only data. The development of one-class methods that perform comparably to two-class methods (for presence/absence data) would remove modelling decisions about sampling pseudo-absences or background data points when absence points are unavailable.
   2. We studied nine methods for one-class classification and seven methods for two-class classification (five common to both), all primarily used in pattern recognition and therefore not common in species distribution and ecological niche modelling, across a set of 106 mountain plant species for which presence-absence data was available. We assessed accuracy using standard metrics and compared trade-offs in omission and commission errors between classification groups as well as effects of prevalence and spatial autocorrelation on accuracy.
   3. One-class models fit to presence-only data were comparable to two-class models fit to presence-absence data when performance was evaluated with a measure weighting omission and commission errors equally. One-class models were superior for reducing omission errors (i.e. yielding higher sensitivity), and two-classes models were superior for reducing commission errors (i.e. yielding higher specificity). For these methods, spatial autocorrelation was only influential when prevalence was low.
   4. These results differ from previous efforts to evaluate alternative modelling approaches to build ENM and are particularly noteworthy because data are from exhaustively sampled populations minimizing false absence records. Accurate, transferable models of species' ecological niches and distributions are needed to advance ecological research and are crucial for effective environmental planning and conservation; the pattern-recognition approaches studied here show good potential for future modelling studies. This study also provides an introduction to promising methods for ecological modelling inherited from the pattern-recognition discipline.

AB  - The identification and prioritization of sites for conservation actions to protect biodiversity in lotic systems is crucial when economic resources or available areas are limited. Challenges include the incorporation of multi-scale interactions, and the application of species distribution models (SDMs) to rare organism with multiple life stages. To support the planning of conservation actions for the highly endangered Freshwater Pearl Mussel Margaritifera margaritifera (FPM), this paper aims at developing an ecohydrological modeling cascade including a hydrological model (SWAT) and a hydraulic model (HEC-RAS). Building on hydrology and hydraulics, Random Forest models for potential risk to juveniles due to sand accumulation, SDMs for adults habitat niche, and a landscape connectivity assessment of dispersal potential were developed. The feasibility of such models integration was tested in the Aist catchment (630 km(2)) in Austria. The potential FPM habitat and the sand accumulation risk for the whole catchment were predicted with good accuracy. Results show that while the potentially suitable habitats for adults FPM cover 34% of the river network, only few habitat patches can maximize the dispersal potential (4% of the river network) and even less are showing limited impact of accumulations (3.5% of river network). No habitat patch that meets all the three criteria is available, suggesting approaches that target the patch-specific critical life stage-factors are promising for conservation. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Understanding how migratory species select habitats is essential for applied ecology and biological conservation. Although migratory species move across a wide range of environments during migration, their dynamic response to environments has rarely been considered. Taking advantage of the fine spatial-temporal resolution of satellite tracking data, we studied habitat selection of East Asian greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) along their spring migration route from Yangtze River Basin to Lena Delta and Yana Bay. We developed a novel methodology to improve dynamic species distribution models (SDMs) by incorporating environmental variables derived from remotely sensed data precisely corresponding to migration time. Our results demonstrate that distance to the nearest water body, elevation, human population density and temperature contribute greatly to the models. Water-related and topographic factors (e.g., elevation, slope and distance to the nearest water body) were consistently associated with habitat selection of the geese from wintering area to breeding area, while the varied influences of temperature and human population density in different migration periods are closely related to their adaptation to local environments. In addition, response curves of vegetation index indicate that the geese are more strongly associated with food quality than quantity in wintering area and stopover sites. By building SDMs in different periods, we provide a unique dynamic perspective on how a long-distance migrant responds to different environments. The methodology proposed here could be integrated to future conservation management plans for predicting species relationship with fast changing environmental conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Networks of protected areas are a key component of efforts to conserve biodiversity. However, there are concerns about an uncritical focus on the percentage area of reserves without an assessment of how well formal reserves are actually protecting biodiversity. In response, we completed a spatial analysis of the formal reserve system in the Australian state of Victoria. We quantified how well the reserve system captured a crude surrogate for vegetation communities (viz: Ecological Vegetation Classes) as well as distribution models for an array of threatened forest-dependent species. We found evidence of a high degree of overlap between areas subject to intensive forestry (clearcutting) operations and the modelled distribution of a suite of forest-dependent species. A key outcome of our study was that areas around sites subject to past logging as well as new areas proposed for logging under the Timber Release Plan in Victoria had significantly higher values for threatened forest-dependent species (as determined by habitat distribution models) than areas that had not been logged. We found significant differences in the spatial characteristics of the dedicated reserve systems and informal protected area networks, with the latter featuring much of its area close to a tenure boundary where logging occurs. Our empirical analyses demonstrating the impacts of ongoing logging operations on areas with high environmental suitability for threatened species have important implications. In particular, the current reserve system is inadequate for a suite of forest-dependent taxa, including critically endangered Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) and the vulnerable Greater Glider (Petauroides volans). This suggests a high degree of conflict between areas of high value for conservation and areas targeted for wood production.

AB  - Diversity determinants have mostly been evaluated in high diversity areas, leaving behind regions with less species diversity such as drylands. Here we aim to analyze the patterns of plant diversity in tropical drylands in the southern Central Andes, and determine the importance of water, energy, and environmental heterogeneity as diversity determinants of the arid and semi-arid adapted flora. We examined the distribution of 645 native species from lowlands to 6000 m.a.s.l. in the north-western region of Argentina (NWA) and define hotspots of diversity within each NWA ecoregion. Diversity is concentrated in regions of middle elevation with intermediate values of water and energy, at the transition between arid and semi-arid regions. Furthermore, we showed that in tropical drylands energy input is as fundamental for plant diversity as water input is and, we found that the effects of these variables varied with elevation and, also with aridity. Water variables had the strongest effect on the flora in the arid high Andean ecoregions, where an increase in precipitation during the growing season stimulated species diversity. Energy only became more important than water when the arid adapted flora entered the low and semi-arid regions where energy increments reduce species diversity. Our analysis provides strong quantitative support for climate variables as the main determinants of plant diversity across different ecoregions of the southern Central Andes. Given the present climate change events, knowing how these variables affect the distribution of the arid adapted flora is crucial for planning strategies for achieve their present and future conservation.

AB  - Recent studies show that light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived habitat variables significantly increase the performance and accuracy of species distribution models (SDMs). In particular, the structure of complex habitats such as forest can be accurately parametrized by an area-wide, LiDAR-based vegetation profile. However, evidence of specific applications of such models in real-world conservation management still remains sparse. Here, we developed a resource selection SDM for hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia L.) in a Swiss nature park with the aim to map habitat suitability and to inform the park management about habitat improvement measures. We used remote sensing, particularly LiDAR to derive ecologically relevant forest vegetation characteristics at the local scale and used them as predictors in an ensemble SDM approach. The predicted habitat suitability was mainly affected by local, fine grained vegetation structure. Average vegetation height, shrub density and canopy height variation contributed most to the habitat quality for hazel grouse. This clearly shows how LiDAR provides the means to develop ecologically interpretable predictor variables of forest habitat structure and that these predictors can be used to reliably map local-scale habitat quality, indicated by high model performance scores (median AUC of 0.918). This improves spatial conservation planning, and at the same time, provides meaningful information to derive habitat improvement measures that can be implemented in the field by foresters. Hazel grouse occurrence in the park is restricted to a few highly suitable, disjunct habitat patches. Therefore, conservation management should increase the connectivity of suitable habitat with the aim to stimulate an increase and better exchange of individuals in the regional hazel grouse population. Habitat improvements can be achieved by forestry measures that regularly integrate early successional forest stages into production forests. They should contain stands with a shrub density of around 30% as well as heterogeneous stands in terms of vegetation height.

AB  - The Amazon floodplains represent important surfaces of highly valuable ecosystems, yet they remain neglected from protected areas. Although the efficiency of the protected area network of the Amazon basin may be jeopardized by climate change, floodplains are exposed to important consequences of climate change but are omitted from species distribution models and protection gap analyses. The present and future (2070) distribution of the giant bony-tongue fish Arapaima spp. (Arapaimidae) was modelled accounting for climate and habitat requirements, and with a consideration of dam presence (already existing and planned constructions) and hydroperiod (high- and low-water stages). The amount of suitable environment that falls inside and outside the current network of protected areas was quantified to identify spatial conservation gaps. We predict that climate change will cause a decline in environmental suitability by 16.6% during the high-water stage, and by 19.4% during the low-water stage. About 70% of the suitable environments of Arapaima spp. remain currently unprotected. The gap is higher by 0.7% during the low-water stage. The lack of protection is likely to increase by 5% with future climate change effects. Both existing and projected dam constructions may hamper population flows between the central, Bolivian and Peruvian parts of the basin. We highlight protection gaps mostly in the south-western part of the basin and recommend the extension of the current network of protected areas in the floodplains of the upper Ucayali, Jurua and Purus rivers and their tributaries. This study has shown the importance of integrating hydroperiod and dispersal barriers in forecasting the distribution of freshwater fish species, and stresses the urgent need to integrate floodplains within the protected area networks.

AB  - Little is known about the ecology of the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides or the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin Sousa chinensis in Southeast Asia. The present study describes the distribution and habitat preferences of these species around the Langkawi Archipelago of Malaysia. Vessel-based passive acoustic monitoring surveys were conducted 5 times between 2012 and 2013. Both species mainly preferred relatively shallow waters, especially on the east sides of the islands at <15 m depth. However, the species differed in number of detections and spatial distribution, preferred distance from shore, chlorophyll a concentration in the water where they resided, and season in which they were detected, indicating that they have different habitat preferences. The best spatial habitat model for the prediction of finless porpoise distribution included bathymetric depth and longitude. The distribution of finless porpoises was relatively stable around the islands and especially in the eastern waters, whereas humpback dolphins may only seasonally visit specific regions of the waters around the islands. Their detection sites were too patchy to enable distribution modeling. The results of this study provide baseline information that can facilitate conservation planning for these species according to their habitat preferences and core areas.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the impact of climate change on keystone subalpine conifers, Tsuga diversifolia and Abies veitchii, incorporating the uncertainties of general circulation models (GCMs) for spatial conservation planning in Japan. Potential habitats for T. diversifolia and A. veitchii under current and 20 GCMs in 2080-2100 were predicted using generalized additive models. We counted the number of GCMs under which current potential habitat was predicted to lose by a spatial unit and used them as indices of vulnerability and prediction uncertainty. Gaps between protected areas and potential habitats under the future climates were identified. Reasonably accurate models revealed that T. diversifolia and A. veitchii require cool and wet summers with low winter precipitation. Only less than 1 % of current potential habitats for the species were predicted to be sustainable with low GCMs-related uncertainties. Most of these certainly sustainable habitats were designated as protected areas. Of current potential habitats for T. diversifolia and A. veitchii, 88 and 97 % were predicted to be non-habitats under future climates with low GCMs-related uncertainties. These certainly vulnerable habitats included the southern and low elevated northern range limits of the species, of which 70 % were designated as protected areas. These results suggest that subalpine conifers are vulnerable to the climate change irrespective of GCMs variation. Strengthening of monitoring may be necessary, especially at unprotected and certainly vulnerable habitats in lower subalpine areas where influences of the climate change will appear first. Active management including assisted regeneration may be necessary for preserving the vulnerable and genetically endemic populations.

AB  - Avian conservation efforts must account for changes in vegetation composition and structure associated with climate change. We modeled vegetation change and the probability of occurrence of birds to project changes in winter bird distributions associated with climate change and fire management in the northern Chihuahuan Desert (southwestern U.S.A.). We simulated vegetation change in a process-based model (Landscape and Fire Simulator) in which anticipated climate change was associated with doubling of current atmospheric carbon dioxide over the next 50 years. We estimated the relative probability of bird occurrence on the basis of statistical models derived from field observations of birds and data on vegetation type, topography, and roads. We selected 3 focal species, Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata), Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), and Rock Wren (Salpinctes obsoletus), that had a range of probabilities of occurrence for our study area. Our simulations projected increases in relative probability of bird occurrence in shrubland and decreases in grassland and Yucca spp. and ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens) vegetation. Generally, the relative probability of occurrence of all 3 species was highest in shrubland because leaf-area index values were lower in shrubland. This high probability of occurrence likely is related to the species' use of open vegetation for foraging. Fire suppression had little effect on projected vegetation composition because as climate changed there was less fuel and burned area. Our results show that if future water limits on plant type are considered, models that incorporate spatial data may suggest how and where different species of birds may respond to vegetation changes.

AB  - In the marine environment Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been used in hundreds of papers for predicting the present and future geographic range and environmental niche of species. We have analyzed ways in which SDMs are being applied to marine species in order to recommend best practice in future studies. This systematic review was registered as a protocol on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/tngs6/. The literature reviewed (236 papers) was published between 1992 and July 2016. The number of papers significantly increased through time (R-2 = 0.92, p < 0.05). The studies were predominantly carried out in the Temperate Northern Atlantic (45%) followed by studies of global scale (11%) and studies in Temperate Australasia (10%). The majority of studies reviewed focused on theoretical ecology (37%) including investigations of biological invasions by non-native organisms, conservation planning (19%), and climate change predictions (17%). Most of the studies were published in ecological, multidisciplinary, or biodiversity conservation journals. Most of the studies (94%) failed to report the amount of uncertainty derived from data deficiencies and model parameters. Best practice recommendations are proposed here to ensure that novice and advanced SDM users can (a) understand the main elements of SDMs, (b) reproduce standard methods and analysis, and (c) identify potential limitations with their data. We suggest that in the future, studies of marine SDMs should report on key features of the approaches employed, data deficiencies, the selection of the best explanatory model, and the approach taken to validate the SDM results. In addition, based on the literature reviewed, we suggest that future marine SDMs should account for uncertainty levels as part of the modeling process.

AB  - Scientifically-based systematic conservation planning for reserve design requires knowledge of species richness patterns and how these are related to environmental gradients. In this study, we explore a large inventory of coastal breeding birds, in total 48 species, sampled in 4646 1 km(2) squares which covered a large archipelago in the Baltic Sea on the east coast of Sweden. We analysed how species richness (alpha diversity) and community composition (beta diversity) of two groups of coastal breeding birds (specialists, i.e. obligate coastal breeders; generalists, i.e. facultative coastal breeders) were affected by distance to open sea, land area, shoreline length and archipelago width. The total number of species per square increased with increasing shoreline length, but increasing land area counteracted this effect in specialists. The number of specialist bird species per square increased with decreasing distance to open sea, while the opposite was true for the generalists. Differences in community composition between squares were associated with differences in land area and distance to open sea, both when considering all species pooled and each group separately. Fourteen species were nationally red-listed, and showed similar relationships to the environmental gradients as did all species, specialists and generalists. We suggest that availability of suitable breeding habitats, and probably also proximity to feeding areas, explain much of the observed spatial distributions of coastal birds in this study. Our findings have important implications for systematic conservation planning of coastal breeding birds. In particular, we provide information on where coastal breeding birds occur and which environments they seem to prefer. Small land areas with long shorelines are highly valuable both in general and for red-listed species. Thus, such areas should be prioritized for protection against human disturbance and used by management in reserve selection.

AB  - Ecosystem specialists are predicted to be more vulnerable to global change than generalists, but whether specialists within an ecosystem will respond similarly to those changes is often largely unknown. Will specialists track changes in their habitats as a group, or are their distributions governed by landscape gradients that will make some species more sensitive to habitat changes? In this study, we forecasted the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on two salt marsh specialist bird species: clapper rails Rallus crepitans and seaside sparrows Ammodramus maritimus. We sampled the abundance of these two species in salt marshes throughout the Georgia, USA, coast in 2013-2014, and analyzed count data using a Bayesian N-mixture model. Model predictions were applied to an SLR land cover model to determine distribution shifts over 100 years. Both species distributions were most sensitive to the relative elevation gradient, with clapper rails using lower elevation marshes and seaside sparrows using higher elevation marshes. These disparities in habitat use, along with other differences according to marsh salinity and distance to forested areas, led to divergent responses to SLR. Clapper rail habitat is predicted to increase with SLR by 52%, but seaside sparrow habitat will contract by 81% by the year 2100. Seaside sparrow habitat is not predicted to decline until sometime between 2025 and 2050, at which point the decline will rapidly accelerate, indicating the importance of careful monitoring in future decades. Diverging responses to a global perturbation create a conservation planning dilemma: if specialists have opposing responses to SLR, it may be difficult to manage conservation areas that accommodate many species.

AB  - In situations where land is limited, such as on islands, wildlife conservation often takes a back seat to economic development. This is particularly the case in the Caribbean, where critical coastal resources are frequently converted into upscale developments. The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) has experienced intense and unmitigated development pressures in recent decades, presumably resulting in the loss of habitat for the endangered Virgin Islands Boa (Epicrates granti). This species is cryptic and difficult to locate, and thus it has been difficult to determine their full distribution and habitat needs. With ongoing development, there was an urgent need to identify locations where this species was likely to occur and to develop habitat conservation measures appropriate for developers. Using geographical information systems and opportunistic observations collected over 25 years, we created a habitat suitability model for E. granti that allowed for the prediction of presence in any particular area. We conducted microhabitat assessments to better understand habitat associations at a fine scale. Using this information, we developed a habitat delineation protocol for identifying appropriate habitat within a particular location. The habitat suitability model is being used by planning agencies to determine whether mitigation might be required for a given development project, and the habitat delineation protocols are being used by developers to identify areas within a proposed site that require additional protective measures. While the process is still in its infancy and not yet widely applied, there has been some success in scaling back development projects.

AB  - Understanding the effect of habitat characteristics on the distribution of threatened species are fundamental in conservation planning and management. Here, we explore the spatial distribution pattern of display site by the North African Houbara Bustard Chlatnydotis undulata undulata males. For this purpose, we examined 81 sites in an area of 255 km(2) located in the Jbil National Park. We hypothesised that in such an area, displaying males prefer sites that may ensure maximum survival, to find a mate and reproduce. We showed that the maximum display-sites density did not exceed 0.04 adult males km(-2) with significant patterns of non-random distribution. The fact that display sites exhibit significant positive spatial autocorrelation, as indicated by Moran's I, is consistent with a lek mating system. We also found a significant relationship between the selection of display sites and the following environmental variables: perennial species covers, annual species covers, percentage of gravel, percentage of other soil surface, plant height, and elevation. Moreover, simultaneous autoregressive models suggest that the inclusion of spatial autocorrelation globally gives better estimates of the regression coefficients.

AB  - Long-term perspectives are critical to understand contemporary ecological systems. However, historical data on the distribution of biodiversity have only rarely been used in applied environmental sciences. Here, we use historical sources to reconstruct the historical range of the European eel, a critically endangered species. We then use this baseline range to set range targets for the recovery of the European eel, as opposed to the abundance-based targets established by the European Union, which are constrained by the poor information on pre-collapse stocks. We collected over 10000 historical freshwater fish records from Spain in the 19th and 16th centuries, as well as over 25000 records from the global biodiversity information facility (GBIF) to characterize historical and current European eel distribution in the Iberian Peninsula. We converted fish records into an eel presence-absence data set using subcatchment as spatial unit of analysis and modelled eel distribution in the different historical periods. The eel was historically widespread throughout the Iberian Peninsula, but it has lost over 80% of its original range, mainly due to river fragmentation by dams. Distribution models applied to 16th- and 19th-century data showed a high agreement, supporting the use of the 19th-century estimated distribution as a baseline range. We identified the number and identity of dams that should be made passable for accomplishing specific range recovery targets, for example showing that acting upon 20 dams would make available 60% of the baseline eel range.Synthesis and applications. This work exemplifies how insights gained from historical ecology can support and guide present-day management of migratory fishes. Similar approaches could be developed throughout Europe to plan the recovery of the eel, since there are large amounts of historical eel records. Historical baseline ranges for the eel range should be incorporated into the European Union legal mandates aimed at the recovery of the species.

AB  - The future of wild tigers is dire, and the Global Tiger Initiative's (GTI) goal of doubling tiger population size by the next year of the tiger in 2022 will be challenging. The GTI has identified 20 tiger conservation landscapes (TCL) within which recovery actions will be needed to achieve these goals. The Amur tiger conservation landscape offers the best hope for tiger recovery in China where all other subspecies have most likely become extirpated. To prioritize recovery planning within this TCL, we used tiger occurrence data from adjacent areas of the Russian Far East to develop two empirical models of potential habitat that were then averaged with an expert-based habitat suitability model to identify potential tiger habitat in the Changbaishan ecosystem in Northeast China. We assessed the connectivity of tiger habitat patches using least-cost path analysis calibrated against known tiger movements in the Russian Far East to identify priority tiger conservation areas (TCAs). Using a habitat-based population estimation approach, we predicted that a potential of 98 (83112) adult tigers could occupy all TCAs in the Changbaishan ecosystem. By combining information about habitat quality, connectivity and potential population size, we identified the three best TCAs totaling over 25?000?km2 of potential habitat that could hold 79 (6382) adult tigers. Strong recovery actions are needed to restore potential tiger habitat to promote recovery of Amur tigers in China, including restoring ungulate populations, increasing tiger survival through improved anti-poaching activities, land-use planning that reduces human access and agricultural lands in and adjacent to key TCAs, and maintaining connectivity both within and across international boundaries. Our approach will be useful in other TCLs to prioritize recovery actions to restore worldwide tiger populations.

AB  - Prediction maps produced by species distribution models (SDMs) influence decision-making in resource management or designation of land in conservation planning. Many studies have compared the prediction accuracy of different SDM modeling methods, but few have quantified the similarity among prediction maps. There has also been little systematic exploration of how the relative importance of different predictor variables varies among model types and affects map similarity. Our objective was to expand the evaluation of SDM performance for 45 plant species in southern California to better understand how map predictions vary among model types, and to explain what factors may affect spatial correspondence, including the selection and relative importance of different environmental variables. Four types of models were tested. Correlation among maps was highest between generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) and lowest between classification trees and GAMs or GLMs. Correlation between Random Forests (RFs) and GAMs was the same as between RFs and classification trees. Spatial correspondence among maps was influenced the most by model prediction accuracy (AUC) and species prevalence; map correspondence was highest when accuracy was high and prevalence was intermediate (average prevalence for all species was 0.124). Species functional type and the selection of climate variables also influenced map correspondence. For most (but not all) species, climate variables were more important than terrain or soil in predicting their distributions. Environmental variable selection varied according to modeling method, but the largest differences were between RFs and GLMs or GAMs. Although prediction accuracy was equal for GLMs, GAMs, and RFs, the differences in spatial predictions suggest that it may be important to evaluate the results of more than one model to estimate the range of spatial uncertainty before making planning decisions based on map outputs. This may be particularly important if models have low accuracy or if species prevalence is not intermediate.

AB  - Increasingly disrupted and altered, the world's oceans are subject to immense and intensifying anthropogenic pressures. Of the biota inhabiting these ecosystems, marine birds are among the most threatened. For conservation efforts targeting marine birds to be effective, quantitative information relating to their at-sea density and distribution is typically a crucial knowledge component. In this study, we generated predictive machine learning ensemble models for 13 marine bird species and 7 groups (representing 24 additional species) in Canada's Pacific coast waters, including several species listed under Canada's Species at Risk Act. Predictive models were based on systematic marine bird line transect survey information collected in spring, summer, and fall on Canada's Pacific coast (2005-2008). Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS) was used to estimate marine bird density along transect segments. Spatial and temporal environmental predictors, including remote sensing information, were used in model ensembles, which were constructed using 4 machine learning algorithms in Salford Systems Predictive Modeler v7.0 (SPM7): Random Forests, TreeNet, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and Classification and Regression Trees. Predictive models were subsequently combined to generate seasonal and overall predictions of areas important to marine birds based on normalized marine bird species or group richness and densities. Our results employ open access data sharing and are intended to better inform marine bird conservation efforts and management planning on Canada's Pacific coast and for broader-scale geographic initiatives across North America and elsewhere.

AB  - Cats (Felis silvestris catus) are one of the most pernicious invasive species on islands, being responsible for the decline and extinction of many vertebrate taxa. Eradications programs are a powerful tool to fight against cat impacts on islands, but their implementation requires planning and design to prevent failure. In that sense, gathering data on cat habitat use, abundance and trophic interactions provides key information to effectively design management actions. The present contribution presents a simple resource-efficient methodology using cat feces to assess cat distribution, density and trophic ecology on an inhabited islet. This information is essential in order to effectively organize trapping efforts and minimize subsequent impacts of other species if a control or eradication campaign is undertaken. Additionally, our research effort evaluated the potential influence of coastal and anthropic resources on cat diet, which can also provide useful information for planning aside management actions. Cat distribution on our model islet, La Graciosa, was clumped', presenting higher densities in anthropic areas (villages and farms). The invasive house mouse and the European rabbit were the main prey items, although native invertebrates, reptiles and birds were also consumed. Cats on La Graciosa ingested a large quantity of garbage, which was negatively correlated with distance from human settlements. Considering the low time and resource requirements of this methodology, and the useful basic ecological information it provides, it can be employed to make optimal management planning decisions for small inhabited islands where cat control or eradication programs are being considered.

AB  - North American freshwaters are among the world's most threatened ecosystems, and freshwater mussels are among the most imperiled inhabiting these systems. A critical aspect of conservation biology is delineating patterns of genetic diversity, which can be difficult when a taxon has been extirpated from a significant portion of its historical range. In such cases, evaluating conservation and recovery options may benefit by using surrogate species as proxies when assessing overall patterns of genetic diversity. Here, we integrate the premise of surrogate species into a comparative phylogeographic framework to hypothesize genetic relationships between extant and extirpated populations ofPotamilus inflatusby characterizing genetic structure in co-distributed congeners with similar life histories and dispersal capabilities. Our mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data exhibited variable patterns of genetic divergence betweenPotamilusspp. native to the Mobile and Pascagoula + Pearl + Pontchartrain (PPP) provinces. However, hierarchical Approximate Bayesian Computation indicated that the diversification between Mobile and PPP clades was synchronous and represents a genetic signature of a common history of vicariance. Recent fluctuations in sea-level appear to have causedPotamilusspp. in the PPP to form a single genetic cluster, providing justification for using individuals from the Amite River as a source of brood stock to re-establish extirpated populations ofP. inflatus. Future studies utilizing eDNA and genome-wide molecular data are essential to better understand the distribution ofP. inflatusand establish robust recovery plans. Given the imperilment status of freshwater mussels globally, our study represents a useful methodology for predicting relationships among extant and extirpated populations of imperiled species.

AB  - Coastal habitats have experienced significant degradation and fragmentation in recent decades under the strain of interacting ecosystem stressors. To maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, coastal managers and restoration practitioners face the urgent tasks of identifying priority areas for protection and developing innovative, scalable approaches to habitat restoration. Facilitating these efforts are models of seascape connectivity, which represent ecological linkages across heterogeneous marine environments by predicting species-specific dispersal between suitable habitat patches. However, defining the suitable habitat patches and migratory pathways required to construct ecologically realistic connectivity models remains challenging. Focusing on two reef-associated fish species of the Florida Keys, United States of America (USA), we compared two methods for constructing species- and life stage-specific spatial models of habitat suitability-penalized logistic regression and maximum entropy (MaxEnt). The goal of the model comparison was to identify the modeling algorithm that produced the most realistic and detailed products for use in subsequent connectivity assessments. Regardless of species, MaxEnt's ability to distinguish between suitable and unsuitable locations exceeded that of the penalized regressions. Furthermore, MaxEnt's habitat suitability predictions more closely aligned with the known ecology of the study species, revealing the environmental conditions and spatial patterns that best support each species across the seascape, with implications for predicting connectivity pathways and the distribution of key ecological processes. Our research demonstrates MaxEnt's promise as a scalable, species-specific, and spatially explicit tool for informing models of seascape connectivity and guiding coastal conservation efforts.

AB  - Where threatened biodiversity is adversely affected by development, policies often state that "no net loss" should be the goal and biodiversity offsetting is one mechanism available to achieve this. However, developments are often approved on an ad hoc basis and cumulative impacts are not sufficiently examined. We demonstrate the potential for serious threat to an endangered subspecies when multiple developments are planned. We modelled the distribution of the black-throated finch (Poephila cincta cincta) using bioclimatic data and Queensland's Regional Ecosystem classification. We overlaid granted, extant extractive and exploratory mining tenures within the known and modelled ranges of black-throated finches to examine the level of incipient threat to this subspecies in central Queensland, Australia. Our models indicate that more than half of the remaining P. cincta cincta habitat is currently under extractive or exploratory tenure. Therefore, insufficient habitat exists to offset all potential development so "no net loss" is not possible. This has implications for future conservation of this and similarly distributed species and for resource development planning, especially the use of legislated offsets for biodiversity protection.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the impacts of climate change on the distribution of major tree species in the temperate forests of Northern Iran (also known as Hyrcanian forests). We analyzed the current distributions of the eleven major tree species using an ensemble approach involving five different species distribution models (generalized linear model, generalized additive model, generalized boosting model, classification tree analysis, and random forests) and generated the ensemble maps of the current and future distribution of each species. For the future, we used five general circulation models and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Finally, we mapped beta-diversity and changes in alpha-diversity of the tree species under climate change. Our analyses showed that generally, the climatically suitable habitats for most of the species tend to shift and shrink in the future. A shift in major trees boundaries will be expected both along an east-west gradient and along an altitudinal gradient under climate change scenarios. The results demonstrated that climate change is likely to exert a strong influence on beta-diversity and richness of the major tree species in northern forests of Iran. In total, beta-diversity of tree species will be higher in the central and eastern parts compared with the western areas under the climate change scenarios and the mid-elevations of the western Hyrcanian forests will likely experience the lowest beta-diversity through time, meaning that the impacts of climate change on these regions are minimal. The impacts of climate change on the distribution of major tree species in the Hyrcanian forests can be considered very severe and pose a high risk of loss in forest functions and services. Forest managers will encounter several uncertainties in the wood productions, plantation, restoration, and conservation plans due to climate change in the Hyrcanian forests.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a salient threat to many animal taxa, causing local and global extinctions, altering communities and ecosystem function. The EID chytridiomycosis is a prominent driver of amphibian declines, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). To guide conservation policy, we developed a predictive decision-analytic model that combines empirical knowledge of host-pathogen metapopulation dynamics with expert judgment regarding effects of management actions, to select from potential conservation strategies. We apply our approach to a boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) and Bd system, identifying optimal strategies that balance tradeoffs in maximizing toad population persistence and landscape-level distribution, while considering costs. The most robust strategy is expected to reduce the decline of toad breeding sites from 53% to 21% over 50 years. Our findings are incorporated into management policy to guide conservation planning. Our online modeling application provides a template for managers of other systems challenged by EIDs.

AB  - The geographic distribution of Bornean orang-utans and its overlap with existing land-use categories (protected areas, logging and plantation concessions) is a necessary foundation to prioritize conservation planning. Based on an extensive orang-utan survey dataset and a number of environmental variables, we modelled an orang-utan distribution map. The modelled orang-utan distribution map covers 155,106 km(2) (21% of Borneo's landmass) and reveals four distinct distribution areas. The most important environmental predictors are annual rainfall and land cover. The overlap of the orang-utan distribution with land-use categories reveals that only 22% of the distribution lies in protected areas, but that 29% lies in natural forest concessions. A further 19% and 6% occurs in largely undeveloped oil palm and tree plantation concessions, respectively. The remaining 24% of the orang-utan distribution range occurs outside of protected areas and outside of concessions. An estimated 49% of the orang-utan distribution will be lost if all forest outside of protected areas and logging concessions is lost. To avoid this potential decline plantation development in orang-utan habitats must be halted because it infringes on national laws of species protection. Further growth of the plantation sector should be achieved through increasing yields in existing plantations and expansion of new plantations into areas that have already been deforested. To reach this goal a large scale island-wide land-use masterplan is needed that clarifies which possible land uses and managements are allowed in the landscape and provides new standardized strategic conservation policies. Such a process should make much better use of non-market values of ecosystem services of forests such as water provision, flood control, carbon sequestration, and sources of livelihood for rural communities. Presently land use planning is more driven by vested interests and direct and immediate economic gains, rather than by approaches that take into consideration social equity and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Predicting the distribution of suitable habitats for species under climate change is essential for conservation planning. In the past three decades, the number of Persian squirrels (Sciurus anomalus) and the area covered by the Persian oak (Quercus brantii) have decreased due to various factors such as habitat degradation. Habitat suitability of the above interacting species was assessed under the current conditions and future (2050) climate change scenarios in western Iran, using a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). The model performed well with an average area under the curve of above 0.9 for the two species. Precipitation in winter was the factor that contributed most to habitat suitability of both species. The MaxEnt projection for the year 2050 revealed a reduction in the area of suitable habitats for both species. Based on the outputs from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research Coupled Model (HadCM) scenarios, the fundamental niche (the range of environmental conditions in which the species can survive) of the Persian squirrel will reduce by between 0.12 and 1.1%. However, under the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques Coupled Model scenarios, small gains in potential habitats may be observed. The area of suitable habitats for the oak was reduced under all scenarios except HadCM (representative concentration pathway 2.6). The results showed that the loss of suitable habitats for both species was more evident in the northern part of the range where the best habitats currently exist. In contrast, small gains in suitable habitats may be observed in the southern and eastern part of the range.

AB  - Understanding the spatial structure of populations is fundamental to effective assessment, planning, and management for species conservation. Because of their sensitivity and public interest, grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) are focused upon in some localized development issues and proactive conservation initiatives. Knowledge regarding the spatial context of regional grizzly bear populations is important, but often a defensible representation of probable population distribution, core areas, and connectivity is lacking. We describe the development and assessment of a regional landscape model of grizzly bear density and distribution. Our study region comprised 180,000 km(2) and 20 management units of southeast British Columbia and southwest Alberta. Our meta-analysis was based on data from 20 independent grizzly bear population surveys across the region. While accounting for differing design parameters among surveys, we contrasted grizzly bear detections against sampling representation relative to scale-dependent landscape factors. Our predictors pertained to the influence of climate, terrain, land cover, vegetation indices, and human activity. Associations within survey areas were consistent with ecological influences on grizzly bear foods and human influences on grizzly bear mortality risk and landscape avoidance. A multiple logistic regression model based on independent components of ecological variation fit well the data pooled across the region and within individual survey areas. Average values of detection probability among survey areas predicted population density (R-2 = 0.64 or 0.79 depending on one outlier). Our results support the application of our model across southeast British Columbia and southwest Alberta for assessment and planning that requires regional and local context of grizzly bear population abundance and distribution, and inference of core areas and population connections among them. For any geographic area, a population estimate can be obtained that is reflective of surveys used in the model. Spatial predictions for any defined population are likely to be more reliable than those extrapolated from tracking data of individual animals given limitations typical of such sampling. Ultimately, model output provides regional population context for environmental assessment, management, and conservation planning, nested within which should be finer-scale data and prediction where available.

AB  - Sicily hosts the largest European population of the endangered lanner falcon, a poorly known species which needs conservation planning based on habitat preferences. A distribution model on 10 x 10 km cells of Sicily was described using Generalized Linear Models and variation partitioning methods. This modelling approach extracted explanatory factors, pure and joint effects of greatest influence from subsets of variables controlled for multi-collinearity and spatial autocorrelation. Analytical cartography used the environmental favourability function to assess habitat preferences, and the insecurity index estimated the degree to which lanner falcon occupancy is represented in the Natura2000 networks of Sicily. The lanner population is not randomly distributed across the geographical space as the significant latitudinal effect revealed. The most parsimonious explanatory model suggested traditional agro-ecosystems (i.e. arable lowlands and grasslands, with rugged terrains and cliffs) as the best predictors of lanner occupancy, and gave strong support to the negative effects of land abandonment and intensification (i.e. increase of heterogeneous areas and shrubby vegetation). The variation partitioning method suggested how an alteration of traditional agro-ecosystems might enhance interference competition with the peregrine falcon and limit lanner falcon occupancy. Most of the lanner falcon favourable habitats fall outside the Natura2000 networks, thus the main challenge for its conservation is represented by agri-environmental measures to be taken within the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. Conservation of traditional agro-ecosystems devoted to top-predators, like the lanner falcon, requires single environmental management agreements for multiple farm units, deployed at landscape scale on a network of favourable areas.

AB  - Developing conservation strategies for threatened species increasingly requires understanding vulnerabilities to climate change, in terms of both demographic sensitivities to climatic and other environmental factors, and exposure to variability in those factors over time and space. We conducted a range-wide, spatially explicit climate change vulnerability assessment for Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), a declining endemic species in a region showing strong environmental change. Using active season and winter adult survival estimates derived from 17 data sets throughout the species' range, we identified demographic sensitivities to winter drought, maximum precipitation during the summer, and the proportion of the surrounding landscape dominated by agricultural and urban land cover. Each of these factors was negatively associated with active season adult survival rates in binomial generalized linear models. We then used these relationships to back-cast adult survival with dynamic climate variables from 1950 to 2008 using spatially explicit demographic models. Demographic models for 189 population locations predicted known extant and extirpated populations well (AUC = 0.75), and models based on climate and land cover variables were superior to models incorporating either of those effects independently. These results suggest that increasing frequencies and severities of extreme events, including drought and flooding, have been important drivers of the long-term spatiotemporal variation in a demographic rate. We provide evidence that this variation reflects nonadaptive sensitivity to climatic stressors, which are contributing to long-term demographic decline and range contraction for a species of high-conservation concern. Range-wide demographic modeling facilitated an understanding of spatial shifts in climatic suitability and exposure, allowing the identification of important climate refugia for a dispersal-limited species. Climate change vulnerability assessment provides a framework for linking demographic and distributional dynamics to environmental change, and can thereby provide unique information for conservation planning and management.

AB  - Least-cost models for focal species are widely used to design wildlife corridors. To evaluate the least-cost modeling approach used to develop 15 linkage designs in southern California, USA, we assessed robustness of the largest and least constrained linkage. Species experts parameterized models for eight species with weights for four habitat factors (land cover, topographic position, elevation, road density) and resistance values for each class within a factor (e. g., each class of land cover). Each model produced a proposed corridor for that species. We examined the extent to which uncertainty in factor weights and class resistance values affected two key conservation-relevant outputs, namely, the location and modeled resistance to movement of each proposed corridor. To do so, we compared the proposed corridor to 13 alternative corridors created with parameter sets that spanned the plausible ranges of biological uncertainty in these parameters. Models for five species were highly robust (mean overlap 88%, little or no increase in resistance). Although the proposed corridors for the other three focal species overlapped as little as 0% (mean 58%) of the alternative corridors, resistance in the proposed corridors for these three species was rarely higher than resistance in the alternative corridors (mean difference was 0.025 on a scale of 1-10; worst difference was 0.39). As long as the model had the correct rank order of resistance values and factor weights, our results suggest that the predicted corridor is robust to uncertainty. The three carnivore focal species, alone or in combination, were not effective umbrellas for the other focal species. The carnivore corridors failed to overlap the predicted corridors of most other focal species and provided relatively high resistance for the other focal species (mean increase of 2.7 resistance units). Least-cost modelers should conduct uncertainty analysis so that decision-makers can appreciate the potential impact of model uncertainty on conservation decisions. Our approach to uncertainty analysis (which can be called a worst-case scenario approach) is appropriate for complex models in which distribution of the input parameters cannot be specified.

AB  - In Mediterranean countries, inventories of many animal groups particularly insects, are incomplete or nonexistent. Hence, a feasible spatial picture of unequally surveyed areas is required to ascertain which faunistic surveys are good enough to produce reliable estimates of species richness. We used generalized linear models to build a multiple-regression function through which we predicted the distribution of Iberian dung beetle species richness. Given the scarcity and unevenness of the species-richness spatial distribution, the number of records of a dung beetle database (BANDASCA), falling within each of the 50 x 50 km grid squares, was chosen as a measure of the sampling effort for that square. Examining the asymptotic relationship between the number of dung-beetle species and database records for each physioclimatic Iberian subregion, we found that 82 grid squares (32% of the total) were adequately sampled. Dung-beetle species richness was related in each of these 82 cells to 24 explanatory variables. Curvilinear functions, interaction terms, and the significant third-degree polynomial terms of latitude and longitude were included to model species-richness distribution. The final model accounted for 62.4% of the total deviance after we eliminated seven outlier squares, with maximum elevation, grassland area, land-use diversity, forest area, geological diversity, interaction of terrestrial area and maximum elevation, and interaction between calcareous rock, and geological diversity and latitude being the most significant independent variables. The residuals of the function were not spatially autocorrelated, and we validated the final model by a jackknife procedure. Large and environmentally complex hotspots in the Iberian Central, Baetic, and Subbaetic mountain ranges stand out from the emerging map of species richness. Further detailed research is required to determine the complementarity of the faunas of these two main hotspots, the key question in conservation planning for a dung-feeding beetle.

AB  - Old trees as a natural heritage are significant components of terrestrial biodiversity, and they also play an important role in the ecosystem. An overall understanding of the distribution patterns and ecological characteristics of old trees in China's Anhui Province will provide valuable insights into old tree conservation and scientific planning. Based on the data from 617 field collection and historical sample documents, we applied DIVA-GIS combined with the BIOCLIM model to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the distribution patterns of old trees and their dominant climate factors for the first time. The model assessment results indicated that the area under the receiving operator curve (AUC) and kappa statistics reached 0.969 and 0.921, respectively, which indicated that the data fit the model very well and that the prediction was highly reliable. According to principal component analysis (PCA), the main bioclimatic variables influencing the distribution of old trees were as follows: water requirements, drought tolerance, preference temperature, heat resistance, cold tolerance and others. The cumulative frequency curves further confirmed that the ecological characteristics of the geographical distributing area for old trees in the study area were annual mean temperature (10.90 similar to 16.30 degrees C), maximum temperature of warmest month (25.60 similar to 32.40 degrees C), mean temperature of coldest quarter (0.30 similar to 4.90 degrees C), annual precipitation (665.00 similar to 1701.00 mm), precipitation of driest month (14.00 similar to 47.00 mm) and precipitation of driest quarter (45.00 similar to 173.00 mm). The current distribution pattern of old trees was mainly affected by precipitation factors. Furthermore, this study demonstrates a new method for the conservation of old trees by virtue of GIS software and predictive models. All of these results could help establish conservation plans for old trees.

AB  - Aim Chestnuts (Castanea spp.) are ecologically and economically important species. We studied the general biology, distribution and climatic limits of seven chestnut species from around the world. We provided climatic matching of Asiatic species to North America to assist the range-wide restoration of American chestnut [C. dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.] by incorporating blight-resistant genes from Asiatic species. Location North America, Europe and East Asia. Methods General chestnut biology was reviewed on the basis of published literature and field observations. Chestnut distributions were established using published range maps and literature. Climatic constraints were analysed for the northern and southern distribution limits and the entire range for each species using principal component analysis (PCA) of fourteen bioclimatic variables. Climatic envelope matching was performed for three Chinese species using Maxent modelling to predict corresponding suitable climate zones for those species in North America. Results Chestnuts are primarily distributed in the warm-temperate and subtropical zones in the northern hemisphere. PCA results revealed that thermal gradient was the primary control of chestnut distribution. Climatic spaces of different species overlap with one another to different degrees, but strong similarities are shown especially between Chinese species and American species. Climatic envelope matching suggested that large areas in eastern North America have a favourable climate for Chinese species. Main conclusions The general biological traits and climatic limits of the seven chestnut species are very similar. The predictions of Chinese species climatic range corresponded with most of the historical American chestnut range. Thus, a regionally adapted, blight-resistant, introgressed hybrid American chestnut appears feasible if a sufficiently diverse array of Chinese chestnut germplasm is used as a source of blight resistance. Our study provided a between-continent climate matching approach to facilitate the range-wide species restoration, which can be readily applied in planning the restoration of other threatened or endangered species.

AB  - In order to prioritize the conservation and management efforts to protect jaguars (Panthera onca), it is of utmost importance to determine their tolerance in face of human disturbances, habitat modifications and varying degrees of prey availability. We assessed the occupancy probability of jaguars and five of their most common prey species throughout a heterogeneous landscape in the Selva Maya in southern Mexico: armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), coati (Nasua narica), paca (Cuniculus paca), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and collared peccary (Dicotyles tajacu). Additionally, we projected prey and Jaguar occupancies onto a 5993 km(2) landscape based on the habitat type in the area. We averaged the best prey models ranked by QAICc and found that white-tailed deer had the highest average occupancy probability of 0.72 +/- 0.06 and paca the lowest with 0.14 +/- 0.04. The average occupancy probability for jaguars was 0.35 +/- 0.07 and the strongest predictor of jaguar occupancy was a positive effect of collared peccary occupancy. These findings support previous studies that show that predator distribution is largely influenced by their prey availability, even in the midst of degraded habitats, and underlies the essential need to incorporate protection plans for prey species in jaguar conservation strategies.

AB  - Climate refugia, or places where habitats are expected to remain relatively buffered from regional climate extremes, provide an important focus for science and conservation planning. Within high-priority, multi-jurisdictional landscapes like the Madrean sky islands of the United States and Mexico, efforts to identify and manage climate refugia are hindered by the lack of high-quality and consistent transboundary datasets. To fill these data gaps, we assembled a bi-national field dataset (n = 1416) for five pine species (Pinus spp.) and used generalized boosted regression to model pine habitats in relation to topographic variability as a basis for identifying potential microrefugia at local scales in the context of current species' distribution patterns. We developed additional models to quantify climatic refugial attributes using coarse scale bioclimatic variables and finer scale seasonal remote sensing indices. Terrain metrics including ruggedness, slope position, and aspect defined microrefugia for pines within elevation ranges preferred by each species. Response to bioclimatic variables indicated that small shifts in climate were important to some species (e.g., P. chihuahuana, P. strobiformis), but others exhibited a broader tolerance (e.g., P. arizonica). Response to seasonal climate was particularly important in modeling microrefugia for species with open canopy structure and where regular fires occur (e.g., P. engelmannii and P. chihuahuana). Hotspots of microrefugia differed among species and were either limited to northern islands or occurred across central or southern latitudes. Mapping and validation of refugia and their ecological functions are necessary steps in developing regional conservation strategies that cross jurisdictional boundaries. A salient application will be incorporation of climate refugia in management of fire to restore and maintain pine ecology. Una version en espanol de este articulo esta disponible como descarga.

AB  - Multiple studies have used species distribution models to identify human-wildlife conflict drivers. An important application of these models is spatial conflict resolution by accounting for habitat suitability and corridors. We used distribution and connectivity models to identify habitats and corridors for brown bear Ursus arctos in southwestern Iran with high risk of bear damages, and evaluated the effects of landscape composition and configuration on the predicted conflict hotspots. We used 154 locations of bear damage incidents along with a suit of predictors to develop risk models. To prepare predictive variables, we used brown bear occurrence data and a number of covariates to develop a suitability model. We then converted the suitability map into a resistance surface and used a connectivity model to predict corridors. Finally, the bear damages risk map, habitats and corridors were overlaid to prioritize conflict hotspots, corridors and habitats, and conflict-prone corridors. Proportion of suitable habitats, distance to village, density of forest patches, conservation areas and corridor bottlenecks were the main predictors contributing to bear damages risk. A total of 38.73% of habitats, and 6.24% of corridors across the 124 000-km(2) study area were identified as areas with high risk of bear damages. The risk of bear damage was also spatially associated with forests fragmentation and patchiness of habitat. Our results highlight the importance of landscape configuration and corridors when investigating the spatial patterns of bear damages. Our findings showed how the combination of distribution models and connectivity analysis can guide carnivore conservation planning aiming at reducing the risk of carnivore-inflicted damages.

AB  - Warming across the low Arctic is increasing tundra vegetation productivity and facilitating the expansion of upright shrubs. We modeled the effects of warming on habitat suitability in green alder, dwarf birch, Labrador tea, bog bilberry, and lingonberry and assessed the influence of data type (true absence or pseudo-absence) on species distribution models (SDMs). We generated SDMs using the two absence data types under current (1970-2000) and future (2061-2080) climate projections. Our results show that warming leads to range expansion of all shrubs, though responses vary in magnitude and extent, with mean increases in suitability ranging from 0.080 (Labrador tea) to 0.369 (lingonberry) with true absences. Differences in driving variables and suitability projections suggest that physiological and ecological variability between species mediate responses to warming. Between data types, we observed inconsistencies in model performance, suitability projections, and variable importance. Bog bilberry and lingonberry exhibited larger differences in suitability (0.201 and 0.288, respectively), whereas alder showed similar responses (difference of 0.01). These results are important to consider when assessing changes in habitat suitability or identifying environmental or climatic determinants of species' distributions. We suggest further development of open data repositories, facilitating access to true absence data to support conservation and land use planning.

AB  - P>1. Conservationists routinely use species distribution models to plan conservation, restoration and development actions, while ecologists use them to infer process from pattern. These models tend to work well for common or easily observable species, but are of limited utility for rare and cryptic species. This may be because honest accounting of known observation bias and spatial autocorrelation are rarely included, thereby limiting statistical inference of resulting distribution maps.
   2. We specified and implemented a spatially explicit Bayesian hierarchical model for a cryptic mammal species (pygmy rabbit Brachylagus idahoensis). Our approach used two levels of indirect sign that are naturally hierarchical (burrows and faecal pellets) to build a model that allows for inference on regression coefficients as well as spatially explicit model parameters. We also produced maps of rabbit distribution (occupied burrows) and relative abundance (number of burrows expected to be occupied by pygmy rabbits). The model demonstrated statistically rigorous spatial prediction by including spatial autocorrelation and measurement uncertainty.
   3. We demonstrated flexibility of our modelling framework by depicting probabilistic distribution predictions using different assumptions of pygmy rabbit habitat requirements.
   4. Spatial representations of the variance of posterior predictive distributions were obtained to evaluate heterogeneity in model fit across the spatial domain. Leave-one-out cross-validation was conducted to evaluate the overall model fit.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our method draws on the strengths of previous work, thereby bridging and extending two active areas of ecological research: species distribution models and multi-state occupancy modelling. Our framework can be extended to encompass both larger extents and other species for which direct estimation of abundance is difficult.

AB  - Understanding factors that affect the distribution and abundance of species is critical to developing effective management plans for conservation. Our goal was to quantify the distribution and abundance of Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), a threatened old-forest associate in Alberta, Canada. The Canada Warbler has declined across its range, including in Alberta where habitat loss and alteration from urban expansion, forestry, and energy development are changing the forest landscape. We used 110,427 point count survey visits from 32,287 unique survey stations to model local-level (150-m radius circular buffers) and stand-level (564-m radius circular buffers) habitat associations of the Canada Warbler. We found that habitat supporting higher densities of Canada Warblers was locally concentrated yet broadly distributed across Alberta's boreal forest region. Canada Warblers were most commonly associated with older deciduous forest at the local scale, particularly near small, incised streams, and greater amounts of deciduous forest at the stand scale. Predicted density was lower in other forest types and younger age classes measured at the local scale. There was little evidence that local-scale fragmentation (i.e., edges created by linear features) influenced Canada Warbler abundance. However, current forestry practices in the province likely will reduce the availability of Canada Warbler habitat over time by cutting old deciduous forest stands. Our results suggest that conservation efforts aimed at Canada Warbler focus on retaining large stands of old deciduous forest, specifically stands adjacent to streams, by increasing the width of deciduous retention buffers along streams during harvest and increasing the size and number of old forest residual patches in harvested stands.

AB  - Aim Our aim was to develop predictive statistical models for mapping the abundance of 18 waterfowl species at a pan-Canadian level. We refined the previous generation of national waterfowl models by (a) developing new, more interpretable statistical models that (b) explicitly account for spatiotemporal variations in waterfowl abundance, while (c) testing for associations with an updated suite of habitat covariates. Location All of Canada, excluding the Northern Arctic ecozone. Methods Our response variables were annual species counts on 2,227 aerial-survey segments over a period of 25 years (1990-2015). Combining machine-learning and hierarchical regression modelling, we devised an innovative covariate selection strategy to select for each species the best subset of a panel of 232 candidate habitat covariates. With the selected covariates, we implemented hierarchical generalized linear models in a Bayesian framework, using the integrated nested Laplace approximation and stochastic partial differential equation approaches. Results On average, our models explained 47% of the observed variance for spatiotemporal predictions and 74% for temporally averaged spatial predictions. The 18 species models included 94 significant waterfowl-habitat associations involving 42 distinct habitat covariates, with an average of 5.3 covariates per model. Covariates for forest attributes were the most represented in our models. The proportional biomass ofPopulus tremuloideswas the most frequently selected covariate (10/94 associations in 10/18 species). Model predictions generated spatial and spatiotemporal maps of species abundances over almost all of Canada. Main conclusions We showed that it is possible to efficiently combine machine-learning, variable selection and hierarchical Bayesian methods that exploit high-dimensional covariate spaces. Our approach yielded powerful and easily interpretable species distribution models with very few covariates, while accounting for residual autocorrelation. Possible applications of the resulting models and maps include the development of biodiversity indicators, the evaluation and execution of conservation planning strategies, and ecosystem services monitoring.

AB  - Observed species richness (OSR) is a widely used and well-studied biodiversity metric. However, non-observed species in favorable ecosystems are also relevant. Two metrics that include observed and potential species were recently defined: potential biodiversity (hereafter potential species richness-PSR) and geometric mean of favorabilities (GMF). We used these metrics to evaluate the national park network of mainland Spain at two time periods (2002 and 2015), using terrestrial mammals on a UTM 100-km(2) grid. PSR and GMF are based on the favorability function, a species distribution model that assesses how favorable an area is for the presence of a species, over and above its prevalence in the study area. For each park and for the whole network, we calculated the mean and sum of OSR, PSR, and GMF in each time period, as well as changes between periods. OSR and PSR were higher inside than outside the park network in both time periods. Thus, although the network covers a very small proportion of the country, it performs well for the representation of mammal species and their favorable areas. However, mean PSR was lower in 2015 than in 2002 inside the national park network, whereas the opposite was the case outside the network. Mountainous Parks generally not only concentrated highly favorable areas for mammals, but they also showed less favorable areas in 2015 compared to 2002, although the reduction was moderate to low. This is a result to consider for future analyses because if the tendency increases, it may have consequences for the conservation of mammals and for the adequacy of the national park network.

AB  - The global climate is changing faster than previously anticipated. Although scientists expect cumulatively deleterious impacts to birds and other wildlife, effects on individual species are likely more complex. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has monitored > 100 songbirds across 37,600 km(2) of Northern California conifer forests for close to two decades to facilitate informed, science-based conservation planning. The study area represents 42% of all conifer forests in the state. Autonomous sound recorders were used to survey birds at 1065 randomly distributed sites from 2002 to 2016. The richness of Neotropical migrants declined below 1515 m (90% CI: 1150-1950 m) elevation whereas it increased above this threshold after controlling for changes in tree cover due to forestry and wildfire. This finding suggests an overall upward shift in Neotropical migrant distributions in response to an annual 0.037 degrees C (90% CI: 0.029-0.045 degrees C) increase in mean daily May temperature during the timespan. Residents and altitudinal migrants may be less vulnerable to increasing temperatures, conversely, as evidence of elevational shifting was much weaker or non-existent for them. Yet for individual species, there were both declines and increases in occupancy. Rapid and mixed population trends, in combination with elevational range shifts, suggest that songbirds vary widely in their capacity to adapt to climate change and other stressors. Conservation of structurally-complex and fire resilient forests above similar to 1500 m elevation is paramount in helping to buffer songbirds against rising temperatures. The expansion of biodiversity monitoring across large taxonomic, spatial, and temporal extents is vital to effective conservation planning.

AB  - The climate oscillations of the quaternary periods have profoundly affected the geographic distributions of current species. Acer davidii is a deciduous forest tree species mainly distributed in East Asia and China, playing a dominant role in the local forest ecosystem. In order to study the potential changes of geographic distributions of A. davidii in climate fluctuations, we collected the relate geographical distribution data and six climatic variables, using maximum entropy modelling to determine the species distribution. The results showed that the Areas Under Curve (AUC) values of the working characteristic curves of the subjects in the five historical periods were all greater than 0.93, suggesting that the results of maximum entropy modelling were accurate. The simulation of species distribution showed that the suitable area of A. davidii was mainly concentrated in central and northern China in contemporary times. From the Last Interglacial Age (LIG) to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and then to the future (2050, 2070), the distribution area of this species experienced a decrease (LGM similar to Current; the high adaptability areas of central China became moderate) then an increase (Current similar to 2050, the adaptation areas expanded to South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Siberia), and finally decreased (2050 similar to 2070, the suitable areas of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Siberia shrank returning to China at latitude 25 degrees N). Compared to the LGM, the area of contemporary suitable area increased. Interestingly, the area of suitable growth range under future climatic conditions (2050) increased by half than before, and the suitable distribution area moved from Midwest China to Northeast China. This study on the change of species distribution can provide a typical case for the model study on the response of plants to climate change in the north temperate and subtropical zones of East Asia. Meanwhile, it can also give a basis for planting planning, species protection, and management.

AB  - Our knowledge on broad-scale patterns of biodiversity, as a basis for biogeographical models and conservation planning, largely rests upon studies on the spatial distribution of vertebrates and plants, neglecting large parts of the world's biodiversity. To reassess the generality of these patterns and better understand spatial diversity distributions of invertebrates, we analyzed patterns of species richness and endemism of a hyperdiverse insect taxon, carabid beetles (ca 11 000 Palaearctic species known), and its cross-taxon congruence with well-studied vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles) and plants across 107 units of the Palaearctic. Based on species accumulation curves, we accounted for completeness of the carabid data by separately examining the western (well-sampled) and eastern (partly less well-sampled) Palaearctic and China (deficient data). For the western Palaearctic, we highlight overall centers of invertebrate, vertebrate and plant diversity. Species richness and endemism of carabids were highly correlated with patterns of especially plant and amphibian diversity across large parts of the Palaearctic. For the well-sampled western Palaearctic, hotspots of diversity integrating invertebrates were located in Italy, Spain and Greece. Only analysis of Chinese provinces yielded low congruence between carabids and plants/vertebrates. However, Chinese carabid diversity is only insufficiently known and China features the highest numbers of annual new descriptions of carabids in the Palaearctic. Even based on the incomplete data, China harbors at least 25% of all Palaearctic carabid species. Our study shows that richness and endemism patterns of highly diverse insects can exhibit high congruence with general large scale patterns of diversity inferred from plants/vertebrates and that hotspots derived from the latter can also include a high diversity of invertebrates. In this regard, China qualifies as an outstanding multi-taxon hotspot of diversity, requiring intense biodiversity research and conservation effort. Our findings extend the limited knowledge on broad-scale invertebrate distributions and allow for a better understanding of diversity patterns across a larger range of the world's biodiversity than usually considered.

AB  - Determining the drivers, patterns and hotspots of biodiversity can be of critical importance in supporting regional conservation planning. However, as biodiversity hotspots can be described with several different metrics, it is important to investigate their congruence as well as the spatial overlap of hotspots with protected areas. Here, by using extensive data on climate, topography, soil characteristics and vascular plants combined with boosted regression tree models, we determine the patterns and key drivers of plant diversity hotspots along broad environmental gradients in northernmost Europe spanning from taiga landscapes to treeless tundra. We assess plant diversity with four metrics - species richness, range-rarity richness, threatened species richness, and local contribution to beta diversity - and examine their congruence with each other as well as with contemporary conservation areas.
   We found that climate plays an important role in governing species diversity, though topo-edaphic are highlighted alongside climatic predictors in determining the diversity patterns of many threatened, near threatened, and range-restricted species. Importantly, the different diversity metrics have contrasting drivers and, overall, their hotspots have low congruence. Furthermore, existing protected areas appear to offer limited coverage for hotspots of vascular plant diversity.
   Modelling the various facets of diversity and their drivers, such as the topo-edaphic setting, may provide useful information to help conserve diversity in a changing climate. Projected patterns of different aspects of diversity and their congruency can provide insights into the processes underlying biodiversity and be employed to assess the representativeness of protected area networks.

AB  - Forest conservation strategies and plans can be unsuccessful if the new habitat conditions determined by climate change are not considered. Our work aims at investigating the likelihood of future suitability, distribution and diversity for some common European forest species under the projected changes in climate, focusing on Southern Europe. We combine an Ensemble Platform for Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) driven by two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), to produce maps of future climate-driven habitat suitability for ten categories of forest species and two time horizons. For each forest category and time horizon, ten maps of future distribution (5 GCMs by 2 RCPs) are thus combined in a single suitability map supplied with information about the likelihood adopting the IPCC terminology based on consensus among projections. Then, the statistical significance of spatially aggregated changes in forest composition at local and regional level is analyzed. Finally, we discuss the importance, among SDMs, that environmental predictors seem to have in influencing forest distribution. Future impacts of climate change appear to be diversified across forest categories. A strong change in forest regional distribution and local diversity is projected to take place, as some forest categories will find more suitable conditions in previously unsuitable locations, while for other categories the same new conditions will become less suited. A decrease in species diversity is projected in most of the area, with Alpine region showing the potentiality to become a refuge for species migration.

AB  - Lake Cuitzeo basin is an important ecological area subjected to strong human pressure on forest covers that are key elements for the long-term support of biodiversity. We studied landscape connectivity changes for the years 1975, 1996, 2000, 2003 and 2008 to identify potential conservation areas in the basin. We modeled potential distributions of the Mexican bobcat (Lynx rufus escuinapae) and the ring-tail (Bassariscus astutus) - two terrestrial mammal focal species with contrasting dispersal capacities and we determined their habitat availability and suitability in the basin. We then identified their optimal habitat patches and produced landscape cumulative resistance maps, estimated least-cost paths (graph theory approach), and elaborated current flow maps (circuit theory approach). For evaluation of landscape connectivity, we applied an integral index of connectivity (IIC) to each study period, and determined individual habitat patch contribution to the overall landscape connectivity. The IIC index had very low values associated with reduced availability of focal species habitat. However, our study showed the conservation importance of the surface of optimal habitat patch areas. The combined application of a graph-based approach and current flow mapping were useful, and complementary both in terms of estimating potential dispersal corridors and identifying high probability dispersal areas. This indicated that landscape connectivity analysis is a useful tool for identification of potential conservation areas and for local landscape planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data deficiencies exist for similar to 20-25% of amphibian and reptile species worldwide, typically excluding them from conservation consideration and funding opportunities. Current species status is often unknown at historic locations or previously unsurveyed areas. We present an iterative study to assess and optimize novel survey methods for a declining amphibian species (Boreal Toad, Anaxyrus boreas boreas) using a combination of methods. We found that if toads are present in a drainage, searching riparian areas multiple times during the active season is an efficient way of detecting the occurrence of previously unknown breeding populations. Once a breeding population has been located, traditional visual encounter surveys yield high probabilities of species detection for monitoring efforts ((p) over cap (vis) approximate to 0.80). Supplementing streamside surveys when toads are not detected with other survey methods (e.g., environmental DNA [eDNA] samples) at suitable breeding locations can help confirm the species is absent, provided >= 10 eDNA samples are collected. Moreover, employing both visual surveys and eDNA samples can simultaneously yield distributional information on amphibian species and target pathogens, if pathogen presence is evaluated for all captured amphibian species and environmental samples are tested for both amphibian and pathogen DNA. Our iterative process of designing, testing, optimizing, and combining sampling methods to determine current species distribution should serve as a model for other rare amphibian and reptile species and provide managers better information with which to plan mitigation and conservation efforts.

AB  - Aim In this study we test molecular-based biogeographical hypotheses of Pleistocene persistence and recolonization in a North Atlantic rocky intertidal invertebrate assemblage using species distribution modelling. Location North Atlantic coastlines. Methods We develop a novel application of species distribution models for intertidal taxa by using both oceanographic and terrestrial environmental variables recently made available at biologically relevant pixel resolutions. We use these model-based distribution estimates to test alternative hypotheses of late Pleistocene history across six amphi-Atlantic taxa whose hypothesized Pleistocene distributions are constructed from previous population genetic inferences. Results Species distribution models correctly estimate all six current amphi-Atlantic distributions on both sides of the Atlantic. Models hindcasted to the Last Glacial Maximum estimate trans-Atlantic distributional persistence in three of six taxa, and conversely indicate no suitable habitat on the North American coastline in the other three taxa. These results are consistent with the histories inferred from population genetic data for five of six of the taxa, the exception being Nucella lapillus, whose hindcasted trans-Atlantic persistence at the Last Glacial Maximum contrasts with the mitochondrial DNA-based estimates of post-glacial expansion from Europe to North America. Main conclusions Marine and terrestrial distribution models are broadly concordant with known contemporary distributions and fail to reject five of six historical distributional hypotheses based on population genetic inferences. This demonstrated utility suggests that this technique could be expanded to examine how Pleistocene and contemporary climate change might play a role in intertidal species distributions across the entire community. Future application and development of these marine and terrestrial distribution models will strengthen inferences regarding the processes generating intertidal community assembly and population divergence, and may assist in conservation planning and the design of marine reserves.

AB  - Climate change is anticipated to alter both wildlife distributions and their movement patterns, due to shifts, loss, and fragmentation of habitat, increasing the risk of extinction for many endangered species. Therefore, climate change must be integrated into wildlife conservation strategies. Using the case study of Asian elephants in China, we used the maximum entropy model to assess habitat suitability by incorporating current and future (2050s) bioclimatic and environmental variables. We then delineated climate refugia where suitable habitat overlapped under both scenarios. Then, we use circuit theory model to analyse potential movement by elephants (through measuring current flow), by linking current habitats and future habitats. Our results showed that current suitable habitat covers an area of about 5228.18 km(2), of which 45.71% is projected to be lost by 2050 due to climate change, leaving 2836.76 km(2). Just 327.2 km(2) new suitable habitat was projected in 2050s. Climate refugia covered 2509.56 km(2), and were mainly located in Mengyang and Shangyong reserves and their surrounding regions. Moreover, maps connecting suitable habitats under current and 2050s identified different regions delineated as important for the potential movement of elephants, which mainly distributed in regions of climate refugia. We proposed various actions to ameliorate the predicted impacts of climate change on Asian elephant, including protecting suitable habitat within regions where elephant are currently distributed, establishing corridors between areas where elephant are distributed, creating cross-boundary protected areas, and translocating elephants. This approach could be applied to the conservation planning of other wildlife, especially for umbrella species that support high biodiversity. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Impacts of climate change are already evident in ecosystems worldwide. High-latitude and altitude regions are at greatest risk because the effects of climate change are greater in these regions, and species from these areas have limited ability to track their climate envelopes. The Caucasian snowcock (Tetraogallus caucasicus) and the Caucasian grouse (Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi) are both high-altitude specialists that are endemic to a restricted range in the Caucasus mountains of Europe. Little research has been performed to determine the status of the populations or the potential impacts of climate change. We investigated how climate and land use change may impact both species in future and determined whether their life history traits may increase their vulnerability using a combined exposure and trait-based index. We compared several climate models, and in all instances, both species showed drastic range contractions although the extent of the contraction varied with each model. Traits like habitat specialism, ground nesting and incubation period meant that both species may be considered "most vulnerable" in the exposure and trait-based index. Given that both species already occur near the maximum elevations of the Caucasus, and that they lack any dispersal capabilities due to the isolation from alternative mountainous areas, research efforts need to be prioritized to improve our knowledge about their population status, to monitor future trends and to begin developing species action plans that conserve these endemic and iconic species of Europe. Both species are flagship and umbrella species and may serve as indicator species, their protection may therefore benefit a whole range of other species inhabiting this vulnerable Alpine ecosystem. Especially the Caucasian grouse has a high aesthetic value and is favoured by hunters in the region. The potential demise of this species may therefore also be negative for local communities.

AB  - The geographic distribution of a species is a fundamental component in understanding its ecology and is necessary for forming effective conservation plans. For rare and elusive species of conservation concern, accurate maps of predicted occurrence are particularly problematic and often highly subjective. Spilogale putorius (Eastern Spotted Skunk) populations have experienced large declines since the 1940s. Their elusive behavior and perceived rarity result in low detection probability when using conventional methods for sampling small mammals. Low detection probability often causes uncertainty as to where Eastern Spotted Skunks could be a management concern. We modeled the distribution of predicted occurrence of Eastern Spotted Skunks using verifiable occurrence and non-detection records obtained throughout Virginia from 2010 to 2020. Occurrence data consisted of trapping records reported to the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources, incidental photo-verified reports of sightings and road-killed animals, and remote-camera detections. Non-detections were presumed at baited remote-camera locations following intense survey efforts. We fit predicted occurrence models using generalized linear modeling in an information-theoretic framework using the package 'stats' in Program R. Our results incidated a greater probability of presence from the Blue Ridge westward, increasing with slope steepness along northeastern- to southeastern-facing slopes and decreasing with slope steepness along southeastern- to southwestern-facing slopes. Emergent rock outcrops prominent along northeastern slopes offer ample protective rocky cover, whereas mixed Quercus spp. (oak), Kalmia latifolia (Mountain Laurel), and Rhododendron maximum (Rosebay Rhododendron) forest communities along southern-facing slopes provide suitable areas of cover, both of which are critical for spotted skunk survival and reproductive success. Our analysis provides insight into the relationships between landscape features and Eastern Spotted Skunk distributions across Virginia. Understanding these relationships is critical for the effective management and conservation of this vulnerable species.

AB  - We aimed to assess the impact of land-use structure on AFIS occurrence and evaluation of these bioindicators in urban conditions. We compiled data about forest continuity based on archival maps and forest management plans; floristic records of 79 AFIS occurrences were collected within a 1 x 1 km grid and land-use form structure in Poznan (W Poland). We tested fidelity of AFIS using chi(2) tests and effects of land-use structure using random forest models. We also checked spatial autocorrelation and its impact on AFIS distribution patterns within old and recent forests, using spatially explicit generalized linear models. We found a strong relationship between AFIS number per grid square and fraction of forests and waters in land-use structure. Relationships between AFIS distribution and land-use shows that AFIS are a good proxy describing human impact or an urbanity gradient. AFIS number per grid square shows small, but significant positive spatial autocorrelation, which suggests possibilities of migration into new forests. AFIS, treated as a bioindicative group of species, may be a useful indicator of landscape and land-use structure transformation in urban environments. Occurrence of many AFIS that are endangered at the city scale indicates the need for conservation of old forests in urban areas, to preserve biodiversity in urban environments. Thus, AFIS may act as indicators of old forests with high conservation value in cities, which need special protection.

AB  - Climate change is expected to have a profound impact on species distributions, contracting suitable climate space. Biodiversity areas are important to mitigate these negative effects but are static by design and thus do not account for future projections of species distributions. The Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja has a broad range across lowland Neotropical forests and thus its distribution could be negatively affected by climate change when combined with current rates of habitat loss. To test this hypothesis, we use spatial point process models fitted with climatic, topographical and landcover covariates to identify the current distribution. We then project to 24 future climate scenarios, using three General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two emission scenarios between the years 2021 and 2100 averaged over four, 20-year periods. Our current model identified a core range across Amazonia and the Guiana Shield, with evergreen forest (71%), mean diurnal temperature range (13%) and elevation (6%) the most important predictors. Reclassifying the current model to a binary prediction estimated a range size of similar to 7.6 million km(2), with the Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) network covering 18% of habitat (similar to 1.4 million km(2)) within this range. By 2090, range size was predicted to decrease on average by 14.4% under a higher emissions scenario, and 7.3% under a lower emissions scenario. The IBA network would cover 14% less area under a higher emissions scenario, and 3.3% less distribution area under a lower emissions scenario by 2090. Southern Amazonia is predicted to have the greatest reduction in range size and subsequently highest loss of Harpy Eagle habitat within the IBA network. Our work demonstrates that the combination of climate change and subsequent habitat loss may result in substantial losses in distribution for this raptor across the southern edge of its range.

AB  - In this paper, habitat models were used to predict potential habitat for endangered species, which is an important question in landscape and conservation planning. Based on logistic regression, we developed habitat distribution models for the burnet moth Zygaena carniolica and the nymphalid butterfly Coenonympha arcania in Northern Bavaria, Germany. The relation between adult occurrence and habitat parameters, including the influence of landscape context, was analyzed on, 118 sites. Habitat connectivity analyses were carried out on the basis of (1) habitat suitability maps generated from these models and (2) dispersal data from mark recapture studies. Our results showed that (1) the presence of the burnet depended mainly on the presence of nectar plants and of nutrient-poor dry grasslands in direct vicinity, that of the nymphalid on larger areas of extensively used dry grasslands within 100 m vicinity in combination with small patches of higher shrubs and bushes. (2) Internal as well as external validation indicated the robustness and general applicability of the models. Transferability in time and space indicated their high potential relevance for applications in nature conservation, such as predicting possible effects of land use changes. (3) Habitat connectivity analyses revealed a high degree of habitat connectivity within the study area. Thus, we could show no effects of isolation or habitat size for both species.

AB  - Spatially explicit population models (SEPMs) are often considered the best way to predict and manage species distributions in spatially heterogeneous landscapes. However, they are computationally intensive and require extensive knowledge of species' biology and behavior, limiting their application in many cases. An alternative to SEPMs is graph theory, which has minimal data requirements and efficient algorithms. Although only recently introduced to landscape ecology, graph theory is well suited to ecological applications concerned with connectivity or movement. This paper compares the performance of graph theory to a SEPM in selecting important habitat patches for Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) conservation. We use both models to identify habitat patches that act as population sources and persistent patches and also use graph theory to identify patches that act as stepping stones for dispersal. Correlations of patch rankings were very high between the two models. In addition, graph theory offers the ability to identify patches that are very important to habitat connectivity and thus long-term population persistence across the landscape. We show that graph theory makes very similar predictions in most cases and in other cases offers insight not available from the SEPM, and we conclude that graph theory is a suitable and possibly preferable alternative to SEPMs for species conservation in heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - Global climate change represents one of the most important threats to wildlife populations. Amphibians, specifically salamanders, are particularly susceptible to the effects of a changing climate due to their restrictive physiological requirements and low vagility; however, little is known about which amphibian species are more vulnerable to climate change. Therefore, we aimed to forecast changes in the distribution of the mountain stream salamander, Ambystoma ordinarium, using different climate scenarios. Approximately 70 representative presence records were selected to model the current potential distribution and two scenarios based on 2070 climate projections (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) using the MaxEnt algorithm and three global climate models (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4 and HadGEM2-ES). A total of three scenarios were simulated using the 10-percentile training presence as the threshold rule. For all scenarios, the average of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the replicated runs was greater than 0.95 +/- 0.005, representing good performance for the current and projected geographical distributions of A. ordinarium. Under the most conservative scenario, of a total area of 45,876 km(2), an average potential distribution area of 5,627 km(2) was defined for current conditions, decreasing to 4,406 km(2) for BCC-CSM1-1 in the optimistic scenario (RCP 2.6) and decreasing to 4,020 km(2) for CCSM4 in the pessimistic scenario (RCP 8.5). The results are useful for the development of future conservation plans, identifying landscapes with high probability to be further affected by climate change and to target potentially resilient habitats that provide consistent climatic conditions for A. ordinarium in the face of environmental changes.

AB  - Seagrass meadows and mussel reefs provide favorable habitats for many fish species, but few studies have compared the associated fish assemblages directly and examined the influence of environmental variables. Knowledge of fish assemblages associated with disparate habitats is needed for the conservation of coastal fisheries and marine spatial planning. Catch per unit effort data derived from fyke nets showed similar species richness and diversity in seagrass meadows and mussel reefs, suggesting that both habitats support elevated marine biodiversity of mobile fauna. However, it was shown that fish assemblage structure differed between those habitats, and also fish abundance in seagrass meadows was significantly higher than in mussel reefs by comparing the data with a multivariate extension of Generalized Linear Models (GLM). Furthermore, employing underwater video recordings to compare fish abundances in high and low water current speed mussel reefs with a Generalized Linear Mixed Model with negative binomial distribution, data revealed similar fish abundances (in terms of the MaxN metric) despite the variation in current speed, probably because the mussel formations provide sufficient shelter, even from high water currents. The commercially important species Atlantic cod (G. morhua), however, was significantly more abundant in the low water current mussel reef. Therefore, restoration efforts targeting G. morhua could benefit from restoring low current mussel reefs. Our study provides input for the conservation of coastal recreational and commercial fisheries, habitat restoration and marine spatial planning where certain habitats may be prioritized.

AB  - Indices that rate the vulnerability of species to climate change in a given area are increasingly used to inform conservation and climate change adaptation strategies. These species vulnerability indices (SVI) are not commonly associated with landscape features that may affect local-scale vulnerability. To do so would increase their utility by allowing managers to examine how the distributions of vulnerable species coincide with environmental features such as topography and land use, and to detect landscape-scale patterns of vulnerability across species. In this study we evaluated 15 animal species that had been scored with the USDA-Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station's system for assessing vulnerability of species to climate change. We applied the vulnerability scores to each species' respective habitat models in order to visualize the spatial patterns of cross-species vulnerability across the biologically diverse Coronado national forest, and to identify the considerations of spatially referencing such indices. Across the study extent, cross-species vulnerability was higher in higher-elevation woodlands and lower in desert scrub. The results of spatially referencing SVI scores may vary according to the species examined, the area of interest, the selection of habitat models, and the method by which cross-species vulnerability indices are created. We show that it is simple and constructive to bring species vulnerability indices into geographic space: landscape-scale patterns of vulnerability can be detected, and relevant ecological and socioeconomic contexts can be taken into account, allowing for more robust conservation and management strategies.

AB  - Epiphytic lichens are an important component of forest biodiversity. Many of them are threatened and conservation planning therefore requires comprehensive information about their distribution over space and time. However, besides topo-climatic predictors, the spatial pattern of epiphytic lichens is also closely related to the tree characteristics on which they grow. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that habitat specialist lichens restricted to specific habitat types and common species with a wide range of ecological preferences may respond differently to the topo-climatic and forest-structure predictors. We applied the generalized linear model (GLM) and maximum entropy (Maxent) for 20 epiphytic lichen species in Switzerland at different spatial scales (1 km and 100 m). To evaluate the influence of forest structure on the epiphytic lichen distribution, models with three sets of predictors (topo-climatic, forest-structure and combined predictor sets) were fitted for each species. Canopy height of forest stands and forest type were tested as a proxy of forest structure. Our results showed that both the techniques applied predicted well the occurrences of habitat specialists but the models of common lichens were overall less accurate. Forest-structure predictors significantly improved the models of rare and threatened species with specific microhabitat requirements, i.e. mainly forest lichens (Arthonia byssacea, Bactrospora dryina, Calicium viride, Gyalecta truncigena and Vulpicida pinastri), but they did not contribute considerably to the models of common species that grow equally well on the bark of different trees within or outside of forests (e.g. Caloplaca cerina, Phaeophyscia orbicularis, Physcia stellaris and Xanthoria parietina). We recommend using high-resolution forest-structure data for robust and reliable predictions of the distribution patterns of threatened epiphytic lichens, most of which are habitat specialists. The inclusion of these data will allow a hypothesis-driven sampling strategy, and will thus increase the effectiveness of the field sampling needed for searching large regions thoroughly to discover new sites where rare and threatened species occur.

AB  - Connecting protected areas remains an important global conservation strategy in the face of ongoing and future threats to biodiversity. Amid our growing understanding of how species' distributions will respond to climate change, conservation scientists need to plan for connectivity conservation across entire continents. We modeled multiscale connectivity priorities based on the least human-modified lands between large protected areas of North America using least-cost and circuit theory approaches. We first identified priority corridors between large protected areas, then characterized the network's structure to unveil priority linkages most important for maintaining network- and regional-level connectivity. Agreement between least-cost corridors and current flow varied throughout North America, reflecting permeable landscape conditions and "pinch points" where potential ecological flows may concentrate between protected areas. Priority network-level linkages derived from each approach were similar throughout the continental network (e.g., Rocky Mountains and Canadian boreal), but critical linkages that bridged regional protected-area networks varied. We emphasize the importance of planning for connectivity at continental scales and demonstrate the utility of multiple methods when mapping connectivity priorities across large spatial extents with wide gradients in landscape conditions.

AB  - Accurate information on the distribution of existing species is crucial to assess regional biodiversity. However, data inventories are insufficient in many areas. We examine the ability of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) multi-response species distribution model to overcome species' data limitations and portray plant species distribution patterns for 199 South Korean plant species. The study models species with two or more observations, examines their contribution to national patterns of species richness, provides a sensitivity analysis of different range threshold cutoff approaches for modeling species' ranges, and presents considerations for species modeling at fine spatial resolution. We ran MARS models for each species and tested four threshold methods to transform occurrence probabilities into presence or absence range maps. Modeled occurrence probabilities were extracted at each species' presence points, and the mean, median, and one standard deviation (SD) calculated to define data-driven thresholds. A maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity threshold was also calculated, and the range maps from the four cutoffs were tested using independent plant survey data. The single SD values were the best threshold tested for minimizing omission errors and limiting species ranges to areas where the associated occurrence data were correctly classed. Eight individual species range maps for rare plant species were identified that are potentially affected by resampling predictor variables to fine spatial scales. We portray spatial patterns of high species richness by assessing the combined range maps from three classes of species: all species, endangered and endemic species, and range-size rarity of all species, which could be used in conservation planning for South Korea. The MARS model is promising for addressing the common problem of few species occurrence records. However, projected species ranges are highly dependent on the threshold and scale criteria, which should be assessed on a per-project basis.

AB  - Aim We use data based on species checklists and geographical range maps for 3096 amphibian, 4100 bird and 1878 terrestrial mammal species to explore possible discrepancies in estimates of species richness for protected areas. We predict substantial differences between checklist and range map richness for smaller areas, where higher errors of commission from range maps are likely to occur. We also explore how discrepancies between species inventories and range maps may affect assessments of reserve prioritization and representation. Location Continental America and associated islands. Methods We obtained species numbers based on checklists for 619 protected areas from a variety of sources, including management plans, technical reports, environmental assessments, official websites, biodiversity databases and conservation agencies, and evaluated how these correlate with species richness estimates from geographical range map databases, also testing for an effect of reserve size on range map omission and commission errors. Results Species richness estimates obtained from checklists and range maps showed a significant positive relationship for all three groups of vertebrates, although for most protected areas, estimates of richness from range overlap maps tended to be overestimates, especially for amphibians and mammals in species-rich regions. Protected area size explained little of the discrepancies between checklist and range map richness. Species representation in protected areas based on checklists was in general lower than representation based on range maps. Main conclusions Our results suggest that range maps, although far from perfect, have the advantage of reducing geographical biases and filling gaps that exist in point locality data at least in species-rich protected areas, while most available checklists in these regions were extremely variable in quality and availability, lacking of basic information on survey design, reliability and completeness. However, range maps will likely overestimate species representation in protected areas and should thus be treated with caution in this context.

AB  - The emerging amphibian disease, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is driving population declines worldwide and even species extinctions in Australia, South and Central America. In order to mitigate effects of Bd on amphibian populations, high-exposed areas should be identified at the local scale and effective conservation measures should be planned at the national level. This assessment is actually lacking in the Mediterranean basin, and in particular in Italy, one of the most relevant amphibian diversity hotspots in the entire region. In this study, we reviewed the available information on Bd in Italy, and conducted a 5-year molecular screening on 1274 individual skin swabs belonging to 18 species. Overall, we found presence of Bd in 13 species and in a total of 56 known occurrence locations for peninsular Italy and Sardinia. We used these occurrence locations and climate data to model habitat suitability of Bd for current and future climatic scenarios. We then employed electric circuit theory to model landscape permeability to the diffusion of Bd, using a resistance map. With this procedure, we were able to model, for the first time, the diffusion pathways of Bd at the landscape scale, characterising the main future pathways towards areas with a high probability of Bd occurrence. Thus, we identified six national protected areas that will become pivotal for a nationally-based strategic plan in order to monitor, mitigate and possibly contrast Bd diffusion in Italy.

AB  - Alpine and arctic tundra regions are likely to retract as a result of climate warming and concerns have been raised over the status of the Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus muta). In Fennoscandia, the Rock Ptarmigan has low population abundance, and predictions based on harvest statistics show population declines throughout the range. In this study, we used a long-term opportunistic dataset of Rock Ptarmigan observations, environmental predictors derived from a digital vegetation map and a digital elevation model to describe the breeding distribution at three different ecological scales. Patterns of spatial distribution were similar across all the three study scales. The presence of permanent snow-fields positively influenced the occurrence of Rock Ptarmigan at the territory and landscape scale. Open vegetation, rock-dominated areas and, in particular, dry heath influenced Rock Ptarmigan presence positively at all scales. Altitude and terrain heterogeneity were important variables at all scales, with higher probabilities of Rock Ptarmigan being present at intermediate altitude ranges, with a high degree of terrain heterogeneity. This is the first study to describe Rock Ptarmigan breeding distribution in Fennoscandia and our findings yield new insights into the environmental variables that are important for the spatial distribution of Rock Ptarmigan during the breeding season. When planning conservation efforts, this information should be used to inform management regarding the protection of core areas and buffer zones related to the conservation and harvest management of the Rock Ptarmigan.

AB  - Despite its recent successful and well-documented reintroduction history, a comprehensive and current update of the distribution and status of the Alpine ibex Capra ibex is lacking. As some concerns persist about its conservation, a status update appears essential for future conservation and management strategies on a large scale.
   We provide an exhaustive update of the geographic range of the species, alongside estimates of its current abundance and population trends from 2004 to 2015.
   We gathered census and distribution data for all the Alpine ibex colonies from management authorities and research groups that monitor them in different countries, and from the literature and publicly available reports. We produced a distribution map, reported the number of individuals observed in the most recent censuses, and estimated global, national, and local population trends using Bayesian hierarchical models.
   Our model estimated that there were a total of 55297 Alpine ibex in the Alps in 2015 (lower 95% credible interval [CrI]: 51157; upper 95% CrI: 62710). The total number of individuals appears to have increased slightly over the last 10 years from the 47000-51000 estimated in previous reports. Positive population trends were observed in Switzerland and Italy, while no trend was apparent in France. For Austria, Germany, and Slovenia, there were insufficient data to estimate a trend. The slopes of the colonies' trends were positively correlated with the year of colony foundation.
   The geographic range of the Alpine ibex does not seem to have increased in size in recent years, although the accuracy of the spatial data varies among countries.
   The periodic and standardised collection of census data for all colonies and a common policy of data sharing at a European level appear essential for monitoring the global trend of this species and for planning balanced conservation and management actions.

AB  - Species distribution models in marine environments typically use static variables, partly due to the limited availability of fine-resolution dynamic predictor variables and sufficiently detailed species abundance data. Our aim was to describe and quantify the dynamic coupling between the distribution of marine species (seabirds) and the natural variability of their habitat in real time through the combination of a high-resolution hydrodynamic model, aerial digital surveys and real-time species distribution modelling. We used a 2-step (delta) generalized additive model at 500 m spatial resolution for assessment and prediction of the changing patterns of wintering red-throated divers (RTDs) Gavia stellata in the outer Thames estuary, United Kingdom. Our dynamic species distribution models successfully resolved the major oscillations in the distribution of RTDs and confirmed their tight association with frontal zones where the probability of prey encounter was higher. The relative model standard errors (%) were generally below 30% in the high-density areas. Area under the curve (AUC) values indicated that the models were capable of distinguishing presence from absence about 75% of the time. The predictive power of the achieved distribution models made it possible to accurately identify areas where RTDs were concentrated. Comparisons between visual aerial and digital stills aerial surveys documented that, in spite of similar patterns, the aerial digital surveys generally recorded significantly higher densities of RTDs than the visual aerial surveys. This study demonstrates how marine distribution models with assimilation of habitat variables from a well-calibrated fine-resolution hydrodynamic model coupled with the use of digital aerial surveys can facilitate the capture of detailed associations between seabirds and their dynamic habitats.

AB  - Protected areas function as a lifeboat that can preserve the origins and maintenance of biodiversity. We assessed the representativeness of biodiversity in existing protected areas in Japan using a distribution dataset and phylogenetic tree for 5565 Japanese vascular plant species. We first examined the overlap of species distribution with the existing protected areas and identified the minimum set representing all plant species. Second, we evaluated the relative importance of environmental variables in explaining the spatial arrangement of protected areas using a random forest model. Finally, we clarified how potential drivers of plant diversity were sufficiently captured within the protected areas network. Although the protected areas captured the majority of species, nearly half of the minimum set areas were selected from outside the existing protected areas. The locations of existing protected areas are mainly associated with geographical and socio-economic factors rather than key biodiversity features (including evolutionary distinctiveness). Moreover, critical biodiversity drivers, which include current climate, paleoclimatic stability, and geographical isolation, were biasedly emulated within the existing protected areas. These findings demonstrate that current conservation planning fails to represent the ecological and evolutionary processes relevant to species sorting, dispersal limitation, and allopatric speciation. In particular, under-representativeness of historically stable habitats that function as evolutionary hotspots or refugia in response to climate changes may pose a threat to the long-term persistence of Japan's endemic biota. This study provides a fundamental basis for developing prioritization measures to retain species assembly processes and in situ diversification along current climatic and geohistorical gradients.

AB  - In Andalusia, southern Spain, each game estate applies its own rules and presents its results in annual hunting reports, which have been mandatory for Spanish game estates since 1989. We used the information about hunting yields, included in 32134 annual hunting reports produced during the period 1993/94 to 2001/02 by 6049 game estates, to determine the current distribution of hunting yields of big and small game species in Andalusia. Using generalised linear models and a geographic information system, we determined the most favourable municipalities to big and small game, respectively, and delimited potential areas to attain good hunting yields for big and small game at a 1-km(2) resolution. Municipalities and areas favourable to big game are mainly located in the Sierra Morena and the westernmost fringe of the Betic Range, while those favourable to small game occupy the upper Guadalquivir River valley. There is a clear segregation between big and small game species according to the physiography and land uses of the territory. Big game species are typical of Mediterranean woodland areas, while the most emblematic small game species prefer agricultural areas. Our results provide a territorial ordination of hunting yields in southern Spain and have several potential applications in strategic planning for hunting activities and biodiversity conservation in Andalusia that can be extrapolated to other regions.

AB  - Aim Conventional species distribution models (SDMs) usually focus on the species level but disregard intraspecific variability. Phylogeographic structure and evolutionary significant units (ESU) have been proposed as pragmatic proxies to incorporate intraspecific differentiation in SDMs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of using these proxies in SDMs has been poorly investigated. We analysed how the projections of current and future climatically suitable areas can be affected when using ESU-based or lineage-based models compared to a species-level model. Location West-Palaearctic region. Methods As examples, we used three bumblebee species (133,787 observations). We assessed potential climatic niche differentiation between species level, lineages and ESUs, by determining the niche position and niche breadth for each classification level by outlying mean index analyses. Subsequently, we developed SDMs for each species and classification level separately using boosted regression trees prior to a comparison of their performances. Finally, we used the alternative models to project the extent of climatically suitable areas in 2070. Results We found that in spite of highly similar overall model accuracy, integrating intraspecific variability significantly increases model sensitivity (i.e., better predicting presences) while decreased model specificity (i.e., over-predicting the range). Consequently, both predictions of current and projections of future suitable conditions differed among the three approaches. Main conclusions We showed that although integrating lineage or ESU information did not improve the accuracy of conventional species-level SDMs, it led to considerably different conclusions. As SDM-based climatic risk assessments are increasingly used to help and improve conservation plans, divergences and limitations of each modelling approach should be taken into account for developing efficient biodiversity management strategies. Lineage and ESU-based SDMs offer the advantage to draw attention to species in which allopatric populations could display physiologically different responses to climate change when they lead to different results than species-based models.

AB  - Lianas are woody plants that require external support to reach the canopy. They are expanding in forests worldwide, possibly due to climate change and forest disturbance. Most studies on lianas have been conducted in tropical forests. Lianas are less explored in subtropical forests. We aimed to document the density and diversity of lianas, to test how habitat condition and the distribution of tree species affect the distributions of lianas based on data from a fully mapped 20 ha plot in subtropical China. We analyzed habitat association by fitting a generalized linear model with family-level liana abundance as response variable and family identity, and its interaction terms with topographic variables (slope, convexity, elevation, and sin(aspect)), as explanatory variables. We focused on the spatial associations of three liana species and 82 tree species with >= 100 individuals using the pair correlation function and redundancy analysis. We found a total of 1305 lianas, falling into 26 species, and 16 families, in the 20 ha plot. They accounted for 1.5% of individuals, 11.7% of species, and 0.4% of total basal area of woody plants in the plot. There were large variations in distributions of liana with respect to the four topographic variables among families, contrasting with former findings suggesting that lianas favor dry and hot habitats. The three most abundant liana species showed non-random associations with tree species, and they tended to positively associate with similar tree species but negatively associate with different tree species. The distribution of tree species explained 21.8% of variance in liana distribution. Our study suggested that both habitat conditions and tree composition intervene in determining liana distributions and that habitat heterogeneity may be a mechanism for liana diversity maintenance. Our study provides a basic understanding of liana diversity and distribution in this subtropical forest and contributes to future planning of liana studies and diversity conservation in subtropical forests under climate change.

AB  - Cetaceans are top-level predators that serve as sentinels of the health and status of lower trophic levels in the marine ecosystem. For this reason they attract significant attention in marine conservation planning and often have been used to promote designation of reserve areas in many countries (e.g., Ligurian Sea, Moray Firth, Hawaiian Islands, The Gully, Wadden Sea, Banks Peninsula, and Golfo San Jos,). Many policies are designed to protect cetaceans. For example, the Habitat Directive requires member states to select, designate, and protect sites that support certain natural habitats or species, such as the bottlenose dolphin, as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) that aim to create a network of protected areas across the European Union known as Natura 2000. The boundaries of protected areas for cetacean species must be defined for management purposes. In recent years, many techniques have been developed to define the distribution of cetaceans in relation to habitat preferences. Although these models can provide an understanding of the ecological processes that determine species distribution, their application requires prior knowledge of the variables that should be included in the model, the interactions among these variables, and their effects on species distribution. Thus, the lack of available data in understudied areas precludes the application of these types of models. As an alternative, we describe a geostatistical approach to identifying areas that potentially should be designated as marine protected areas for cetaceans. We illustrate the application of the kriging algorithm to the bottlenose dolphin population that resides in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The data derived from a 7-year survey were used. The encounter rate is the only variable required for this method, making it very easy to apply. The resulting georeferenced and high resolution map includes areas most visited by bottlenose dolphins, which are called core areas. Core areas are helpful for establishing the boundaries of marine reserves for the protection of the species. The approach described herein is accurate, precise, unbiased, replicable to all highly mobile species and easy to understand by both researchers and policy makers.

AB  - This study focused on the distribution of fish with high reproductive activity along a basin, using a 430 km stretch of the Cuiaba River in Brazil as a model. The main objective of this study was to identify those fish that migrate long distances for reproduction, among all the basin species. Thus, a set of working criteria are proposed to classify species according to their reproductive behaviour (i.e., reproductive activity and distribution). Samplings were performed in the Cuiaba River basin, encompassing several environments (river, channels and lakes) during the reproductive periods (between October and February), from 2000 to 2004. Species occurrence (presence and absence - proxy of distribution) across the basin and index of reproductive activity values were used as criteria to identify the species that perform long-distance longitudinal migrations for reproduction. The study confirmed the classification of long-distance longitudinal migration species; nonetheless, some species were not classified as described in the literature. The proposed sequential criteria have proven to be effective in the classification of long-distance longitudinal migrations species and certainly contribute to filling some existing knowledge gaps of reproductive traits. This classification is of fundamental importance in planning new dam projects, in decision making and in the development of management and conservation actions for the ichthyofauna.

AB  - Amphibians are the most severely threatened terrestrial vertebrates and we are witnessing a global decline phenomenon, which is even suggested to be of the same level as the historical mass extinctions. Albeit the myriad of causative stressors identified in the last decades, future sea level rise (SLR) and its impact on coastal terrestrial fauna remains essentially unreported. Even if there is no consensus on the magnitude of the future SLR, several studies suggest that it is likely to be greater than previously reported by the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect severe impacts on the coastal terrestrial fauna at a worldwide scale. Here, we assembled a worldwide data set of coastal-lowland anuran species in an attempt to quantify the potential habitat loss caused by flooding according to different SLR scenarios. We also assessed potential habitat suitability under climate change (CC) in order to evaluate its expected effects on species' climatic niches, by building species distribution models for three future scenarios (A2a, A1b and B2a). Our results revealed that SLR has the potential to produce negative impacts on similar to 86% of the selected coastal-lowland species in different magnitudes, whereas CC is expected to produce a greater impact on the same taxa. Thus, species predicted to persist under the new climatic conditions may be exposed to effects associated with SLR. Breaking our results down to biogeographic realms, we found that Australasia harboured most amphibian species suffering the dual impacts of SLR and CC. Based on our results, we advocate for the inclusion of potential future impacts of SLR in conservation action plans, anticipating and preventing biodiversity loss.

AB  - The role of vegetation is very important in ecosystem conservation. The present study was conducted to classify the existing ground flora in Tharparker, Pakistan. The distribution pattern of vegetation and species association was grouped into different communities by using ordination techniques. Both direct and indirect ordination methods were applied to classify the species into groups and communities, and also quantify the relationship of species with varied soil parameters (pH, EC, moisture, OM, K, P, Fe+3, Zn+2, Mn+2, Cu+2). Plant and soil samples were randomly collected using quadrat of 1*1 m(2). Two main groups and four communities were formed by species derived from fifty quadrat. Cynodon dactylon and Desmostachya bipinnata showed higher abundance over the broad range of all edaphic factor's concentration. This study provided the significant results of least abundant and most abundant herbaceous species in the region of Tharparker, which will be helpful for land managing and planning.

AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) in the Parana-Paraguay basin on multiple facets of ichthyofauna, both currently and in future climate change scenarios, based on reaching the 17% of conserved terrestrial and inland water defined by Aichi Target 11. Analyses were carried out vis-a-vis a distribution of 496 native species, modeling for the present and for the future, and in moderate and pessimistic scenarios of greenhouse gases. We calculated species richness, functional richness, and phylogenetic diversity, overlapping the combination of these facets with the PAs. The results indicate that the current PAs of the Parana-Paraguay basin are not efficient in protecting the richest areas of ichthyofauna in their multiple facets. While there is a larger overlap between PAs and the richest areas in phylogenetic diversity, the values are too low (2.37%). Currently, the overlap between PAs and areas with larger species richness, functional richness, and phylogenetic diversity is only 1.48%. Although this value can increase for future projections, the values of the indices decrease substantially. The relevant aquatic environments, biological communities, and climate change should be considered as part of the systematic planning of PAs that take into consideration the terrestrial environments and their threats.

Environmental Niche Modelling has emerged as a powerful tool to predict the patterns of range expansion of non-native species and to direct effective strategies for managing biological invasions. The raccoon, Procyon lotor, is a wild mesocarnivore presenting a high adaptability and showing successful introduced populations worldwide. Here, we modelled the current and future climatically favourable areas for the raccoon using two protocols, based on data sets filtrated in geographic and environmental spaces. Projections from these models show extensive current favourable geographical areas covering extensive regions of temperate biomes. Moreover, predictions for 2050 reveals extensive new favourable areas north of the current favourable regions. However, the results of the two modeling approaches differ in the extent of predicted favourable spaces. Protocols using geographically filtered data present more conservative forecasts, while protocol using environmental filtration presents forecasts across greater areas. Given the biological characteristics and the ecological requirements of a generalist carnivore such as the raccoon, the latter forecasts appears more relevant and should be privileged in the development of conservation plans for ecosystems.

AB  - Roost for bats, which are responsible for a wide range of vital ecological and economic services, is crucial. Their availability affects both the geographic occurrence and the diversity of bat communities. Hence, understanding how bats use roosts and variables that influence these patterns could contribute to the development of management plans to ensure their survival. In this study, species distribution modeling of two bat species, the greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum) and the small mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma muscatellum), were carried out using the sdm package in R. To do so, 16 environmental variables were used as the predictors to explore their relationships with the occurrence of the two species using 12 modeling algorithms. The prediction models for each species were then combined into an ensemble model. The random forest modeling algorithm showed better performance than the other individual models in this modeling. Moreover, the prediction performance of the ensemble model was more substantial than all the individual models for both species. For the greater mouse-tailed bat, elevation, annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, and distance to roads-railways were identified as the essential variables for summer roosting habitat selection. Meanwhile, distance to roads-railways, annual mean temperature, elevation, and distance to the ridge were significant for the small mouse-tailed bat. Since this study facilitates the management of future and suitable habitats by identifying important environmental conditions, it can be used in conservation plans.

AB  - This study, using species distribution modeling (involving a new approach that allows for uncertainty), predicts the distribution of climatically suitable areas prevailing during the mid-Holocene, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and at present, and estimates the potential formation of new habitats in 2070 of the endangered and rare Tertiary relict tree Davidia involucrata Baill. The results regarding the mid-Holocene and the LGM demonstrate that south-central and southwestern China have been long-term stable refugia, and that the current distribution is limited to the prehistoric refugia. Given future distribution under six possible climate scenarios, only some parts of the current range of D. involucrata in the mid-high mountains of south-central and southwestern China would be maintained, while some shift west into higher mountains would occur. Our results show that the predicted suitable area offering high probability (0.5-1) accounts for an average of only 29.2% among the models predicted for the future (2070), making D. involucrata highly vulnerable. We assess and propose priority protected areas in light of climate change. The information provided will also be relevant in planning conservation of other paleoendemic species having ecological traits and distribution ranges comparable to those of D. involucrata.

AB  - Habitat selection of endangered species in peripheral populations must be considered when designing effective conservation plans, as these populations tend to occupy atypical habitats where species-environment relationships are not well understood. We examined patterns of habitat use in peripheral populations of the endangered Dupont's Lark Chersophilus duplonti using a multi-scale approach and assessed the spatiotemporal transferability of these models to test for their generality. Our results show that at microhabitat (circles of 50-m diameter used by the species versus random points) and macrohabitat (occupied/unoccupied squares of 1 ha) scales the species selected flat and non-forested areas, but at the microhabitat scale the cover of small shrubs was also important. Models developed at patch scale (occupied/unoccupied sites) identified only site size as an important predictor of species occurrence. Habitat models transferred successfully among sites and years, which suggests that these models and our recommendations may be extrapolated over a larger geographic area. A multi-scale approach was used for identifying conservation requirements at different spatial scales. At the patch scale our models confirm it is a priority to maintain or enlarge the extent of habitat patches to ensure the viability of the studied metapopulation. At the macrohabitat scale our results suggest that reducing tree density in low slope areas would be the most effective management action. At the microhabitat scale, encouraging the presence of small and medium-sized shrubs, by clearing certain scrubs (e.g. large brooms Genista spp. and rosemary Rosmarinus officinalis) or promoting traditional low-level extensive grazing, should increase the availability of high-quality habitats for the species, and thus the number of potential territories within a patch. These recommendations largely coincide with the ones given for core populations at specific scales elsewhere.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in basic and applied ecology, making it important to understand sources and magnitudes of uncertainty in SDM performance and predictions. We analyzed SDM performance and partitioned variance among prediction maps for 15 rare vertebrate species in the southeastern USA using all possible combinations of seven potential sources of uncertainty in SDMs: algorithms, climate datasets, model domain, species presences, variable collinearity, CO2 emissions scenarios, and general circulation models. The choice of modeling algorithm was the greatest source of uncertainty in SDM performance and prediction maps, with some additional variation in performance associated with the comprehensiveness of the species presences used for modeling. Other sources of uncertainty that have received attention in the SDM literature such as variable collinearity and model domain contributed little to differences in SDM performance or predictions in this study. Predictions from different algorithms tended to be more variable at northern range margins for species with more northern distributions, which may complicate conservation planning at the leading edge of species' geographic ranges. The clear message emerging from this work is that researchers should use multiple algorithms for modeling rather than relying on predictions from a single algorithm, invest resources in compiling a comprehensive set of species presences, and explicitly evaluate uncertainty in SDM predictions at leading range margins.

AB  - The recent proliferation of high-quality global gridded environmental datasets has spurred a renaissance of studies in many fields, including biogeography. However, these data, often 1 km at the finest scale available, are too coarse for applications such as precise designation of conservation priority areas and regional species distribution modeling, or purposes outside of biology such as city planning and precision agriculture. Further, these global datasets likely underestimate local climate variations because they do not incorporate locally relevant variables. Here we describe a comprehensive set of 30 m resolution rasters for Hong Kong, a small tropical territory with highly variable terrain where intense anthropogenic disturbance meets a robust protected area system. The data include topographic variables, a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index raster, and interpolated climate variables based on weather station observations. We present validation statistics that convey each climate variable's reliability and compare our results to a widely used global dataset, finding that our models consistently reflect greater climatic variation. To our knowledge, this is the first set of published environmental rasters specific to Hong Kong. We hope this diverse suite of geographic data will facilitate future environmental and ecological studies in this region of the world, where a spatial understanding of rapid urbanization, introduced species pressure, and conservation efforts is critical.

AB  - Context Prioritising is likely to differ depending on the species considered for connectivity assessments, leading to a lack of consensual decisions for territorial planning. Objectives The objective was to assess the relevance of identifying priority areas for connectivity for groups of species based on common dispersal abilities. We aimed to assess the impact of target groups choices on predicted priority areas. Method The study was located at the Thau Lagoon territory to demonstrate the methodological approach. Ecological niche modelling was used to quantify species resistance and to identify suitable habitat patches. We coupled the least-cost path methodology with circuit theory to assess species connectivity. We classified connectivity from high to low levels and averaged the results by dispersal groups. Results We found important differences in identified priority areas between groups with dissimilar dispersal abilities, with little overlap between highly connected areas. We identified a gap between the level of protection of low dispersal species and highly connected areas. We found mismatches between existing corridors and connectivity in low dispersal species, and a greater impact in areas of expected urban sprawl projects on favourably connected areas for species with high dispersal capabilities. Conclusion We have demonstrated that a diversity of dispersal capacity ranges must be accounted for in order to identify ecological corridors in programmes that aim to restore habitat connectivity at territorial levels. Our findings are oriented to support the decisions of planning initiatives, at both local and regional scale.

AB  - Context Interactions between multiple threats are driving biodiversity loss. In human-modified landscapes, the extent to which fire regimes threaten species may depend on the configuration of native vegetation in relation to the matrix of other land uses. Despite crucial implications for fire management, interactions between spatial pattern in fire history and the matrix are unstudied. Objectives We used a multi-scale analysis to address two questions: do mammals respond to the landscape-context effect of the extent of older vegetation or growth-stage diversity? If so, are responses influenced by the presence of matrix? Methods Camera traps were used to survey mammals in the fragmented heathy woodland of southeast Australia. We quantified the percent of older vegetation, growth-stage diversity and matrix presence using 16 concentric circles centred on sites, and examined species' responses using generalised linear models. Results We modelled eight species and found the responses of five species to fire history were influenced by matrix availability. Four species (three macropods and the yellow-footed antechinus, Antechinus flavipes) responded positively to growth-stage diversity when matrix was absent and vice versa, indicating that species acquire different resources from multiple growth stages in the absence of matrix. Moreover, these results suggest that using prescribed fire to create a mosaic of growth stages at scales of 80-710 ha may have positive conservation outcomes for these species. Conclusions Our study highlights the importance of examining the consequences of interacting threats. Consideration of landscape context in fire management may lead to better conservation outcomes for mammals in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - Aim Understanding how habitat loss and overhunting impact large carnivores is important for broad-scale conservation planning. We aimed to assess how these threats interacted to affect jaguar habitat (Panthera onca) between 1985-2013 in the Gran Chaco, a deforestation hotspot. Location Gran Chaco ecoregion in Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. Methods We modelled jaguar habitat change from 1985-2013 using a time-calibrated species distribution model that uses all occurrence data available for that period. We modelled habitat as a function of resource availability and hunting threats, which allowed us to separate core (high resource availability and low hunting threat), refuge (low resources but safe), attractive sink (high resources but risky) and sink (low resources and risky) habitat for 1985, 2000 and 2013. Results Jaguar core areas contracted by 33% (82,400 km(2)) from 1985-2013, mainly due to an expansion of hunting threats. Sink and attractive sink habitat covered 58% of the jaguar range in 2013 and most confirmed jaguar kill sites occurred in these areas. Furthermore, habitat loss and hunting threats co-occurred in 29% of jaguars' range in 2013. Hunting threats also deteriorated core areas within protected areas, but 95% of all core areas loss occurred outside protected lands. About 68% of the remaining core areas in 2013 remained unprotected, mostly close to international borders. Main conclusions Our study highlights the synergistic effects that habitat loss and hunting threats exert on large carnivores, even inside protected areas, emphasizing the need to consider the geography of threats in conservation planning. Our results also point to the importance of areas along international borders as havens for wildlife and thus the urgent need for cross-border planning to prevent the imminent extinction of jaguars from the Chaco. Opportunities lie in reducing jaguar mortality over the widespread attractive sinks, particularly in corridors connecting core areas.

AB  - The lack of spatial distribution data on marine habitats often presents an obstacle to their protection. The Annex I of the Habitats Directive (European Council Directive 92/43/EEC) lists habitats that are important in biodiversity protection and should be maintained (or restored) to a favourable conservation status. The habitats listed should be protected within an ecological network of protected areas, the Natura 2000 network. However, in the past the establishment of the marine Natura 2000 network has been largely based on insufficient knowledge on the distribution of the habitats. Annex I habitat type reefs are defined as formations of hard compact biogenic or geogenic substrata, which arise from the seafloor in the sublittoral and littoral zone. As obtaining marine data is time-consuming and costly, the bathymetric and substratum data needed for their identification on a larger scale are often scarce. Furthermore, the use of data may be limited due to e.g. national security reasons. This study identifies reefs in a complex archipelago area in the northern Baltic Sea using the best, although limited, data currently available. In the area reefs are elevated rocky outcrops and the associated algal communities and blue mussel beds are vital in maintaining biodiversity in the relatively species poor Baltic Sea. In addition to identifying the physical reef structures, an estimate of their ecological value is obtained by modelling the distribution of four key species occurring on reefs. The results are encouraging, as 55 out of 68 of the potential reefs ground-truthed were confirmed to be reefs. Furthermore the number of predicted species occurring on the reefs, correlated significantly with the number of species observed. The presented maps serve as a valuable background for more detailed mapping of the species diversity occurring on reefs as well as for monitoring their ecological status. Map-based information on important habitats is essential in conservation and marine spatial planning to minimize human impact on marine ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Avian influenza A, a highly pathogenic avian influenza, is a lethal infection in certain species of wild birds, including some endangered species. Raptors are susceptible to avian influenza, and spatial risk assessment of such species may be valuable for conservation planning. We used the maximum entropy approach to generate potential distribution models of three raptor species from presence-only data for the mountain hawk-eagle Nisaetus nipalensis, northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis and peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus, surveyed during the winter from 1996 to 2001. These potential distribution maps for raptors were superimposed on avian influenza A risk maps of Japan, created from data on incidence of the virus in wild birds throughout Japan from October 2010 to March 2011. The avian influenza A risk map for the mountain hawk-eagle showed that most regions of Japan had a low risk for avian influenza A. In contrast, the maps for the northern goshawk and peregrine falcon showed that their high-risk areas were distributed on the plains along the Sea of Japan and Pacific coast. We recommend enhanced surveillance for each raptor species in high-risk areas and immediate establishment of inspection systems. At the same time, ecological risk assessments that determine factors, such as the composition of prey species, and differential sensitivity of avian influenza A virus between bird species should provide multifaceted insights into the total risk assessment of endangered species.

AB  - Proactive forest conservation planning requires spatially accurate information about the potential distribution of tree species. The most cost-efficient way to obtain this information is habitat suitability modelling i.e. predicting the potential distribution of biota as a function of environmental factors. Here, we used the bootstrap-aggregating machine-learning ensemble classifier Random Forest (RF) to derive a 1-km resolution European forest formation suitability map. The statistical model use as inputs more than 6,000 field data forest inventory plots and a large set of environmental variables. The field data plots were classified into different forest formations using the forest category classification scheme of the European Environmental Agency. The ten most dominant forest categories excluding plantations were chosen for the analysis. Model results have an overall accuracy of 76%. Between categories scores were unbalanced and Mesophitic deciduous forests were found to be the least correctly classified forest category. The model's variable ranking scores are used to discuss relationship between forest category/environmental factors and to gain insight into the model's limits and strengths for map applicability. The European forest suitability map is now available for further applications in forest conservation and climate change issues.

AB  - Species distribution models enable practitioners to analyze large datasets of encounter records and make predictions about species occurrence at unsurveyed locations. In omnibus surveys that record data on multiple species simultaneously, species ranges are often nonoverlapping and misaligned with the administrative unit defining the spatial domain of interest (e.g., a state or province). Consequently, some species display differentially restricted extents within a study area. Assuming hard boundaries based on expert opinion or published range maps to restrict species occurrence predictions implies a false sense of certainty in model-based inferences.
   We propose a multi-species occupancy model with a spatial Gaussian process on site-specific effects for each species as a model-based solution. Specifying informative Bayesian hyperpriors on the spatial hyperparameters encapsulates broad-scale correlation among site occupancy probabilities for each species. We fit this model to acoustic detection/nondetection data collected with autonomous recording units during summer of 2016-2019 throughout Oregon and Washington, USA, on 15 bat species.
   We found vast improvements in spatial predictions of spotted bat (Euderma maculatum), canyon bat (Parastrellus hesperus), and Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) when the available environmental predictors were insufficient for characterizing their restricted ranges within the region.
   In contrast, widespread species (Lasionycteris noctivagans, Myotis californicus, Myotis evotis, Myotis volans) were appropriately modeled using only environmental predictors, such as percentage forest cover and cliff and canyon cover.
   Utilizing spatial Gaussian processes within a community or multi-species model incorporates uncertainty in range boundaries and allows for simultaneous predictions for the entire faunal assemblage even if species have nonoverlapping or restricted ranges within a spatial domain of interest. Such modeling improvements are essential if species distribution models are to accurately inform monitoring, species recovery plans, and other conservation efforts.

AB  - This paper focuses on a rare case of natural disappearance of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) in an extensive area without using traditional methods of eradication programs. The study was conducted both in the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (PRNH) Sesc Pantanal and in an adjacent traditional private cattle ranch. In 1998, feral pigs were abundant and widely distributed in the PRNH. However, the feral pigs gradually disappeared from the area and currently, the absence of pigs in the PRNH contrasts with the adjacent cattle ranch where the species is abundant. To understand the current distribution of the species in the region we partitioned the effects of variation of feral pigs' presence considering the habitat structure (local), landscape composition and the occurrence of potential predators. Additionally, we modeled the distributions of the species in Northern Pantanal, projecting into the past using the classes of vegetation cover before the PRNH implementation (year 1988). Our results show areas with more suitability for feral pigs in regions where the landscape is dominated by pastures and permeated by patches of Seasonal Dry Forest. The species tends to avoid predominantly forested areas. Additionally, we recorded that the environmental suitability decreases exponentially as the distance from water bodies increases. The disappearance of feral pigs in the PRNH area seems to be associated with changes in the landscape and vegetation structure after the removal of the cattle. In the Brazilian Pantanal, the feral pigs' occurrence seems strongly conditioned to environmental changes associated to livestock activity.

AB  - The critically endangered Brazilian Merganser Mergus octosetaceus is one of the rarest waterfowls in the world. Only three isolated populations remain in the Brazilian Cerrado, totaling less than 250 individuals. We evaluated the potential influence of small hydroelectric plants (SHPs) and Protected Areas (PAs) on the species' conservation. We identified suitable areas by using recent presence records and environmental predictors, and overlapped it with the species dispersion zone and the SHP impact zone. Suitable areas for the species are limited to 4% of the geographic space (142,899 km2). Within the dispersion zone, we found 36 planned SHPs, which can impact 4.1% of the suitable area and 17.2% of the suitable area inside PAs. Our results expose the critical situation of the Brazilian Merganser, with few isolated suitable areas, high potential impacts for the three known populations, and a high proportion of suitable areas out of PAs. We highlight the need of considering SHPs impacts on the Brazilian Merganser in environmental impact assessment studies to reduce them. Furthermore, we appointed areas for search of new populations, and emphasize how urgent the implementation of effective conservation actions aiming to protect the remaining suitable habitats for the Brazilian Merganser is.

AB  - Several species of woodland birds have recently declined in Britain and there is a need to understand better how species are distributed across a wide spectrum of habitat types in order to develop appropriate conservation management strategies. To assess habitat associations of 28 woodland species, a large-scale study was carried out across Great Britain. A total of 2668 stands embedded in 825 woodland sites were surveyed. The number of species recorded in each stand and the occurrence of each species was examined in relation to the unique (or marginal) effects of gross structural characteristics of stands (growth stage and understorey structure), plant species composition (floristics) expressed in terms of dominant tree, shrub layer and field layer species and both sets of variables considered together whilst controlling for the spatial distribution of sites and site identity. The number of species recorded was independently related to growth stage, understorey structure, tree composition and field layer type. Eighteen species showed at least one significant relationship in models containing structure variables only. Thirteen species showed at least one significant relationship in models containing floristic variables only. In models containing both structure and floristic variables; 14 species showed at least one significant relationship with a structure variable, 9 species with at least one floristic variable and 8 species with both at least one structure and at least one floristic variable. Different bird species showed individualistic patterns of association with habitat variables. Results suggest that structure and floristics have complex and inter-related effects on bird distribution across woodland stands. Some of the apparent relationships with structure were a consequence of between-stand differences in floristics and vice versa whilst in two cases relationships with structure variables became apparent after controlling for the masking effects of floristic variables. Both vegetation structure and floristics appear to be important determinants of composition in bird assemblages in British woodland, though gross structural factors have previously received most emphasis. The existence of species-specific responses to habitat variation suggests that habitat heterogeneity, embracing structure and floristics, should be a key element in conservation planning within forests especially in the light of uncertainty about future regional species pools due to climate change. We discuss how responses of birds to habitat variation at the level of stands can form a basis for developing large-scale conservation strategies within managed forests. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Occupancy models, that describe the presence and absence patterns of a species in a given area, are increasingly being used to predict the occurrence of the species in unsurveyed sites, as an aid to conservation planning. In this paper, we consider whether conclusions about local distributions derived from one landscape can be extrapolated to others. We found that habitat patchiness influenced the distribution and abundance of the host-specific moth Wheeleria spilodactylus in a similar way in two landscapes widely separated geographically. In both geographic regions, the spatial location (positive effect of connectivity), and quantity of resource (positive effect of host plant density) increased the likelihood that the moth would be present, consistent with the expectations of metapopulation dynamics. Though some biological attributes of the species appeared to be slightly different, including population density and the timing of the life cycle (phenology), occupancy patterns in one landscape accurately predict occupancy in the other landscape. Our results suggest that it maybe possible to make predictions from one landscape to another, even when the landscapes are widely separated.

AB  - Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to determine threats to biodiversity and opportunities under climate change. Despite SDMs being based on the assumption of complete knowledge of the climate space of the modelled species, truncated occurrence datasets (and hence truncated climate spaces) such as national inventories are often employed. This may lead to prediction errors, which have been proposed to stemfrom: (1) the degree of climate space truncation and/or (2) instability of the modelling algorithms. Our aim was to explore the potential causes of prediction errors in SDMs using truncated training datasets.
   Location Europe 11 degrees W-32 degrees E, 34 degrees-72 degrees N.
   Methods SDMs employing commonly used bioclimatic variables were applied to seven forest tree species. We created two model training datasets covering: (1) Germany only (significantly truncated climate space) and (2) Europe (minimally truncated climate space). Differences between the climate space represented by Germany-only and European data were measured on two-dimensional climate spaces obtained through principal component analysis of the bioclimatic variables. Seven SDM algorithms were run, and the stability of the response function and variable selection for each species and model type were analysed.
   Results The degree of climate space truncation was less important for model performance than the instability of model algorithms and indiscriminate variable selection. The latter led to irrelevant relationships of species occurrence with bioclimatic variables. These instabilities caused pronounced prediction errors.
   Main conclusions Our results strongly suggest that erroneous model predictions stem from instability and ecological irrelevance of the statistical functions relating the probability of a species' occurrence to bioclimatic variables, compounded by a lack of consistency in variable selection. Models displaying these characteristics showed lower overall performance when trained with truncated datasets. Further, commonly used ensemble approaches do not compensate for the shortfalls of individual models. Detailed model-by-model and species-by-species analysis of response functions and variable importance is recommended.

AB  - The effective management and conservation of fishery resources requires knowledge of their spatial distribution and notably of their critical life history stages. Predictive modelling of the European hake (Merluccius merluccius L., 1758) distribution was developed in the south-central Mediterranean Sea by means of historical fisheries-independent databases available in the region. The study area included the international waters of the south-central Mediterranean Sea and the territorial waters of Italy, Malta, Tunisia and Libya. Distribution maps of predicted population abundance index, and probabilistic occurrence of recruits and large adults were obtained by means of generalized additive models using depth and seafloor characteristics as predictors. Presence/absence data of the two life stages was obtained using threshold values applied to the mean weight of the survey catches. Modelling results largely matched previously reported knowledge on habitat preference of the species and its critical life phases. Hake recruits showed an occurrence peak at 200 m depth with preference for soft bottoms. Large adults preferred deeper and harder bottom substrates. Prediction maps allowed to improve our knowledge on the distributional patterns of one of the most important shared stocks in the south-central Mediterranean. This knowledge is essential for an appropriate development of regional-spatial-based management plans.

AB  - Grassland loss has been extensive worldwide, endangering the associated biodiversity and human well-being that are both dependent on these ecosystems. Ecologists have developed approaches to restore grassland communities and many have been successful, particularly where soils are rich, precipitation is abundant, and seeds of native plant species can be obtained. However, climate change adds a new filter needed in planning grassland restoration efforts. Potential responses of species to future climate conditions must also be considered in planning for long-term resilience. We demonstrate this methodology using a site-specific model and a maximum entropy approach to predict changes in habitat suitability for 33 grassland plant species in the tallgrass prairie region of the U.S. using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios A1B and A2. The A1B scenario predicts an increase in temperature from 1.4 to 6.4 degrees C, whereas the A2 scenario predicts temperature increases from 2 to 5.4 degrees C and much greater CO2 emissions than the A1B scenario. Both scenarios predict these changes to occur by the year 2100. Model projections for 2040 under the A1B scenario predict that all but three modeled species will lose similar to 90% of their suitable habitat. Then by 2080, all species except for one will lose similar to 90% of their suitable habitat. Models run using the A2 scenario predict declines in habitat for just four species by 2040, but models predict that by 2080, habitat suitability will decline for all species. The A2 scenario appears based on our results to be the less severe climate change scenario for our species. Our results demonstrate that many common species, including grasses, forbs, and shrubs, are sensitive to climate change. Thus, grassland restoration alternatives should be evaluated based upon the long-term viability in the context of climate change projections and risk of plant species loss.

AB  - The potential distribution of critically rare or endangered species is necessary to assess species conservation status and guide recovery plans. Habitat models based on remotely sensed geospatial data are increasingly used to predict the suitability of sites for rare and endangered species, but in rapidly changing landscapes, habitat evaluations must reflect temporal as well as spatial variation of environmental suitability in order to properly inform management. We used field measurements of species occurrence, a 22-yr time series of satellite images, and the Maximum Entropy modeling approach (Maxent) to monitor spatio-temporal variation in habitat suitability of an endangered butterfly that uses riparian wetlands modified by beaver activity. We modeled the niche of the St. Francis' satyr Neonympha mitchellii francisci in an environment of remotely sensed metrics and projected the niche model over space and time to evaluate habitat dynamics and target sites for reintroduction efforts. Suitable habitat for the subspecies is currently distributed across the study area; however, most of the suitable area is unoccupied, and patches of the most suitable habitat have shifted over time in response to beaver activity and subsequent wetland succession, suggesting a negative interaction between dispersal limitation and landscape dynamics. Landcover changes complicate the recovery of critically threatened species such as N. m. francisci, but habitat monitoring over time can improve recovery plans, offer adaptive management strategies, and provide more exact criteria for species status assignment. Spatio-temporal extensions of the niche/habitat concept are made possible by long-term archives of remotely sensed data, and will likely prove most useful in rapidly changing landscapes.

AB  - With the accelerating pace of global change, it is imperative that we obtain rapid inventories of the status and distribution of wildlife for ecological inferences and conservation planning. To address this challenge, we launched the SNAPSHOT USA project, a collaborative survey of terrestrial wildlife populations using camera traps across the United States. For our first annual survey, we compiled data across all 50 states during a 14-week period (17 August-24 November of 2019). We sampled wildlife at 1,509 camera trap sites from 110 camera trap arrays covering 12 different ecoregions across four development zones. This effort resulted in 166,036 unique detections of 83 species of mammals and 17 species of birds. All images were processed through the Smithsonian's eMammal camera trap data repository and included an expert review phase to ensure taxonomic accuracy of data, resulting in each picture being reviewed at least twice. The results represent a timely and standardized camera trap survey of the United States. All of the 2019 survey data are made available herein. We are currently repeating surveys in fall 2020, opening up the opportunity to other institutions and cooperators to expand coverage of all the urban-wild gradients and ecophysiographic regions of the country. Future data will be available as the database is updated at eMammal.si.edu/snapshot-usa, as will future data paper submissions. These data will be useful for local and macroecological research including the examination of community assembly, effects of environmental and anthropogenic landscape variables, effects of fragmentation and extinction debt dynamics, as well as species-specific population dynamics and conservation action plans. There are no copyright restrictions; please cite this paper when using the data for publication.

AB  - Aim Maps of species richness are the basis for applied research and conservation planning as well as for theoretical research investigating patterns of richness and the processes shaping these patterns. The method used to create a richness map could influence the results of such studies, but differences between these methods have been insufficiently evaluated. We investigate how different methods of mapping species ranges can influence patterns of richness, at three spatial resolutions.
   Location California, USA.
   Methods We created richness maps by overlaying individual species range maps for terrestrial amphibians and reptiles. The methods we used to create ranges included: point-to-grid maps, obtained by overlaying point observations of species occurrences with a grid and determining presence or absence for each cell; expert-drawn maps; and maps obtained through species distribution modelling. We also used a hybrid method that incorporated data from all three methods. We assessed the correlation and similarity of the spatial patterns of richness maps created with each of these four methods at three different resolutions.
   Results Richness maps created with different methods were more correlated at lower spatial resolutions than at higher resolutions. At all resolutions, point-to-grid richness maps estimated the lowest species richness and those derived from species distribution models the highest. Expert-drawn maps and hybrid maps showed intermediate levels of richness but had different spatial patterns of species richness from those derived with the other methods.
   Main conclusions Even in relatively well-studied areas such as California, different data sources can lead to rather dissimilar maps of species richness. Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different methods for creating a richness map can provide guidance for selecting the approach that is most appropriate for a given application and region.

AB  - MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy), a Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) method, was applied in the current study in order to assess present and future spatial distribution of the Phoenician juniper (Juniperus phoenicea). Potential future changes in the geographic range size of J. phoeniceain Algeria was determined for the two horizons 2050 and 2070 based on CCSM4 model of the IPCC. Three types of data were used in SDM namely: 21 edaphic factors, 10 topographic parameters, and 19 climatic factors. The AUC value (Area Under Curve) scored 0.966, which showed the high performance of the MaxEnt model. The most contributing variables were: total soil carbon (22.1%), Bio14: driest month precipitation (19.2%), slope (11.1%), Bio15: seasonality of precipitation (coefficient of variation) (10.3), total soil nitrogen (7%), soil available water capacity during summer (6.3%). The presence probability map obtained shows a narrowing of the favorable area of the species by about 52.5% by the year 2070. Such a result asserts the vulnerable state of this species toward the climate change, which results in altitudinal, longitudinal and latitudinal species distribution range shift as a response reflecting the becoming of unfavorable changes of the Phoenician juniper habitats. Based on these results, it is necessary to adopt necessary planning measures for the protection and conservation of the species regarding its vulnerability to climate change.

AB  - Amphibian populations are threatened globally, and one of the hypotheses for these declines is climate change. Species distribution models are frequently used to predict changes in suitable habitat as a result of changing climates; however, these projections can be heavily influenced by choice of modeling approach. To evaluate global predictions for amphibians, we conducted a literature review of studies that utilize correlative species distribution models to project changes in climate suitability under various climate change scenarios. We paid particular attention to the use of model selection in choosing among candidate species distribution models (SDMs) so as to control for overparameterization of SDMs. In addition, we conducted a case study with three species of Slender Salamanders (Batrachoseps) to further investigate the impact of differences in modeling decisions on projected amphibian climate suitability. We found 83 studies (including the present case study) in which projections of future climate suitability were made for amphibian species. Of those studies, 36 included estimates of percent change in climate suitability and thus were included in our meta-analysis. These studies included projections for over 1000 species or species complexes, with the majority being Anurans (86%), and encompassed five continents with the most representation in South America, Europe, and North America. Across these studies, average projected change in climate suitability ranged from -70% to 167%, and these projected changes varied with dispersal assumptions representative concentration pathway (RCP) used, the projection year, and taxonomic order. Only three of the 36 studies reported the use of Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based model selection to choose a best-fit SDM. However, our case study demonstrated that predicted change in climate suitability varied whether the best-fit or default SDM was used for projections. Further, this result varied among species (Delta AIC = 0), suggesting that the impact of overparameterization differs across species. Our results illustrate that there is a pressing need to project climate suitability across more species and more geographic regions. In addition, we may need to revisit projections for previously investigated species to evaluate additional climate scenarios and whether overparameterization may have influenced projections. Our ability to accurately model future changes in climate suitability will be essential for successful conservation and management plans for amphibians.

AB  - Bioconstructions such as coralligenous outcrops and maerl beds are typical Mediterranean underwater seascapes. Fine-scale knowledge on the distribution of these sensitive habitats is crucial for their effective management and conservation. In the present study, a thorough review of existing spatial datasets showing the distribution of coralligenous and maerl habitats across the Mediterranean Sea was undertaken, highlighting current gaps in knowledge. Predictive modelling was then carried out, based on environmental predictors, to produce the first continuous maps of these two habitats across the entire basin. These predicted occurrence maps for coralligenous outcrops and maerl beds provide critical information about where the two habitats are most likely to occur. The collated occurrence data and derived distribution model outputs can help addressing the challenge of developing basin-wide spatial plans and to guide cost-effective future surveys and monitoring efforts towards areas that are presently poorly-sampled.

AB  - Conservation planning of threatened taxa relies upon accurate data on systematics, ecological traits and suitable habitats. The genus Gazella includes taxa with distinct morphologies and ecological traits, but close phylogenetic relationships. The North African Gazella cuvieri and Gazella leptoceros loderi share morphological and physiological characters but the former is darker and found in mountain areas, while the latter is lighter and associated with sand dunes. Here we aim to assess the genetic distinctiveness of these taxa, to characterize their ecological niches and to identify potential occurrence areas, by analysing 327 samples across North-West Africa. Phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial (CYTB) and five nuclear gene fragments (KCAS, LAC, SPTBN1, PRKCI and THYR) show that both taxa comprise a single monophyletic group. However, ecological niche-based modelling suggests that populations of these taxa occupy distinct geographic areas and specific environments. Predicted areas of sympatry were restricted, as a consequence of local sharp transitions in climatic traits. The lack of genetic differentiation between these taxa suggests they should be lumped into G. cuvieri, while ecological and morphological differences indicate they correspond to distinct ecotypes. Conservation planning of G. cuvieri should consider the preservation of both mountain and lowland ecotypes to maintain the overall adaptive potential of the species. This integrative approach provides valuable insights in identifying evolutionary units and should be extended to other gazelles.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate by prediction of the spatial distribution of Quercus ilex L. in its natural range in eastern Algeria. The maximum entropy method was used for modeling the species in potentially favorable areas under environmental conditions by linking the spatial occurrence and the environmental conditions. The following three explanatory parameter groups were used for the modeling: i) edaphic variables, ii) variables related to topography, and iii) climatic variables. The established predictions demonstrated that over the horizons 2050 and 2070, we shall lose 125,000 and 147,000 hectares, respectively. The most favorable areas for Q. ilex L. would appear to extend between the elevations of 1430 m by 2050 and reach 1650 m by 2070. The performance of the model used in this study was confirmed by the AUC (area under the curve) value of 0.929. The high elevations, especially those of the Saharan Atlas, would offer climatic refuges. These results represent a decision support tool for designing the best strategy of sensitization. and planning for the conservation of the holm oak.

AB  - Research conducted in several Mediterranean areas indicates that most populations of steppe birds are currently experiencing population declines associated with intensification of traditional agricultural practices. By using habitat suitability modeling (HSM), our aim was to use available environmental data sets, including land use and relief, to model the current distribution of nine steppe bird species in the agriculture dominated areas of the Catalan Ebro basin ( northeast Iberia). We then employ HSM to quantitatively assess the future impact of land use changes on the potential distribution range of these species under two scenarios following irrigation of present extensive cereal steppes in the area. HSM analyses showed a close association between steppe bird distribution and the extent of extensive cereal agriculture in flat areas. Although the sensitivity to planned irrigation schemes was species specific, we estimated significant decreases in distribution after irrigation for seven of the nine species examined, i.e. the Little bustard, the Montagu's harrier, the Roller and the Calandra lark, the species predicted to be more severely affected by predicted decreases in area exceeding 50%. Overall, core steppe habitats where most valuable steppe species may co-occur are expected to be mostly impacted and decrease by 74 to 81% after irrigation of only 28 to 36% of the cereal cropland in the region. Future maintenance and survival of viable populations of steppe birds will rely on our ability to enlarge the network of protected areas and to implement agri-environmental measures targeting current species core habitats in low-intensity farmland.

AB  - Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea is among the important places in Africa for the conservation of primates, but a cultural preference for bushmeat and a lack of effective law enforcement has encouraged commercial bushmeat hunting, threatening the survival of the remaining primate population. For over 13 years, we collected bushmeat market data in the Malabo market, recording over 35,000 primate carcasses, documenting mardi gras consumption patterns, seasonal carcass availability, and negative effects resulting from government intervention. We also conducted forest surveys throughout Bioko's two protected areas in order to localize and quantify primate populations and hunting pressure. Using these data, we were able to document the significant negative impact bushmeat hunting had on monkey populations, estimate which species are most vulnerable to hunting, and develop ecological niche models to approximate the distribution of each of Bioko's diurnal primate species. These results also have allowed for the identification of primate hotspots, such as the critically important southwest region of the Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve, and thus, priority areas for conservation on Bioko, leading to more comprehensive conservation recommendations. Current and future efforts now focus on bridging the gap between investigators and legislators in order to develop and effectively implement a management plan for Bioko's Gran Caldera Scientific Reserve and to develop a targeted educational campaign to reduce demand by changing consumer attitudes toward bushmeat. Using this multidisciplinary approach, informed by biological, socioeconomic, and cultural research, there may yet be a positive future for the primates of Bioko.

AB  - After the dramatic eutrophication-induced decline of intertidal seagrasses in the 1970s, the Wadden Sea has shown diverging developments. In the northern Wadden Sea, seagrass beds have expanded and become denser, while in the southern Wadden Sea, only small beds with low shoot densities are found. A lack of documentation of historical distributions hampers conservation management. Yet, the recovery in the northern Wadden Sea provides opportunity to construct robust habitat suitability models to support management. We tuned habitat distribution models based on 17years of seagrass surveys in the northern Wadden Sea and high-resolution hydrodynamics and geomorphology for the entire Wadden Sea using five machine learning approaches. To obtain geographically transferable models, hyperparameters were tuned on the basis of prediction accuracy assessed by non-random, spatial cross-validation. The spatial cross-validation methodology was combined with a consensus modelling approach. The predicted suitability scores correlated amongst each other and with the hold-out observations in the training area indicating that the models converged and were transferable across space. Prediction accuracy was improved by averaging the predictions of the best models. We graphically examined the relationship between the consensus suitability score and independent presence-only data from outside the training area using the area-adjusted seagrass frequency per suitability class (continuous Boyce index). The Boyce index was positively correlated with the suitability score indicating the adequacy of the prediction methodology. We used the plot of the continuous Boyce index against habitat suitability score to demarcate three habitat classes - unsuitable, marginal and suitable - for the entire international Wadden Sea. This information is valuable for habitat conservation and restoration management. Divergence between predicted suitability and actual distributions from the recent past indicates that unaccounted factors limit seagrass development in the southern Wadden Sea.Synthesis and applications. Our methodology and data enabled us to produce a robust and validated consensus habitat suitability model. We identified highly suitable areas where intertidal seagrass meadows may establish and persist. Our work provides scientific underpinning for effective conservation planning in a dynamic landscape and sets monitoring priorities.

AB  - Aim: Ecological niche modelling (ENM) is widely used in biogeography and conservation studies. The performance of ENM is influenced by the quality of species' presence and absence datasets. Presences may include marginal localities, and absences are usually difficult to collect. We evaluated the use of species' physiological limits to improve selection of presences and absences for ENM in a virtual species framework with defined response functions as surrogates for physiological knowledge.
   Location: The lower 48 states in USA.
   Methods: We generated physiologically informed absences based on either complete or incomplete knowledge of species' physiology. With the same physiological knowledge, we reduced noise (incorrect or marginal locations) from presence datasets, completely or incompletely. We compared (i) models based on physiologically informed absences and random background points, (ii) models based on presences with and without noise and (iii) models obtained with and without incorporating physiological knowledge in absence and presence datasets.
   Results: Only absences based on complete physiological information produced better performing models than random background points. Model improvement was positively correlated with the percentage of noise being removed from the presence data, and best--performing models were obtained with true presences (all noise removed). Manipulating both absences and presences led to better models than manipulating only presences when all or majority of physiological limits were known.
   Main conclusions: The benefit of incorporating physiological information into ENM datasets largely depends on completeness of physiological knowledge, but in reality incomplete understanding of species' physiology is the norm. We found that applying incomplete physiological knowledge to absences may bias ENM, and thus, use of random background points is recommended; on the other hand, removing noise from species' presence datasets based on incomplete physiological limits increases model performance, thus this approach could potentially improve the effectiveness of ENM applications in conservation planning and invasive species management.

AB  - As an evolutionary lineage cycads are rare, and the extinction risk is high for many species. The genus Ceratozamia, one of the most diverse in Mexico, is experiencing drastic reductions of its habitat. Ceratozamia is widely distributed along the Sierra Madre Oriental, a complex mountain range, in a region characterized by high ecological and cultural diversity. Since 1990, various conservation and management strategies have been applied to this taxon in Mexico but evidence for the effectiveness of these measures is lacking. Ceratozamia in the Mexican Sierra Madre Oriental is highly diverse and endemic, offering a model for analysing geographical distribution patterns with ecological niche modelling. It also presents an opportunity for assessing the success of conservation and management strategies that have been implemented in this area. Here, we examined three aspects that are considered fundamental for the development and evaluation of conservation strategies: (1) taxonomy, (2) ecology and (3) sociocultural anthropology. Our findings suggest a pessimistic outlook for the long-term survival of Ceratozamia species in their natural environment, indicating the need to review the current IUCN Cycad Action Plan for the genus. To improve the protection of Ceratozamia and other taxonomic and/or ecological assemblages, we encourage a multidisciplinary approach, with increased collaboration between natural and social scientists.

AB  - Climate change is likely to be one of the most important factors affecting our future food security. To mitigate negative impacts, we will require our crops to be more genetically diverse. Such diversity is available in crop wild relatives (CWRs), the wild taxa relatively closely related to crops and from which diverse traits can be transferred to the crop. Conservation of such genetic resources resides within the nation where they are found; therefore, national-level conservation recommendations are fundamental to global food security. We investigate the potential impact of climate change on CWR richness in Norway. The consequences of a 1.5 and 3.0 A degrees C temperature rise were studied for the years 2030, 2050, 2070, 2080 and then compared to the present climate. The results indicate a pattern of shifting CWR richness from the south to the north, with increases in taxa turnover and in the numbers of threatened taxa. Recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation actions over the short and long term for the priority CWRs in Norway are presented. The methods and recommendations developed here can be applied within other nations and at regional and global levels to improve the effectiveness of conservation actions and help ensure global food security.

AB  - One of the primary reason of species extinction especially rare species with very specific requirements, is habitat destruction. To protect these species, habitat suitability evaluation plays a central role. Hence, an attempt is made in this study to evaluate the suitability of sand cat's habitat in a sand dune-dominated landscape in Iran. Four Landsat-derived indices including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Weighted Difference Vegetation Index, Brightness Index (BI) and Salinity Index were combined to characterize sand cat's habitat requirements through a land use land cover (LULC) map. Furthermore, a set of landscape metrics were employed to explore the spatial pattern LULC classes. Sand cat's habitat suitability map was generated by linear combination of the standardized and relatively weighted NDVI and BI indices and then categorized into five classes of most suitable, highly suitable, moderately suitable, least suitable and not suitable. The results showed that about 75% of the total area is suitable for sand cat. Although this region is rich in biodiversity, it has not yet been subject to any conservation planning and should be granted more conservation attentions.

AB  - Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) is a rare habitat specialist that breeds in dense balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and red spruce (Picea rubens) forests at high elevations in the northeastern United States. Ongoing and projected loss of this forest type has led to increased demand for information on the species' status throughout the region. We used elevation, latitude, and forest type to construct a model of Bicknell's Thrush distribution in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The model predicts the species to be present in conifer-dominated forests above an elevation threshold that descends with increasing latitude. The slope of the threshold (-81.63 m/l degrees latitude) reflects climatic effects on forest composition and structure. The distribution model encompasses 136.250 ha of montane forest, including extensive areas of the White Mountains in New Hampshire and Adirondack Mountains in New York. To test model performance, We conducted point Count and playback surveys along 1-km routes established in conifer forests above and below the threshold. The model accurately predicted the presence or presumed absence of Bicknell's Thrush on 61 of 72 routes (84.7%). When areas within 50 vertical in of the threshold were excluded, accuracy improved to 98.1%. The distribution model is a practical tool for conservation planning at local and regional levels. Potential applications include projecting effects of climate change on Bicknell's Thrush distribution, assessing risks of habitat alteration, and setting priorities for conservation and management.

AB  - Implementing and monitoring long-term conservation strategies demands identifying priorities for preserving landscape connectivity. In this manuscript, we present an approach to prioritize areas for preserving landscape connectivity by using the landscape matrix in central-western Mexico and the connectivity for habitat patches considering ensembles of different terrestrial organisms. We aggregated three multispecies connectivity scenarios into a composite corridor scenario. To evaluate which corridors were more important to multispecies connectivity, we used the composite corridor model based on two ways: (1) the contribution of habitat patches that the corridor connects to overall connectivity and (2) the corridor's capability for facilitating movement across the network of patches. Habitat patches were classified according to their value for the conservation of multispecies connectivity by hybridizing circuit-based and spatial prioritization models for connectivity conservation. We developed current flow models for each species (n = 40) and combined them in four prioritization models corresponding to the three multispecies groups and an all-species group. We found that the corridors having the highest accumulated importance (CI >= 58) are located along the protected areas of Pico de Tancitaro and the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biosfera de la Mariposa Monarca-RBMM, Spanish acronym), which have relatively similar spatial distributions corridors compared to areas with priority for conservation (relative rank test = 0.6). Within those areas, there are permeable sectors with high connectivity retention values that could optimize their ecological function as multispecies corridors. Our approach is applicable to different landscapes, and it allows for identifying priorities for connectivity conservation by integrating landscape elements outside habitat patches.

AB  - The focus of biodiversity conservation is shifting to larger spatial scales in response to habitat fragmentation and the need to integrate multiple landscape objectives. Conservation strategies increasingly incorporate measures to combat fragmentation such as ecological networks. These are often based on assessment of landscape structure but such approaches fail to capitalise on the potential offered by more ecologically robust assessments of landscape function and connectivity. In this paper, we describe a modelling approach to identifying functional habitat networks and demonstrate its application to a fragmented landscape where policy initiatives seek to improve conditions for woodland biodiversity including increasing woodland cover. Functional habitat networks were defined by identifying suitable habitat and by modelling connectivity using least-cost approaches to account for matrix permeability. Generic focal species (GFS) profiles were developed, in consultation with stakeholders, to represent species with high and moderate sensitivity to fragmentation. We demonstrated how this form of analysis can be used to aid the spatial targeting of conservation actions. This 'targeted' action scenario was tested for effectiveness against comparable scenarios, which were based on random and clumped actions within the same landscape. We tested effectiveness using structural metrics, network-based metrics and a published functional connectivity indicator. Targeting actions within networks resulted in the highest mean woodland area and highest connectivity indicator value. Our approach provides an assessment of landscape function by recognising the importance of the landscape matrix. It provides a framework for the targeting and evaluation of alternative conservation options, offering a pragmatic, ecologically-robust solution to a current need in applied landscape ecology.

AB  - Ecological niche models predict plant responses to climate change by circumscribing species distributions within a multivariate environmental framework. Most projections based on modern bioclimatic correlations imply that high-elevation species are likely to be extirpated from their current ranges as a result of rising growing-season temperatures in the coming decades. Paleoecological data spanning the last 15,000 years from the Greater Yellow-stone region describe the response of vegetation to past climate variability and suggest that white pines, a taxon of special concern in the region, have been surprisingly resilient to high summer temperature and fire activity in the past. Moreover, the fossil record suggests that winter conditions and biotic interactions have been critical limiting variables for high-elevation conifers in the past and will likely be so in the future. This long-term perspective offers insights on species responses to a broader range of climate and associated ecosystem changes than can be observed at present and should be part of resource management and conservation planning for the future.

AB  - Because rare and cryptic species can be difficult to locate, distribution maps for such species are often inaccurate or incomplete. Bog Turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii) are emblematic of this challenge. Conducting surveys of known, historical, and potential Bog Turtle habitat is a specific need stated in the Bog Turtle Northern Population Recovery Plan and in most Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategies of states in the southern population. To address this need, we constructed a species distribution model for the southern population of Bog Turtles and ground-validated the model to assess its ability to locate suitable Bog Turtle habitat. Our final model identified 998,325 ha of potentially suitable habitat. On-the-ground evaluation of habitat identified as potentially suitable was carried out at 113 wetlands in Georgia and 83 in South Carolina. Of these, only nine wetlands met criteria for suitable Bog Turtle habitat in Georgia and 13 in South Carolina. Trapping efforts at the nine Georgia sites and eight of the South Carolina sites showed Bog Turtles to be present at two of the Georgia sites. This ground-validation effort demonstrates that the species distribution model greatly over-predicts the amount of suitable habitat for Bog Turtles. Nonetheless, this manner of searching for rare and cryptic species does avoid the typical biases of haphazard searches and helps identify habitat on private property. Given these findings, the model is most useful when the area of interest is small, such as a county within the range of a species that currently has no known occurrence records.

AB  - Objectives: Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are used to produce predictions of potential Leguminosae diversity in West Central Africa. Those predictions are evaluated subsequently using expert opinion. The established methodology of combining all SDMs is refined to assess species diversity within five defined vegetation types. Potential species diversity is thus predicted for each vegetation type respectively. The primary aim of the new methodology is to define, in more detail, areas of species richness for conservation planning.
   Methodology: Using Maxent, SDMs based on a suite of 14 environmental predictors were generated for 185 West Central African Leguminosae species, each categorised according to one of five vegetation types: Afromontane, coastal, non-flooded forest, open formations, or riverine forest. The relative contribution of each environmental variable was compared between different vegetation types using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis followed by a post-hoc Kruskal-Wallis Paired Comparison contrast. Legume species diversity patterns were explored initially using the typical method of stacking all SDMs. Subsequently, five different ensemble models were generated by partitioning SDMs according to vegetation category. Ecological modelers worked with legume specialists to improve data integrity and integrate expert opinion in the interpretation of individual species models and potential species richness predictions for different vegetation types.
   Results/Conclusions: Of the 14 environmental predictors used, five showed no difference in their relative contribution to the different vegetation models. Of the nine discriminating variables, the majority were related to temperature variation. The set of variables that played a major role in the Afromontane species diversity model differed significantly from the sets of variables of greatest relative important in other vegetation categories. The traditional approach of stacking all SDMs indicated overall centers of diversity in the region but the maps indicating potential species richness by vegetation type offered more detailed information on which conservation efforts can be focused.

AB  - The conversion of natural areas to human-dominated land uses results in loss, degradation, and fragmentation of wildlife habitat which often lead to species endangerment and local extinction. The risk of endangerment may be particularly acute for species that exist as metapopulations in which viability of the species is contingent upon dispersal of individuals among local sub-populations. This paper uses an optimization framework to investigate the problem of conserving metapopulations residing in areas at the urban-rural fringe. We compare the optimal allocation of preservation to outcomes of four other policy alternatives including the reserve-site-selection option that fully preserves habitat patches while allowing full development of the intervening dispersal matrix. In general, the optimal allocation includes some amount of preservation in both habitat patches and dispersal matrix, with the level of protection typically greater in habitat patches. The reserve-site-selection conservation option is optimal in only a few cases. Heterogeneity in terms of land use and landscape structure adds complexity to the optimal solution such that no one policy works well across all land units and in situations where the landscape structure is skewed, full protection of some land units and full development of others becomes more common.

AB  - The rise in global temperature is one of the main threats of extinction to many vulnerable species by the twenty-first century. The negative impacts of climate change on the northern highlands of Pakistan (NHP) could change the species composition. Range shifts and range reduction in the forested landscapes will dramatically affect the distribution of forest-dwelling species, including the Galliformes (ground birds). Three Galliformes (e.g., Lophophorus impejanus, Pucrasia macrolopha, and Tragopan melanocephalus) are indicator species of the environment and currently distributed in NHP. For this study, we used Maximum Entropy Model (MaxEnt) to simulate the current (average for 1960-1990) and future (in 2050 and 2070) distributions of the species using three General Circulation Models (GCMs) and two climate change scenarios, i.e., RCP4.5 (moderate carbon emission scenario) and RCP8.5 (peak carbon emission scenario). Our results indicated that (i) under all three climate scenarios, species distribution was predicted to both reduce and shift towards higher altitudes. (ii) Across the provinces in the NHP, the species were predicted to average lose around one-third (35%) in 2050 and one-half (47%) by 2070 of the current suitable habitat. (iii) The maximum area of climate refugia was projected between the altitudinal range of 2000 to 4000 m and predicted to shift towards higher altitudes primarily > 3000 m in the future. Our results help inform management plans and conservation strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change on three indicator Galliforms species in the NHP.

AB  - Aim: To present an updated database of fish species recorded on south-western Atlantic reef environments and to explore the ecological drivers of the structure, the latitudinal gradient of biodiversity and the centre of endemism in this peripheral province.
   Location: South-western Atlantic (SWA): Brazilian and Argentinian Provinces.
   Methods: A database composed of 733 fish species along 23 locations in the SWA (00 degrees 55' N to 43 degrees 00' S) was compiled based on primary data, literature and museum records. Cluster and beta diversity analyses were carried out to evaluate faunal overlaps among locations and subprovinces. "Target-area-distance effect" and "stepping stones dispersal" hypotheses for assemblage composition were tested through Mantel tests. Relationships between the distribution patterns and ecological traits of reef fish species were investigated through generalized linear mixed-effect models.
   Results: Out of the 733 fish species, 405 are SWA resident reef fishes, of which 111 (27%) are endemics and 78 are threatened with extinction. Cluster analysis detected six subprovinces in the SWA structured following the target-area-distance model, and with no evidence for a latitudinal gradient in diversity. The greatest overall richness and endemic species richness were found in the east-south-eastern region. Depth range, habitat use and body size were the main drivers of SWA reef fish assemblage structure.
   Main conclusions: The Brazilian and Argentinian coasts constitute different provinces structured by oceanographic barriers and environmental filters. Similarities among oceanic islands indicate connectivity driven by stochastic and ecological factors. Species richness and endemism indicate that peripheral provinces may also bear centres of origin and biodiversity, patterns driven by parapatric/ecological speciation and the overlap between tropical and subtropical reef fish species. Ecological drivers of reef fish distribution, such as habitat specialization and body size, support hypotheses of speciation in the periphery. New approaches for spatial planning, marine protected areas and off-reserve marine management are essential for the conservation and sustainability of SWA reef fishes.

AB  - A feature of many endangered species management plans, is the provision or protection of habitat. However, defining exactly what constitutes habitat can be difficult. This is made more complicated when habitat preferences differ within a species such as between males and females. Using a combination of field surveys and sex identification through fecal DNA, we investigated gender differences in habitat use in wild giant pandas through ecological niche factor analysis modelling. Our results indicated that both males and females tended to prefer areas at high altitudes and with high forest cover. However, significant sexual differences in habitat selection were also observed. Furthermore, habitat preferences of females are more restrictive than those of males, and females have a stronger association with high altitude conifer forest, mixed forest, historically clear-felled forest and >10 to <= 20 degrees slopes. The more restricted habitat preferences of females could be explained by their need for dens for birthing and dense bamboo cover for concealing the young. Therefore, effective conservation and management strategies should consider these differences in habitat selection of females and males.

AB  - P>The latitudinal gradient in species richness is a nearly universal ecological phenomenon. Similarly, conspecific genetic diversity often increases towards the equator - usually explained as the consequence of post-glacial range expansion or due to the shared response of genetic diversity to processes that promote species richness. However, no study has yet examined the relationship between latitude and within-population genetic diversity in exclusively tropical species. We surveyed genetic variation in nine resident bird species co-occurring in tropical lowlands between southern Mexico and western Ecuador, where avian species richness increases with decreasing latitude. Within-population genetic variation was always highest at mid-range latitudes, and not in the most equatorial populations. Differences in demography and gene flow across species' ranges may explain some of our observations; however, much of the pattern may be due simply to geometric constraints. Our findings have implications for conservation planning and for understanding how biodiversity scales from genes to communities.

AB  - Ecological niche models (ENMs) have become a practical and key mechanism for filling major gaps in spatial information for targeted conservation planning, particularly when only occurrence data are available. Nonetheless, accounting for abundance patterns in the internal structure of species' ranges, and the role of biotic interactions in such models across broadscale, remains highly challenging. Our study gathered baseline information on abundance data of two Endangered Amazonian primates (Ateles chamek and Lagothrix lagotricha cana) to create geospatial abundance models using two spatial interpolation methods: Inverse distance weight (IDW) and Ordinary kriging (OK). The main goals were to: (i) test whether geospatial abundance models are correlated with habitat suitability derived from correlative ENMs; (ii) compare the strength of the abundance-suitability relationships between original and interpolated abundances; (iii) test whether interspecific competition between the two target taxa constrained abundance over broad spatial scales; and (iv) create ensemble models incorporating both habitat suitability and abundance to identify high-priority areas for conservation. We found a significant positive relationship between habitat suitability with observed and predicted abundances of woolly (L. l. cana) and spider (A. chamek) monkeys. Abundance-suitability correlations showed no significant differences when using original relative abundances compared to using interpolated abundances. We also found that the association between L. l. cana abundance and habitat suitability depended on the abundance of its putative competitor species, A. chamek. Our final models combining geospatial abundance information with ENMs were able to provide more realistic assessments of hotspots for conservation, especially when accounting for the important, but often neglected, role of interspecific competition in shaping species' geographic ranges at broader scales. The framework developed here, including general trends in abundance patterns and suitability information, can be used as a surrogate to identify high-priority areas for conservation of poorly known species across their entire geographic ranges.

AB  - Least-cost modeling for focal species is the most widely used method for designing conservation corridors and linkages. However, these linkages have been based on current species' distributions and land cover, both of which will change with large-scale climate change. One method to develop corridors that facilitate species' Shifting distributions is to incorporate climate models into their design. But this approach is enormously complex and prone to error propagation. It also produces outputs at a grain size (km(2)) coarser than the grain at which conservation decisions are made. One way to avoid these problems is to design linkages for the continuity and interspersion of land facets, or recurring landscape units of relatively uniform topography and soils. This coarse-filter approach aims to conserve the arenas of biological activity rather than the temporary occupants of those arenas. In this paper, we demonstrate how land facets can be defined in a rule-based and adaptable way, and how they can be used for linkage design in the face of climate change. We used fuzzy c-means cluster analysis to define land facets with respect to four topographic variables (elevation, slope angle, solar insolation, and topographic position), and least-cost analysis to design linkages that include one corridor per land facet. To demonstrate the flexibility of our procedures, we designed linkages using land facets in three topographically diverse landscapes in Arizona, USA. Our procedures can use other variables, including soil variables, to define land facets.. We advocate using land facets to complement, rather than replace, existing focal species approaches to linkage design. This approach can be used even in regions lacking land cover maps and is not affected by the bias and patchiness common in species occurrence data.

AB  - Although field-collected recordings typically contain multiple simultaneously vocalizing birds of different species, acoustic species classification in this setting has received little study so far. This work formulates the problem of classifying the set of species present in an audio recording using the multi-instance multi-label (MIML) framework for machine learning, and proposes a MIML bag generator for audio, i.e., an algorithm which transforms an input audio signal into a bag-of-instances representation suitable for use with MIML classifiers. The proposed representation uses a 2D time-frequency segmentation of the audio signal, which can separate bird sounds that overlap in time. Experiments using audio data containing 13 species collected with unattended omnidirectional microphones in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve high accuracy (96.1% true positives/negatives). Automated detection of bird species occurrence using MIML has many potential applications, particularly in long-term monitoring of remote sites, species distribution modeling, and conservation planning.

AB  - This paper compares the performance of five modelling methods in the prediction of a species distribution, using a data set describing the distribution of the threatened clouded apollo butterfly (Parnassius mnemosyne) in south-west Finland. The five statistical techniques included were: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), neural networks (ANN) and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS). The accuracy of the models was examined at three spatial resolutions (1, 25 and 100 ha) by area under the curve (AUC) and kappa statistics. All five modelling techniques had a relatively high discrimination capacity for the occurrence of clouded apollo. Classification tree analysis provided the least robust model performance. The differences between the other methods were small, although GAM and MARS provided marginally the best stability and performance. The most accurate models were developed for the resolutions of I ha (highest AUC values)and 25 ha (highest kappa values) and the least accurate models for the resolution of 100 ha. Our work shows that modern modelling techniques can provide useful forecasts of species distributions in unsurveyed parts of landscapes and provide valuable contributions to conservation and management planning. However, the success of applying the new modelling tools can be influenced by the choice of statistical technique and especially of spatial resolution. In conclusion, small changes in the spatial scale may result in a clear decrease in the model performance and thus caution should be exercised when implementing the models and their predictions in practice.

AB  - Mangroves are highly threatened ecosystems yet their community ecology is poorly understood. We examined the ecological determinants of bird community assemblage in floristically depauperate mangroves. Birds were surveyed using line transect methods. Large mangrove patches supported fewer species than smaller patches. Patches did not comprise nested species subsets and the bird species richness of several small patches combined was greater than a single large area. The number of mangrove dependent species in a patch was area-dependent suggesting these species may be resource limited, although there was no species density compensation. There was a clear effect of the surrounding habitat, with matrix species accounting for similar to 45% of bird species in a patch. Patches surrounded by tropical savanna were relatively species-poor, while regardless of size, patches including monsoon rainforest were relatively species rich. Null model analysis of non-random assemblage structure (nestedness and species co-occurrence) revealed no deterministic structure to the overall mangrove species assemblage. These analyses described a random pattern of bird distribution and with no evidence of density compensation this suggests that competition is a weak structuring force of mangrove bird assemblages. The lack of nestedness and the random co-occurrence of species are consistent with the matrix-dependence of bird community composition. Conservation plans should treat mangrove patches as part of a habitat mosaic and incorporate many smaller mangrove patches rather than just big ones. Consideration of the nature, extent and diversity of the surrounding matrices is vital in managing and conserving mangrove bird communities. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, predictive habitat distribution models, derived by combining multivariate statistical analyses with Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, have been recognised for their utility in conservation planning. The size and spatial arrangement of suitable habitat can influence the long-term persistence of some faunal species. In southwestern Victoria, Australia, populations of the rare swamp antechinus (Antechinus minimus maritimus) are threatened by further fragmentation of suitable habitat. In the current study, a spatially explicit habitat suitability model was developed for A. minimus that incorporated a measure of vegetation structure. Models were generated using logistic regression with species presence or absence as the dependent variable and landscape variables, extracted from both GIS data layers and multi-spectral digital imagery, as the predictors. The most parsimonious model, based on the Akaike Information Criterion, was spatially extrapolated in the GIS. Probability of species presence was used as an index of habitat suitability. A negative association between A. minimus presence and both elevation and habitat complexity was evidenced, suggesting a preference for relatively low altitudes and a vegetation structure of low vertical complexity. The predictive performance of the selected model was shown to be high (91 %), indicating a good fit of the model to the data. The proportion of the study area predicted as suitable habitat for A. minimus (Probability of occurrence greater than or equal to0.5) was 11.7%. Habitat suitability maps not only provide baseline information about the spatial arrangement of potentially suitable habitat for a species, but they also help to refine the search for other populations, making them an important conservation tool.

AB  - Concerns about bycatch of protected species have become a dominant factor shaping fisheries management. However, efforts to mitigate bycatch are often hindered by a lack of data on the distributions of fishing effort and protected species. One approach to overcoming this problem has been to overlay the distribution of past fishing effort with known locations of protected species, often obtained through satellite telemetry and occurrence data, to identify potential bycatch hotspots. This approach, however, generates static bycatch risk maps, calling into question their ability to forecast into the future, particularly when dealing with spatiotemporally dynamic fisheries and highly migratory bycatch species. In this study, we use boosted regression trees to model the spatiotemporal distribution of fishing effort for two distinct fisheries in the North Pacific Ocean, the albacore (Thunnus alalunga) troll fishery and the California drift gillnet fishery that targets swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Our results suggest that it is possible to accurately predict fishing effort using <10 readily available predictor variables (cross-validated correlations between model predictions and observed data approximate to 0.6). Although the two fisheries are quite different in their gears and fishing areas, their respective models had high predictive ability, even when input data sets were restricted to a fraction of the full time series. The implications for conservation and management are encouraging: Across a range of target species, fishing methods, and spatial scales, even a relatively short time series of fisheries data may suffice to accurately predict the location of fishing effort into the future. In combination with species distribution modeling of bycatch species, this approach holds promise as a mitigation tool when observer data are limited. Even in data-rich regions, modeling fishing effort and bycatch may provide more accurate estimates of bycatch risk than partial observer coverage for fisheries and bycatch species that are heavily influenced by dynamic oceanographic conditions.

AB  - Wide-ranging marine birds rely on multiple habitats for wintering, breeding, and migrating, and their conservation may be dependent on protecting networks of key areas. Urbanized estuaries are critical wintering and stopover areas for many declining sea ducks in North America; however, conservation measures within estuaries are difficult to establish given lack of knowledge about habitat use by these species and the variety of competing human interests. We applied hierarchical modeling to evaluate resource selection of sea ducks (surf scoters, Melanitta perspicillata) wintering in San Francisco Bay, California, USA, a large and highly urbanized estuary. We also examined their distribution, home range, and movements with respect to key habitat features and regions within the estuary. Herring roe was the strongest predictor of bird locations; however, eelgrass, water depth and salinity were also highly-ranked, with sea ducks using deeper areas of higher salinity associated with herring roe and eelgrass presence during mid-winter. Sea ducks were also strongly associated with ferry routes, suggesting these areas may contain resources that are too important to avoid and emphasizing the need to better understand water traffic effects. Movements and home range size differed between males and females in early winter but became more similar in late winter. Birds traveled farther and used several sub-bays in early winter compared to mid-winter when herring roe availability peaked in the Central Bay. Our findings identified key environmental variables, highlighted core use areas, and documented critical periods for consideration when developing conservation plans for sea ducks in urbanized estuaries.

AB  - This paper examines the potential impact of climate change on grassland butterfly species in Finland. It combines multiple climate change scenarios and different impact models for bioclimatic suitability to capture multi-faceted aspects of uncertainty. It also evaluates alternative options to enhance the adaptation of grassland biodiversity. Due to the long-term decline of semi-natural grasslands, their current extent in Finland is much lower than the minimum level estimated to ensure the survival of butterfly species. Projected locations of the climatically most suitable areas for butterfly species varied considerably between different modelling techniques and climate change scenarios. This uncertainty needs to be taken into account in planning adaptation responses. Analysis of potential adaptation options considered the promotion of existing measures based on the agri-environmental scheme (AES), as well as new measures, including species translocation and dispersal corridors. Current AES options were compared using a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). The CEA results indicated that buffer zones are the most cost-effective AES measure, although environmental fallows and buffer zones had broadly similar cost-effectiveness. The cost of translocation was relatively modest compared to that of dispersal corridors, due to the high number of habitat stepping stones required along potential dispersal corridors. A questionnaire survey of Finnish farmers revealed that a third of the respondents supported increases in nature conservation. Thus, large increases of the uptake of biodiversity-related AES measures among farmers may prove to be difficult. Given the small areas currently assigned for such measures, the prospects for the adaptation of grassland butterflies to climate change in Finland appear unfavourable.

AB  - Understanding the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on species' behaviour is crucial for conservation planning, considering the extent of habitat loss. We investigated the influence of anthropogenic disturbances including agriculture, urbanisation, protected areas, and the presence of novel predators, on the temporal and spatial behaviour of sympatric forest antelope (Tragelaphus scriptus, Philantomba monticola, Sylvicapra grinunia, and Cephalophus natalensis) in an anthropogenic matrix containing forest fragments in the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt of South Africa. We integrated land-use types with camera-trap data and compared activity patterns using circular statistics and occupancy modelling. Antelope species overlapped in temporal and spatial distribution and exhibited diurnal activity for 50% of the time. All species exhibited nocturnal activity for similar to 25-33% of all observations, except for C. natalensis. Nocturnal activity varied between species and land-use types. The predators Canis familiaris, C. mesomelas and Caracal caracal negatively influenced occupancy of P. monticola, S. grimmia and C. natalensis. Humans negatively influenced temporal activity of P. monticola, and spatial distribution of T. scriptus and S. grimmia. C. familiaris had an overall negative influence on S. grimmia. We found spatial, and to a lesser extent temporal, segregation between species. However, plasticity in activity patterns existed, which varied in response to anthropogenic effects and novel predators.

AB  - Aim To investigate the historical distribution of the Cerrado across Quaternary climatic fluctuations and to generate historical stability maps to test: (1) whether the historical climate stability hypothesis explains squamate reptile richness in the Cerrado; and (2) the hypothesis of Pleistocene connections between savannas located north and south of Amazonia. Location The Cerrado, a savanna biome and a global biodiversity hotspot distributed mainly in central Brazil. Methods We generated occurrence datasets from 1000 presence points randomly selected from the entire distribution of the Cerrado, as determined by two spatial definitions. We modelled the potential Cerrado distribution by implementing a maximum-entropy machine-learning algorithm across four time projections: current, mid-Holocene (6 ka), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 ka) and Last Interglacial (LIG, 120 ka). We generated historical stability maps (refugial areas) by overlapping presence/absence projections of all scenarios, and checked consistencies with qualitative comparisons with available fossil pollen records. We built a spatially explicit simultaneous autoregressive model to explore the relationship between current climate, climatic stability, and squamate species richness. Results Models predicted the LGM and LIG as the periods of narrowest and widest Cerrado distributions, respectively, and were largely corroborated by palynological evidence. We found evidence for two savanna corridors (eastern coastal during the LIG, and Andean during the LGM) and predicted a large refugial area in the north-eastern Cerrado (Serra Geral de Goias refugium). Variables related to climatic stability predicted squamate richness better than present climatic variables did. Main conclusions Our results indicate that Bolivian savannas should be included within the Cerrado range and that the Cerrados biogeographical counterparts are not Chaco and Caatinga but rather the disjunct savannas of the Guyana shield plateaus. Climatic stability is a good predictor of Cerrado squamate richness, and our stability maps could be used in future studies to test diversity patterns and genetic signatures of different taxonomic groups and as a higher-order landscape biodiversity surrogate for conservation planning.

AB  - Assessing the population structure and understanding growth patterns is crucial to manage freshwater resources and to solve fundamental questions concerning endangered species conservation. Austropotamobius pallipes (Lereboullet, 1858) species complex has been declining on a widespread basis in Europe, including Italy, but detailed data on population structure and growth are lacking. In four low order streams populated by the species, water temperature data were collected by data-loggers. In July 2012, a total of 746 crayfish were collected at night and their length was measured. Females and males size distributions were analysed separately for each stream using Bhattacharya's Method. Age was assigned to each length class. The mean values of the age classes were used to evaluate the growth rate of Von Bertalanffy, by the seasonalized equation. Up to six age classes were identified in two populations. Results show that three out of four populations are well-structured, and they confirm that A. pallipes complex is a K-selected species. We stress the need for long-term monitoring and the importance of obtained results in development of conservation plans of endangered crayfish.

AB  - Detecting occupied sites of rare species, and estimating the probability that all occupied sites are known within a given area, are desired outcomes for many ecological or conservation projects. Examples include managing all occupied sites of a threatened species or eradicating an emerging invader. Occupied sites may remain undetected because (1) sites where the species potentially occurs had not been searched, and (2) the species could have been overlooked in the searched sites. For rare species, available data are typically scant, making it difficult to predict sites where the species probably occurs or to estimate detection probability in the searched sites. Using the critically endangered Rose's mountain toadlet (Capensibufo rosei), known from only two localities, we outline an iterative process aimed at estimating the probability that any unknown occupied sites remain and maximizing the chance of finding them. This includes fitting a species distribution model to guide sampling effort, testing model accuracy and sampling efficacy using the occurrence of more common proxy species, and estimating detection probability using sites of known presence. The final estimate of the probability that all occupied sites were found incorporates the uncertainties of uneven distribution, relative area searched, and detection probability. Our results show that very few occupied sites of C. rosei are likely to remain undetected. We also show that the probability of an undetected occupied site remaining will always be high for large unsearched areas of potential occurrence, but can be low for smaller areas intended for targeted management interventions. Our approach is especially useful for assessing uncertainty in species occurrences, planning the required search effort needed to reduce probability of unknown occurrence to desired levels, and identifying priority areas for further searches or management interventions.

AB  - Awareness of the habitat needs of top predators is vital for viability of wildlife populations. During 2017-2018, 32 points of presence signs of the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) were spotted and they were associated to 6 environmental variables. The maximum entropy (Maxent) model was used to predict the distribution of Persian leopards in the Gisakan, south-western Iran. The validity of habitat suitability model (Training data = 0.844) confirmed the reliability of method. On the basis of Jackknife test, distance from the villages (less presence far from the villages), distance from water resources (the farther from the water resource, the less presence), elevation and slope (most presence in elevations 600-1400 m a. s. l. and slopes 30-70%), distance from the roads (the farther from roads, the more presence) and land cover (more presence in woodlands) variables, respectively, were the most important variables. The results indicate that 25.19% of area (115.13 km(2)) contains suitable habitat. We suggest that conservation and management plans for leopards be conducted on areas such as studied area that are not formally protected. The results of this study can also help us to identify and protect suitable habitats for conservation and management as well as decrease wildlife-human conflicts.

AB  - Conservation planning and implementation require identifying pertinent habitats and locations where protection and management may improve viability of targeted species. The winter range of Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli), a threatened Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbird, is restricted to the Greater Antilles. We analyzed winter records from the mid-1970s to 2009 to quantitatively evaluate winter distribution and habitat selection. Additionally, we conducted targeted surveys in Jamaica (n = 433), Cuba (n = 363), Dominican Republic (n = 1,000), Haiti (n = 131) and Puerto Rico (n = 242) yielding 179 sites with thrush presence. We modeled Bicknell's Thrush winter habitat selection and distribution in the Greater Antilles in Maxent version 3.3.1. using environmental predictors represented in 30 arc second study area rasters. These included nine landform, land cover and climatic variables that were thought a priori to have potentially high predictive power. We used the average training gain from ten model runs to select the best subset of predictors. Total winter precipitation, aspect and land cover, particularly broadleaf forests, emerged as important variables. A five-variable model that contained land cover, winter precipitation, aspect, slope, and elevation was the most parsimonious and not significantly different than the models with more variables. We used the best fitting model to depict potential winter habitat. Using the 10 percentile threshold (>0.25), we estimated winter habitat to cover 33,170 km 2, nearly 10% of the study area. The Dominican Republic contained half of all potential habitat (51%), followed by Cuba (15.1%), Jamaica (13.5%), Haiti (10.6%), and Puerto Rico (9.9%). Nearly one-third of the range was found to be in protected areas. By providing the first detailed predictive map of Bicknell's Thrush winter distribution, our study provides a useful tool to prioritize and direct conservation planning for this and other wet, broadleaf forest specialists in the Greater Antilles.

AB  - The aims of this study were (1) to examine the geographic distribution of red-listed species of agricultural environments and identify their national threat spots (areas with high diversity of threatened species) in Finland and (2) to determine the main environmental variables related to the richness and occurrence patterns of red-listed species. Atlas data of 21 plant, 17 butterfly and 11 bird species recorded using 10 km grid squares were employed in the study. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed separately for species richness and occurrence of individual species of the three species groups using climate and land cover predictor variables. The predictive accuracy of models, as measured using correlation between the observed and predicted values and AUC statistics, was generally good. Temperature-related variables were the most important determinants of species richness and occurrence of all three taxa. In addition, land cover variables had a strong effect on the distribution of species. Plants and butterflies were positively related to the cover of grasslands and birds to small-scale agricultural mosaic as well as to arable land. Spatial coincidence of threat spots of plants, butterflies and birds was limited, which emphasizes the importance of considering the potentially contrasting environmental requirements of different taxa in conservation planning. Further, it is obvious that the maintenance of various non-crop habitats and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes has an essential role in the preservation of red-listed species of boreal rural environments.

AB  - Models of vertebrate distributions based on dominant vegetation cover or land-use classification are commonly used for conservation planning, but these models may be inappropriate for species that choose sites based on criteria other than land cover or within urban areas that are not adequately described by cover-type alone. We compared the accuracy of predicted occupancy of birds for a set of cover-type models Alabama Gap Analysis Program's (ALGAP) vertebrate distribution maps between an urban and a rural landscape in east-central Alabama. We performed analysis at two scales of investigation-0.03-km(2) point-count surveys or 28.26-km(2) landscapes using point counts conducted during summers 2004-2006. We tested ALGAP's ability to predict the occupancy of habitat by birds grouped by life-history parameters: migrant, resident, insectivore, carnivore, and omnivore, forest dweller, and cavity nester. ALGAP performed well at the scale of entire landscapes but poorly at the scale of individual point counts. At the point-count scale, ALGAP was most accurate for species requiring interior forest conditions. At the landscape scale, ALGAP was more accurate in the rural landscape than the urban landscape, and it had higher commission errors in the urban landscape. Variation in the ability of ALGAP to predict species occupancy was likely due to (1) poor model performance when applied to species that choose sites using criteria other than cover type and (2) the inadequacy of ALGAP to describe a heterogeneous urbanized landscape. Our results highlight pitfalls of using land cover information to model species distributions in situations where it may be inappropriate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cave ecosystems are subterranean biodiversity hotspots, but limited knowledge of the distribution of diversity among caves hampers their conservation. Surveys of surrogate taxa (e.g., keystone species) can identify hotspots of biodiversity when knowledge about an ecosystem is lacking. Bats are keystone species in cave ecosystems because their guano is the primary energy source supporting diverse assemblages of cave-dependent wildlife. However, directly measuring bat diversity is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge; instead, we suggest the use of correlates of bat diversity that can be derived from readily accessible data (e.g., land-use maps) and straightforward methods not requiring expert knowledge (e.g., cave surveys, interviews) as a foundation for prioritizing caves. To identify easily measurable correlates of bat diversity, we compared assemblage composition and species abundances of 21 bat species captured in 56 caves on Bohol Island, Philippines, along gradients in environmental factors and human disturbance. Model- and distance-based methods indicated that surface-level disturbance (i.e., percent non-forested habitat, degree of urbanization and road development) along with cave complexity (i.e., available roosting area, structural heterogeneity, number of entrances and temperature range) were the most influential factors governing cave-roosting bat assemblages, thus representing correlates of bat diversity. Prioritization schemes based on these correlates select combinations of caves with greater species richness than both random selection and selection of caves based on observed richness from intensive bat surveys. The use of easy-to-measure environmental and disturbance correlates of bat diversity is an effective tool to prioritize caves to protect cave-roosting bats and the cave-dependent wildlife they support.

AB  - This study attempts to model the probability of occurrence of some characteristic macro-invertebrate species of the Baltic Sea from different functional groups (i.e. grazers, deposit and suspension feeders, and predators) in response to major environmental forcing factors (salinity, water depth and seabed substrate type). Analyses were based on the inventory data set compiled by revising the data on macrobenthic species for over 12,000 sampling events in the Baltic Sea. In addition, data on environmental variables are retrieved from the results of modelling and large-scale mapping efforts. A simple logistic regression based modelling technique was applied and the candidate model with highest discriminatory power was selected for habitat suitability mapping. Habitat suitability models allowed to satisfactorily predict the potential distribution of macrofaunal species based solely on modelled salinity, bathymetry and rough sediment class information. Our results indicated that salinity, depth and substrate type are all important in determining the distribution of most characteristic macrobenthic species on the large-scale of the whole Baltic Sea. The present exercise is only a first step. Implementation of other variables (e.g. characterizing oxygen and temperature fluctuations, total organic content, and nutrient supply) would obviously increase the model applicability. Information on the ecological potential of habitat suitability can serve as the utmost important basis for scientifically sound marine spatial planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - As marine predators experience increasing anthropogenic pressures, there is an urgent need to understand their distribution and their drivers to inform spatial conservation planning. We used an ensemble modelling approach to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis) in relation to a variety of ecogeographical and anthropogenic variables in Coffin Bay, Thorny Passage Marine Park, South Australia. Further, we evaluated the overlap between current spatial management measures and important dolphin habitat. Dolphins showed no distinct seasonal shifts in distribution patterns. Models of the entire study area indicate that zones of high probability of dolphin occurrence were located mainly within the inner area of Coffin Bay. In the inner area, zones with high probability of dolphin occurrence were associated with shallow waters (2-4 m and 7-10 m) and located within 1,000 m from land and 2,500 m from oyster farms. The multimodal response curve of depth in the models likely shows how the different dolphin communities in Coffin Bay occupy different embayments characterized by distinct depth patterns. The majority of areas of high (> 0.6) probability of dolphin occurrence are outside sanctuary zones where multiple human activities are allowed. The inner area of Coffin Bay is an important area of year-round habitat suitability for dolphins. Our results can inform future spatial conservation decisions and improve protection of important dolphin habitat.

AB  - Large carnivores have been posited as potential conservation surrogates to inform the design and prioritization of conservation planning. We show that wolves Canis lupus and cougars Puma concolor may have potential to serve as a surrogate suite for conserving landscape heterogeneity, hypothesized to be a determinant of biodiversity in some landscapes. We examined habitat and landscape features associated with the spatial distribution of wolf- and cougar-killed prey in the basin of the North Fork of the Flathead River in Montana. The spatial distribution of wolf-killed prey was driven largely by cover type, whereas physiographic characteristics were the primary driver of the distribution of cougar-killed prey. Spatial templates, generated using >0.66 probability quantiles from spatially explicit models of kill site distribution, estimated over three times as much high-quality habitat for wolves (1005?km2) than for cougars (381?km2). While there were only minor differences in the proportional representation of land cover types between the wolf and cougar templates, 40% of the cougar template fell outside the wolf template, and the former contained over three times more rugged terrain than the latter. The use of a combined wolfcougar spatial template resulted in a 15% increase in total area and 91% increase in the amount of rugged terrain identified. Based on our models, the advantage of using both wolves and cougars as a focal suite in north-west Montana is the ability to identify a greater area of high-quality habitat, and capture landscape heterogeneity that may be important to conserving biodiversity.

AB  - The planning of protected areas take into consideration the current distributions of target species, disregarding possible future range shifts under climate change. This study tested potential shifts in the distribution of three xenarthran species (the giant anteater, Myrmecophaga tridactyla; the giant armadillo, Priodontes maximus; and the three-banded armadillo, Tolypeutes tricinctus) due to the effects of climate change under different dispersal scenarios. In addition, we tested the adequacy of the current Brazilian protected areas in preserving these species under future climate changes (future distribution for the year 2050), under full and null dispersal scenarios. The final occurrence maps were then confronted with two Brazilian reserve systems for the year 2010: one consisting of reserves for integral protection only (IPCU), and one that included also reserves for sustainable use and indigenous reserves (SUCU). In the IPCU system, none of the species have or will have >= 10% of their distributions protected, under neither dispersal scenario. Including SUCU, however, M. tridactyla and P. maximus already are, and will still be, adequately protected in the future. T. tricinctus, which is endemic to the Brazilian semi-arid, will not reach the 10% goal under neither dispersal scenario, even under the SUCU system. We stress the need for management actions in the northeastern and central parts of Brazil. Opportunities for the creation of more reserves are highlighted, considering the potential range shifts and the natural habitats still present in these regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - AimAn understanding of the factors that influence species distributions in heterogeneous landscapes is important when making decisions regarding conservation. Moreover, occupancy probabilities based on detection data can reveal important species-habitat relationships. Accounting for the spatial autocorrelation of detection data increases the statistical validity of occupancy models, but is not often considered. Using novel occupancy modelling that explicitly incorporates detectability and spatial autocorrelation, we assessed the influence of habitat on occupancy patterns of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), moose (Alces alces) and wolves (Canis lupus) across a broad biogeographical extent where fire is the dominant agent of disturbance.
   LocationNorthern Ontario, Canada.
   MethodsWe aerially surveyed 3851 sampling units, each covering 100km(2), for woodland caribou, moose and wolves in February-March in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and visited 1663 units more than once to estimate detectability. We used restricted spatial regression to model occupancy probabilities of each species with respect to habitat factors in two ecozones, accounting for both imperfect detection and lack of independence of sampling units.
   ResultsCovariates influencing species detection varied among ecozones and species. Caribou occupancy was positively related to bogs and negatively related to disturbed areas, while moose occupancy showed opposite responses to these covariates. Wolf occupancy was related to high prey occupancy. Explicitly accounting for spatial autocorrelation in detection data reduced the chance of type I error in occupancy estimates compared with non-spatial models.
   Main conclusionsHabitat relationships and occupancy patterns support the hypothesis that caribou remain spatially segregated from moose to reduce predation risk. The broad scale of analysis indicated changes in species-habitat relationships, suggesting that limiting factors vary across biogeographical gradients. The spatial pattern in caribou occupancy allowed us to identify important areas used by caribou across the region, including the ecotone between fire-driven boreal forests and peatland complexes. The evidence for significant relationships between caribou and land cover, predators and alternate prey underscores the need for careful planning of development and infrastructure in the area.

AB  - Fire suppression allows tree species that are intolerant of fire stress to increase their distribution, potentially resulting in disruption of historical species-environmental relationships. To measure changes between historical General Land Office surveys (1815 to 1850) and current USDA Forest Inventory and Assessment surveys (2004 to 2008), we compared composition, distribution, and site factors of 21 tree species or species groups in the Missouri Ozarks. We used 24 environmental variables and random forests as a classification method to model distributions. Eastern redcedar, elms, maples, and other fire-sensitive species have increased in dominance in oak forests, with concurrent reductions by oak species; specific changes varied by ecological subsection. Ordinations displayed loss of separation between formerly distinctive oak and fire-sensitive tree species groups. Distribution maps showed decreased presence of disturbance-dependent oak and pine species and increased presence of fire-sensitive species that generally expanded from subsections protected from fire along rivers to upland areas, except for eastern redcedar, which expanded into these subsections. Large scale differences in spatial gradients between past and present communities paralleled reduced influence of local topographic gradients in the varied relief of the Missouri Ozarks, as fire-sensitive species have moved to higher, drier, and sunnier sites away from riverine corridors. Due to changes in land use, landscapes in the Missouri Ozarks, eastern United States, and world-wide are changing from open oak and pine-dominated ecosystems to novel oak-mixed species forests, although at fine scales, forests are becoming more diverse in tree species today. Fire suppression weakened the influence by environmental gradients over species dominance, allowing succession from disturbance-dependent oaks to an alternative state of fire-sensitive species. Current and future research and conservation that rely on historical relationships and ecological principles based on disturbance across the landscape will need to incorporate modern interactions among species for resources into management plans and projections.

AB  - Sampling biases permeate ecological research and result in knowledge gaps that have vital consequences for conservation planning. The consequences of knowledge gaps on species identity and distribution (the Wallacean and Linnean shortfalls, respectively) have become apparent recently, but we know little about the extent that research biases and knowledge gaps on traits that influence species' niches (the Hutchinsonian shortfall) affect conservation policy. To examine whether knowledge of species' traits based on seed ecology is geographically, phylogenetically, and ecologically biased, we retrieved research data on seed germination, seed dormancy, seed dispersal, seed banks, seed predation, and seed removal from a database of 847 papers, 1648 species, and 5322 cases. Brazil was selected as a model system for megadiverse, undersampled countries. Kernel density maps showed that research was geographically biased towards highly populated sites, with vast areas remaining historically unexplored. We also show that research was clustered into protected areas. We detected a significant positive phylogenetic bias at genus-level, indicating research concentration in few genera and lower relative bias rates for many herbaceous genera. Unexpectedly, information on seed banking was available for only 74 (3.4%) of threatened species, which suggests that information deficits are highest for species with critical needs for ex situ conservation strategies. Tree, fleshy-fruited, and biotic dispersal species were disproportionately overstudied. Our data indicate that information deficits on seed ecology preclude our ability to effectively restore ecosystems and to safeguard endangered species. We call for a systematic improvement of environmental agenda in which policy makers and scientists target sites, clades, and functional groups historically neglected. Lessons from developed countries and collaborative efforts will be important for megadiverse, underdeveloped countries to achieve the targets of international agreements that depend on seed ecology knowledge aiming to secure biological diversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - Quantifying the risk of extinction due to habitat loss is an increasingly urgent task for the design and implementation of effective conservation interventions. Methods based on species- and endemics-area relationships are well developed, but applications to date have concentrated primarily on the fragmentation of formerly continuous habitats such as forests and woodlands. Applying these area-based methods to predict extinction risk in habitat types occurring naturally as spatially discrete patches has been largely ignored. We address this knowledge gap using a network of seasonally connected wetlands. We modelled the risk of extinction associated with native wetland plant communities under two alternative scenarios: the loss of (i) entire wetlands (patch loss) versus (ii) an equivalent area distributed across the wetlands (area loss). Patch-loss scenarios resulted in more than twice the number of species going extinct than the equivalent loss of area. Extinction due to patch loss was highest when wetlands were removed in increasing size order (smallest to largest) a plausible scenario arising from forecast climatic drying in the region. Small wetlands contained >16% of endemic species in only <5% of wetland area, largely explaining this result. Extinction risk associated with naturally occurring habitat patches depends on the distribution of regionally endemic species; where this is not solely a function of habitat area, the loss of small patches can represent higher risk than an equivalent reduction in total habitat area across the network.

AB  - There is increasing awareness that the long-term success of ecological restoration efforts can be compromised if projected climate change is not effectively incorporated in restoration planning. We propose an approach that aims to support the decision-making process for seed provenance selection in ecological restoration when clear genetic-based guidelines for seed transfer are not available. The approach takes advantage of the increasing availability and refinement of user-friendly web-based GIS interfaces that allow non-experts to directly access biodiversity and environmental data, and build species distribution models. It offers an easily accessible desktop method that land managers and practitioners can use to gain insight: (1) on the overall spatial implications of projected climate change to their restoration project; (2) whether assisted gene flow through climate-adjusted provenance may be appropriate for a given species at a given restoration site; and (3) how far away and in which direction from the restoration site seeds should be collected from. This approach should be used in the early stages of the restoration project to help frame the decision-making process in a climate change context, and can also be used as a platform where other lines of evidence are integrated. We advocate that, in the context of rapid climate change, the climate-adjusted provenance is a promising approach to seed sourcing in ecological restoration, and we suggest its refinement in a way that hedges against uncertainty in climatic projections.

AB  - Using existing data can be a reliable and cost-effective way to predict species distributions, and particularly useful for recovering or expanding species. We developed a current gray wolf (Canis lupus) distribution model for the western Great Lakes region, USA, and evaluated the spatial transferability of single-state models to the region. This study is the first assessment of transferability in a wide-ranging carnivore, as well as one of few developed for large spatial extents. We collected 3500 wolf locations from winter surveys in Minnesota (2017-2019), Wisconsin (2019-2020), and Michigan (2017-2020). We included 10 variables: proportion of natural cover, pastures, and crops; distance to natural cover, agriculture, developed land, and water; major and minor road density; and snowfall (1-km res.). We created a regional ensemble distribution by weight-averaging eight models based on their performance. We also developed single-state models, and estimated spatial transferability using two approaches: state cross-validation and extrapolation. We assessed performance by quantifying correlations, receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), sensitivities, and two niche similarity indices. The regional area estimated to be most suitable for wolves during winter (threshold = maximum sensitivity/specificity) was 106,465 km(2) (MN = 48,083 km(2), WI = 27,757 km(2), MI = 30,625 km(2)) and correctly predicted 88% of wolf locations analyzed. Increasing natural cover and distance to crops were consistently important for determining regional and single-state wolf distribution. Extrapolation (vs. cross-validation) produced results with the greatest performance metrics, and were most similar to the regional model, yet good internal performance was unrelated to greater extrapolation performance. Factors influencing species distributions are scale-dependent and can vary across areas due to behavioral plasticity. When extending inferences beyond the current occurrence of individuals, assessing variation in ecology such as habitat selection, as well as methodological factors including model performance, will be critical to avoid poor scientific interpretations and develop effective conservation applications. In particular, accurate distribution models for recovering or recovered carnivores can be used to develop plans for habitat management, quantify potential of unoccupied habitat, assess connectivity modeling, and mitigate conflict, facilitating long-term species persistence.

AB  - We assessed the spatial extent at which the species-landscape relationship is strongest (i.e. the scale of effect-SE) on primate occurrence (Alouatta belzebul,Saguinus midas,Saimiri sciureus, andSapajus apellaandCebus olivaceus, the last two considered together in the analysis) and species richness and evaluated which landscape, patch, and human variables influence primate distribution in a savanna ecosystem in Brazil. We used nested buffers to measure the landscape attributes, and used these data to assess the SE of the species-landscape relationships. We explored the relative contributions of landscape, patch, and human variables to species richness and occurrences by using Generalized Linear Mixed Models and logistic regression. We found that the SE did not differ between primates, but did between two regions with different matrix composition. At the landscape level, occurrence of all species was higher as the distance to the nearest block of continuous forest decreased, but was lower as the amount of water bodies and anthropogenic cover in the matrix increased. The occurrence ofS. apella,C. olivaceusandA. belzebulwas positively related to forest cover, and all species butA. belzebulhad higher occurrence in taller forest. The occurrence ofS. apella,C. olivaceusandA. belzebuldecreased closer to the city, andS. apellaandC. olivaceuspresence increased with the number of residents. Richness was negatively related to the number of residents and anthropogenic cover, but positively to forest height. We concluded that conservation planning for primates should follow a "functional landscape" perspective, by maintaining higher forest cover and minimizing the anthropogenic alterations in the matrix.

AB  - Functional connectivity modeling is increasingly used to predict the best spatial location for over- or underpasses, to mitigate road barrier effects and wildlife roadkills. This tool requires estimation of resistance surfaces, ideally modeled with movement data, which are costly to obtain. An alternative is to use occurrence data within species distribution models to infer movement resistance, although this remains a controversial issue. This study aimed both to compare the performance of resistance surfaces derived from path versus occurrence data in identifying road-crossing locations of a forest carnivore and assess the influence of movement type (daily vs. dispersal) on this performance. Resistance surfaces were built for genet (Genetta genetta) in southern Portugal using path selection functions with telemetry data, and species distribution models with occurrence data. An independent roadkill dataset was used to evaluate the performance of each connectivity model in predicting roadkill locations. The results show that resistance surfaces derived from occurrence data are as suitable in predicting roadkills as path data for daily movements. When dispersal was simulated, the performance of both resistance surfaces was equally good at predicting roadkills. Moreover, contrary to our expectations, we found no significant differences in locations of roadkill predictions between models based on daily movements and models based on dispersal. Our results suggest that species distribution models are a cost-effective tool to build functional connectivity models for road mitigation plans when movement data are not available.

AB  - Aim To explore the usefulness of Spatially Explicit Population Models (SEPMs), incorporating dispersal, as tools for animal conservation, as illustrated by the contrasting cases of four British mammals.
   Methods For each of the four species (American mink, Mustela vison, pine marten, Martes martes, dormouse, Muscardinus avellanarius and water vole, Arvicola terrestris) a spatial dynamics model was developed based on an integrated geographical information system (GIS) population model that linked space use to the incidence of the species. Each model had, first, a GIS, which stored environmental, habitat and animal population information, and secondly, an individual-based population dynamics module, which simulated home range formation, individual life histories and dispersal within the GIS-held landscape.
   Results The four models illustrated different interactions between species life-history variables and the landscape, particularly with respect to dispersal. As water voles and dormice occupy home ranges that are small relative to blocks of their habitat, they were most effectively modelled in terms of the dynamics of local populations within habitat blocks but linked by dispersal. In contrast, because the home ranges of American mink and pine marten are large relative to blocks of habitat, they were best modelled as individuals moving through a landscape of more or less useful patches of habitat. For the water vole, the most significant predictors of population size were the carrying capacity of each habitat and the annual number of litters. For the dormouse, the likelihood of catastrophe and the upper limit to dispersal movement were the key variables determining persistence. Adult mortality and home-range size were the only significant partial correlates of total population size for the American mink. Adult mortality was also a significant correlate of total population size in the pine marten, as were litter size and juvenile mortality. In neither the marten nor the mink was dispersal distance a significant factor in determining their persistence in the landscape.
   Main conclusions At a landscape scale it is difficult to measure animal distributions directly and yet conservation planning often necessitates knowledge of where, and in what numbers, animals are found, and how their distributions will be affected by interventions. SEPMs offer a useful tool for predicting this, and for refining conservation plans before irreversible decisions are taken in practice.

AB  - Accurate estimates of species' distributions are needed to ensure that conservation-planning efforts are directed at appropriate areas. Since the early 1980s, temperate-breeding populations of Branta canadensis (Canada Goose) have increased, yet reliable estimates of the species' distribution are lacking in many regions. Our objective was to identify the landcover features that best predicted Canada Goose distribution. In April 2015, we surveyed 300 one-km(2) plots across North Carolina and observed 449 Canada Geese. We quantified percent coverage of 7 continuous landcover variables at 5 different spatial extents for each of the 300 plots. We fit logistic regression models using presence and absence at the 300 plots as the dependent variable and percent-cover covariates as independent variables. The best model for predicting Canada Goose presence included percent pasture within the 9 km(2) surrounding the survey plot and percent open water within the 1-km(2) survey plot. The probability of Canada Goose presence increased with increasing percent open water and percent pasture, albeit at different spatial extents, which provided important cover and food resources, respectively. Our approach using remote-sensing data to accurately predict Canada Goose presence across a large spatial extent can be employed to determine distributions for other easily surveyed, widely distributed species.

AB  - This study presents the results of the first broad-scale, spatial cumulative impact analysis (SCIA) conducted for colonial-nesting seabirds at-sea in eastern Canada. Species distribution models, based on at-sea tracking data for thirteen species/groups of seabirds (n = 520 individuals), were applied to over 5000 species-specific colonies to map relative abundance patterns across the entire region. This information was combined with distributional data for a number of key anthmpogenic threats to quantify exposure to fisheries, light and ship-source oil pollution, and marine traffic. As a final step, information about species-specific sensitivity to each threat was integrated to compute region-wide cumulative risk.
   The data products permit the visualization of the interaction between species and threats, and confirm that large portions of the coastal zones of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, as well as the Grand Banks shelf break, constitute areas where breeding seabirds experience the highest potential impact. The cumulative risk maps revealed that species which were either widespread throughout coastal areas (e.g., gulls), or capable of foraging long distance (Leach's Storm-Petrel), were most at risk. Cumulative risk maps help identify appropriate and potentially effective management and conservation actions, and are of value to federal regulators responsible for managing cumulative effects as part of the new Canadian Impact Assessment Act. They also can assist marine planners achieve the Aichi marine conservation targets as specified by the Convention on Biodiversity. By filling a knowledge gap for a large potion of the northwest Atlantic, these results help to counter the "shifting baselines syndrome".

AB  - Predicting the effects of fire on biota is important for biodiversity conservation in fire-prone landscapes. Time since fire is often used to predict the occurrence of fauna, yet for many species, it is a surrogate variable and it is temporal change in resource availability to which animals actually respond. Therefore prediction of fire fauna relationships will be uncertain if time since fire is not strongly related to resources. In this study, we used a space-for-time substitution across a large diverse landscape to investigate interrelationships between the occurrence of ground-dwelling mammals, time since fire, and structural resources. We predicted that much variation in habitat structure would remain unexplained by time since fire and that habitat structure would predict species' occurrence better than time since fire. In line with predictions, we found that time since fire was moderately correlated with habitat structure yet was a poor surrogate for mammal occurrence. Variables representing habitat structure were better predictors of occurrence than time since fire for all species considered. Our results suggest that time since fire is unlikely to be a useful surrogate for ground-dwelling mammals in heterogeneous landscapes. Faunal conservation in fire-prone landscapes will benefit from a combined understanding of fauna-resource relationships and the ways in which fire (including planned fires and wildfires) alters the spatial and temporal distribution of faunal resources.

AB  - We submitted tree species occurrence and geoclimatic data from 59 sites in a river basin in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil to ordination, ANOVA, and cluster analyses with the goals of investigating the causes of phytogeographic patterns and determining whether the six recognized subregions represent distinct floristic units. We found that both climate and space were significantly (p <= 0.05) important in the explanation of phytogeographic patterns. Floristic variations follow thermal gradients linked to elevation in both coastal and inland subregions. A gradient of precipitation seasonality was found to be related to floristic variation up to 100 km inland from the ocean. The temperature of the warmest quarter and the precipitation during the coldest quarter were the main predictors. The subregions Sandy Coastal Plain, Coastal Lowland, Coastal Highland, and Central Depression were recognized as distinct floristic units. Significant differences were not found between the Inland Highland and the Espinhaco Range, indicating that these subregions should compose a single floristic unit encompassing all interior highlands. Because of their ecological peculiarities, the ferric outcrops within the Espinhaco Range may constitute a special unit. The floristic units proposed here will provide important information for wiser conservation planning in the Atlantic Forest hotspot.

AB  - Understanding how birds select breeding sites plays an important role in habitat protection, especially for the conservation of endangered species. With the increase in population size of the endangered Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon, its distribution range has expanded from mountain areas to plains located outside protected areas, representing a new challenge for conservation of the species. Identifying the current nesting habitat requirements is thus needed and can provide valuable information for the planning of new nature reserves. In this research, we surveyed a total of 117 nests across the whole distribution range from 2015 to 2019. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to assess nesting preferences of the Crested Ibis in the wild. Results showed that in mountain areas, Masson pines Pinus massoniana were preferred (64.6%), whereas elms Ulmus pumila (44.9%) and aspens Populus davidiana (40.6%) were used more frequently lower down, probably because of their higher availability. In both mountain areas and plains the ibises selected tall nesting trees with larger diameter at breast height and preferred nesting rather high above ground, especially in plains where taller trees provided higher suitable nesting positions. The ibises also preferred nesting close to tree trunks, especially in mountain areas, probably for more safety from collapsing. Furthermore, in mountain areas, slope and distance to path had positive effects on nesting occurrence, and understorey coverage was avoided by nesting ibises, while these variables had little impact in plains. Our results indicate that, despite their range expansion, Crested Ibises rely on very specific habitat characteristics for nesting. We suggest relatively tall trees like elms and aspens should be preserved in plains. In addition, we highlight how selection patterns of Crested Ibises may vary, and that such variation should be addressed in conservation planning, especially in future reintroduction.

AB  - Understanding species' distributions often requires taking into consideration the characterization of the environment at different spatial scales. The habitat characteristics of the endangered fire salamander, S. infraimmaculata, have received little attention. In this study, at this species' most peripheral and xeric limit (Mt. Carmel, Israel), we examined predictors of the larval distribution of S. infraimmaculata at aquatic-breeding sites at both local and landscape scales. We investigated the predictive power of environmental variables using two methods: generalized linear models and conditional inference trees (CTREE). Both multi-model approaches yielded similar results. At the local site scale, hydroperiod predicted breeding site use. At the landscape scale, Salamandra presence was best predicted by proximity to other breeding sites. In addition, our study indicates that sites selected for breeding are far from roads and agricultural fields. Overall, this study demonstrates that ultimately, both local and landscape scale predictors are necessary to understand properly a species' habitat requirements and thus can help in planning future management around the breeding sites.

AB  - The European red click beetle, Elater ferrugineus L., is associated with wood mould in old hollow deciduous trees. As a result of severe habitat fragmentation caused by human disturbance, it is threatened throughout its distribution range. A new pheromone-based survey method, which is very efficient in detecting the species, was used in the present study to relate the occurrence of E. ferrugineus to the density of deciduous trees. The latter data were from a recently completed regional survey in SE Sweden recording >120,000 deciduous trees. The occurrence of E. ferrugineus increased with increasing amount of large hollow and large non-hollow trees in the surrounding landscape. Quercus robur (oak) was found to be the most important substrate for E. ferrugineus, whereas two groups of tree species (Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Ulmus glabra, vs. Acer platanoides, Aesculus hippocastanum, Fraxinus excelsior, Tilia cordata) were less important but may be a complement to oak in sustaining populations of the beetle. The occurrence of E. ferrugineus was explained by the density of oaks at two different spatial scales, within the circle radii 327 m and 4658 m. In conclusion, priority should be given to oaks in conservation management of E. ferrugineus, and then to the deciduous trees in the genera listed above. Conservation planning at large spatial and temporal scales appears to be essential for long-term persistence of E. ferrugineus. We also show that occurrence models based on strategic sampling might result in pessimistic predictions. This study demonstrates how pheromone-based monitoring make insects excellent tools for sustained feedback to models for landscape conservation management.

AB  - Dendrocygna javanica (Horsfield, 1821) is a species of bird that lives in the South, Southeast and South Asian regions, especially on the islands of Kalimantan, Java and Sumatra, Indonesia. D. javanica is a member of the genus Dendrocygna and the Anatidae family with a unique characteristic-making a continuous sound when flying and therefore often called the Lesser Whistling Teal. This study aims to predict the distribution model of D. javanica in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The study area ranges from the districts of Central Tapanuli, Mandailing Natal, Medan, Langkat, Deli Serdang, Tebing Tinggi, Tanjung Balai, Asahan, and Siantar. A total of 35 points obtained from the study area were analyzed using the Maximum Entropy 3.4.0 application. The environmental variables used in this analysis are global elevation, global land, solar radiation, bioclims, global aspects, precipitation, temperature, water vapor pressure, and wind speed. The Jacknife test is used to evaluate important variables for predicting the distribution model. The resulting MaxEnt model has high accuracy with a significant AUC value of 0.968. The distribution model approach using MaxEnt can promise the potential distribution of D. javanica in North Sumatra so that it can be used as an effective tool in planning bird conservation.

   Using New Zealand land snails as a case study, we evaluated recent spatial modelling approaches for the analysis of diversity in species-rich invertebrate groups. Applications and prospects for improved conservation assessment were investigated.
   Location
   New Zealand.
   Methods
   The study used a spatially extensive and taxonomically comprehensive, plot-based dataset on community structure in New Zealand land snails. Generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction (GRASP) was used to model and predict species richness as a function of environmental variables (including aspects of climate, soils and vegetation). Generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM) was used to model turnover in species composition in relation to environmental and geographical distances, and to assess community similarity and the representativeness of the reserve network.
   Results
   Observed land snail richness in 20 x 20 m plots ranged from 1 to 74 (mean 17.5). The GRASP model explained a modest 27% of the variation in richness. The GDM model explained 57% of the variation in species turnover and indicated approximately equal amounts related to environmental (Cody's beta diversity) and geographical distance (Cody's gamma diversity). Temperature and moisture were the most important environmental variables. Results indicate that snail distributions are not only sorted by environment but are also strongly influenced by historical effects consistent with those expected of poorly dispersing taxa that have persisted in refugia during past climatic change. The GDM model enabled spatial classifications of snail communities, highlighting diverse communities in heterogeneous regions, such as the South Island mountains, and also enabled continuous depictions of community similarity and adequacy of New Zealand's protected natural areas network.
   Main conclusions
   The GRASP and GDM analyses allowed us to model and depict spatial patterns of diversity in land snail communities involving 845 species, and produce community classifications and estimates of community similarity. These tools advance conservation assessment in species-rich groups, but require further conceptual and methodological development.

AB  - Human modification and habitat fragmentation significantly impact large carnivores requiring large, connected habitats to persist in a landscape. Understanding species responses to such change and the protection of critical areas and connectivity they provide is essential when planning effective conservation strategies. Our study examines the spatial distribution of the snow leopard (Panthera uncia) across a gradient of protection status, anthropogenic pressures and habitat types in the Gangotri landscape (similar to 4600 km(2)), Western Himalaya. Using spatial capture-recapture modeling, we analyzed a 4-year camera trapping dataset (2015-2019) to assess the relationship between snow leopard movement and topography and identified the conducible areas for facilitating movement across the landscape. Snow leopard density was positively associated with elevation and slope, and was higher in protected areas (summer: 1.42 SE 0.02/100km(2); winter 2.15 SE 0.03 vs. summer: 0.4 SE 0.01; winter: 0.6 SE 0.01 for unprotected areas). Precipitous terrain and several prominent mountain peaks were found to be resistant to snow leopard movement. Even with a range of human activities inside protected areas, the higher density suggests a positive impact of protection. Density-weighted connectivity showed that conducible areas are available between the Gangotri landscape and the adjacent protected areas. However, compared to protected area, these areas are relatively less used and require attention for management. We recommend regulating human activities and co-managing pastures with local communities to revive prey base outside protected areas, especially in corridors, to ensure such areas are functionally conducive. Our study provides a framework to collectively quantitate the spatial pattern of abundance, distribution and connectivity. Our approach has broad applicability for policymakers to develop strategic plans for balancing the conservation of species, and other land uses in a multiuse landscape.

AB  - The study of species' response is a key to understand the ecology of a species (e.g. critical habitat requirement and biological invasion processes) and design better conservation and management plans (e.g. problem identification, priority assessment and risk analysis). Predictive machine learning methods can be used as a tool for modeling species distributions as well as for describing important variables and specific habitat conditions required for a target species. This study aims (1) to demonstrate how habitat information such as species response curves can be retrieved from a species distribution model (SDM), (2) to assess the effects of data prevalence on model accuracy and habitat information retrieved from SDMs, and (3) to illustrate the differences between three data-driven methods, namely a fuzzy habitat suitability model (FHSM), random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVMs). Nineteen sets of virtual species data with different data prevalences were generated using field observed habitat conditions and hypothetical habitat suitability curves under four interaction scenarios governing the species-environment relationship for a virtual species. The effects of data prevalence on species distribution modeling were evaluated based on model accuracy and habitat information such as species response curves. Data prevalence affected both model accuracy and the assessment of species' response, with a stronger influence on the latter. The effects of data prevalence on model accuracy were less pronounced in the case of RF and SVMs which showed a higher performance. While the response curves were similar among the three models, data prevalence markedly affected the shapes of the response curves. Specifically, response curves obtained from a data set with higher prevalence showed higher tolerance to unsuitable habitat conditions, emphasizing the importance of accounting for data prevalence in the assessment of species-environment relationships. In a practical implementation of an SDM, data prevalence should be taken into account when interpreting the model results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological connectivity depends on key elements within the landscape, which can support ecological fluxes, species richness and long-term viability of a biological community. Landscape planning requires clear aims and quantitative approaches to identify which key elements can reinforce the spatial coherence of protected areas design. We aim to explore the probability of the ecological connectivity of forest remnants and amphibian species distributions for current and future climate scenarios across the Central Corridor of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Integrating amphibian conservation, climate change and ecological corridors, we design a landscape ranking based on graph and circuit theories. To identify the sensitivity of connected areas to climate-dependent changes, we use the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate by means of simulations for 2080-2100, representing a moderated emission scenario within an optimistic context. Our findings indicate that more than 70% of forest connectivity loss by climate change may drastically reduce amphibian dispersal in this region. We show that high amphibian turnover rates tend to be greater in the north-eastern edges of the corridor across ensembles of forecasts. Our spatial analysis reveals a general pattern of low-conductance areas in landscape surface, yet with some well-connected patches suggesting potential ecological corridors. Atlantic Forest reserves are expected to be less effective in a near future. For improved conservation outcomes, we recommend some landscape paths with low resistance values across space and time. We highlight the importance of maintaining forest remnants in the southern Bahia region by drafting a blueprint for functional biodiversity corridors.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The unique geography of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, USA has promoted a flora with exceptional endemism that may face high rates of extinction due to climate change. The Olympic Mountains provide an unparalleled opportunity to test predicted responses in topographically complex environments and inform conservation plans for threatened alpine taxa.
   METHODS: We estimated the potential impact of climate change for five endemic alpine plants of the Olympic Peninsula. We used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to visualize changes in climate niche-space in the alpine zone and the exposure of the endemics to changing conditions. We then constructed climate and topographic-based Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to estimate changes in the distribution of habitat for each taxon.
   KEY RESULTS: The Olympic alpine zone will experience novel environmental conditions in the future, with a pronounced decrease in winter snow and an increase in growing-season moisture stress. When topography was taken into account, the losses were more dramatic than the impact of climate alone. Indeed, 85-99% of the suitable habitat will be lost for each of the five focal taxa by 2080, with thermal refugia remaining only on the highest peaks of the eastern Olympics.
   CONCLUSIONS:The Olympic alpine endemics are stranded on ever-shrinking habitat islands. Within a few, isolated thermal refugia, the distribution of micro-topography may be a critical factor in determining long-term survival.The Olympic Mountains and their alpine taxa are a model system for endemics worldwide, illustrating the biogeographic characteristics that underpin vulnerability to climate change.

AB  - We estimated the current location, quality, and connectivity of habitat for 50 species of breeding birds in four mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander, Nye, and Eureka Counties, Nevada) and projected the future location, quality, and connectivity of habitat for these species given different scenarios of climate-induced land-cover change. In the United States, such models are relevant to federally mandated management of wild animals by state-level agencies. We sampled birds during the breeding seasons of 2001-2009 with fixed-radius point counts. For each species, we used boosted regression trees to model incidence (proportion of years a location was surveyed in which the species was present) as a function of topography and current land cover and climate. To assess model fit, we calculated the proportion of binomial deviance explained. We used cross-validation to estimate the predictive accuracy of the models. We applied the conservation planning program Zonation to identify locations where incidences of multiple species were maximized through time given current land cover and two scenarios of land-cover change, expansion of pinyon-juniper woodland into sagebrush shrubsteppe and contraction of riparian woodland. Models based on a set of 13 covariates derived from remotely sensed data had some predictive capacity for 41 of 50 species. Model outputs suggested substantial changes in amount of habitat for many species following projected expansion of pinyon-juniper woodland, but less pronounced changes following projected contraction of riparian woodland. Zonation analyses indicated that the spatial distribution of the highest-quality habitat for the avian assemblage was relatively consistent through time under both scenarios. Breeding birds in the Great Basin commonly are grouped in management plans on the basis of their general association with land-cover classes such as pinyon-juniper woodland, sagebrush shrubsteppe, and riparian woodland. However, even within these groups, the environmental attributes that explained a high proportion of variation in species' incidences and the projected responses to different scenarios of land-cover change varied considerably among species.

AB  - Loggerhead turtles are a globally vulnerable species of marine turtle. Broad-scale patterns of distribution and abundance can provide regional managers a tool to effectively conserve and manage this species at basin and sub-basin scales. In this study, combined aerial and shipboard line transect survey data collected between 2003 and 2018 were used to estimate distribution and abundance throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Approximately 230,000 linear kilometers of survey effort, from seven different surveying organizations were incorporated into a generalized additive model to relate loggerhead density on survey segments to environmental conditions. Two spatial density models estimating loggerhead density, abundance, and distribution were generated - one a long-term annual average covering 2003-2018 and another covering the summer of 2018, when a basin-wide aerial survey, the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area Survey Initiative, was performed. Both models were adjusted for availability bias using dive data from loggerhead turtles tagged with time depth recorders. Mean abundance for the long-term average model was estimated as 1,201,845 (CV=0.22). The summer 2018 abundance estimate was 789,244 turtles and covered a smaller area than the long-term average. These estimates represent the first basin-wide estimates of abundance for loggerhead turtles in the Mediterranean not based on demographic models. Both models predicted similar distributions, with higher abundance predicted in the northern Adriatic Sea, central Mediterranean basin, Tyrrhenian Sea, and south of the Balearic Islands. Lower densities were predicted in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea. The highest density areas generally did not coincide with previously established adult loggerhead turtle foraging areas, which are typically neritic, indicating the models are predominantly predicting oceanic distributions, where most of the survey effort occurred. Juvenile loggerhead turtles are predominantly oceanic and comprise most of the population, but care must be taken when using these models as they may not accurately predict distribution of neritic foraging areas, where subadult and adult loggerheads can often be found. Despite this limitation, these models represent a major step forward for conservation planning and understanding basin-wide distribution and abundance patterns of this species.

AB  - Large herbivores and carnivores today often only occupy small fractions of their former ranges, and restoring them is a conservation priority. Reintroductions may serve two critical goals in this context: (1) to expand and connect existing populations, or (2) to increase the number of separate populations as insurance in case individual populations are lost, for example, to disease. We developed an approach to identify reintroduction sites for both purposes, using an applied example of European bison or wisent (Bison bonasus) in Poland. Using a large occurrence dataset from all extant herds in Poland, we mapped suitable wisent habitats throughout Poland using a species distribution modelling approach. We identified 47 patches of suitable habitat, together covering 20,710 km(2), and used graph theory tools to identify the top candidate reintroduction sites for (1) connecting existing herds into larger metapopulations or (2) establishing 'reservoir' herds that could serve as a backup in case of mass die-offs. The most well-connected habitat patches ranged between 203 and 728 km(2) and occurred mainly in north-western and south-eastern Poland, in close vicinity to other free-ranging herds. In contrast, candidate sites for reservoir herds were smaller (204-410 km(2)) and occurred mainly in central Poland. Our approach provides a possible blueprint for wisent reintroductions in Poland. More broadly, our work also highlights how jointly planning for multiple conservation goals for wide-ranging species that depend on reintroductions or translocations can be achieved at the regional scale.

AB  - Climate change is expected to alter the structure and functions of an ecosystem including species composition and its geographical distribution. There is limited understanding on how the habitat of the Himalayan range-restricted species would be affected under the influence of climate change. In the present study, we model the climate change impacts on habitat suitability of western tragopan (Tragopan melanocephalus), a range-restricted and vulnerable bird species in the Indian western Himalayas. The climate change scenarios of IPCC represented by representative concentration pathways (RCPs) viz. RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5 were considered for assessing the habitat suitability for the year 2050 and 2070. Most influencial variables that may be linked to habitat suitability of Tragopan, such as bioclimatic variables, land use (forest cover and forest type), soil characteristics, and topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, heat load index) were considered to develop a model using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm. MaxEnt is a widely used and accepted tool for modeling species distribution. The model's performance for mapping habitat was evaluated by the Area Under Curve (AUC) (AUC > 90%). The measured TSS value 0.98 and Kappa value 0.71 were elaborated for the aptness of the model for suitable habitat mapping. It was observed that the suitable habitat of the western tragopan would shift towards higher elevations under all RCPs. The study would benefit to biodiversity conservators and policymaker for formulating future strategy and planning for conservation and management of the Himalayan range-restricted bird species. The approach of this study could be replicated with other range-restricted Himalayan bird species for future projections of suitable habitat.

AB  - Understanding habitat quality and landscape connectivity and exploring corridors connecting habitat patches are crucial for conservation, particularly for species distributed among isolated populations. The Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey, Rhinopithecus roxellana, is an Endangered primate species endemic to mountainous forests in China. Its easternmost distribution lies in the Shennongjia area, which harbors an isolated subspecies, R. roxellana hubeiensis. Unfortunately, it has experienced significant habitat loss, fragmentation, and dramatic population decline in recent decades, primarily due to increased human disturbance. To quantify habitat quality, identify suitable habitat patches, and detect possible linkages among these patches for R. roxellana hubeiensis, we conducted habitat suitability assessments and landscape connectivity analyses in the Shennongjia area based on a set of environmental factors. We created a habitat quality model and a movement cost surface for the Shennongjia area based on a habitat suitability index, graph theory, expert knowledge, field experience, and information from the literature. Our results show that suitable habitat for R. roxellana hubeiensis in Shennongjia is fragmented and limited, and that this is particularly true for highly suitable habitats. We detected six core habitat patches and six least-cost paths and corridors. Our study does not provide accurate distributions of the monkeys and their habitat use. However, it identifies the most feasible and traversable habitats and corridors, which should be conservation priorities for this subspecies, and provides valuable guidance for reevaluating habitat conservation plans.

AB  - Species distribution data are essential to understanding and protecting biodiversity against current human threats. However, biodiversity knowledge is unevenly distributed geographically and needs to be evaluated to target deficient knowledge locations and support conservation planning. In this study, we intend to assess the inventory completeness of the vascular epiphytes from the Atlantic Forest, in addition to: comparing the sampling effort between (i) phytophysiognomies, (ii) epiphyte taxa, and quantifying (iii) spatial and (iv) environmental biases. We used the average of the last 10% of Species Accumulation Curves (SAC) as the inventory completeness and quantified their spatial biases using Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) models. We evaluated the environmental biases using the Mann-Whitney U test. We found that most epiphyte inventories in the Atlantic Forest are undersampled, with well-sampled inventories concentrated on the southeastern coast; thus, Ombrophilous forests are better sampled than other phytophysiognomies. These well-sampled inventories are spatially biased mainly in large forest cover, protected and low agricultural coverage areas. In addition, epiphytes were more collected in regions environmentally associated with high diversity, such as areas with low temperature, high rainfall and altitudes. More conspicuous and richer groups had the highest sampling coverage, but the lowest effort when compared to poor groups. In order to reduce the gaps, we suggest that future inventories focus on the continental portion of the Atlantic Forest, since these areas are already highly threatened by land-use and have large Wallacean shortfalls for all epiphyte taxa. Therefore, enabling future researchers to propose efficient conservation actions in these priority areas.

AB  - The use of species occurrence as a proxy for habitat type is widespread, probably because it allows the use of species distribution modeling (SDM) to cost-effectively map the distribution of e.g., vulnerable marine ecosystems. We have modeled the distribution of epibenthic megafaunal taxa typical of soft-bottom, Deep-Sea Sponge Aggregations (DSSAs), i.e., "indicators," to discover where in the Barents Sea region this habitat is likely to occur. The following taxa were collectively modeled: Hexadella cf. dedritifera, Geodia spp., Steletta sp., Stryphnus sp. The data were extracted from MarVid, the video database for the Marine AREAI database for NOrwegian waters (MAREANO). We ask whether modeling density data may be more beneficial than presence/absence data, and whether using this list of indicator species is enough to locate the target habitat. We use conditional inference forests to make predictions of probability of presence of any of the target sponges, and total density of all target sponges, for an area covering a large portion of the Norwegian Barents Sea and well beyond the data's spatial range. The density models explain <31% of the variance, and the probability models have high classificatory power (AUC > 0.88), depending on the variables/samples used to train the model. The predicted surfaces were then classified on the basis of a probability threshold (0.75) and a density threshold (13 n/100 m(2)) to obtain polygons of "core area" and "hotspots" respectively (zones). The DSSA core area comprises two main regions: the Egga shelf break/Tromsoflaket area, and the shelf break southwest of Rost bank in the Traena trench. Four hotspots are detected within this core area. Zones are evaluated in the light of whole-community data which have been summarized as taxon richness and density of all megafauna. Total megafaunal density was significantly higher inside the hotspots relative to the background. Richness was not different between zones. Hotspots appeared different to one another in their richness and species composition although no tests were possible. We make the case that the effectiveness of the indicator species approach for conservation planning rests on the availability of density data on the target species, and data on co-occurring species.

AB  - Wildlife management in rapid changing landscapes requires critical planning through cross cutting networks, and understanding of landscape features, often affected by the anthropogenic activities. The present study demonstrates fine-scale spatial patterns of genetic variation and contemporary gene flow of red panda (Ailurus fulgens) populations with respect to landscape connectivity in Kangchenjunga Landscape (KL), India. The study found about 1,309.54 km(2) area suitable for red panda in KL-India, of which 62.21% area fell under the Protected Area network. We identified 24 unique individuals from 234 feces collected at nine microsatellite loci. The spatially explicit and non-explicit Bayesian clustering algorithms evident to exhibit population structuring and supported red panda populations to exist in meta-population frame work. In concurrence to the habitat suitability and landscape connectivity models, gene flow results supported a contemporary asymmetric movement of red panda by connecting KL-India in a crescent arc. We demonstrate the structural-operational connectivity of corridors in KL-India that facilitated red panda movement in the past. We also seek for cooperation in Nepal, Bhutan and China to aid in preparing for a comprehensive monitoring plan for the long-term conservation and management of red panda in trans-boundary landscapes.

AB  - Conservation and recovery of species of concern necessitates evaluating forest habitat conditions under changing climate conditions, especially in the early stages of the delisting process. Managers must weigh implications of near-term habitat management activities within the context of changing environmental conditions and a species' biological traits that may influence their vulnerability to changing conditions. Here we applied established population-habitat relationships based on decades of monitoring and research-management collaborations for the Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) to project potential impacts of changing environmental conditions to breeding habitat distribution, quantity, and quality in the near future. Kirtland's warblers are habitat-specialists that nest exclusively within dense jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forests between ca. 5-20 years of age. Using Random Forests to predict changes in distribution and growth rate of jack pine under future scenarios, results indicate the projected distribution of jack pine will contract considerably (ca. 75%) throughout the Lake States region, U.S.A. in response to projected environmental conditions in 2099 under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios regardless of climate model. Reduced suitability for jack pine regeneration across the Lake States may constrain management options, especially for creating high stem-density plantations nesting habitat. However, conditions remain suitable for jack pine regeneration within their historical and current core breeding range in northern Lower Michigan and several satellite breeding areas. Projected changes in jack pine growth rates varied within the core breeding area, but altered growth rates did not greatly alter the duration that habitat remained suitable for nesting by the Kirtland's Warblers. These findings contribute to Kirtland's Warbler conservation by informing habitat spatial planning of plantation management to provide a constant supply of nesting habitat based on the spatial variability of potential loss or gain of lands environmentally suitable for regenerating jack pine in the long-term.

AB  - In polar environments, a lack of empirical knowledge about biodiversity prompts reliance on species distribution models to predict future change, yet these ignore the role of biotic interactions including the role of long past human exploitation. To explore how mammals of extreme elevation respond to glacial recession and past harvest, we combined our fieldwork with remote sensing and used analyses of,60 expeditions from 1850-1925 to represent baseline conditions for wildlife before heavy exploitation on the Tibetan Plateau. Focusing on endangered wild yaks (Bos mutus), we document female changes in habitat use across time whereupon they increasingly relied on steeper post-glacial terrain, and currently have a 20x greater dependence on winter snow patches than males. Our twin findings-that the sexes of a cold-adapted species respond differently to modern climate forcing and long-past exploitation-indicate that effective conservation planning will require knowledge of the interplay between past and future if we will assure persistence of the region's biodiversity.

AB  - Assessing landscape connectivity allows us to identify critical areas that impede or facilitate the movement of organisms and their genes and to plan their conservation and management. In this article, we assessed landscape connectivity and ecological condition of the habitat patches of a highly biodiverse region in Chiapas, Mexico. We employed data of three cracid species with different characteristics in habitat use and mobility. The habitat map of each species was derived from a spatial intersection of the models of potential distribution and a high-resolution map of current land cover and land use. The ecological condition of vegetation types was evaluated using 75 field plots. Structure of landscape was estimated by fragmentation metrics, while functional connectivity was assessed using spatially explicit graph analysis. The extent of suitable habitat for Oreophasis derbianus, Penelopina nigra, and Penelope purpurascens correspond to 25%, 46%, and 55% of the study area (5,185.6 km(2)), respectively. Although the pine-oak forests were the most fragmented vegetation type, habitats of the three species were well connected, and only 4% to 9% of the fragments located on the periphery of the corridor had low connectivity. Landscape connectivity depends mainly on land uses with an intermediate and lower ecological condition (secondary forests and coffee agroforestry systems). Therefore, we suggest that in addition to promoting the improvement in connectivity in fragmented forests, conservation efforts should be aimed at preventing the conversion of mature forests into agricultural uses and maintaining agroforestry systems.

AB  - Habitat loss is a critical factor driving extinction of biodiversity worldwide, with models of future land use anticipating increases in rates of destruction of native habitats worldwide. The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is a red-listed species with a broad geographic range that has been fragmented dramatically by land use change. Remaining populations of U. thibetanus occupy diverse habitats, ranging from highlands to coastal regions. We integrated ecological niche models (ENMs) with nighttime satellite imagery to identify areas suitable for U. thibetanus after anthropogenic alteration. We found that at least 10% of the potential distributional area for the species is not suitable owing to urban or suburban encroachment. U. thibetanus seems to persist in highland areas, characterized by low temperature and high precipitation, whereas humans concentrate in lowlands and less-extreme climatic conditions. ENMs based solely on climate frequently overestimate suitable areas available for species; nighttime light imagery offers a robust alternative to refining estimates of species' ranges, designing protected areas and corridors, prioritizing threatened species, and determining areas of human-wildlife conflict across broad areas. Our approach is transferable to other taxa and contexts, and should be considered in conservation planning and policy implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Models that predict the distributions and habitat suitability for species of conservation concern can be useful for guiding survey, monitoring, and conservation planning efforts. The Humboldt marten (Martes caurina humboldtensis) has significantly declined throughout its historical range in coastal California and Oregon and this taxon is known from a few remnant populations. We developed a landscape habitat suitability model to identify areas of suitable habitat not yet surveyed, to provide a template for designing monitoring programs and research studies, and to inform the development of a conservation strategy. We used the results of 1,159 occupancy surveys to develop a predictive habitat model using Generalized Additive Modeling to relate Humboldt marten detections to combinations of environmental and habitat attributes hypothesized to influence marten distribution. We measured 30 candidate variables at three spatial scales, using 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 km, and although several models were competitive, each contained the same three core variables: old growth structural index measured at the 1-km scale, serpentine habitat measured at the 3-km scale, and annual precipitation measured at the 3-km scale. The final model had an overall correct classification rate of 91% for marten detections, 82% for non-detections and a true skill statistic of 0.73. Model predictions were stable when cross-validated, with the correct classification of marten detections (89%) varying little. The largest complexes of predicted suitable habitat occurred in the areas with the three extant marten populations (north coastal California, south coastal Oregon, and central coastal Oregon), however connectivity of suitable habitat to areas outside these three areas appears limited.

AB  - The basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) is an endangered species in the north-east Atlantic, having been historically over exploited. Whilst near-shore aggregation hotspots in the UK have been identified, robust knowledge on species distribution and abundance outside these areas remains limited. Research techniques, such as habitat modelling, could however be used to gain a greater knowledge of the species distribution to inform management plans to aid population recovery. For large mobile species gathering wide-scale distribution data can be financially and logistically challenging. In lieu of conducting an expensive UK-wide strategic survey for basking sharks, we use data from two regional-scale surveys, which were conducted in southwest England and western Scotland, in an Ensemble Ecological Niche Model (EENM) to produce a spatially-explicit map of habitat suitability. When compared against a similar to 20-year database of public sightings of basking sharks across UK coastal seas (to 6 nautical miles offshore), patterns of habitat suitability yielded a statistically significant agreement with areas known to support basking shark sightings. EENMs could be used to advise Marine Protected Area (MPA) selection, as well as to inform environmental impact assessments for offshore developments. The application of EENM outputs could be wide-reaching and benefit not only basking sharks but other large mobile marine species in the north-east Atlantic.

AB  - Hotspot analysis is a commonly used method in ecology and conservation to identify areas of high biodiversity or conservation concern. However, delineating and mapping hotspots is subjective and various approaches can lead to different conclusions with regard to the classification of particular areas as hotspots, complicating long-term conservation planning. We present a comparative analysis of recent approaches for identifying waterbird hotspots, with the goal of developing insights about the appropriate use of these methods. We selected four commonly used measures to identify persistent areas of high use: kernel density estimation, Getis-Ord G(i)*, hotspot persistence and hotspots conditional on presence, which represent the range of quantitative hotspot estimation approaches used in waterbird analyses. We applied each of the methods to aerial survey waterbird count data collected in the Great Lakes from 2012-2014. For each approach, we identified areas of high use for seven species/species groups and then compared the results across all methods and to mean effort-corrected counts. Our results indicate that formal hotspot analysis frameworks do not always lead to the same conclusions. The kernel density and Getis-Ord G(i)* methods yielded the most similar results across all species analysed and were generally correlated with mean effort-corrected count data. We found that these two models can differ substantially from the hotspot persistence and hotspots conditional on presence estimation approaches, which were not consistently similar to one another. The hotspot persistence approach differed most significantly from the other methods but is the only method to explicitly account for temporal variation. We recommend considering the ecological question and scale of conservation or management activities prior to designing survey methodologies. Deciding the appropriate definition and scale for analysis is critical for interpretation of hotspot analysis results as is inclusion of important covariates. Combining hotspot analysis methods using an integrative approach, either within a single analysis or post hoc, could lead to greater consistency in the identification of waterbird hotspots.

AB  - Despite some populations of European wildcat Felis silvestris in central Europe are stable or increasing, the Iberian subpopulation is in decline and is listed as 'vulnerable'. In Portugal, little is known about wildcat populations, making conservation policies extremely difficult to define. Furthermore, the secretive behaviour of these mammals, along with low population densities, make data collection complicated. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical tools to interpret existing data for this species. In this study, we determine the home-range size and environmental factors related to wildcat spatial ecology in a Mediterranean ecosystem using a combined analysis of habitat selection and maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling. Simultaneously, we test the feasibility of using radio-tracking locations to construct an ecologically meaningful distribution model. Six wildcats were captured and tracked. The average home-range size (MCP95) was 2.28 km(2) for females and 13.71 km(2) for one male. The Maxent model built from radio-tracking locations indicated that the abundance of the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and limited human disturbance were the most important correlates of wildcat presence. Habitat selection analysis revealed that wildcats tend to use scrubland areas significantly more than expected by chance. A mosaic of scrublands and agricultural areas, with a higher proportion of the former, benefits wildcat presence in the study area; however, species distribution is mainly constrained by availability of prey and resting sites. The Maxent model validation with camera-trapping data indicated that highly adequate model performance. This technique may prove useful for recovering small radio-tracking datasets as it provides a new alternative for handling data and maximizing the ecological information on a target population, which can then be used for conservation planning.

AB  - Globally, elevated extinction risk in mammals is strongly associated with large body size. However, in regions where introduced predators exert strong top-down pressure on mammal populations, the selectivity of extinctions may be skewed towards species of intermediate body size, leading to a hump-shaped relationship between size and extinction risk. The existence of this kind of extinction pattern, and its link to predation, has been contentious and difficult to demonstrate. Here, we test the hypothesis of a hump-shaped body size-extinction relationship, using a database of 927 island mammal populations. We show that the size-selectivity of extinctions on many islands has exceeded that expected under null models. On islands with introduced predators, extinctions are biased towards intermediate body sizes, but this bias does not occur on islands without predators. Hence, on islands with a large-bodied mammal fauna, predators are selectively culling species from the lower end of the size distribution, and on islands with a small-bodied fauna they are culling species from the upper end. These findings suggest that it will be difficult to use predictable generalizations about extinction patterns, such as a positive body size-extinction risk association, to anticipate future species declines and plan conservation strategies accordingly.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems support biological communities with high species richness and conservation interest. However, these ecosystems are highly altered by human intervention and threatened worldwide, making them a priority in conservation planning and biodiversity monitoring. Bryophytes, including several conservation-interest taxa, are recognized indicators of ecological status in freshwaters. We aimed to develop a framework for designing monitoring networks to detect trends in aquatic and semi-aquatic bryophyte communities, prioritizing high-conservation interest communities in different contexts of human pressure (specifically, resulting from the intersection of two criteria: (i) protection status and (ii) presence of a potential impact area).
   The framework consists of three steps: (1) Spatial modelling of biodiversity; (2) Spatial conservation prioritization; and (3) Model-assisted monitoring network design. Community-level modelling was used to model the distribution of the main bryophyte assemblages in the study area. A conservation prioritization software was utilized to identify areas with high conservation value. The monitoring network was designed using stratified random sampling and unequal-probability sampling techniques to target high conservation value sites distributed across different contexts of human pressure.
   We have identified four distinct community types, each characterized both by a small group of common and dominant species, and by small group of rarer, conservation-interest species. This typification of four species assemblages occurring in the study area, also highlighted those with potentially higher conservation-interest. The most valuable areas for the conservation of aquatic and semi-aquatic bryophyte communities coincide with specific environmental zones: mountainous areas in Lusitania, large watercourses in the Mediterranean North and some locations in the Mediterranean Mountains. Finally, we obtained a potential monitoring network consisting of 64 monitoring points, unequally distributed across different contexts of human pressure, privileging locations with higher conservation value.
   The framework presented here illustrates the potential of combining biodiversity modelling, spatial conservation prioritization and monitoring design in the development of monitoring networks. Namely, this framework allowed us to counter data deficiencies, to identify high priority areas to monitor and to design a monitoring network considering different scenarios of human pressure at a regional scale.
   This framework can also be valuable for conservation efforts as an approach to monitoring conservation-interest biodiversity features in anthropogenically modified riverscapes, which present different degrees of human pressure and the cumulative effects of these different impact elements. Moreover, this approach allows for the comprehensive monitoring of biodiversity values important for management at the national and regional levels. In addition, this framework is one of the first efforts in the development of monitoring networks that target aquatic and semi-aquatic bryophyte communities, a long-neglected plant group of high ecological and conservation importance in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Soil nutrient content plays a key role in plant growth through mineral nutrition and toxicity. Its impact on plant species and community distribution is studied on a large geographical scale through surrogates like topography or geology. We investigated the importance of soil pH and C:N ratio, as direct nutritional gradients, to determine, with climatic factors, the spatial distribution of plant communities over large territories.
   We studied the distribution of six beech habitats of the NATURA 2000 network throughout France (550,000 km(2)).
   Models were calibrated with 2108 floristic plots classified in the NATURA 2000 system and including climatic and topographic variables and soil nutritional measurements carried out in a laboratory. Logistic regression was used to model habitat distribution according to environmental variables. Climatic layers, a digital elevation model and maps of soil pH and nitrogen content, created using plant indicator values and large floristic databases, were used to map the sites suitable for beech communities. Distribution models were evaluated with an independent set of 2091 phytosociological plots.
   pH and nitrogen supply were the key distribution drivers for four of the six beech communities on a national scale. Their use in the distribution models distinguished within homogeneous climatic territories a gradient of nutritional conditions from acidic areas, suitable for nutrient-poor beech communities, to calcareous areas suitable for nutrient-rich ones. Predicted maps of beech habitats fit the spatial distribution of validation plots.
   Soil pH and nitrogen supply strongly improve predictions of forest community distribution carried out with climatic variables on a broad geographical scale. They allow delineation of areas with nutritional conditions suitable for each community, as well as the realization of predictive high-resolution maps over large areas useful for sustainable and conservation management.

AB  - Temperate forests of Chile exhibit high biodiversity, which generates a wide range of habitats for wildlife. These valuable natural ecosystems have been affected by major natural and anthropogenic processes that have reduced habitats, resulting in serious ecological problems, given both the high endemism of certain avian groups in these forests and the complexity of their habitat selection. Continued degradation and ecosystem problems could lead to the extinction of such groups. In spite of this possibility, ecologically valuable wildlife conservation is seldom integrated into forest management decision-making processes. This study aims to integrate wildlife into forest management, identifying potential habitats for two endemic birds of high ecological value, the Black throated Huet-Huet (Pteroptochos tamii), and the Ochre-flanked Tapaculo (Eugralla paradoxa). Both species inhabit an ecotonal area between evergreen and sclerophyllous forests, making them high-quality bio-indicator species for the degree of conservation of temperate forest. The integration of environmental information and a geostatistical model based on the criterion of maximum entropy (Maxent model) identifies the most important variables that explain the presence of each species. Pteroptochos tamii is less restrictive in its choice of habitat than Eugralla paradoxa, requiring merely certain topographical condition (elevation, ground slope and aspect). However Eugralla paradoxa requires not only the same topographical features, but also eco-geographical characteristics such as distance to trails, waterways and ecotones. Maxent analysis showed that for both species, the model most capable of predicting their choice of microhabitat was not random based, but rather one based on topographical and environmental variables. The integration of Maxent and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools could help to solve problems of wildlife habitat conservation and forest planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species distribution models for marine organisms are increasingly used for a range of applications, including spatial planning, conservation, and fisheries management. These models have been constructed using a variety of mathematical forms and drawing on both physical and biological independent variables; however, what might be called first-generation models have mainly followed the form of linear models, or smoothing splines, informed by data collected in the context of fish surveys.
   The performance of different classes of variables were tested in a series of species occurrence models built with machine learning methods, specifically evaluating the potential contribution of lower trophic level data. Random forest models were fitted based on the classification of the absence/presence for fish and macroinvertebrates surveyed on the US Northeast Continental Shelf.
   The potential variables included physical, primary production, secondary production, and terrain variables. For accepted model fits, six variable importance measures were computed, which collectively showed that physical and secondary production variables make the greatest contribution across all models. In contrast, terrain variables made the least contribution to these models.
   Multivariable analyses that account for all performance measures reinforce the role of water depth and temperature in defining species presence and absence; however, chlorophyll concentration and some specific zooplankton taxa, such as Metridia lucens and Paracalanus parvus, also make important contributions with strong seasonal variations.
   Our results suggest that lower trophic level variables, if available, are valuable in the creation of species distribution models for marine organisms.

AB  - Mohave ground squirrels Xerospermophilus mohavensis Merriam are small grounddwelling rodents that have a highly restricted range in the northwest Mojave Desert, California, USA. Their small natural range is further reduced by habitat loss from agriculture, urban development, military training and recreational activities. Development of wind and solar resources for re newable energy has the potential to further re duce existing habitat. We used maximum entropy habitat models with observation data to describe current potential habitat in the context of future renewable energy development in the region. While 16% of historic habitat has been impacted by, or lost to, urbanization at present, an additional 10% may be affected by renewable energy development in the near future. Our models show that X. mohavensis habitat suitability is higher in areas slated for renewable energy development than in surrounding areas. We provide habitat maps that can be used to develop sampling designs, evaluate conservation corridors and inform development planning in the region.

AB  - Tropical rain forests harbor a high diversity of tree species, a large portion of which are considered rare and threatened by anthropogenic factors such as land-use change. Addressing the global need for ex situ rescue populations of such species, we investigated whether certain methods of wild-source seed collection harvest greater amounts of genetic variation from the source population while minimizing the costs expended. We used an individual-based computer program (NEWGARDEN) to conduct simulation trials examining which aspects of seed procurement provided the most cost-effective methods for maximal rare allele capture for single isolated populations of rare tropical tree species. Aspects examined included the geometric pattern of harvesting, location of seed collections within the spatial distribution of the population (central vs. peripheral), geometric partitioning of sampling regions (contiguous vs. subdivided), gene dispersal distance, linear travelling costs, and ratio of seeds collected to plants sampled. Results demonstrated that ratio of seeds collected to plants sampled had the highest effect on genetic diversity harvested relative to sampling location or geometric pattern of collection, explaining 82 and 79% of the variance in alleles harvested, respectively. Collecting from subdivided peripheral sampling regions and populations having long distance gene dispersal led to increases of up to 39 and 51% in the amount of genetic variation conserved respectively. These results suggest that ex situ conservation efforts for rare tropical trees can benefit by collecting fewer seeds from each of a larger number of trees, sampling from peripheral subdivided regions of the population rather than in a contiguous centrally located one under the transect or nearest neighbor strategies, and adjusting harvesting based on the dispersal biology of the source population. This study underscores the need for more information regarding the dispersal characteristics of the target species and demonstrates the value of predictive modeling for planning seed collection projects.

AB  - The distribution of mockingbird species among the Galapagos Islands prompted Charles Darwin to question, for the first time in writing, the 'stability of species'. Some 50 years after Darwin's visit, however, the endemic Floreana mockingbird (Mimus trifasciatus) had become extinct on Floreana Island and, today, only two small populations survive on two satellite islets. As Darwin noted, rarity often precedes extinction. To avert extinction, plans are being developed to reintroduce M. trifasciatus to Floreana. Here, we integrate evolutionary thinking and conservation practice using coalescent analyses and genetic data from contemporary and museum samples, including two collected by Darwin and Robert Fitzroy on Floreana in 1835. Our microsatellite results show substantial differentiation between the two extant populations, but our coalescence-based modelling does not indicate long, independent evolutionary histories. One of the populations is highly inbred, but both harbour unique alleles present on Floreana in 1835, suggesting that birds from both islets should be used to establish a single, mixed population on Floreana. Thus, Darwin's mockingbird specimens not only revealed to him a level of variation that suggested speciation following geographical isolation but also, more than 170 years later, return important information to their place of origin for the conservation of their conspecifics.

AB  - The impacts of climate change put pressure onto environmental and natural resources, which in turn increases the vulnerability of ecosystems and human communities. This makes social participation essential for biodiversity conservation. This article addresses the community perceptions of the adaptations made to climate change in the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve (REBIVI), in Baja California Sur (Mexico), one of the largest natural protected areas in Latin America. Workshops with local communities defined the Socio-ecological Assets for Conservation (SEACs) and prioritized the adaptation strategies and actions by multicriteria analysis. The conclusions point out that a combination of ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) and communities-based adaptation (CbA) is the most appropriate pathway to affront the adverse impacts of climate change. Thus, a socioecological approach for land and biodiversity use planning has to be implemented if both human welfare and conservation are to be effectively promoted. The process is necessary and very important, as is the participation of the local residents in the implementation and monitoring of the adaptation actions.

AB  - Through, the gathering of all butterfly inventoried and surveys already done in Brazil, a conclusion was reached on how poor the country is regarding this type of study and poorly represented despite, its immense territory. All agglomeration indexes used, approached by quadrants, biomes, regions, and states, indicated a strong grouping in the distribution of inventories. In addition, groupings are relatively correlated with the human presence or strongly correlated to its agglomeration. Consequently, several gaps are observed in the knowledge of Brazilian species and their distribution, especially in the Caatinga and Western Amazon biomes. Subsequent conservation and biogeography studies suffer from bad sampling trends, since the greatest body of knowledge about lepidopterofauna. is confined to the large urban centers. In this study, priority areas are proposed for the execution of butterfly inventories in an attempt to minimize these effects and contribute to, directing research that aim at the building of management. plans or applied scientific production.

AB  - We used the results of the Spanish Otter Survey of 1994-1996, a Geographic Information System and stepwise multiple logistic regression to model otter presence/absence data in the continental Spanish UTM 10 x 10-km squares. Geographic situation, indicators of human activity such as highways and major urban centers, and environmental variables related with productivity, water availability, altitude, and environmental energy were included in a logistic model that correctly classified about 73% of otter presences and absences. We extrapolated the model to the adjacent territory of Portugal, and increased the model's spatial resolution by extrapolating it to I x 1-km squares in the whole Iberian Peninsula. The model turned out to be rather flexible, predicting, for instance, the species to be very restricted to the courses of rivers in some areas, and more widespread in others. This allowed us to determine areas where otter populations may be more vulnerable to habitat changes or harmful human interventions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological relationships and processes vary across species' geographic distributions, life stages and spatial, and temporal scales. Montane landscapes are characterized by low wetland densities, rugged topographies, and cold climates. Consequently, aquatic-dependent and low-vagility ectothermic species (e.g., pool-breeding amphibians) may exhibit unique ecological associations in montane landscapes. We evaluated the relative importance of breeding- and landscape-scale features associated with spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) wetland occupancy in Maine's Upper Montane-Alpine Zone ecoregion, and we determined whether models performed better when the inclusive landscape-scale covariates were estimated with topography-weighted or circular buffers. We surveyed 135 potential breeding sites during May 2013-June 2014 and evaluated environmental relationships with multi-season implicit dynamics occupancy models. Breeding site occupancy by both species was influenced solely by breeding-scale habitat features. Spotted salamander occupancy probabilities increased with previous or current beaver (Castor canadensis) presence, and models generally were better supported when the inclusive landscape-scale covariates were estimated with topography-weighted rather than circular buffers. Wood frog occupancy probabilities increased with site area and percent shallows, but neither buffer type was better supported than the other. Model rank order and support varied between buffer types, but model inferences did not. Our results suggest pool-breeding amphibian conservation in montane Maine include measures to maintain beaver populations and large wetlands with proportionally large areas of shallows 1-m deep. Inconsistencies between our study and previous studies substantiate the value of region-specific research for augmenting species' conservation management plans and suggest the application of out-of-region inferences may promote ineffective conservation.

AB  - Aim With climate change, reliable predictions of future species geographic distributions are becoming increasingly important for the design of appropriate conservation measures. Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict geographic range shifts in response to climate change. However, because species communities are likely to change with the climate, accounting for biotic interactions is imperative. A shortcoming of introducing biotic interactions in SDMs is the assumption that biotic interactions remain the same under changing climatic factors, which is disputable. We explore the performance of SDMs while including biotic interactions. Location Fennoscandia, Europe. Methods We investigate the appropriateness of the inclusion of biotic factors (predator pressure and prey availability) in assessing the future distribution of the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) in Fennoscandia by means of SDM, using the algorithm MaxEnt. Results Our results show that the inclusion of biotic interactions enhanced the accuracy of SDMs to predict the current arctic fox distribution, and we argue that the accuracy of future predictions might also be enhanced. While the range of the arctic fox is predicted to have decreased by 43% in 2080 because of temperature-related variables, projected increases in predator pressure and reduced prey availability are predicted to constrain the potential future geographic range of the arctic fox in Fennoscandia 13% more. Main conclusions The results indicate that, provided one has a good knowledge of past changes and a clear understanding of interactions in the community involved, the inclusion of biotic interactions in modelling future geographic ranges of species increases the predictive power of such models. This likely has far-reaching impacts upon the design and implementation of possible conservation and management plans. Control of competing predators and supplementary feeding are suggested as necessary management actions to preserve the Fennoscandian arctic fox population in the face of climate change.

AB  - Throughout Africa, conservancies under community and private management are becoming increasingly important as a complement to the protection offered by the established core network of protected areas (PAs), which are largely under national management. However, opportunities for creating new conservation areas are restricted by increasing demand on land use by growing human populations, and it is unclear how effectively the current protected area network captures spatial priorities for conservation. Taking into account climate-induced range-shifts, we first identified spatial priorities for antelope conservation in Africa by gap analysis of the network of PAs listed with an IUCN category in the World Database for Protected Areas. For three countries from which information were available, we then assessed to what extent the gaps identified were covered by PAs not listed with an IUCN category, for the latter making a distinction between whether management was referred to as community-based or not. The results showed limited overlap, suggesting that the success of community-based and privately managed PAs in covering spatial priorities from a continent-wide perspective could be increased by more strategic land use planning at the national level.

AB  - Bayesian networks (BN) have been increasingly used for habitat suitability modeling of threatened species due to their potential to construct robust models with limited survey data. However, previous applications of this approach have only occurred in countries where human and budget resources are highly available, but the highest concentrations of threatened vertebrates globally are located in the tropics where resources are much more limited. We assessed the effectiveness of Bayesian networks in generating habitat suitability models in Thailand, a biodiversity-rich country where the knowledge base is typically sparse for a wide range of threatened species. The Bayesian network approach was used to generate habitat suitability maps for 52 threatened vertebrate species in Thailand, using a range of evidence types, from relatively well-documented species with good local knowledge to poorly documented species, with few local experts. Published information and expert knowledge were used to define habitat requirements. Focal species were categorized into 22 groups based on known habitat preferences, and then habitat suitability models were constructed with outcomes represented spatially. Models had a consistent structure with three major components: potential habitat, known range, and threat level. Model classification sensitivity was tested using presence-only field data for 21 species. Habitat models for 12 species were relatively sensitive (>70% congruency between observed and predicted locations), three were moderately congruent, and six were poor. Classification sensitivity tended to be high for bird models and moderate for mammals, whereas sensitivity for reptiles was low, presumably reflecting the relatively poor knowledge base for reptiles in the region. Bayesian network models show significant potential for biodiversity-rich regions with scarce resources, although they require further refinement and testing. It is possible that one detailed ecological study is sufficient to develop a model with reasonable sensitivity, but BN models for species groups with no quantitative data continue to be problematic.

AB  - Local and landscape features influence the spatial distribution of biodiversity. At the landscape scale, heterogeneity has compositional and configurational components that can be measured at different resolutions of conservation planning. We assess the importance of local and landscape features measured at different planning resolutions for maintaining taxonomic and functional butterfly diversity. In remnant conservation corridors that dissect alien tree plantations, butterflies were sampled along a gradient of successional stages, from open and recently burned grasslands to closed-canopy woody habitats. Changes in local vegetation structure were represented by measures of canopy cover. At the landscape scale, compositional and configurational heterogeneity were measured at two resolutions: a simple binary classification of suitable habitat versus unsuitable transformed habitat, and a classification that accounts for the different successional stages within corridors (i.e. within-corridor heterogeneity). Butterfly assemblages were characterized using taxonomic (Simpson's diversity index) and functional indices (Rao's quadratic entropy). The relationship between environmental filters and species traits was further assessed using multivariate modelling. Taxonomic diversity did not reflect functional diversity, as the latter showed differential trait specific responses to local vegetation structure. For both functional and taxonomic diversity, local and landscape variables representing within-corridor heterogeneity were more important than landscape variables measured at the coarser planning resolution. Butterfly diversity showed a negative relationship with increasing edge density between grassy and woody habitats. Synthesis and applications. To promote the taxonomic and functional dimensions of biodiversity, management should aim to maintain both open- and closed-canopy habitats within corridors. These habitats should be contiguous, and corridors as wide as possible, to increase the patch size of contiguous habitat while reducing the proportion of edge.

AB  - Spatial closures are an important component of regulations to protect cold-water corals and sponges from potential damage by bottom trawling. However, designing spatial closures can be challenging because the distribution of most cold-water coral and sponge habitat is unknown, and closures that overlap with fishing areas may reduce fishing opportunities and landings. In this paper, we examined trade-off relationships between bottom trawl fishery landings and the proportion of coral and sponge habitat protected by alternative spatial closure designs within Hecate Strait, British Columbia, Canada. We selected closures using a spatial optimization procedure involving 3 steps: (1) maximum entropy species distribution modelling to predict habitat suitability for Hexactinellida sponges and Alcyonacea and Pennatulacea corals, (2) matching habitat suitability predictions with spatially explicit estimates of bottom trawl landings value from at-sea observer data, and (3) Marxan spatial optimization to select closures that protect the most suitable coral and sponge habitat while minimizing losses in landings value. Our results suggest that the majority of coral and sponge habitat within Hecate Strait could be protected while maintaining existing fisheries value; spatial closures protecting up to 70% of the most suitable coral and sponge habitat resulted in negligible losses in trawl fishery landings. Protecting 99% of suitable coral and sponge habitats decreased landings value to 63% of its former total. Landings for rockfishes Sebastes and Sebastolobus spp. were the most sensitive to spatial closures, decreasing twice as much as average landings value for all groundfish species. By explicitly revealing potential trade-offs between fisheries and conservation objectives, our analysis provides a concrete starting point towards implementing spatial closures with increased transparency, credibility, and acceptability from stakeholders.

AB  - Background and aims - Plants are often overlooked in conservation planning, yet they are the foundation of all terrestrial ecosystems. The East Africa region is used to investigate the effectiveness of protected areas for conserving plants. With a wide range of ecosystems and 771 protected areas covering nearly one quarter of the land area, East Africa is an ideal location to assess the effectiveness of protected areas through distribution modelling of the genus Acacia.
   Methods - Herbarium specimen data (2,047 records) were collated from East Africa for 65 taxa (species, subspecies, varieties) from the genus Acacia. Generalised Additive Models were used to determine climatic drivers, and thence to extrapolate climatic suitability across the region. For two Acacia taxa, we investigated the potential for climate-induced range-shifts using a downscaled regional climate model under two IPCC scenarios.
   Key results - Approximately two thirds of Acacia diversity hotspots had < 10% coverage by protected areas. Furthermore, the protected area network covered less of the predicted ranges of the Acacia taxa and contained fewer taxa per unit area than would be expected under randomised placement. Areas with suitable climate for high-elevation, moisture-dependent taxa such as A. abyssinica subsp. calophylla are predicted to contract their potential range by up to 80% towards mountain peaks, where protected areas are dominated by low-level protection forest reserves. Conversely, the area of suitable environment for a xerophytic low-elevation species (A. turnbulliana) is predicted to increase by up to 77%.
   Conclusions - East Africa's national parks may not be preserving an important component of ecosystem diversity, a situation exacerbated by climate change. Even within the genus Acacia, different species are predicted to respond differently to climate change. Priority areas for research and conservation are identified based on overlap between predicted high Acacia diversity and gaps in the collection record, with northern and eastern Kenya highlighted as particularly important. High elevation protected areas are also predicted to become increasingly important as climatic refugia in a warmer future.

AB  - Understanding the role of land-use patterns in determining the distribution of nocturnal birds has important implications for the conservation of these species and for land management. One important step for effective conservation is to develop statistical models to assess how the probability of birds' presence can be influenced by land-use types in order to support decision making in conservation planning at the landscape or regional scale. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of extent and configuration of land-use types in determining the distribution of some nocturnal birds of prey (Strigiformes) and the European Nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus in agricultural landscapes. We surveyed six nocturnal birds (Eurasian Scops Owl Otus scops, Little Owl Athene noctua, Barn Owl Tyto alba, Long-eared Owl Asio otus, Tawny Owl Strix aluco and European Nightjar) in 123 listening stations located in nine protected areas of southern Tuscany, Central Italy. Nocturnal birds were present in 97 % of the stations, where variables relative to the extent and configuration of land-use types were measured. The probability of Tawny Owl presence increased with increasing forest cover, the probability of Little Owl presence increased with increasing amount of arable land, whilst the probability of Eurasian Scops Owl and Long-eared Owl presence increased with increasing amount of open areas. The model of European Nightjar showed that the probability of presence increased with increasing amount of forest edge and scrubs. Our results suggest that heterogeneous agricultural landscapes may favour the coexistence of several nocturnal birds, since the different species are each associated with different land-use types.

AB  - The scientific evaluation of the wetland biodiversity conservation function is the basis of balanced wetland protection and development. Our research sought to provide references for the protection of wetland ecological environments as well as the related planning and management policies. The study established a fitting model for evaluating the biodiversity conservation function in the Liaohe Delta, northeastern China. The new model, the Wetland Biodiversity Conservation Indicator (WBCI), was with four input factors, including the vegetation coverage (VC), habitat suitability index (HI), land use and land cover (LULC) index (LI), and threat factor index (TI) of the LULC type. The values assigned to HI and TI were based on Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) habitat quality models. The weights of all the factors in WBCI were valued with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We evaluated the wetland biodiversity conservation function of Panjin, Liaohe Delta, China, by using the WBCI model based onGaofen-1(GF-1) satellite data in 2018, and the result was verified with InVEST and other models. It showed that the output map was similar to that of InVEST, with the higher-quality habitat including the wetland, tidal flat, water body, and forest, as well as the lower-quality land use types including the paddy field, crop field, construction land, and land used by traffic. The wetland biodiversity conservation function was better in areas less affected by human disturbance, with very abundant species and good-quality habitat. It was poor in areas impacted by more frequent human activities such as the land cultivation, housing, and traffic, which led to the landscape fragmentation. The WBCI model provided a more accurate reflection of the bird distribution than the InVEST model. The WBCI model was able to reflect the difference in quality of each habitat grade, in contrast to the net primary productivity (NPP) method and species distribution models (SDMs). The new model was, therefore, simpler and suitable in reflecting the quality of wetland biodiversity function in the Liaohe Delta.

AB  - Riparian vegetation provides important wildlife habitat in the southwestern United States, but limited distributions and spatial complexity often leads to inaccurate representation in maps used to guide conservation. We test the use of data conflation and aggregation on multiple vegetation/land-cover maps to improve the accuracy of habitat models for the threatened western yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis). We used species observations (n = 479) from a state-wide survey to develop habitat models from 1) three vegetation/land-cover maps produced at different geographic scales ranging from state to national, and 2) new aggregate maps defined by the spatial agreement of cover types, which were defined as high (agreement = all data sets), moderate (agreement > 2), and low (no agreement required). Model accuracies, predicted habitat locations, and total area of predicted habitat varied considerably, illustrating the effects of input data quality on habitat predictions and resulting potential impacts on conservation planning. Habitat models based on aggregated and conflated data were more accurate and had higher model sensitivity than original vegetation/land-cover, but this accuracy came at the cost of reduced geographic extent of predicted habitat. Using the highest performing models, we assessed cuckoo habitat preference and distribution in Arizona and found that major watersheds containing high-probably habitat are fragmented by a wide swath of low-probability habitat. Focus on riparian restoration in these areas could provide more breeding habitat for the threatened cuckoo, offset potential future habitat losses in adjacent watershed, and increase regional connectivity for other threatened vertebrates that also use riparian corridors.

AB  - Nasuella olivacea is an endemic mammal from the Andes of Ecuador and Colombia. Due to its rarity, aspects about its natural history, ecology and distribution patterns are not well known, therefore, research is needed to generate knowledge about this carnivore and a first step is studying suitable habitat areas. We performed Ecological Niche Models and applied future climate change scenarios (2.6 and 8.5 RCP) to determine the potential distribution of this mammal in Colombia and Ecuador, with current and future climate change conditions; furthermore, we analysed its distribution along several land covers. We found that N. olivacea is likely to be found in areas where no records have been reported previously; likewise, climate change conditions would increase suitable distribution areas. Concerning land cover, 73.4% of N. olivacea potential distribution was located outside Protected Areas (PA), 46.1% in Forests and 40.3% in Agricultural Lands. These findings highlight the need to further research understudied species, furthering our understanding about distribution trends and responses to changing climatic conditions, as well as informig future PA designing. These are essential tools for supporting wildlife conservation plans, being applicable for rare species whose biology and ecology remain unknown.

AB  - The random forests (RF) algorithm is a superb learner and classifier in machine learning applications. This ensemble model is also one of the most popular species distribution model algorithms (SDMs) available to date. RF by default can produce categorical and numerical species distribution maps based on its classification tree (CT) and regression tree (RT) algorithms, respectively. Statistically, CT can also produce numerical predictions (class probability). Many real-world applications (e.g. conservation planning) employ binary presence-absence outputs that use classification thresholds to make these conversions. However, there is little available information regarding the difference in model performance between CT and RT for inference settings. Here, under an ensemble modeling framework, 52 forest tree species with presence-only data for all of China were selected for comparison of the performance of CT and RT algorithms in projecting the distribution and potential range shifts of these species under current and future climates. Five climatic variables were used to develop CT and RT models. Eight threshold-setting approaches were employed to convert numerical predictions into binary predictions. With regard to probabilistic predictions, the relative performance of CT and RT depended on the choice of the evaluation criteria. For both RT and CT, threshold-setting methods significantly altered the determination of thresholds, model performance, and subsequently projections of species range shifts under climate change. The four threshold selection methods (MaxKappa, MaxOA, MaxTSS, and MinROCdist) based on the composite model accuracy measures most often achieved significantly higher model performance than CT default threshold method and other threshold methods. They consistently projected that species' geographical ranges changed in response to climate change with the same direction and magnitude. We argue for choosing RT rather than CT as the SDM if model discrimination capacity (the ability to differentiate between occurrences of presence and absence) is viewed as more important than model reliability (the agreement between predicted relative indexes of occurrence and observed proportions of occurrence), and vice versa. In line with gradient theory, we can recommend the use of numerical predictions for species distribution modeling since they help to convey more information than binary predictions. Binary conversion of model outputs should only be carried out when it is clearly justified by the application's objective. The four aforementioned threshold methods are promising objective methods for binary conversions of continuous predictions when presence-only data are available. This study proposes guidelines on how machine learning can be used for specific applied and theoretical applications in a SDM context.

AB  - To determine the influence of nonclimatic factors on predicting the habitats of tree species and an assessment of climate change impacts over a broad geographical extent at about 1 km resolution, we investigated the predictive performance for models with climatic factors only (C-models) and models with climatic and nonclimatic factors (CN-models) using seven tree species in Japan that exhibit different ecological characteristics such as habitat preference and successional traits. Using a generalized additive model, the prediction performance was compared by prediction accuracy [area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC)], goodness of fit, and potential habitat maps. The results showed that the CN-models had higher predictive accuracy, higher goodness of fit, smaller empty habitats, and more finely defined borders of potential habitat than those of the C-models for all seven species. The degree of the total contribution of the nonclimatic variables to prediction performance also varied among the seven species. These results suggest that nonclimatic factors also play an important role in predicting species occurrence when measured to this extent and resolution, that the magnitude of model improvement is larger for species with specific habitat preferences, and that the C-models cannot predict the land-related habitats that exist for almost all species. Climate change impacts were overestimated by C-models for all species. Therefore, C-model outcomes may lead to locally ambiguous assessment of the impact of climate change on species distribution. CN-models provide a more accurate and detailed assessment for conservation planning.

AB  - Limestone karsts can form terrestrial habitat islands for calcium-dependent organisms. In Vietnam, many karst habitats are threatened, while their rich biodiversity is still far from being thoroughly explored. Given that conservation of karst biota strongly relies on correct species identification, the presence of undetected cryptic species can pose severe problems. The present study focuses on cryptic diversity among karst-inhabiting land snails of the genus Cyclophorus in northern Vietnam, where specimens with a similar shell morphology have been reported from various regions. In order to examine the diversity and evolutionary history of this "widespread morphotype", we generated a Bayesian phylogeny based on DNA sequence data. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and the Bayesian implementation of the Poisson tree processes model (bPTP) contributed to species delimitation and analyses of shell shape and size aided the morphological characterisation of individual species. We found that the examined specimens of the widespread morphotype did not form a single monophyletic group in the phylogeny but clustered into several different clades. We delimited nine different species that develop the widespread morphotype and described four of them as new. Processes of convergent evolution were probably involved in the origin of the delimited species, while their generally allopatric distribution could result from interspecific competition. Our findings indicate ongoing processes of speciation and a potential case of morphological character displacement. The high degree of morphological overlap found among the species underlines the importance of DNA sequence data for species delimitation and description in the genus Cyclophorus. Given the findings of the present study and the high potential that as yet undiscovered cryptic taxa have also evolved in other groups of karst-inhabiting organisms, we argue for a systematic and efficient detection and description of Vietnam's karst biodiversity to provide a solid basis for future conservation planning.

AB  - Climate change poses major challenges for conservation and management because it alters the area, quality, and spatial distribution of habitat for natural populations. To assess species' vulnerability to climate change and target ongoing conservation investments, researchers and managers often consider the effects of projected changes in climate and land use on future habitat availability and quality and the uncertainty associated with these projections. Here, we draw on tools from hydrology and climate science to project the impact of climate change on the density of wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of the USA, a critical area for breeding waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species. We evaluate the potential for a trade-off in the value of conservation investments under current and future climatic conditions and consider the joint effects of climate and land use. We use an integrated set of hydrological and climatological projections that provide physically based measures of water balance under historical and projected future climatic conditions. In addition, we use historical projections derived from ten general circulation models (GCMs) as a baseline from which to assess climate change impacts, rather than historical climate data. This method isolates the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and ensures that modeling errors are incorporated into the baseline rather than attributed to climate change. Our work shows that, on average, densities of wetlands (here defined as wetland basins holding water) are projected to decline across the U.S. Prairie Pothole Region, but that GCMs differ in both the magnitude and the direction of projected impacts. However, we found little evidence for a shift in the locations expected to provide the highest wetland densities under current vs. projected climatic conditions. This result was robust to the inclusion of projected changes in land use under climate change. We suggest that targeting conservation towards wetland complexes containing both small and relatively large wetland basins, which is an ongoing conservation strategy, may also act to hedge against uncertainty in the effects of climate change.

   We aim to report what hyperspectral remote sensing can offer for invasion ecologists and review recent progress made in plant invasion research using hyperspectral remote sensing.
   Location
   United States.
   Methods
   We review the utility of hyperspectral remote sensing for detecting, mapping and predicting the spatial spread of invasive species. We cover a range of topics including the trade-off between spatial and spectral resolutions and classification accuracy, the benefits of using time series to incorporate phenology in mapping species distribution, the potential of biochemical and physiological properties in hyperspectral spectral reflectance for tracking ecosystem changes caused by invasions, and the capacity of hyperspectral data as a valuable input for quantitative models developed for assessing the future spread of invasive species.
   Results
   Hyperspectral remote sensing holds great promise for invasion research. Spectral information provided by hyperspectral sensors can detect invaders at the species level across a range of community and ecosystem types. Furthermore, hyperspectral data can be used to assess habitat suitability and model the future spread of invasive species, thus providing timely information for invasion risk analysis.
   Main conclusions
   Our review suggests that hyperspectral remote sensing can effectively provide a baseline of invasive species distributions for future monitoring and control efforts. Furthermore, information on the spatial distribution of invasive species can help land managers to make long-term constructive conservation plans for protecting and maintaining natural ecosystems.

AB  - Carrying out studies that lead us to obtain information on both the cultural and biological heritage of a locality, region, or country allows us to create appropriate strategies for the conservation of biocultural diversity. In this context, the objective of this study was to model the potential distribution of Cuphea aequipetala Cav. within the Mexican territory, to identify the main environmental variables that delimit its habitat, and to obtain information from traditional knowledge through the medicinal uses that the inhabitants of nearby communities give to the plant. Potential distribution modeling was performed with MaxEnt together with 19 bioclimatic variables of Worldclim plus three variables closely related to the habitat of the species. Data on its presence were obtained in situ within the Lagunas de Zempoala National Park and from iNaturalist. Information on the medicinal uses of the plant was obtained through semi-structured surveys with people who were in continuous contact with it. The potential range of C. equipetala Cav. was 3205.63 km(2), which represents 0.16% of the Mexican territory. The altitude, precipitation in the driest period, average temperature of the warmest quarter, and average temperature of the driest quarter were the variables that had the greatest effects on the potential distribution (49%), and these factors mainly delimited the suitability of the habitat. C. aequipetala Cav. is still used in traditional medicine, mainly for conditions related to cancer, shocks, and inflammation. Finally, it was found that the potential distribution coincided with the states of the country where its medicinal use was reported. This information is important, since it constitutes the basis for performing actions targeting the conservation of this species of medicinal relevance. For example, potential distribution areas can be integrated into habitat restoration and conservation plans to prevent anthropogenic activities, such as felling, that directly affect the habitat. This information can also be used as a reference to promote the preservation of medicinal uses among the young population of the distribution areas.

AB  - As a region known for its high species richness, southwest China plays an important role in preserving global biodiversity and ensuring ecological security in the Yangtze, Mekong, and Salween river basins. However, relatively few studies focus on the response of tree species richness to climate change in this part of China. This study determined the main tree species in southwest China using the Vegetation Map of China and the Flora of China. From simulations of 1970 to 2000 and three forecasts of future benign, moderate, and extreme climate warming anticipated during 2061 to 2080, this study used a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to simulate main tree species richness in southwest China. Regions with a peak species richness at intermediate elevations were typically dominated by complex mountainous terrain, such as in the Hengduan Mountains. Likewise, regions with the smallest richness were low-elevation areas, including the Sichuan Basin, and the high-elevation Sichuan-Tibet region. Annual precipitation, minimum temperature of the coldest month, temperature seasonality, and elevation were the most critical factors in estimating tree species richness in southwest China. During future 2061 to 2080 climate scenarios, tree species tended to migrate towards higher elevations as mean temperatures increased. For climate change scenarios RCP2.6-2070 (benign) and RCP4.5-2070 (moderate), the main tree species richness in the study area changed little. During the RCP8.5-2070 extreme scenario, tree species richness decreased. This study provides useful guidance to plan and implement measures to conserve biodiversity.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are under a constant risk of being irreversibly damaged by human pressures that threaten their biodiversity, the sustainability of ecosystem services (ESs), and human well-being. Despite the implementation of various environmental regulations, the challenges of safeguarding freshwater assets have so far not been tackled successfully. A promising way forward to stop the loss of freshwater biodiversity and to sustain freshwater-based ESs is by implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM), an environmental planning and adaptive management approach that jointly considers social and ecological needs. Responsible for considerable recent success in sustainably managing and conserving marine ecosystems, EBM has not yet been championed for fresh waters. A major reason for the delayed uptake of EBM in fresh waters is likely to be its complexity, requiring planners to be familiar with the latest developments in a range of different research areas. EBM would therefore benefit from becoming more tangible to receive attention on the ground. To facilitate uptake, eight core research areas for EBM and their innovations are introduced, and the way in which they feed into the workflow that guides the EBM planning stage is explained. The workflow links biodiversity distributions with ES supply-and-demand modelling and SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely) target planning, including scenario- and cross-realm perspectives, the prioritization of management alternatives, spatial prioritization of biodiversity conservation and ES areas, and the quantification of uncertainties. Given the extensive resources, time, and technical capacity required to implement the full workflow, a light and an ultralight version of the workflow are also provided. Applied in concert, the eight well-known research areas allow for better planning and operationalizing, and eventually for implementing EBM in freshwater ecosystems. EBM has great potential to increase public acceptance by introducing the consideration of human needs and aspirations into typically biodiversity-driven conservation and management approaches. This will ultimately improve the integrity of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - 1. Species distribution models (habitat models) relate the occurrence or abundance of a species to environmental and/or geographical predictors that then allow predictions to be mapped across an entire region. These models are used in a range of policy settings such as managing greenhouse gases, biosecurity threats and conservation planning. Prediction errors are almost ubiquitous in habitat models. An understanding of the source, magnitude and pattern of these errors is essential if the models are to be used transparently in decision making.
   2. This study considered the sources of errors in habitat models. It divided them into two main classes, error resulting from data deficiencies and error introduced by the specification of the model. Common and important data errors included missing covariates, and samples of species' occurrences that were small, biased or lack absences. These affected the types of models that could be developed and the probable errors that would occur. Almost all models had missing covariates, and this introduced significant spatial correlation in the errors of the analysis.
   3. A challenging aspect of modelling is that species' distributions are affected by processes operating in both environmental and geographical space. We differentiated between global (aspatial) and local (spatial) errors, and discussed how they arise and what can be done to alleviate their effects.
   4. Synthesis and applications. This study brings together statistical and ecological thinking to consider the appropriate techniques for habitat modelling. Ecological theory suggests models capable of defining optima, while allowing for interactions between variables. Statistical considerations, including impacts of data errors, suggest models that deal with multimodality and discontinuity in response surfaces. Models are typically simple approximations of the true probability surface. We suggest the use of flexible regression techniques, and explain what makes such methods superior for ecological modelling. The most robust modelling approaches are likely to be those in which care is taken to match the model with knowledge of ecology, and in which each is allowed to inform the other.

AB  - A GIS-based database (or geodatabase) was developed for the Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve, on Luzon Island, Philippines toward the establishment of a management decision support system. The study presents initial results in the development of a geodatabase, as well as the use of geographic information system (GIS) in the planning, design and implementation of programs for forest renewal and biodiversity conservation. GIS use for data encoding is already extensive but its use as a planning and analytical tool is limited, if not altogether lacking. An outline for the establishment of a geodatabase is presented that will allow processing, analysis and modeling and, ultimately, the sustainable development and conservation of the mountain forest reserve, which is a significant watershed area and an important catchment for Laguna de Bay - the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia.
   The database design is patterned after the GAME model earlier developed. GAME is an acronym for GIS-based assessment, monitoring and evaluation which uses regular-shaped polygons to provide a full description of the watershed. There are five (5) levels of detail or precision that can be used to characterize and map watershed phenomena: 100-ha grids, 25-ha quadrants, 1-ha cells, 0.04-ha squares and 0.01-ha granules. Depending on the level of detail required for analysis, the appropriate precision level can be used to describe land use/land cover, especially degraded areas, habitats, species distributions and conservation hotspots, among others. The geodatabase for the Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve already contains data and information on soils, slope, elevation and land use.

AB  - Aim Using a comprehensive floristic database ( 2616 species, 36,004 occurrence records from 128 unique localities), we model species turnover along the central region of the Atlantic Forest hotspot to ( 1) test whether local rivers, particularly the Rio Doce, are associated with marked biogeographical breaks, and ( 2) investigate how regional compositional changes correlate with geo-climatic variables.
   Location The central region of the Atlantic Forest in eastern Brazil ( 12 degrees-22 degrees S latitude).
   Methods We combine occurrence and geo-climatic data in a generalized dissimilarity model, obtaining a continuous prediction of species turnover across space and identifying 12 significant geo-climatic predictors of community composition. We use a two-step cluster analysis to classify the turnover map into major floristic regions based on the natural subgroups observed. We further divide each major floristic region into smaller sub-regions based on natural subgroups statistically identified by the two-step cluster analyses.
   Results High levels of turnover in species composition occurred around latitudes 18 degrees-19 degrees S, c. 50-100 km north of the Rio Doce, and concurred with shifts in availability of both humidity and energy. We identified three major floristic regions in the central region of the Atlantic Forest, which we called Bahia Interior Forests, Bahia Coastal Forests, and the Krenak-Waitaka Forests each of them divided into two to four subregions.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that local climatic conditions, not riverine barriers, drive biogeographical shifts in this region - a finding that supports studies of current and historical determinants of the composition of the Atlantic Forest biota. Floristic composition at higher elevations (> 600 m) is clearly distinct from those in lower elevations, likely as a result of physiological constraints imposed by cooler climates in the former. Floristic regions here identified from observed communities substantially improve the maps currently employed for conservation planning in a shrinking hotspot.

AB  - Population estimates are widely used to underpin conservation decisions. However, determining accurate population estimates for migratory species is especially challenging, as they are often widespread and it is rarely possible to survey them throughout their full distribution. In the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF), this problem is compounded by its size (85 million square kilometres) and the number of migratory species it supports (nearly 500). Here, we provide analytical approaches for addressing this problem, presenting a revision of the EAAF population estimates for 37 migratory shorebird species protected under Australian national environmental legislation. Population estimates were generated by (1) summarizing existing count data in the non-breeding range, (2) spatially extrapolating across uncounted areas, and (3) modelling abundance on the basis of estimates of breeding range and density. Expert review was used to adjust modelled estimates, particularly in under-counted areas. There were many gaps in shorebird monitoring data, necessitating substantial use of extrapolation and expert review, the extent of which varied among species. Spatial extrapolation to under-counted areas often produced estimates that were much higher than the observed data, and expert review was used to cross-check and adjust these where necessary. Estimates of population size obtained through analyses of breeding ranges and density indicated that 18 species were poorly represented by counts in the non-breeding season. It was difficult to determine independently the robustness of these estimates, but these breeding ground estimates were considered the best available data for 10 species that mostly use poorly surveyed freshwater or pelagic habitats in the non-breeding season. We discuss the rationale and limitations of these approaches to population estimation, and how they could be modified for other applications. Data available for population estimates will vary in quality and extent among species, regions and migration stage, and approaches need to be flexible enough to provide useful information for conservation policy and planning.

AB  - We studied a population of the endangered glassfrog, Cochranella mache, at Bilsa Biological Station, northwestern Ecuador, from 2008 and 2009. We present information on annual abundance patterns, behavioral ecology, habitat use and a species distribution model performed with MaxEnt. We evaluate the importance of the National System of Protected Areas (SNAP) in Colombia and Ecuador, under scenarios of climate change and habitat loss. We predicted a restricted environmental suitability area from 48,509 Km 2 to 65,147 Km 2 along western Ecuador and adjacent Colombia;,8% of the potential distribution occurs within SNAP. We examined four aspects of C. mache ecology: (1) ecological data suggests a strong correlation between relative abundance and rainfall, with a high probability to observe frogs through rainy months (February-May); (2) habitat use and the species distribution model suggest that this canopy dweller is restricted to small streams and rivulets in primary and old secondary forest in evergreen lowland and piedmont forest of western Ecuador, with predictions of suitability areas in adjacent southern Colombia; (3) the SNAP of Colombia and Ecuador harbor a minimum portion of the predicted model of distribution (, 10%); and (4) synergetic effects of habitat loss and climate change reduces in about 95% the suitability areas for this endangered frog along its distributional range in Protected Areas. The resulting model allows the recognition of areas to undertake conservation efforts and plan future field surveys, as well as forecasting regions with high probability of C. mache occurrence in western Ecuador and southern Colombia. Further research is required to assess population tendencies, habitat fragmentation and target survey zones to accelerate the discovery of unknown populations in unexplored areas with high probability of suitability. We recommend that Cochranella mache must be re-categorized as "Critically Endangered'' species in national and global status, according with criteria and sub-criteria A4, B1ab(i,ii,iii,iv),E.

AB  - Designing permanent sample plots is a key issue in forestry where long-term data are required to assess the sustainability of forest logging. The data that are collected in permanent sample plots are used to set parameters in a population dynamics matrix model which in turn is used to predict stock recovery rates for each species. The sampling plan for permanent plots can be designed to estimate stock recovery rates with a required accuracy at a given confidence level, while minimizing installation costs. This can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem (one constraint for each species). The question then is to quantify sampling variability, i.e. the variability of model predictions that are generated by the distribution of parameter estimators. In this study, we address the question of sampling variability for a size-classified population matrix model in a hierarchical context where sample size is itself random and driven by a multivariate spatial point process. An approximate expression is given for the accuracy of the stock recovery rate estimator. This expression is the limit of the accuracy as the expectation of sample size tends to infinity. We extend this expression to the multispecies case. To a first approximation, interactions between species do not affect the accuracy of the stock recovery rate for each species. A sampling plan is designed using the data for three species in a tropical rainforest in French Guiana. The optimal sampling plan appears to be determined by the most constrained species.

AB  - Two of the major limitations to effective management of coral reef ecosystems are a lack of information on the spatial distribution of marine species and a paucity of data on the interacting environmental variables that drive distributional patterns. Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = > 0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92% map accuracy) than BRT (68% map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management.

AB  - Tropical dry forests are some of the world's most endangered ecosystems, but are the least studied habitats. The lack of information on their ecology and distribution is a constraint for restoration and conservation of these forests. The last study to describe dry forest communities in Myanmar was conducted in the 1960s, and was based on their physiognomy and the dominant tree species. We investigated the species composition of the dry forest communities in the central dry zone of Myanmar, and developed environmental distribution models. Based on presence/absence vegetation surveys, we classified the community types using TWINSPAN. We obtained 14 statistically significant basic community types, which we combined into five alliances and two orders. Community types were generally divided into two groups at the order level: woody communities in the forest landscapes and in the anthropogenic (agricultural and residential) landscapes. Tectona hamiltoniana and Terminalia oliveri were abundant in the forest landscapes, whereas Prosopis juliflora and Borassus flabellifer were common in the anthropogenic landscapes. Acacia catechu and Waltheria indica were distributed in communities with intermediate characteristics between the forest and anthropogenic landscapes. Communities in the anthropogenic landscapes lacked species from the forest landscapes. Forest landscape communities were endemic to Myanmar's dry zone, and T. hamiltoniana was dominant. A novel community of alien P. juliflora which is common to the world's dry forests, was detected in the anthropogenic landscapes. We predicted the distribution of dry forest communities across the study area using a logistic regression model based on landscape types and mesoscale environmental variables. Landscape was the most significant factor that explained the distribution of the communities, followed by elevation. The forest landscape communities, especially the Shorea siamensis-T. hamiltoniana and T. hamiltoniana-T. oliveri forest alliances were rare in the study area. The limited area of these communities suggested their importance for conservation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In regions where snowfall historically has been a defining seasonal characteristic of the landscape, warming winters have reduced the depth, duration, and extent of snowpack. However, most management and conservation has focused on how aboveground wildlife will be affected by altered snow conditions, even though the majority of species that persist through the winter do so under the snowpack in a thermally stable refugium: the subnivium. Shortened winters, forest management practices, and winter recreation can alter subnivium conditions by increasing snow compaction and compromising thermal stability at the soil-snow interface. To help slow the loss of the subnivium in the face of rapidly changing winter conditions, we suggest managers adopt regional conservation plans for identifying threatened snow-covered environments; measure and predict the effects land cover and habitat management has on local subnivium conditions; and control the timing and distribution of activities that disturb and compact snow cover (e.g., silvicultural practices, snow recreation, and road and trail maintenance). As a case study, we developed a spatially explicit model of subnivium presence in a working landscape of the Chequamegon National Forest, Wisconsin. We identified landscapes where winter recreation and management practices could threaten potentially important areas for subnivium persistence. Similar modeling approaches could inform management decisions related to subnivium conservation. Current climate projections predict that snow seasons will change rapidly in many regions, and as result, we advocate for the immediate recognition, conservation, and management of the subnivium and its dependent species.

AB  - In 2009, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (UK) launched its Breathing Planet Programme. This 10 year programme seeks to re-align Kew's work to develop plant-based solutions to the challenges of climate change. Further to the development of the Programme, Kew has undertaken a review of its science projects with relevance to mitigating the impacts of climate change on plant diversity and people. The review has allowed Kew to better understand its current strengths and weaknesses in this area in order to plan for the future. The findings of the review could be relevant for science programmes in other botanic gardens. Botanic gardens play a fundamental role in the conservation of biodiversity to mitigate climate change impacts. Knowledge and data on plant systematics, distribution and physiology is vital for modelling and monitoring the impacts of climate change, to help to identify plant species and habitats most at risk of losing their wild diversity. Kew's Millennium Seed Bank Project will safeguard 25% of plant species by 2020, while in situ projects are improving the conservation of threatened habitats. One challenge is to make such activities relevant and useful to other scientists, conservation groups and policy makers working to address climate change. However, botanic gardens must also develop working practices and projects that specifically address the challenges of climate change. Kew and a global network of partners are doing this in a variety of ways, and examples will be presented in this paper.

AB  - Moorland is an interesting vegetation because (1) it has high diversity with various coexisting species of different functional groups; (2) the coexistence of species is conserved for long time without large disturbances; (3) it is isolated from other moorlands by forest areas, where dispersal of species is expected to be influenced by spatial distribution and size of moorlands; and (4) the environmental factors vary among moorlands, which enable us to determine how these environmental factors affect species composition. We analyzed species diversity of plant communities in subalpine moorlands as well as underlying mechanisms using trait-based approaches to reveal that landscape-level species diversity is mainly a function of between-moorland level species diversity. Species composition and community-level functional traits were influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and soil water characteristics. We analyzed light acquisition efficiency of species belonging to different functional groups and found a seasonal niche separation for light use between functional groups, facilitating species coexistence. Furthermore, we found that species diversity in moorland plant communities conforms to a spatially nested structure. By assuming that the nested rank of species is the potential order of species loss, our simulation analysis demonstrated that vulnerability is considerably different among moorlands, which implies that functional diversity can be a useful measure for the planning of conservation strategies.

AB  - BackgroundSaraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde is a valuable tree used in traditional medicine against a variety of ailments. Almost all parts of the tree are used for various commercial herbal preparations. Due to overexploitation, the species is rapidly disappearing from Western Ghats where it is native and grew extensively until recently. Conservation of this important medicinal plant is therefore an urgent need. To plan effective conservation strategies, a scientific assessment of the genetic diversity and distribution is needed.MethodsRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA fingerprinting was employed and the population genetic structure of seven wild and three cultivated populations totalling 160 individuals of S. asoca in the Western Ghats region of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Goa for analysis.ResultsVariation of 89% was observed within populations while 11% was observed among the populations of S. asoca. Gene flow (Nm) of 2.01 was observed, and 0.19 was the degree of genetic differentiation recorded. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis generated a dendrogram that showed an admixture of all genotypes but with two major clusters, which was also supported by a STRUCTURE-based Bayesian model. One wild population was well, but inexplicably, differentiated from the rest.ConclusionsThe study shows that there is still considerable genetic diversity existing in natural populations of S. asoca, suggesting good natural cross-pollination, giving encouraging indications that the gene pool is under no immediate threat. Any conservation strategy should utilise the observed genetic variation in the choice of planting stock for programmes of conservation, propagation and reforestation.

AB  - Aim Our objective was to identify the distribution of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) in fragmented oakjuniper woodlands by applying a geoadditive semiparametric occupancy model to better assist decision-makers in identifying suitable habitat across the species breeding range on which conservation or mitigation activities can be focused and thus prioritize management and conservation planning.
   Location Texas, USA.
   Methods We used repeated double-observer detection/non-detection surveys of randomly selected (n = 287) patches of potential habitat to evaluate warbler patch-scale presence across the species breeding range. We used a geoadditive semiparametric occupancy model with remotely sensed habitat metrics (patch size and landscape composition) to predict patch-scale occupancy of golden-cheeked warblers in the fragmented oak-juniper woodlands of central Texas, USA.
   Results Our spatially explicit model indicated that golden-cheeked warbler patch occupancy declined from south to north within the breeding range concomitant with reductions in the availability of large habitat patches. We found that 59% of woodland patches, primarily in the northern and central portions of the warbler's range, were predicted to have occupancy probabilities <= 0.10 with only 3% of patches predicted to have occupancy probabilities >0.90. Our model exhibited high prediction accuracy (area under curve = 0.91) when validated using independently collected warbler occurrence data.
   Main conclusions We have identified a distinct spatial occurrence gradient for golden-cheeked warblers as well as a relationship between two measurable landscape characteristics. Because habitat-occupancy relationships were key drivers of our model, our results can be used to identify potential areas where conservation actions supporting habitat mitigation can occur and identify areas where conservation of future potential habitat is possible. Additionally, our results can be used to focus resources on maintenance and creation of patches that are more likely to harbour viable local warbler populations.

AB  - Aim Marine forests of brown macroalgae create essential habitats for coastal species and support invaluable ecological services. Here, we provide the first global analysis of species richness and endemicity of both the kelp and fucoid biomes. Location Global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Marine forests of brown macroalgae, formed by kelp (here defined as orders Laminariales, Tilopteridales and Desmarestiales) and fucoid (order Fucales), inhabiting subtidal and intertidal environments. Methods We coupled a large dataset of macroalgal observations (420 species, 1.01 million records) with a high-resolution dataset of relevant environmental predictors (i.e., light, temperature, salinity, nitrate, wave energy and ice coverage) to develop stacked species distribution models (stacked SDMs) and yield estimates of global species richness and endemicity. Results Temperature and light were the main predictors shaping the distribution of subtidal species, whereas wave energy, temperature and salinity were the main predictors of intertidal species. The highest regional species richness for kelp was found in the north-east Pacific (maximum 32 species) and for fucoids in south-east Australia (maximum 53 species), supporting the hypothesis that these regions were the evolutionary sources of global colonization by brown macroalgae. Locations with low species richness coincided between kelp and fucoid, occurring mainly at higher latitudes (e.g., Siberia) and the Baltic Sea, where extensive ice coverage and low-salinity regimes prevail. Regions of high endemism for both groups were identified in the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica, South Africa and East Russia. Main conclusions We estimated the main environmental drivers and limits shaping the distribution of marine forests of brown macroalgae and mapped biogeographical centres of species richness and endemicity, which largely coincided with the expectation from previous evolutionary hypotheses. The mapped biodiversity patterns can serve as new baselines for planning and prioritizing locations for conservation, management and climate change mitigation strategies, flagging threatened marine forest regions under different climate change scenarios.

AB  - 1. Few extensive lotic studies have examined patterns in the biodiversity of non-biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) along major environmental gradients. Our aim was to fill this gap by describing patterns in species diversity, assemblage composition and distributions of midges across a boreal drainage basin.
   2. We found that the diversity of midges, as measured by rarefied species richness, Fisher's alpha and Pielou's evenness, responded positively to stream size in regression analysis. By contrast, species density was most strongly correlated to a gradient in suspended solids and phosphorus in stream water, as well as macrophyte cover. Spatial variables were not significantly correlated with species diversity.
   3. Midge assemblage composition was best explained by a model incorporating five composite environmental gradients in canonical correspondence analysis. The environmental gradients were stream size, macrophyte cover, alkalinity, nitrogen and suspended solids. Spatial variables did not overcome the effects of environmental gradients on assemblage composition.
   4. Cluster analysis divided the 27 study sites into four groups with relatively similar midge assemblages. These groups were statistically significant in multi-response permutation procedure, and 15 of the 49 midge taxa recorded varied significantly among the groups in indicator value analysis. Discriminant function analysis showed that stream size, macrophyte cover and habitat structure predicted 66.7% of sites into correct groups.
   5. The information provided by the present analyses may be of considerable importance in conservation planning at the drainage basin level. The fact that species diversity and assemblage composition varied primarily along the stream size gradient suggests that sites belonging to the different size classes (first to fifth order) are needed to conserve the biodiversity of midges. The other environmental gradients should also be considered in conservation planning, because they explained significant amounts of variability in midge assemblage composition.

AB  - The environmental characteristics of the Taiwan Strait (TS) have been linked to variations in the abundance and distribution of greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) populations. Greater amberjack is a commercially and ecologically valuable species in ecosystems, and its spatial distribution patterns are pivotal to fisheries management and conservation. However, the relationship between the catch rates of S. dumerili and the environmental changes and their impact on fish communities remains undetermined in the TS. The goal of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of S. dumerili with environmental characteristics in the TS from south to north (20 degrees N-29 degrees N and 115 degrees E-127 degrees E), applying generalized additive models (GAMs) and spatiotemporal fisheries data from logbooks and voyage data recorders from Taiwanese fishing vessels (2014-2017) as well as satellite-derived remote sensing environmental data. We used the generalized linear model (GLM) and GAM to analyze the effect of environmental factors and catch rates. The predictive performance of the two statistical models was quantitatively assessed by using the root mean square difference. Results reveal that the GAM outperforms the GLM model in terms of the functional relationship of the GAM for generating a reliable predictive tool. The model selection process was based on the significance of model terms, increase in deviance explained, decrease in residual factor, and reduction in Akaike's information criterion. We then developed a species distribution model based on the best GAMs. The deviance explained indicated that sea surface temperature, linked to high catch rates, was the key factor influencing S. dumerili distributions, whereas mixed layer depth was the least relevant factor. The model predicted a relatively high S. dumerili catch rate in the northwestern region of the TS in summer, with the area extending to the East China Sea. The target species is strongly influenced by biophysical environmental conditions, and potential fishing areas are located throughout the waters of the TS. The findings of this study showed how S. dumerili populations respond to environmental variables and predict species distributions. Data on the habitat preferences and distribution patterns of S. dumerili are essential for understanding the environmental conditions of the TS, which can inform future priorities for conservation planning and management.

AB  - Cactaceae (cacti), a New World plant family, is one of the most endangered groups of organisms on the planet. Conservation planning is uncertain as it is unclear whether climate and land-use change will positively or negatively impact global cactus diversity. On the one hand, a common perception is that future climates will be favourable to cacti as they have multiple adaptations and specialized physiologies and morphologies for increased heat and drought. On the other hand, the wide diversity of the more than 1,500 cactus species, many of which occur in more mesic and cooler ecosystems, questions the view that most cacti can tolerate warmer and drought conditions. Here we assess the hypothesis that cacti will benefit and expand in potential distribution in a warmer and more drought-prone world. We quantified exposure to climate change through range forecasts and associated diversity maps for 408 cactus species under three Representative Concentration Pathways (2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) for 2050 and 2070. Our analyses show that 60% of species will experience a reduction in favourable climate, with about a quarter of species exposed to environmental conditions outside of the current realized niche in over 25% of their current distribution. These results show low sensitivity to many uncertainties in forecasting, mostly deriving from dispersal ability and model complexity rather than climate scenarios. While current range size and the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List category were not statistically significant predictors of predicted future changes in suitable climate area, epiphytes had the greatest exposure to novel climates. Overall, the number of cactus species at risk is projected to increase sharply in the future, especially in current richness hotspots. Land-use change has previously been identified as the second-most-common driver of threat among cacti, affecting many of the similar to 31% of cacti that are currently threatened. Our results suggest that climate change will become a primary driver of cactus extinction risk with 60-90% of species assessed negatively impacted by climate change and/or other anthropogenic processes, depending on how these threat processes are distributed across cactus species.

AB  - Unprecedented poaching levels triggered by demand for ivory in Far East Asia are threatening the persistence of African elephant Loxodonta africana. Southern African countries make an important contribution to elephant conservation and could soon become the last stronghold of elephant conservation in Africa. While the ecological factors affecting elephant distribution and densities have extensively been accounted for, there is a need to understand which socioeconomic factors affect elephant numbers in order to prevent conflict over limited space and resources with humans. We used elephant count data from aerial surveys for seven years in a generalized linear model, which accounted for temporal correlation, to investigate the effect of six socioeconomic and ecological variables on the number of elephant at the country level in the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area (GMTFCA). Important factors in predicting elephant numbers were the proportion of total land surface under cultivation, human population density and the number of tourists visiting the country. Specifically, elephant numbers were higher where the proportion of total land surface under cultivation was the lowest; where population density was the lowest and where tourist numbers had increased over the years. Our results confirm that human disturbance is affecting elephant numbers, but highlight that the benefits provided by ecotourism could help enhance elephant conservation. While future studies should include larger areas and more detailed data at the site level, we stress that the development of coordinated legislation and policies to improve land-use planning are needed to reduce the impact of increasing human populations and agriculture on elephant.

AB  - Mapping suitable habitat for a species at risk is one of the first steps in a conservation plan. Creating habitat suitability maps can be very challenging when the area of interest is large and located in remote areas where field excursions can be difficult to implement. Such is the case for the Blanding's turtle, a threatened species in Ontario, that live on the Georgian Bay archipelago. With increasing anthropogenic pressures, maps indicating suitable habitat can aid management decisions and prioritize areas for protection. We apply an interdisciplinary approach using traditional field data and generalized linear models to produce high resolution, regional maps which identify suitable habitat for Blanding's turtles throughout the archipelago. We assessed the accuracy of our models using an independent survey dataset of 16 island sites distributed throughout the archipelago, and evaluated models using a reference island as a threshold for determining suitability of survey sites. Islands with higher proportions of wetlands and vernal pools were generally considered to be suitable for Blanding's turtles compared to those with lower proportions. Our findings highlight the importance of both permanent and temporary wet habitats for Blanding's turtles. Based on our final model, approximately 64% of evaluated islands support habitat for Blanding's turtles. Our study is the first to produce detailed habitat suitability maps for Blanding's turtles on the Georgian Bay archipelago. We recommend an integrative approach be applied to create habitat suitability maps for other species at risk in Georgian Bay. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding marine mammal distributions is essential for conservation, as it can help identify critical habitat where management action can be taken. The semi-enclosed Gulf of Corinth, Greece, has been identified as an Important Marine Mammal Area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Marine Mammal Protected Areas Task Force, based on the regular occurrence of odontocete populations. A 7-year (2011-17) dataset of boat-based surveys was used to model and predict the distribution of striped dolphins, Stenella coeruleoalba, common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, and common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, in the entire Gulf (2400 km(2)). Multiple geographic, bathymetric, oceanographic, and anthropogenic variables were incorporated in a combined generalized additive model and generalized estimation equation (GAM-GEE) framework to describe dolphin occurrence and produce distribution maps. Modelling indicated that striped and common dolphins prefer deep waters (>300 m) in the central and southern part of the Gulf, whereas bottlenose dolphins prefer shallow waters (<300 m) and areas close to fish farms along the northern-central shore. Model-based maps of the predicted distribution identified a preferred habitat encompassing most of the Gulf, also revealing: (i) hot spots of dolphin distribution covering about 40% of the Gulf's surface; (ii) an almost complete overlap of striped and common dolphin distribution, consistent with the hypothesis that common dolphins modified their habitat preferences to live in mixed species groups with striped dolphins; (iii) a clear partitioning of striped/common and bottlenose dolphin habitat; and (iv) the important role played by fish farms for bottlenose dolphins, consistent with studies conducted elsewhere in Greece. Evidence provided by this study calls for area-specific and species-specific management measures to mitigate anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Wild tiger numbers continue to decline despite decades of conservation action. Identification, conservation and restoration of tiger habitat will be a key component of recovering tiger numbers across Asia. To identify suitable habitat for tigers in the Russian Far East, we adopted a niche-based tiger habitat modeling approach, including biotic interactions with ungulate prey species, human activities and environmental variables to identify mechanisms driving selection and distribution of tiger habitat. We conducted >28,000 km of winter snow tracking surveys in 2004/2005 over 266,000 km(2) of potential tiger habitat in 970 sampling units (similar to 171 km(2)) to record the presence of tracks of tigers and their ungulate prey. We adopted a used-unused design to estimate Resource Selection Probability Functions (RSPF) for tigers, red deer, roe deer, sika deer, wild boar, musk deer and moose. Tiger habitat was best predicted by a niche-based RSPF model based on biotic interactions with red deer, sika deer and wild boar, as well as avoidance of areas of high human activity and road density. We identified 155,000 km(2) of occupied tiger habitat in the RFE in 17 main habitat patches. Degradation of tiger habitat was most extreme in the southern areas of the Russian Far East, where at least 42% of potential historic tiger habitat has been destroyed. To improve and restore tiger habitat, aggressive conservation efforts to reduce human impacts and increase ungulate densities, tiger reproduction and adult survival will be needed across all tiger habitat identified by our tiger habitat model.

AB  - Spatial patterns of beta diversity are a major focus of ecology. They can be especially valuable in conservation planning. In this study, we used a generalized dissimilarity modeling approach to analyze and predict the spatial patterns of beta diversity for commercially exploited, demersal marine species assemblages along the Tunisian coasts. For this study, we used a presence/absence dataset which included information on 174 species (invertebrates and fishes) and 9 environmental variables. We first performed the modeling analyses and assessed beta diversity using the turnover component of the Jaccard's dissimilarity index. We then performed nonmetric multidimensional scaling to map predicted beta diversity. To delineate the biogeographical regions, we used fuzzy cluster analysis. Finally, we also identified a set of indicator species which characterized the species assemblages in each identified biogeographical region. The predicted beta diversity map revealed two patterns: an inshore-offshore gradient and a south-north latitudinal gradient. Three biogeographical regions were identified and 14 indicator species. These results constitute a first contribution of the bioregionalisation of the Tunisian waters and highlight the issues associated with current fisheries management zones and conservation strategies. Results could be useful to follow an Ecosystem Based Management approach by proposing an objective spatial partitioning of the Tunisian waters. This partitioning could be used to prioritize the adjustment of the actual fisheries management entities, identify current data gaps, inform future scientific surveys and improve current MPA network.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether limited occurrence data for highly threatened species can provide useful spatial information to inform conservation. The study was conducted across central and southern China. We developed a habitat suitability model for the Critically Endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) based on one biotic and three abiotic parameters from single-site locality records, which represent the only relevant environmental data available for this species. We then validated model quality by testing whether increased percentage of predicted suitable habitat at the county level correlated with independent data on giant salamander presence. We randomly selected 48 counties containing historical records which were distinct from, and independent of, the single-site records used to develop the model, and 47 additional counties containing >50% predicted suitable habitat. We interviewed 2,812 respondents near potential giant salamander habitat across these counties and tested for differences in respondent giant salamander reports between counties selected using each method. Our model predicts that suitable giant salamander habitat is found widely across central and southern China, with counties containing 50% predicted suitable habitat distributed in 13 provinces. Counties with historical records contain significantly more predicted suitable habitat than counties without historical records. There are no statistical differences in any patterns of respondent giant salamander reports in surveyed counties selected from our model compared with the areas of known historical giant salamander distribution. A Chinese giant salamander habitat suitability model with strong predictive power can be derived from the restricted range of environmental variables associated with limited available presence-only occurrence records, constituting a cost-effective strategy to guide spatial allocation of conservation planning. Few reported sightings were recent, however, with most being over 20 years old, so that identification of areas of suitable habitat does not necessarily indicate continued survival of the species at these locations.

AB  - The assessment of the conservation status of a species is the first step to prevent local extinction and to plan appropriate, effective and scientifically sound conservation actions, hence knowledge of the distribution, population trends and characteristics of preferred habitat is crucial for the conservation of a species. Galliformes are facing increasing threats related to overhunting, habitat loss and fragmentation, and human disturbance. The Sicilian Rock Partridge (hereafter Rock Partridge) Alectoris graeca whitakeri is a significant conservation unit endemic to Sicily (Italy) classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN due to a decreasing population. Few studies have been conducted on the occurrence and population density of this subspecies. Here, we estimated its population density and identified which habitat factors drive the occurrence of this species on Mt. Etna. We used a combination of sampling methods (species-specific play-back calls, distance sampling, camera-trapping) to collect count and presence/absence data, which were then integrated into a single habitat model (presence vs. absence). We obtained 24 responses from play-back calls (plus 8 individuals observed while performing the play-back calls), 8 sightings from distance sampling, 6 detections from camera-trapping. Probability of occurrence of Rock Partridge on Mt. Etna was positively driven by shrub and meadow vegetation, whereas its occurrence decreased with an increase in both woody areas (coniferous and deciduous) and elevation. Population density estimated using play-back call data resulted in 0.80 pairs/km(2) (95% CI: 0.17-2.22) over an area of 53.7 km(2). The density of Rock Partridge on Mt. Etna appeared to have slightly declined and its distribution undergone a contraction since the previous survey. Several potential threats to the Rock Partridge in Sicily are currently increasing and should be mitigated to ensure the long-term survival of this unique population on Mt. Etna, as well as in the whole island of Sicily.

AB  - Occupancy modeling, an important tool for conservation monitoring, was employed to assess the occupancy status of resident birds of Delhi and their association with persisting habitats, such as woodland, urban and open areas in an urbanized landscape. In the 240 sampling grids, each of 2.5 x 2.5 km, a total of 115 species were recorded during two alternative sampling years 2012 and 2014, out of which 31 terrestrial bird species were retained for the modeling exercise. Species occupancy related strongly to the extent of preferred habitat. Birds from woodland guild showed high occupancy (T) in urban grids with green patches. Distribution maps developed for 31 terrestrial species provided strong evidence that the variations in occupancy values of a species across the study site was linked to the extent of persistent habitat and the type of urbanization taking place. For Delhi, estimates of occupancy for various species can form a baseline to study the future trends. The accelerating trend of urbanization, posing a serious challenge for biodiversity conservation can be most effectively dealt with by incorporating ecological knowledge of urban biodiversity in city planning. As a policy recommendation there is considerable merit in integrating islands of greenery in urban development because of their attractiveness for many types of arboreal birds, besides undertaking new plantation and habitat management programs.

AB  - 1. To manage anthropogenic environmental change for the benefit of biodiversity, we must improve our understanding of the complex relationships between organisms and their environment. We have developed multiscale habitat suitability models (HSMs) for bats, a mobile group of mammals, for a geographically varied region of the UK. We ask whether the models have sufficient accuracy to contribute to informed decision-making in habitat management and in minimizing the impact of climate change and human infrastructural development. 2. We used acoustic surveys supplemented by catching to gather presence data for eight species from 30 sites across the south of the Lake District National Park in NW England. Species were identified by manual and automated extraction and analysis of echolocation calls. Fine-resolution (50 and 100m) habitat maps were generated at twelve spatial scales by calculating the variables across squares of increasing size, from 100 to 6000m, around each focal 50 or 100m square. Presence-only HSM software, MaxEnt, was used to determine the predictive power of each habitat variable at each scale. Multiscale models included data for each variable at the scale at which it had the strongest relationship with the presence of each species. 3. The best multiscale models were selected using fivefold cross-validation, with backwards, stepwise variable removal, whilst minimizing residual spatial autocorrelation and sampling bias. Further tests with independent field data indicated good model transferability across the entire National Park. 4. Foraging bats were generally most strongly associated with variables measured at small spatial scales and distance measures. However, each species responded differently across the range of scales, and strong associations were also found at the largest scale of analysis (6000m). 5. Synthesis and applications. The best models for determining habitat suitability had few variables, making them easy to interpret and use in practical conservation planning. The approach is applicable to any taxa for which reliable presence records are available, providing insight into the potential impacts of land-use and environmental change. Maps identify areas of conservation concern, such as hot spots for diversity, rare or vulnerable species and potential or threatened network corridors, making them useful for ecological impact assessment of proposed developments, and to conservation managers planning habitat creation or improvement.

AB  - The extreme variability in the topography, altitude and climatic conditions in the temperate Grassland Mountains of Southern Africa is associated with the complex mosaic of grassland communities with pockets of woodland patches. Understanding the relationships between plant communities and environmental parameters is essential in biodiversity conservation, especially for current and future climate change predictions. This article focused on the spatial distribution of woodland communities and their associated environmental drivers in the Golden Gate Highlands (GGHNP) National Park in South Africa. A generalized linear model (GLM) assuming a binomial distribution, was used to determine the optimal environmental variables influencing the spatial distribution of the woodland communities. The Coefficient of Variation (CV) was relatively higher for the topographic ruggedness index (68.78%), topographic roughness index (68.03), aspect (60.04%), coarse fragments (37.46%) and the topographic wetness index (31.33) whereas soil pH, bulk density, sandy and clay contents had relatively less variation (2.39%, 3.23%, 7.56% and 8.46% respectively). In determining the optimal number of environmental variables influencing the spatial distribution of woodland communities, roughness index, topographic wetness index, soil coarse fragments, soil organic carbon, soil cation exchange capacity and remote-sensing based vegetation condition index were significant (p < 0.05) and positively correlated with the woodland communities. Soil nitrogen, clay content, soil pH, fire and elevation were also significant but negatively correlated with the woodland communities. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was 0.81. This was indicative of a Parsimonious Model with explanatory predictive power for determination of optimal environmental variables in vegetation ecology.
   Conservation implications: The isolated woodland communities are sources of floristic diversity and important biogeographical links between larger forest areas in the wider Drakensberg region. They provide suitable habitats for a larger number of forest species and harbour some of the endemic tree species of South Africa. They also provide watershed protection and other important ecosystem services. Understanding the drivers influencing the spatial distribution and persistence of these woodland communities is therefore key to conservation planning in the area.

AB  - Ecological restoration is essential in rehabilitating degraded areas and safeguarding biodiversity, ecosystem services and human welfare. Using functional traits to plan restoration strategies has been suggested as they are the main ecological attributes that underlie ecosystem processes and services. However, few studies have translated ecological theory into actual restoration practices that can be easily used by different stakeholders. In this article, we applied a multiple-trait approach to select plant species for the restoration of degraded lands inside the Brazilian Amazon Forests. We selected 10 traits encompassing ease of management, geographical distribution and interactions with animals and other ecosystem services and scored these traits using 118 native species. Then, we ranked all species according to the total number of traits that they exhibited to obtain a list of 53 highly ranked species. In addition, we employed non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to assess the variation in these traits across the entire group of species. Based on the results, we selected a subset of species that maximizes functional diversity (high variability). We performed a sparse linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) to highlight a minimum set of traits to effectively discriminate botanical families. The final list of species and their traits highlight the importance of preserving not only the historical reference of a focused ecosystem but also its functional diversity to restore the interaction with local fauna, enrich the food chain and guarantee ecosystem services for local communities.

AB  - In South America the biogeographic history has produced different biomes with different vegetation types and distinct floras. As these vegetation types may diverge in evolutionary histories, we analysed how alpha and beta phylogenetic diversity vary across them and determine the main drivers of variation in phylogenetic diversity. To this end, we compiled a list of 205 sites and 1222 tree species spread over four biomes and eight vegetation types in central South America. For each site we evaluated six measures of evolutionary alpha diversity (species richness, phylogenetic diversity sensu stricto and the standardized effect size of phylogenetic diversity, mean phylogenetic distance and mean nearest taxon distance) and beta diversity (phylogenetic Sorensen's similarity). We checked the influence of spatial and environmental variables using generalized least squares models. The greatest phylogenetic differentiation was found between west and east of central South America, mainly between the Chaco communities and the other vegetation types, suggesting that species found in this biome come from different lineages, comparing with the others vegetation types. Our results also showed a clustered phylogenetic structure for the Dry Chaco woodlands, which may be associated with harsh environmental conditions. In addition to historical process, climatic conditions are the main drivers shaping phylogenetic patterns among the distinct vegetation types. Understanding patterns of phylogenetic diversity and distribution can greatly improve conservation planning and management since it allows the conservation of unique biome characteristics.

AB  - Canopy forming macroalgae are declining globally due to climate change and the identification of refuges for these habitats is crucial for their conservation. This is particularly pertinent in ocean warming hotspots where significant range contractions of kelp have occurred and are projected to continue. We developed a stacked urchin-kelp species distribution model (SDM) to predict climate refugia for kelp (Ecklonia radiata) in an ocean warming hotspot, south-eastern Australia. The optimal stacked-SDM incorporated biotic and abiotic explanatory covariates and was validated using an independent dataset. Density of the urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii, summer bottom temperature and photosynthetically available radiation at the seabed were significant predictors of kelp cover, highlighting the physiological and ecological influence of these variables on the distribution of kelp. Our optimal stacked-SDM predicted three spatially distinct refuge areas, where kelp occurs in deeper waters than surrounding seascapes. The presence of kelp at two of these refuge areas was confirmed using independent data. The identification of these refuge areas is crucial for conservation, as they are likely to facilitate the persistence of ecologically and economically important kelp forests as waters warm in shallow areas and kelp retreat to depth under climate change. Furthermore, identification of refugia will enable proactive spatial planning that prioritises new locations for protection to ensure that key kelp habitats can persist in a future of increasing stress.

AB  - Climate change has affected the geographical distributions of most species worldwide; in particular, insects of economic importance inhabiting tropical regions have been impacted. Current and future predictions of change in geographic distribution are frequently included in species distribution models (SDMs). The potential spatial distributions of the fruit fly Anastrepha striata Schiner, the main species of agricultural importance in guava crops, under current and possible future scenarios in Colombia were modeled, and the establishment risk was assessed for each guava-producing municipality in the country. SDMs were developed using 221 geographical records in conjunction with nine scenopoetic variables. The model for current climate conditions indicated an extensive suitable area for the establishment of A. striata in the Andean region, smaller areas in the Caribbean and Pacific, and almost no areas in the Orinoquia and Amazonian regions. A brief discussion regarding the area's suitability for the fly is offered. According to the results, altitude is one of the main factors that direct the distribution of A. striata in the tropics. The Colombian guava-producing municipalities were classified according to the degree of vulnerability to fly establishment as follows: 42 were high risk, 16 were intermediate risk, and 17 were low risk. The implementation of future integrated management plans must include optimal spatial data and must consider environmental aspects, such as those suggested by the models presented here. Control decisions should aim to mitigate the positive relationship between global warming and the increase in the dispersal area of the fruit fly.

AB  - Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne pathogen that infects the roots of plants, is listed as a Key Threatening Process under Commonwealth and NSW state biodiversity legislation due to its deleterious effects on native flora. In warm temperate eastern Australia, the disease may cause insidious declines in plant species that have slow rates of population turnover, and thereby threaten their long term persistence. Phytophthora cinnamomi has been known to occur in Royal National Park since the 1970s and systematic surveys for the pathogen were carried out a decade ago. Development of effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of the disease requires information on the spatial distribution of risks posed by the disease. In this study, we use limited disease survey data to identify areas that are most at risk. We propose and apply a simple risk model in which risks of disease impact are proportional to the product of habitat suitability for the pathogen and abundance of susceptible biota. We modelled habitat suitability of the pathogen from available survey data and found that soil landscapes and topographic variables were the strongest predictors. Susceptible flora were concentrated on sandstone plateaus. Disease risks were greatest on the sandstone plateaus and lowest in the shale gullies with intermediate levels of risk on shale ridges and the coastal sand plain. The outcomes of this spatially explicit risk assessment will help inform the development of management strategies and priorities for the disease in the Park. Our approach lends itself to broader application to conservation planning in other landscapes and to other threats to biodiversity.

AB  - Capsule Spatial environmental modelling well predicted nesting distribution of the White stork in Southeast Europe and can be used in conservation planning with respect to climate change.
   Aims To create spatial models for predicting White Stork presence and densities in the Southeast Europe to identify areas of suitable habitat for White Storks.
   Methods We quantified the habitat used by nesting White storks in Southeast Europe. Using spatial modelling, we defined a set of free and available online environmental variables that predict the breeding localities of the species. We employed pseudo-absences and the kriging of the residuals in order to create predictive models of nest presence and density.
   Results The presence-absence model was found to be precise in predicting the presence of nests. Both density and presence of breeding pairs were best explained negatively by elevation, slope, minimum temperature during May, and distance to the nearest human settlement and positively by topographic wetness index, total area of human settlement and spring precipitation.
   Conclusion Our robust and easily repeatable models offer a conservation tool to reveal suitable but unoccupied localities for breeding White Storks pairs which may inform our understanding of how climate change might affect the species' distribution in the future. For example, protecting White Storks on the Dalmatian coast may become even more significant in the future, because the Dalmatian coast is predicted as the only suitable breeding area in Croatia later this century.

AB  - Understanding species' distribution patterns and the environmental and ecological interactions that drive them is fundamental for biodiversity conservation. Data deficiency exists in areas that are difficult to access, or where resources are limited. We use a broad-scale, non-targeted dataset to describe dolphin distribution and habitat suitability in remote north Western Australia, where there is a paucity of data to adequately inform species management. From 1,169 opportunistic dolphin sightings obtained from 10 dugong aerial surveys conducted over a four-year period, there were 661 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), 191 Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis), nine Australian snubfin dolphin (Orcaella heinsohni), 16 Stenella sp., one killer whale (Orcinus orca), one false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and 290 unidentified dolphin species sightings. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) habitat suitability models identified shallow intertidal areas around mainland coast, islands and shoals as important areas for humpback dolphins. In contrast, bottlenose dolphins are more likely to occur further offshore and at greater depths, suggesting niche partitioning between these two sympatric species. Bottlenose dolphin response to sea surface temperature is markedly different between seasons (positive in May; negative in October) and probably influenced by the Leeuwin Current, a prominent oceanographic feature. Our findings support broad marine spatial planning, impact assessment and the design of future surveys, which would benefit from the collection of high-resolution digital images for species identification verification. A substantial proportion of data were removed due to uncertainties resulting from non-targeted observations and this is likely to have reduced model performance. We highlight the importance of considering climatic and seasonal fluctuations in interpreting distribution patterns and species interactions in assuming habitat suitability.

AB  - The species is landlocked, and this life history contributes substantially to its strong population differentiation at the very small geographical scale. Given its widespread distribution, it serves as an excellent model for examining population connectivity and phylogeographical history of freshwater invertebrates in South China. This study isolated ten microsatellite loci from genome sequences of C. cantonensis and four from the transcriptome assemblies of Neocaridina davidi. The microsatellites were then characterized in 24 C. cantonensis individuals from one population. The number of alleles ranged from seven to 18. Observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.050 to 0.958 (averaged 0.649) and 0.754 to 0.919 (averaged 0.833), respectively. We also assessed the cross-species transferability of the markers developed across eight confamilial species. On average, nine markers can be amplified in each species, and five markers can be amplified across all eight species. The markers developed in this study would enable evaluation of genetic diversity and population structure of these species for conservation management planning.

AB  - Tumih / Parepat (Combretocarpus-rotundatus Mig. Deneer) of the family Anisophylleaceae and Meranti (Shorea Belangerang, ShoreaTeysmanniana Dyer ex. Brandis) of Dipterocarpaceae are groups of species of vegetation that is modeled for the designation of its spread. Pioneer species are predicted as an indicator of ecosystem restoration succession of wet tropical peatland characteristic (unique) and very susceptible (fragile) in an endemic Sundaland hotspot. Projected climate change and conservation planning a topic of heated discussion, the analysis of alternative approaches and the development of a combination of search algorithm projection models within the fabric of the diffusion of the species to attain this through a geospatial information system technology. Model approach used to work out problems in research on this vegetation species level based machine learning is a method (hybrid), which is a combination of wavelet and neural network. Often the approach to field data into general use in the management of natural resources and biodiversity assessment. Expression of the hybrid models provides encouraging results, to decide the classification of the species Tumih / Parepat and Meranti through mapping of vegetation species that are backed up by the pattern of the spectral curve of the field spectrometer.

AB  - The brook chub (Squalius lucumonis) is a freshwater fish, endemic of Central Italy, which is experiencing a rapid range decline so that it is presently listed as Critically Endangered in the Italian IUCN Red List. For effective conservation, information about the spatial pattern of genetic diversity is crucial. Therefore, we analysed the mitochondrial Control Region and nuclear (microsatellites) markers to investigate population genetic structure, demography and spatial diversity over the whole species distribution range. We revealed significant divergence among populations, even at the local spatial scale, according to the isolation by distance model. At the biogeographic spatial scale, genetic diversity was shaped by past hydrogeological and climatic events that iso-lated the principal drainage basins (Vara, Tiber and Arno) from each other. On the other hand, strong genetic differentiation within the Tiber drainage basin could be due to local factors that acted at single-stream scale, as recent barriers to fish dispersal and irregular seasonal flow rates typical of small Mediterranean streams. Our findings contribute to the basal data collection on S. lucumonis required by European Habitats Directive and necessary for planning protection actions. We recommend that the three river drainages and most of the sampling sites should be regarded as different Management Units (MUs) to preserve their genetic distinctiveness. A recovery plan for the brook chub should consider environmental intervention and creation of protected areas, as well as in situ/ex situ restocking activities with juveniles produced by breeders from the same MU, to preserve local (adaptive) diversity.

AB  - Background: Resolving threats to widely distributed marine megafauna requires definition of the geographic distributions of both the threats as well as the population unit(s) of interest. In turn, because individual threats can operate on varying spatial scales, their impacts can affect different segments of a population of the same species. Therefore, integration of multiple tools and techniques - including site-based monitoring, genetic analyses, mark-recapture studies and telemetry - can facilitate robust definitions of population segments at multiple biological and spatial scales to address different management and research challenges.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To address these issues for marine turtles, we collated all available studies on marine turtle biogeography, including nesting sites, population abundances and trends, population genetics, and satellite telemetry. We georeferenced this information to generate separate layers for nesting sites, genetic stocks, and core distributions of population segments of all marine turtle species. We then spatially integrated this information from fine-to coarse-spatial scales to develop nested envelope models, or Regional Management Units (RMUs), for marine turtles globally.
   Conclusions/Significance: The RMU framework is a solution to the challenge of how to organize marine turtles into units of protection above the level of nesting populations, but below the level of species, within regional entities that might be on independent evolutionary trajectories. Among many potential applications, RMUs provide a framework for identifying data gaps, assessing high diversity areas for multiple species and genetic stocks, and evaluating conservation status of marine turtles. Furthermore, RMUs allow for identification of geographic barriers to gene flow, and can provide valuable guidance to marine spatial planning initiatives that integrate spatial distributions of protected species and human activities. In addition, the RMU framework - including maps and supporting metadata - will be an iterative, user-driven tool made publicly available in an online application for comments, improvements, download and analysis.

AB  - Human-induced alteration of habitat is a major threat to biodiversity worldwide, especially in areas of high biological diversity and endemism. Polylepis (Rosaceae) forest, a unique forest habitat in the high Andes of South America, presently occurs as small and isolated patches in grassland dominated landscapes. We examine how the avian community is likely influenced by patch characteristics (i.e., area, plant species composition) and connectivity in a landscape composed of patches of Polylepis forest surrounded by paramo grasslands in Cajas National Park in the Andes of southern Ecuador. We used generalized linear mixed models and an information-theoretic approach to identify the most important variables probably influencing birds inhabiting 26 forest patches. Our results indicated that species richness was associated with area of a patch and floristic composition, particularly the presence of Gynoxys (Asteraceae). However, connectivity of patches probably influenced the abundance of forest and generalists species. Elsewhere, it has been proposed that effective management plans for birds using Polylepis should promote the conservation of mature Polylepis patches. Our results not only suggest this but also show that there are additional factors, such as the presence of Gynoxys plants, which will probably play a role in conservation of birds. More generally, these findings show that while easily measured attributes of the patch and landscape may provide some insights into what influences patch use by birds, knowledge of other factors, such as plant species composition, is essential for better understanding the distribution of birds in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Aim On the basis of multitaxon biogeographical processes related to region-specific geohistory and palaeoclimate, we identified a balanced and area-effective protected area network (PAN) expansion in the East Asian islands, a global biodiversity hotspot. Location Japanese archipelago, Ryukyu archipelago and Izu-Bonin oceanic islands. Methods We modelled the distributions of 6,325 species (amphibians, birds, freshwater fish, mammals, plants and reptiles) using 4,389,489 occurrence data points. We then applied the Zonation software for spatial conservation prioritization. First, we identified environmental drivers underpinning taxon-specific biodiversity patterns. Second, we analysed each taxon individually to understand baseline priority patterns. Third, we combined all taxa into an inclusive analysis to identify the most important PAN expansions. Results Biodiversity patterns were well explained by geographical factors (climate, habitat stability, isolation and area), but their explanatory power differed between the taxa. There was remarkably little overlap between priority areas for the individual higher taxa. The inclusive prioritization analysis across all taxa identified priority regions, in particular in southern subtropical and mountainous areas. Expanding the PAN up to 17% would cover most of the ranges for rare and/or restricted-range species. On average, approximately 30% of the ranges of all species could be covered by the 17% expansion identified here. Main conclusions Our analyses identified top candidates for the expansion of Japan's protected area network. Taxon-specific prioritization was informative for understanding the conservation priority patterns of different taxa associated with unique biogeographical processes. For the basis of PAN expansion, we recommend multi-taxon prioritization as an area-efficient compromise that reflects taxon-specific priority patterns. Spatial prioritization across multiple taxa provides a promising start for the development of conservation plans with the aim of long-term persistence of biodiversity on the East Asian islands.

AB  - Aim Species inhabiting fresh waters are severely affected by climate change and other anthropogenic stressors. Effective management and conservation plans require advances in the accuracy and reliability of species distribution forecasts. Here, we forecast distribution shifts of Salmo trutta based on environmental predictors and examine the effect of using different statistical techniques and varying geographical extents on the performance and extrapolation of the models obtained.
   Location Watercourses of Ebro, Elbe and Danube river basins (c. 1,041,000 km(2); Mediterranean and temperate climates, Europe).
   Methods The occurrence of S. trutta and variables of climate, land cover and stream topography were assigned to stream reaches. Data obtained were used to build correlative species distribution models (SDMs) and forecasts for future decades (2020s, 2050s and 2080s) under the A1b emissions scenario, using four statistical techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, random forest, and multivariate adaptive regression).
   Results The SDMs showed an excellent performance. Climate was a better predictor than stream topography, while land cover characteristics were not necessary to improve performance. Forecasts predict the distribution of S. trutta to become increasingly restricted over time. The geographical extent of data had a weak impact on model performance and gain/loss values, but better species response curves were generated using data from all three basins collectively. By 2080, 64% of the stream reaches sampled will be unsuitable habitats for S. trutta, with Elbe basin being the most affected, and virtually no new habitats will be gained in any basin.
   Main conclusions More reliable predictions are obtained when the geographical data used for modelling approximate the environmental range where the species is present. Future research incorporating both correlative and mechanistic approaches may increase robustness and accuracy of predictions.

AB  - Following a recent assessment of the distribution and habitat use of Gurney's Pitta in Myanmar (Burma), further extensive surveys were undertaken in 2010, 2011 and 2012. These have extended the species' known altitudinal limit to between 250 m and 300 m asl and its latitudinal limit to above 12.5 degrees N, around 80 km north of the northernmost historical record, although the species was recorded far less frequently at higher altitudes and latitudes. Birds were recorded in a range of forested habitats, from intact primary forest to secondary and bamboo forest, with no significant difference between major forest types in the likelihood of occurrence. Niche envelope modelling (MaxEnt) suggested a total range size in Myanmar of 3,379 km(2), and did not identify any potentially suitable areas in adjacent parts of Thailand. The species' preference for warmer, wetter areas on flat ground, conditions ideal for growing oil palm and rubber, suggest that its distribution is likely to contract in the near future. The entire range of Gurney's Pitta in Myanmar falls within the part of the country most suitable for commercial oil palm production, although the projected yields within its range are low to moderate. Field surveys found evidence of rapid recent deforestation and high levels of hunting and trapping in many parts of the region. The species' range in Myanmar does not overlap with any protected areas. The protection of southern Myanmar's biodiversity will require substantial investment by foreign conservation interests, sympathetic land-use planning and the strengthening of environment legislation. Protection of extensive tracts of lowland forest within the range of Gurney's Pitta, particularly the proposed Lenya National Park and the adjacent Ngawun and Htaung Pru Reserve Forests, is urgently needed. Conserving these areas will also protect populations of other globally threatened bird and mammal species.

AB  - Many regions of South Africa are prone to woody plant thickening. This can have an ecologically detrimental effect on the open savannas and grasslands. KwaZulu-Natal, a province on the east coast of South Africa, is currently experiencing an increase in both the density and distribution of Vachellia nilotica. This research aims to gain better insight into the potential distribution of this plant and to determine some of the main environmental conditions that promote its thickening. Using the Maxent programme to determine the potential distribution, a map was developed to illustrate the possible extent of V. nilotica within KwaZulu-Natal. It is estimated that a possible 800 968 ha (8.5%) of the province has a greater than 50% distribution probability, whereas in 26.9% of the province there is 25%-50% probability of V. nilotica inhabiting these areas. Using Maxent, it was determined that geology and altitude were key determinants for V. nilotica habitat selection. This model-based map will be particularly useful for conservation and rangeland planning for future management and control of the plant through being able to predict which areas of the province are more likely to be high potential regions for the thickening of V. nilotica.

AB  - Species distribution models have been widely used to predict species distributions for various purposes, including conservation planning, and climate change impact assessment. The success of these applications relies heavily on the accuracy of the models. Various measures have been proposed to assess the accuracy of the models. Rigorous statistical analysis should be incorporated in model accuracy assessment. However, since relevant information about the statistical properties of accuracy measures is scattered across various disciplines, ecologists find it difficult to select the most appropriate ones for their research. In this paper, we review accuracy measures that are currently used in species distribution modelling (SDM), and introduce additional metrics that have potential applications in SDM. For the commonly used measures (which are also intensively studied by statisticians), including overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, kappa, and area and partial area under the ROC curves, promising methods to construct confidence intervals and statistically compare the accuracy between two models are given. For other accuracy measures, methods to estimate standard errors are given, which can be used to construct approximate confidence intervals. We also suggest that as general tools, computer-intensive methods, especially bootstrap and randomization methods can be used in constructing confidence intervals and statistical tests if suitable analytic methods cannot be found. Usually, these computer-intensive methods provide robust results.

AB  - In April 2019, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) released its recovery plan for the jaguar Panthera onca after several decades of discussion, litigation and controversy about the status of the species in the USA. The USFWS estimated that potential habitat, south of the Interstate-10 highway in Arizona and New Mexico, had a carrying capacity of c. six jaguars, and so focused its recovery programme on areas south of the USA-Mexico border. Here we present a systematic review of the modelling and assessment efforts over the last 25 years, with a focus on areas north of Interstate-10 in Arizona and New Mexico, outside the recovery unit considered by the USFWS. Despite differences in data inputs, methods, and analytical extent, the nine previous studies found support for potential suitable jaguar habitat in the central mountain ranges of Arizona and New Mexico. Applying slightly modified versions of the USFWS model and recalculating an Arizona-focused model over both states provided additional confirmation. Extending the area of consideration also substantially raised the carrying capacity of habitats in Arizona and New Mexico, from six to 90 or 151 adult jaguars, using the modified USFWS models. This review demonstrates the crucial ways in which choosing the extent of analysis influences the conclusions of a conservation plan. More importantly, it opens a new opportunity for jaguar conservation in North America that could help address threats from habitat losses, climate change and border infrastructure.

AB  - 1. To develop a conservation management plan for a species, knowledge of its distribution and spatial arrangement of preferred habitat is essential. This is a difficult task, especially when the species of concern is in low abundance. In south-western Victoria, Australia, populations of the rare rufous bristlebird Dasyornis broadbenti are threatened by fragmentation of suitable habitat. In order to improve the conservation status of this species, critical habitat requirements must be identified and a system of corridors must be established to link known populations. A predictive spatial model of rufous bristlebird habitat was developed in order to identify critical areas requiring preservation, such as corridors for dispersal.
   2. Habitat models generated using generalized linear modelling techniques can assist in delineating the specific habitat requirements of a species. Coupled with geographic information system (GIS) technology, these models can be extrapolated to produce maps displaying the spatial configuration of suitable habitat.
   3. Models were generated using logistic regression, with bristlebird presence or absence as the dependent variable and landscape variables, extracted from both GIS data layers and multispectral digital imagery, as the predictors. A multimodel inference approach based on Akaike's information criterion was used and the resulting model was applied in a GIS to extrapolate predicted likelihood of occurrence across the entire area of concern. The predictive performance of the selected model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) technique. A hierarchical partitioning protocol was used to identify the predictor variables most likely to influence variation in the dependent variable. Probability of species presence was used as an index of habitat suitability.
   4. Negative associations between rufous bristlebird presence and increasing elevation, 'distance to creek', 'distance to coast' and sun index were evident, suggesting a preference for areas relatively low in altitude, in close proximity to the coastal fringe and drainage lines, and receiving less direct sunlight. A positive association with increasing habitat complexity also suggested that this species prefers areas containing high vertical density of vegetation.
   5. The predictive performance of the selected model was shown to be high (area under the curve 0.97), indicating a good fit of the model to the data. Hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that all the variables considered had significant independent contributions towards explaining the variation in the dependent variable. The proportion of the total study area that was predicted as suitable habitat for the rufous bristlebird (using probability of occurrence at a greater than or equal to 0.5 level) was 16%.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The spatial model clearly delineated areas predicted as highly suitable rufous bristlebird habitat, with evidence of potential corridors linking coastal and inland populations via gullies. Conservation of this species will depend on management actions that protect the critical habitats identified in the model. A multiscale approach to the modelling process is recommended whereby a spatially explicit model is first generated using landscape variables extracted from a GIS, and a second model at site level is developed using fine-scale habitat variables measured on the ground. Where there are constraints on the time and cost involved in measuring finer scale variables, the first step alone can be used for conservation planning.

AB  - The Italian hare (Lepus corsicanus) is endemic to Central-Southern Italy and Sicily, classified as vulnerable due to habitat alterations, low density and fragmented populations and ecological competition with the sympatric European hare (Lepus europaeus). Despite this status, only few and local studies have explored its ecological features. We provided some key traits of the ecological niche of the Italian hare as well as its potential distribution in the Italian peninsula. All data derived from genetically validated presences. We generated a habitat suitability model using maximum entropy distribution model for the Italian hare and its main competitor, the European hare. The dietary habits were obtained for the Italian hare with DNA metabarcoding and High-Throughput Sequencing on faecal pellets. The most relevant environmental variables affecting the potential distribution of the Italian hare are shared with the European hare, suggesting a potential competition. The variation in the observed altitudinal distribution is statistically significant between the two species.The diet of the Italian hare all year around includes 344 plant taxa accounted by 62 families. The Fagaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae and Solanaceae (counts>20,000) represented the 90.22% of the total diet. Fabaceae (60.70%) and Fagaceae (67.47%) were the most abundant plant items occurring in the Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter diets, respectively. The Spring/Summer diet showed richness (N=266) and diversity index values (Shannon: 2.329, Evenness: 0.03858, Equitability: 0.4169) higher than the Autumn/Winter diet (N=199, Shannon: 1.818, Evenness: 0.03096, Equitability: 0.3435). Our contribution adds important information to broaden the knowledge on the environmental (spatial and trophic) requirements of the Italian hare, representing effective support for fitting management actions in conservation planning.

AB  - Conservation planning for wildlife species requires mapping and assessment of habitat suitability across broad areas, often relying on a diverse suite, or stack, of geospatial data presenting multidimensional controls on a species. Stacks of univariate, independently developed vegetation layers may not represent relationships between each variable that can be characterized by multivariate modeling techniques, leading to inaccurate inferences on the distribution of suitable habitat. In this paper, we examine the role of variable combining in mapping multiple dimensions of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus, GRSG) habitat as a basis for GRSG conservation in the great basin ecoregion within southeastern Oregon. We compare two modeling approaches: a univariate random forest regression model (RF regression) and a multivariate random forest nearest neighbor (RFNN) imputation model , across an array of variables. These include five GRSG habitat descriptor variables: percent cover of trees, juniper, sagebrush, and GRSG food forbs, and the proportion of grasses that are exotic annuals. We also model species distributions of 51 common species in the sage steppe and combine these predictions to estimate alpha diversity. Our results show that RF regression and RFNN can yield univariate predictions with similar performance, but RF regression predictions tend to contain slightly more bias at broader spatial scales. Stacking univariate predictions from RF regression yields covariance errors that manifest as logical errors (juniper cover > tree cover), biases in estimates of GRSG habitat area, and biases in estimates of alpha diversity. Combining variables from the RFNN model does not introduce covariance errors. We conclude that multivariate modeling approaches are better suited to map multidimensional habitat niches at broader spatial scales, and also better suited to provide information for defining multivariable adaptive management triggers at the population level or above.

AB  - We studied habitat selection of three-toed woodpecker (TTW) in relation to forest structural variables, habitat types and hydrological conditions in north-eastern Poland. Based on known locations of 34 breeding pairs and the data on location of forest areas with high conservation value (referred to as Biologically Important Forests), we created a habitat prediction model for TTW using a Maxent algorithm. We found that this species most often selected breeding sites characterized by high contribution of old-growth stands with uneven vertical structure and considerable amount of very old trees of previous generations, as well as boreal spruce-dominated bogs and riverine forests. Such sites were preferred regardless of their actual protection status, which leads to the following conclusion: although existing forest reserves are very important to three-toed woodpecker, suitable habitats with similar characteristics can still be found outside protected areas and are also utilized by the species. However, such sites outside reserves are threatened by fragmentation due to timber extraction. Therefore it is recommended to protect these sites by either including them into existing reserves or putting them under special management schemes.
   The presented model can be applied in similar environmental conditions across lowland Europe, allowing for identification of representative habitat network for future conservation planning at landscape scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Classifying the status of threatened species using tools such as the IUCN Red List is a critical step for identifying at-risk species, and for conservation planning at global and sub-global levels. The requirement for data on population trends, geographic ranges and population sizes has proved challenging to carry out at the national level, especially in countries with unstructured and spatially limited monitoring schemes and limited conservation resources. In this study, we investigated the repeatability of risk assessments made under the IUCN Red List guidelines for assessment at the national level. Specifically, we assessed the national threat status of breeding and non-breeding populations of Anatidae in Iran using population and distribution data. The variable quality of these data led to uncertainties in decision-making. To evaluate the impact of these uncertainties on population trend estimates, we generated a range of alternative possible threat categories under three scenarios of population trend estimation. For the non-breeding populations, for which long-term population data were available, we were able to classify 93% of species, 72% of which were placed in threatened categories. For the breeding populations, 78% of the species were categorized as Data Deficient. Of those species in data-sufficient categories, 67% were classified as threatened. We conclude that effective use of the IUCN categories and criteria at the national level is hampered in situations where monitoring schemes have a short history. Therefore, available data need to be complemented with some level of standardized data collection. We further make suggestions about efficient means of data collection in such cases and the importance of the use of modeling techniques prior to Red Listing and discuss the most useful IUCN criteria for threat categorization in such circumstances.

AB  - Vegetation structure is identified as an important biodiversity indicator providing the physical environment that generates, supports, and maintains forest biodiversity. Airborne lidar systems (light detection and ranging) have the capacity to accurately measure three-dimensional vegetation structure, and have been widely used in wildlife habitat mapping and species distribution modeling. Large-area structural inventories using lidar-derived variables that characterize generic habitat structure have rarely been done, yet would be helpful for guiding biodiversity monitoring and conservation assessments of species at regional levels. This study provides a novel approach for processing regional-scale lidar data into categorical classes representing natural groupings of habitat structure. We applied cluster analysis on six lidar-derived habitat-related variables to classify vegetation structure into eight classes for the forested areas of ten natural subregions in boreal and foothill forests in Alberta, Canada. Structure classes were compared across different natural subregions and under anthropogenic/non-anthropogenic disturbance regimes. We found that the Lower Foothills Natural Subregions had the most complex vegetation structure, and wildfire was the most prevalent disturbance agent for all classes except for the rarest class (i.e. stands with high standard deviations of height and low canopy cover) which was more heavily altered by timber harvesting. This data product provides continuous, regional mapping of vegetation structure directly measured from lidar, with a spatial resolution (30 m) relatively finer than what was provided by polygon-based forest inventories. This vegetation structure classification and its associated spatial distribution address the fundamental issue of habitat structure in biodiversity monitoring. It can serve as a base layer used together with species and land cover data for forest resources planning, species distribution and animal movement modeling, as well as prioritization of conservation efforts on critical habitat structures.

AB  - Aim The distribution of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the deep sea is poorly understood. This has led to the emergence of modelling methods to predict the occurrence of suitable habitat for conservation planning in data-sparse areas. Recent global analyses for cold-water corals predict a high probability of occurrence along the slopes of continental margins, offshore banks and seamounts in the north-eastern Atlantic, but tend to overestimate the extent of the habitat and do not provide the detail needed for finer-scale assessments and protected area planning. Using Lophelia pertusa reefs as an example, this study integrates multibeam bathymetry with a wide range of environmental data to produce a regional high-resolution habitat suitability map relevant for marine spatial planning.
   Location Irish continental margin (extended continental shelf claim).
   Methods Maximum entropy modelling was used to predict L. pertusa reef distribution at a spatial resolution of 0.002 degrees. Coral occurrences were assembled from public databases, publications and video footage, and filtered for quality. Environmental predictor variables were produced by re-sampling of global oceanographic data sets and a regional ocean circulation model. Multi-scale terrain parameters were computed from multibeam bathymetry.
   Results Suitable habitat was predicted on mound features and in canyon areas along a narrow band following the slopes of the Irish continental margin, the Rockall Bank and the Porcupine Bank. Standard deviation of the seabed slope (54%), temperature (28%) and bottom shear stress (9%) were the most important variables to predict coral distribution.
   Main conclusions This is the first regional coral habitat suitability modelling study to incorporate full coverage multibeam bathymetry in the deep sea. The use of high-resolution environmental data and quality-controlled distribution data significantly reduces habitat overestimation demonstrated by global-scale analyses and produces detailed maps to support marine protected area network design. The strong response of the corals to local-scale terrain variability highlights the need to protect the seabed from anthropogenic impacts that may reduce its complexity, such as bottom trawling.

AB  - The distribution of free-feeding insect herbivores in Brazilian savanna was studied in the National Park of Serra do Cipo. Insect samples were obtained with sweep nets across cerrado (savanna), rupestrian field and altitudinal grassland vegetation from 800 to 1500 m above sea level. We found a low species richness in xeric and mesic habitats during both wet and dry seasons. Sap-sucking insects were the most abundant guild (53.4%) with Cicadellidae the most abundant family (27.2%). The hypothesis that taxon richness of free-feeding insects decreases with increasing altitude was supported in xeric habitats during the wet season only, mainly as a function of mountain summit effect. There was a decrease of 65% in the number of families occurring at 1400 and 1500 m compared with lower elevations. The exclusion of sites of rupestrian vegetation at mid-elevations from the analysis increased significantly the proportion of variance explained by the model. An examination of taxon distribution using canonical variate analysis supported this result. The hypothesis that mesic habitats are richer in species of free-feeding insect herbivores than are xeric habitats was not supported. The data indicate that plant sclerophylly may exert a strong negative influence on insect species richness, and that variation due to particular characteristics of each site strongly affected the studied guilds. The present results should inform conservation strategies for the National Park Management Plan, which is currently being developed.

AB  - Pedicularis longiflora Rudolph and its variant (P. longiflora var. tubiformis (Klotzsch) Tsoong) are alpine plants and traditional Chinese medicines with important medicinal value, and future climate changes may have an adverse impact on their geographic distribution. The maximum entropy (MAXENT) model has the outstanding ability to predict the potential distribution region of species under climate change. Therefore, given the importance of the parameter settings of feature classes (FCs) and the regularization multiplier (RM) of the MAXENT model and the importance of add indicators to evaluate model performance, we used ENMeval to improve the MAXENT niche model and conducted an in-depth study on the potential distributions of these two alpine medicinal plants. We adjusted the parameters of FC and RM in the MAXENT model, evaluated the adjusted MAXENT model using six indicators, determined the most important ecogeographical factors (EGFs) that affect the potential distributions of these plants, and compared their current potential distributions between the adjusted model and the default model. The adjusted model performed better; thus, we used the improved MAXENT model to predict their future potential distributions. The model predicted that P. longiflora Rudolph and its variant (P. longiflora var. tubiformis (Klotzsch) Tsoong) would move northward and showed a decrease in extent under future climate scenarios. This result is important to predict their potential distribution regions under changing climate scenarios to develop effective long-term resource conservation and management plans for these species.

AB  - Predictive studies play a crucial role in the study of biological invasions of terrestrial plants under possible climate change scenarios. Invasive species are recognized for their ability to modify soil mi-crobial communities and influence ecosystem dynamics. Here, we focused on six species of allelopathic flowering plantsdAilanthus altissima, Casuarina equisetifolia, Centaurea stoebe ssp. micranthos, Dioscorea bulbifera, Lantana camara, and Schinus terebinthifoliadthat are invasive in North America and examined their potential to spread further during projected climate change. We used Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to predict future suitable areas for these species in North America under several proposed future climate models. ENMEval and Maxent were used to develop SDMs, estimate current distributions, and predict future areas of suitable climate for each species. Areas with the greatest predicted suitable climate in the future include the northeastern and the coastal northwestern regions of North America. Range size estimations demonstrate the possibility of extreme range loss for these invasives in the southeastern United States, while new areas may become suitable in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. These findings show an overall northward shift of suitable climate during the next few decades, given projected changes in temperature and precipitation. Our results can be utilized to analyze potential shifts in the distribution of these invasive species and may aid in the development of conservation and management plans to target and control dissemination in areas at higher risk for potential future invasion by these allelopathic species.

AB  - Nowadays 37% of Earth's ice-free land is composed by fragments of natural habitats settled in anthropogenic biomes. Therefore, we have to improve our knowledge about distribution of organisms in remnants and to understand how the matrix affects these distributions. In this way, the present study aims to describe the structure of the butterfly assemblages and determined how richness and abundance are influenced by the scale of the surrounding vegetation. General linear models were used to investigate how the type and scale of vegetation cover within a radius of 100-2,000 m around the sampling point explained butterfly diversity. After sampling ten forest fragments we found 6,488 individuals of 73 species. For all clades tested null models explain the species richness at the fragments better than other models when we include the effect of butterfly abundance as a covariate. Abundance of Satyrini, Brassolini, and Biblidinae were best predicted by small scales (100-200 m), and large scales were more suited for Charaxinae. The presence of pasture best explains the abundance of all groups except Charaxinae, which was best explained by early-regrowth forest. The abundance of different species and groups are correlated with different kinds of vegetation cover. However, we demonstrate that small scales (100-200 m) are more effective at explaining the abundance of most butterflies. These results strongly suggest that efforts to preserve insect diversity in forest fragments should take in account the immediate surroundings of the fragment, and not only the regional landscape as a whole. In general, actions of people living near forest fragments are as important to fruit-feeding butterflies as large scale actions are, with the former being seldom specified in management plans or conservation policies.

AB  - Satellite telemetry data are a key source of animal distribution information for marine ecosystem management and conservation activities. We used two decades of telemetry data from the East Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean. Habitat utilization models for the spring/summer period were developed for six highly abundant, wide-ranging meso- and top-predator species: Adelie Pygoscelis adeliae and emperor Aptenodytes forsteri penguins, light-mantled albatross Phoebetria palpebrata, Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella, southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina, and Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii. The regional predictions from these models were combined to identify areas utilized by multiple species, and therefore likely to be of particular ecological significance. These areas were distributed across the longitudinal breadth of the East Antarctic sector, and were characterized by proximity to breeding colonies, both on the Antarctic continent and on subantarctic islands to the north, and by sea-ice dynamics, particularly locations of winter polynyas. These areas of important habitat were also congruent with many of the areas reported to be showing the strongest regional trends in sea ice seasonality. The results emphasize the importance of on-shore and sea-ice processes to Antarctic marine ecosystems. Our study provides ocean-basin-scale predictions of predator habitat utilization, an assessment of contemporary habitat use against which future changes can be assessed, and is of direct relevance to current conservation planning and spatial management efforts.

AB  - Callophrys irus (Frosted Elfin) is threatened under New York State conservation law and has fewer than 5 secure populations within the state. Published research on these populations is needed to support the development of a state recovery plan and monitoring program for the species. We assessed the relationship between adult occupancy (patch use) in the Albany Pine Bush Preserve and a suite of potential controlling factors. We then used the results in a simulation framework to quantitatively inform how many sites and surveys are needed for Frosted Elfin occupancy monitoring. Patch use was best explained by a model that assumed the same occupancy probability for each patch. The species was more likely to use patches with limited shrub cover and greater host plant density, yet showed a good chance (>= 76%) of using even the smaller patches (<1 ha) with relatively sparse density (<1000 ramets ha(-1)). Detection probability depended primarily on observer and survey date, ranging from 0.34 to 0.94 among observers and from 0.35 to 0.96 across surveys. In the worst-case scenario (i.e., low detectability and low intrinsic occupancy rate), minimum effort for adult Frosted Elfin occupancy monitoring in habitat similar to the Albany Pine Bush may require at least 20 habitat patches surveyed 6 times each or at least 10 habitat patches surveyed 8 times each. Less effort (e.g., 10 sites x 4 surveys) will likely suffice if surveys are restricted to the period of peak abundance. Adult occupancy (or patch use) is probably the most efficient state variable for monitoring Frosted Elfin populations, and changes in detection-corrected occupancy rate or proportion of area occupied could be useful for conservation planning.

AB  - We conducted an analysis of species associations using fish diversity and abundance surveys conducted in Bonaire Marine Park by recreational divers. We used data from the REEF (Reef Environmental Education Foundation) Fish Survey Project to compute Bray-Curtis similarity coefficients for all species pairs for the 100 most abundant species. We quantified relationships between species using hierarchical agglomerative clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the matrix of Bray-Curtis similarity coefficients. We identified three clusters of species from the analysis. MDS results showed species clusters occupied distinct regions across a continuous gradient of species in two-dimensional space, rather than form distinct clusters. While differences in habitat requirements can explain some of the pattern in pairwise species interactions, these results suggest that there are significant direct and indirect behavioral interactions mediating the distribution and abundance of species. Studies conducted to elucidate patterns of species-habitat relationships have been central to conservation planning for marine protected areas (MPAs). However, the role of behavioral interactions between species driving the dynamics of species composition within MPA networks, designed for representation of biological diversity, should be considered when selecting sites in order to be effective.

AB  - Since the last glacial-interglacial cycles, Mediterranean mountains in Southern Europe have constituted the southern refuge of numerous species of Eurosiberian and Boreal origin. Some vestiges of European Tertiary flora have also remained in this area. These mountains present one of the continent's highest plant diversity indices deriving from their geographic and historical circumstances throughout the Quaternary. Throughout this century, a change in the biogeographic characteristics of these mountains is to be expected as a result of climate change.
   Based on four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios, we developed a multivariate analysis model for mountain ranges in Central Spain (Southern Europe), enabling us to adjust data on vegetation, climate, lithology and availability of soil water. With high-resolution data on species occurrences and abiotic characteristics for better accounting of micro-refugia and topographic complexity in mountain regions, we assess the future potential distribution of tree species and changes in plant communities under climate change. Our model provides the climate descriptors that most influence changes in species distribution and which lead us to consider the parameters of these changes as indicators for management.
   We project for this century a significant spread of Mediterranean tree communities in detriment to temperate or cold-adapted tree communities. In mountain forests in northern Europe. limitations on plant growth are mainly thermic, and the boreal and subalpine species in high- and mid-mountain regions are therefore the ones most threatened by the predicted global warming. To the contrary, our results show that in mountains in southern Europe, the formations that will undergo the greatest changes will be at piedmonts and low-mountain levels, due to increased hydric deficit. These results suggest that nature conservation strategies currently call for new approaches that take into account the fact that climate change is a driving force of species distribution. The results can be used at the landscape scale for management of forest species and for the design of protected areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the large number of species distribution modelling (SDM) applications driven by tracking data, individual information is most of the time neglected and traditional SDM approaches commonly focus on predicting the potential distribution at the species or population-level. By running classical SDMs (population approach) with mixed models including a random factor to account for the variability attributable to individual (individual approach), we propose an innovative five-steps framework to predict the potential and individual-level distributions of mobile species using GPS data collected from green turtles. Pseudo-absences were randomly generated following an environmentally-stratified procedure. A negative exponential dispersal kernel was incorporated into the individual model to account for spatial fidelity, while five environmental variables derived from high-resolution Lidar and hyperspectral data were used as predictors of the species distribution in generalized linear models. Both approaches showed a strong predictive power (mean: AUC > 0.93, CBI > 0.88) and goodness-of-fit (0.6 < adjusted R-2 < 0.9), but differed geographically with favorable habitats restricted around the tagging locations for the individual approach whereas favorable habitats from the population approach were more widespread. Our innovative way to combine predictions from both approaches into a single map provides a unique scientific baseline to support conservation planning and management of many taxa. Our framework is easy to implement and brings new opportunities to exploit existing tracking dataset, while addressing key ecological questions such as inter-individual plasticity and social interactions.

AB  - Habitat richness, that is, the diversity of ecosystem types, is a complex, spatially explicit aspect of biodiversity, which is affected by bioclimatic, geographic, and anthropogenic variables. The distribution of habitat types is a key component for understanding broad-scale biodiversity and for developing conservation strategies. We used data on the distribution of European Union (EU) habitats to answer the following questions: (i) how do bioclimatic, geographic, and anthropogenic variables affect habitat richness? (ii) Which of those factors is the most important? (iii) How do interactions among these variables influence habitat richness and which combinations produce the strongest interactions? The distribution maps of 222 terrestrial habitat types as defined by the Natura 2000 network were used to calculate habitat richness for the 10 km x 10 km EU grid map. We then investigated how environmental variables affect habitat richness, using generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and boosted regression trees. The main factors associated with habitat richness were geographic variables, with negative relationships observed for both latitude and longitude, and a positive relationship for terrain ruggedness. Bioclimatic variables played a secondary role, with habitat richness increasing slightly with annual mean temperature and overall annual precipitation. We also found an interaction between anthropogenic variables, with the combination of increased landscape fragmentation and increased population density strongly decreasing habitat richness. This is the first attempt to disentangle spatial patterns of habitat richness at the continental scale, as a key tool for protecting biodiversity. The number of European habitats is related to geography more than climate and human pressure, reflecting a major component of biogeographical patterns similar to the drivers observed at the species level. The interaction between anthropogenic variables highlights the need for coordinated, continental-scale management plans for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Understanding the social dimensions of conservation opportunity is crucial for conservation planning in multiple-use landscapes. However, factors that influence the feasibility of implementing conservation actions, such as the history of landscape management, and landholders' willingness to engage are often difficult or time consuming to quantify and rarely incorporated into planning. We examined how conservation agencies could reduce costs of acquiring such data by developing predictive models of management feasibility parameterized with social and biophysical factors likely to influence landholders' decisions to engage in management. To test the utility of our best-supported model, we developed 4 alternative investment scenarios based on different input data for conservation planning: social data only; biological data only; potential conservation opportunity derived from modeled feasibility that incurs no social data collection costs; and existing conservation opportunity derived from feasibility data that incurred collection costs. Using spatially explicit information on biodiversity values, feasibility, and management costs, we prioritized locations in southwest Australia to control an invasive predator that is detrimental to both agriculture and natural ecosystems: the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). When social data collection costs were moderate to high, the most cost-effective investment scenario resulted from a predictive model of feasibility. Combining empirical feasibility data with biological data was more cost-effective for prioritizing management when social data collection costs were low (<4% of the total budget). Calls for more data to inform conservation planning should take into account the costs and benefits of collecting and using social data to ensure that limited funding for conservation is spent in the most cost-efficient and effective manner.
   El Valor de Usar Modelos de Viabilidad en la Planeacion de la Conservacion Sistematica para Predecir la Comprension de Manejo de los Terratenientes Entender las dimensiones sociales de las oportunidades de conservacion es importante para la planeacion de la conservacion en terrenos de uso multiple. Sin embargo, los factores que influyen la viabilidad de implementar acciones de conservacion, como la historia del manejo del terreno y la disposicion de los terratenientes a comprometerse, frecuentemente son dificiles o consumen mucho tiempo para poder cuantificar y rara vez se incorporan a la planeacion. Examinamos como las agencias de conservacion pueden reducir los costos de adquisicion de dicha informacion al desarrollar modelos pronosticadores de manejo de viabilidad con parametros de factores sociales y biofisicos que probablemente influyan sobre las decisiones de los terratenientes de participar en el manejo. Para probar la utilidad de nuestro modelo mejor fundamentado, desarrollamos cuatro escenarios alternativos de inversion basados en diferentes entradas de datos para la planeacion de la conservacion: solo datos sociales; solo datos biologicos; oportunidad de conservacion potencial derivada de la viabilidad modelada que no cause gastos de colecta de datos sociales; y oportunidades conservacion existentes derivados de datos de viabilidad que causaron gastos de colecta. Al usar informacion espacialmente explicita sobre los valores de la biodiversidad, viabilidad y gastos de manejo, priorizamos ubicaciones en el suroeste de Australia para controlar a un depredador invasor que es danino para la agricultura y los ecosistemas naturales: el zorro rojo (Vulpes vulpes). El escenario de inversion mas rentable resulto de un modelo pronosticador de viabilidad. Combinar los datos de viabilidad empirica con datos biologicos fue mas rentable para priorizar el manejo cuando los gastos de colecta de datos sociales fueron bajos (<4% del presupuesto total). Al querer mas datos para informar a la planeacion de la conservacion se deben considerar los gastos y beneficios de colectar y usar datos sociales para asegurar que el financiamiento limitado de la conservacion se gaste de la manera mas rentable y efectiva.

AB  - Globally, aquatic biodiversity is imperiled at an increasing rate, especially in diversity hotspots such as the southeastern USA. The spotfin chub Erimonax monachus is a federally threatened minnow with a disjunct distribution resulting from numerous impoundments on the Tennessee River and its tributaries in the heart of the southeastern USA. Recovery actions required to remove federal protection for E. monachus are dependent on the establishment of additional populations within the historical range of the species, but little is known regarding macroscale habitat requirements that could guide conservation planning. We analyzed local- and network-scale watershed attributes to develop an ecological niche model (ENM) for E. monachus useful for directing conservation actions at sampled and unsampled sites across the Tennessee River Basin. We found E. monachus occurred most often in larger streams with large upstream catchment areas and minimal alteration to forested uplands, but all of these sites were in close proximity to high densities of downstream dams due to populations being restricted to large-stream habitat upstream of reservoirs. The ENM showed the highest probability of E. monachus occurrence among catchment locations with known extant populations; however, additional historical and previously unoccupied catchments showed potential for successful (re)introductions, provided that fine-scale habitats are appropriate. Our framework can be used to identify potential survey and (re)introduction sites for E. monachus as well as other rare riverine fishes and represents a method for identifying areas of high priority for conserving aquatic biodiversity.

AB  - Prediction of invasive species distributions from survey data is widely recognized as a significant component of forest management and conservation planning. Leucaena leucocephala is the most aggressive invasive shrub and tree in the Hengchun peninsula in southern Taiwan. We analyzed geo-referenced data to identify potential variables of invasion and to predict likelihood of further invasion using boosted regression trees. Our results, which classified 92% of the cells correctly with regard to species presence and absence, indicated probability of invasion is correlated with climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation), landscape features (altitude; slope ratio and aspect; percentages of natural or secondary forest, agriculture land, developed area, and water bodies; and distances to the nearest forest edge and river), and anthropogenic factors (length of forest edge, and distances to the nearest road and agriculture land). The most influential variables are average annual temperature, altitude, piecipitation, and slope. Continued range expansion by L. leucocephala is most likely to proceed (1) from the eastern and western portions toward the central portion of Hengchun township and (2) throughout the southern and toward the eastern portions of Manjhou township. Our model should provide useful information to aid forest managers in the development of long term monitoring and control strategies for L. leucocephala, in the early detection and eradication of newly established invasions, and also a framework for the integration and analysis of new presence and absence field data as they become available.

AB  - Spatial demographic models can help guide monitoring and management activities targeting atrisk species, even in cases where baseline data are lacking. Here, we provide an example of how site-specific changes in land use and anthropogenic stressors can be incorporated into a spatial demographic model to investigate effects on population dynamics of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). Our study focused on a population of Golden Eagles exposed to risks associated with rapid increases in renewable energy development in southern California, U.S.A. We developed a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation model that integrated empirical data on demography of Golden Eagles with spatial data on the arrangement of nesting habitats, prey resources, and planned renewable energy development sites. Our model permitted simulated eagles of different stage-classes to disperse, establish home ranges, acquire prey resources, prospect for breeding sites, and reproduce. The distribution of nesting habitats, prey resources, and threats within each individual's home range influenced movement, reproduction, and survival. We used our model to explore potential effects of alternative disturbance scenarios, and proposed conservation strategies, on the future distribution and abundance of Golden Eagles in the study region. Results from our simulations suggest that probable increases in mortality associated with renewable energy infrastructure (e.g., collisions with wind turbines and vehicles, electrocution on power poles) could have negative consequences for population trajectories, but that site-specific conservation actions could reduce the magnitude of negative effects. Our study demonstrates the use of a flexible and expandable modeling framework to incorporate spatially dependent processes when determining relative effects of proposed management options to Golden Eagles and their habitats.

AB  - Drastic shifts in species distributions are a cause of concern for ecologists. Such shifts pose great threat to biodiversity especially under unprecedented anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Many studies have documented recent shifts in species distributions. However, most of these studies are limited to regional scales, and do not consider the abundance structure within species ranges. Developing methods to detect systematic changes in species distributions over their full ranges is critical for understanding the impact of changing environments and for successful conservation planning. Here, we demonstrate a centroid model for range-wide analysis of distribution shifts using the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The centroid model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework which models population change within physiographic strata while accounting for several factors affecting species detectability. Yearly abundance-weighted range centroids are estimated. As case studies, we derive annual centroids for the Carolina wren and house finch in their ranges in the U.S. We further evaluate the first-difference correlation between species' centroid movement and changes in winter severity, total population abundance. We also examined associations of change in centroids from sub-ranges. Change in full-range centroid movements of Carolina wren significantly correlate with snow cover days (r = - 0.58). For both species, the full-range centroid shifts also have strong correlation with total abundance (r = 0.65, and 0.51 respectively). The movements of the full-range centroids of the two species are correlated strongly (up to r = 0.76) with that of the sub-ranges with more drastic population changes. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of centroids for analyzing distribution changes in a two-dimensional spatial context. Particularly it highlights applications that associate the centroid with factors such as environmental stressors, population characteristics, and progression of invasive species. Routine monitoring of changes in centroid will provide useful insights into long-term avian responses to environmental changes.

AB  - The Red-spectacled Amazon (Amazona pretrei) is an endangered, small range and migratory parrot threatened by habitat destruction and pet trade. We modelled its geographical distribution with the objective of predicting its historical, current and future (in face of climatic changes) geographical distributions. We also tested the assumption that the species tracks similar ecological conditions while seasonally migrating. Finally, we estimated the overlap between its predicted distributions and the current protected areas network. We used eight modelling techniques in an ensemble-forecasting approach to reach consensus distributional scenarios. The modelled historical breeding and wintering ranges covered a larger area than today. Its current year-round distribution is located in the same region as before but decreased by 13%, whereas the breeding range decreased by 32%, and the wintering range by 43%. The future year-round distribution is predicted to decrease by 47% and shift to east by 2060. Even more drastic decreases in range are predicted for breeding (63%) and wintering (91%) ranges. The niches of the breeding and wintering distributions are good predictors of the records of the other season. The greatest variation (SDs) in the predictions comes from modelling tools and GCMs, and little from climatic scenarios. However, variation in predictions were small within high probability regions for modelling tools by higher everywhere for GCMs and climatic scenarios. The Red-spectacled Amazon is currently underrepresented (<1% of year-round range, and <4% of each seasonal range) in the current reserve system. A broad view over all estimated and predicted ranges revealed that a small portion of the range has a very important role in current and future conservation actions for this bird - in the northeast part of state of Rio Grande do Sul and southeast state of Santa Catarina, Brazil.

AB  - Climate change and hydropower development are two primary stressors affecting riverine ecosystems and both stressors facilitate invasions by non-native species. However, little study has focused on how habitats of native and non-native fishes may be affected by independent or combined impacts of such stressors. Here we used the Jinsha River as an example to predict habitat change and distributional shift of native and non-native fishes with species distribution models. The Jinsha River Basin has nearly 40 cascade dams constructed or planned and located in the Tibetan Plateau, which is sensitive to future climate change. Two climate change scenarios and future hydropower development were combined to produce five scenarios of future changes. Under the impacts of independent extreme climate change or hydropower development, non-native fishes showed greater habitat gain in total, while native fishes shifted their distribution into tributaries and higher elevations, and impacts were stronger in combined scenarios. Habitat overlap between the two groups also increased in future scenarios. Certain fish traits correlated with stressors in habitat change prediction. River basins with hydropower development were shown to face higher risk of non-native fishes invasion under future climate change. As the most biodiverse river basins globally are threatened by hydropower development, our results emphasize the importance of regulating non-native fish introduction in reservoirs. Our approaches are also applicable to other systems globally to better understand how hydropower development and climate change may increase invasion risk, and therefore help conserve native species effectively.

AB  - Land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) change is one of the main drivers of global biodiversity change. However, the lack of detailed data on species' local distributions is frequently a major constraint to identify effective indicators of impact and to prescribe effective conservation and management measures. Here we aim to describe and demonstrate the applicability of a novel looping approach to predict spatially dynamic ecological responses to LU/LC changes. The methodology integrates statistical downscaling, multi-model inference, stochastic-dynamic modelling and simulations, and spatial projections under a common and interactive framework. We illustrate the approach with a study of passerine foraging groups and their potential indicator role under LU/LC change scenarios. Based on the coarse occurrence data from published atlases, this approach allowed transposing species richness to fine resolutions in order to assess regional ecological integrity by up scaling the local responses of those indicators again at the landscape level. Overall, our proposed framework was able to provide realistic patterns of passerine foraging responses to LU/LC changes, highlighting the usefulness of existing databases for model-based research in addressing complex emergent problems across scales. Comparative analysis between simulations and independent field data showed a promising model performance, with consistent projections of the local passerine functional composition for a significant number of point-counts tested. Our approach represents a contribution for more universal applications in the scope of conservation and landscape planning, especially when fine resolution data is difficult to obtain due to resources constraints.

AB  - Sustainable management strategies for tropical forest ecosystems require a detailed understanding of the distribution of tropical forest species, limitations on distribution, as well as occurrence patterns in the absence of limitations. In the Americas, many tropical palms (Arecaceae) are locally abundant keystone species that provide a number of non-timber forest products. Here we focus on 10 such species (Aphandra natalia, Attalea phalerata, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartea deltoidea, Mauritia flexousa, Oenocarpus bataua, Phytelephas aequatorialis, Phytelephas macrocarpa, and Phytelephas seemannii) found in western South America. This study aimed to determine: (i) what variables control potential species distribution, (ii) whether their distribution is spatially constrained and if so, (iii) how their potential ranges compare to their actual ranges. We built species distribution models using Maxent software with three groups of predictor variables: C (climatic), N (non-climatic environmental), S (spatial), and combinations thereof: C, CN and CNS. The CNS predictor variable combination gave superior predictive ability based on median Area Under the Curve (AUC) values and was consistent with available range maps. In contrast, individual C and CN predictor variables gave inferior AUC values and showed less similarity to range maps. We concluded that the CNS model that combined climatic, non-climatic, and spatial variables best represented the actual distribution of the 10 palm species, whereas C and CN models approached their potential distribution. Precipitation during the driest quarter and annual precipitation were the most important predictors of the potential distribution, whereas temperature of the coldest month, soil, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were less important. We found that the actual distributions of palm species were spatially constrained, and that the spatial variables largely coincided with the dispersal barriers of the Andean Cordillera and past climatic fluctuations. The estimated potential range varied from nearly equal to the actual range, to up to 0.55 x 10(6) km(2) (55.1 x 10(6) ha) larger than the actual range, depending on model, threshold settings, and species. We thus concluded that current palm resources in the forests of western South America have major potential for ecological expansion. These results are relevant to current palm management and resource conservation planning, as well as future strategies that will have to address climate change and increasing human disturbance.

AB  - National and European shark conservation plans aim to manage elasmobranch stocks sustainably. However uncertainties and deficiencies with available data hamper traditional, quantitative assessment methods of stock status to inform those plans, and thus effective management. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Expert Groups have explored a range of data deficient assessment methods that may be used to support management advice, including Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA). This method was applied to the demersal elasmobranch fauna (21 species) of the Celtic Sea to explore how such approaches could inform the management of skates (Rajidae). This species complex is an important catch component for demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries and is currently managed under a mixed species total allowable catch (TAC). PSAs were conducted on both of these fisheries, by four experts from three countries to introduce independence, and to quantify the range in perceptions of each stock. Confidence scoring of attributes was incorporated and probability distributions generated to model uncertainty in the expert responses to susceptibility attributes. Results showed that three shark species (tope, Galeorhinus galeus; angel shark, Squatina squatina and spurdog, Squalus acanthias) were the most vulnerable species in both fisheries (a consequence of their life history strategy and large size), followed by two skates (otter trawl) and three skates (gillnet). All of these species have some form, of restrictive management and, apart from tope, are either currently listed as prohibited species or have a zero TAC in the area. Blonde ray, Raja brachyura was ranked as the next most vulnerable member of the commercially exploited skate complex. This adaptation of the PSA approach enabled skate species of higher and lower risk to be ranked and thus inform where management efforts should be focussed, whilst giving a novel consideration to uncertainty through canvassing expert opinion.

AB  - This paper presents a study on predicting the potential spatial distribution of Toothed Leionema (Leionema Bilobum sub sp. Serrulatum) using Weights-of-Evidence (WofE) predictive modelling with GIS. Toothed Leionema is one of four subspecies of Leionema bilobum from the Rutaceae family. It is a poorly investigated species which is considered rare in Victoria, Australia. WofE is a statistical method based on Bayesian theorem, which applies a log-linear form of Bayes' rules and uses the prior probability distribution, calculated based on the observed presence of the modelled species, to produce a posterior probability distribution of the species. This study aims to use WofE as a tool coupled with GIS to identify key environmental factors associated with the habitat of Toothed Leionema, based on field observations and to determine the potential spatial distribution of this species in the Strzelecki Ranges, part of the Great Dividing Range, located in the West Gippsland region of Victoria.
   The integration of WofE with GIS allowed the distribution of the species to be predicted based on geographically referenced observation data. It involved combining a set of evidence themes representing environmental predictor variables with the known distribution of the species to generate a response theme representing the probabilities of occurrence of the species at every location. The evidence and response themes were represented as raster map layers. This research used Arc-WofE to implement WofE.
   The modelling results indicate that elevation, aspect, distance to water and distance to plantation areas are significant factors associated with the spatial distribution of Toothed Leionema. The model shows that areas with elevations between 336m and 555m and a dominant south-western aspect that are close to plantation areas (within 710 m), and to water (between 1000-1250m), provide potentially suitable habitat for Toothed Leionema in the region.
   The effectiveness and validity of the tool for predicting the likely distribution of the species for which there is little knowledge about their physiology and habitat requirements was also assessed. Both model validation with training and control sites and ground truthing suggest that the modelling results are valid and the predicted spatial distribution provides a useful indication of potentially suitable habitat for Toothed Leionema. The results not only offer some understanding of the habitat requirements of the species, but also provide a new set of data about the species for developing strategies for their conservation and management, particularly when forest plans are formulated or reviewed.

AB  - Rational sampling of the spontaneous diversity of forage and turf species requires an a priori knowledge of the range of environmental conditions suitable for these species. We introduce some concepts and methods for investigating the environmental range of species by empirical modelling of species ecological niche, and we suggest how such investigations could help to plan collection campaigns and to improve the choice of core-collections. The empirical modelling of the ecological niche of a species consists of building a function of environmental parameters predicting the presence of the species from a calibration dataset including observed presence-absence or abundance records of the species and environmental data at observation sites. We emphasize that data from collection campaigns of plant breeders are valuable information for niche modelling. We introduce two methods for investigating the environmental distribution of species and for niche modelling based on presence-absence data: the canonical correlation analysis and the logistic regression. We give examples combining niche model and GIS software that may contribute to organize collection campaigns. We suggest that models predicting probability of presence of species may be useful for the selection of core-collections. Such models may help to delineate geographically isolated areas of presence of species that should be sampled separately for selecting a core-collection. In each isolated area of presence, we propose to stratify the accessions in clusters according to the predicted probability of presence of the species in collection sites, and to select accessions in each cluster.

AB  - Using empirical location data from individuals to model habitat quality and species distributions is valuable towards understanding habitat use of wildlife, especially for conservation and management planning. Incorporating measures of reproductive success or survival into these models helps address the role of vital rates (a surrogate of fitness) in affecting a species' distribution. We used 24-year datasets of Arctic peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus tundrius nest-site locations and productivity from the Colville River Special Area, Alaska, USA to model suitability of breeding habitat and the relative quality of used and potential nest sites. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression models and covariates describing nest-site productivity, area of surrounding prey habitat, geology, topography and land-cover type to model and predict intensity of Arctic peregrine falcon nest-site use along the Colville River, and developed a predictive map of intensity of nest-site use. Regions of higher predicted intensity of use were characterized by steeper slopes, greater area of prey habitat, and higher average productivity, which are likely attributed to minimizing predation risk, gaining advantages for hunting, having sufficient prey resources, site quality, and overall fitness. Including productivity in intensity of nest-site use models improved the models, supporting our supposition that adding a fitness parameter enhanced the predictive capability of the species distribution model. Areas predicted to have higher intensity of use by our model can be used to focus efforts of continued protection of areas with frequently occupied and productive nest sites, and conversely, identify areas where protection of nest sites is likely to have few conservation benefits.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation typically precedes conservation planning; maintaining remaining linkages among core habitat areas can thus become a key conservation objective. Identifying linkages for dispersal and ensuring those linkages have long-term protection and management are challenging tasks for wildlife managers. These tasks can be especially daunting for smaller species with low mobility, termed corridor dwellers, which must maintain sustainable populations within corridors. Between May 2007 and June 2009, we collected occurrence locations for a corridor dweller, the Palm Springs pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris bangsii), from museums, previous research, and our own field sampling. We used those data to model their suitable niche space and then identify suitable linkages between proposed conservation areas. We used a partitioned Mahalanobis D-2 statistic to create a spatially explicit niche model describing the distribution of a suitable niche space, and we validated the model statistically, with live trapping and with burrowing owl (Athene cunnicularia) diets. Our model identified soil characteristics, topographic ruggedness, and vegetation as variables delimiting Palm Springs pocket mouse habitat; sand content of the soils was an especially important characteristic. Our historic distribution model identified 120,000-90,000 ha as historically potential Palm Springs pocketmouse habitat; roughly 39% of that has been lost to more recent development. Most of the remaining suitable habitat occurred in the northwestern portion of the valley. We modeled habitat within core reserves as well as within proposed linkages between those reserves as having high similarity to known occupied habitats. Live trapping in areas with high (>= 0.95) Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) values resulted in captures at 66% of those locations and, along with burrowing owl diets, refined a qualitative model as to what constituted a suitable Palm Springs pocket mouse corridor. While most corridor analyses have focused on mobile species which may traverse corridors in hours, days, or weeks, linkages for corridor dwellers must include habitat for sustaining multi-generational populations. This requires evaluating whether continuous suitable habitat exists within proposed corridors. Our research demonstrates how niche modeling can provide a landscape-scale view of the distribution of suitable habitat to evaluate conservation objectives for connectivity.

AB  - Consensus has been reached that global biodiversity loss impairs ecosystem functioning and the sustainability of services beneficial to humanity. However, the ecosystem consequences of extinction in natural communities are moderated by compensatory species dynamics, yet these processes are rarely accounted for in impact assessments and seldom considered in conservation programmes. Here, we use marine invertebrate communities to parameterise numerical models of sediment bioturbation a key mediator of biogeochemical cycling - to determine whether post-extinction compensatory mechanisms alter biodiversity-ecosystem function relations following non-random extinctions. We find that compensatory dynamics lead to trajectories of sediment mixing that diverge from those without compensation, and that the form, magnitude and variance of each probabilistic distribution is highly influenced by the type of compensation and the functional composition of surviving species. Our findings indicate that the generalized biodiversity-function relation curve, as derived from multiple empirical investigations of random species loss, is unlikely to yield representative predictions for ecosystem properties in natural systems because the influence of post-extinction community dynamics are under-represented. Recognition of this problem is fundamental to management and conservation efforts, and will be necessary to ensure future plans and adaptation strategies minimize the adverse impacts of the biodiversity crisis.

AB  - A fundamental goal of ecology is to understand whether ecological communities are structured according to general assembly rules or are essentially dictated by random processes. In the context of fragmentation, understanding assembly patterns and their mechanistic basis also has important implications for conservation. Using distribution data of 20 bat species collected on 11 islands in Gatun Lake, Panama, we tested for non-randomness in presence-absence matrices with respect to nestedness and negative species co-occurrence. We examined the causal basis for the observed patterns and conducted separate analyses for the entire assemblage and for various species submatrices reflecting differences in species' trophic position and mobility. Furthermore, we explored the influence of weighting factors (area, isolation, abundance) on co-occurrence analyses. Unweighted analyses revealed a significant negative co-occurrence pattern for the entire assemblage and for phytophagous bats alone. Weighting analyses by isolation retained a pattern of species segregation for the whole assemblage but nullified the non-random structure for phytophagous bats and suggested negative associations for animalivores and species with low mobility. Area- and abundance-weighted analyses always indicated random structuring. Bat distributions followed a nested subset structure across islands, regardless of whether all species or different submatrices were analysed. Nestedness was in all cases unrelated to island area but weakly correlated with island isolation for incidence matrices of all species, phytophagous bats, and mobile species. Overall, evidence for negative interspecific interactions indicative of competitive effects was weak, corroborating previous studies based on ecomorphological analyses. Our findings indicate that bat assemblages on our study islands are most strongly shaped by isolation effects and species' differential movement and colonization ability. From a conservation viewpoint this suggests that even in systems with high fragment-matrix contrast, a purely area-based approach may be inadequate, and structural and functional connectivity among patches are important to consider in reserve planning.

AB  - Preservation of biodiversity is a central goal of conservation management, yet the conditions that promote persistence may differ for the species in the community. For systems subject to stochastic disturbances such as fire, understanding which management practices promote persistence for all species in a community is complex. Before deciding on the best course of action, an objective must be specified. Yet an overarching goal of species persistence can be specified into a measureable objective many different ways. We investigated four alternative management objectives for maximizing species persistence that use common biodiversity indices: (1) attaining the minimally acceptable mix of successional vegetation states to support species' relative abundances, (2) maximizing the arithmetic mean abundance of species, (3) maximizing the geometric mean abundance of species, and (4) minimizing the average extinction risk of species. We used stochastic dynamic programming to model successional changes in vegetation in the presence of both planned and unplanned fires, and utilize an extensive data set on the occurrence of birds, reptiles, and small mammals in different successional states in semiarid Australia. We investigated the influence the choice of objective function and taxonomic focus has on the optimal fire management recommendations. We also evaluated a recent hazard reduction policy to annually burn a fixed amount of the landscape and compare results to the optimal solution. The optimal management strategy to maximize species persistence over a 100-year period is predominantly to minimize wildfires. This is because the majority of species are more likely to occur in intermediate and late successional vegetation. However the optimal solution showed sensitivity to the objective and the species included in the analysis. These results highlight the need for careful consideration when specifying an objective to represent overarching conservation goals. Using the extinction risk objective, we show that a policy to annually burn 5% of the landscape could increase the average probability of extinction for the modelled species by 7% over the next 100 years compared to the optimal management scenario.

AB  - Epiphytic orchids are fundamental elements of the dynamics and composition of tropical ecosystems; there are an estimated 19,000 species worldwide, of which 85 occur in the dry forests of the basins of the Cauca and Dagua rivers in the Valle del Cauca Department in southwestern Colombia. These plants form the interface between the forest and the atmosphere and depend on aerial nutrient sources, rain, and water vapour for survival. This physiological dependence on the climate makes them especially sensitive to changes in the atmosphere and temperature, so they are ideal models for the study of climate change (CC). The objective of this study was to detect changes in the spatial distribution of seven orchid species in the tropical dry forest in the department of Valle del Cauca and their significance in terms of conservation planning for CC. A maximum entropy algorithm was used for modelling, and nine variables were analysed. Presence data for 30 municipalities came from 31 field trips, herbarium data, and the literature, and the current potential distribution was compared against the SRES-A2 scenario developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and modelled for the 2080-2100 time horizon. For the set of seven species, the results show an altitudinal increase under the future CC scenario compared to the present, but the responses vary amongst taxa, elevation, and location, depending on the degree of thermal specialization. Under the future CC scenario, the suitability of mid-mountain areas will increase at the expense of the basal areas where dry forest orchids are currently found, and the Cordillera Occidental will have a greater concentration of suitable areas than the Cordillera Central. Variables such as accessibility, land coverage, temperature, and water availability explain 88.6% of the model. A strategy to combat the impending loss of biodiversity due to CC is the establishment of Altitudinal Migration Corridors (AMCs) that connect the forest relics of the alluvial plain with the mid-mountain areas. Areas with a probability of species occurrence greater than P=0.75 have been identified with MaxEnt software, and these areas constitute "thermal refugia", which, together with existing protected areas, form the backbone of this conservation strategy. Protection of xeric shrublands and the appropriate management of phorophytes would not only facilitate the dispersion processes of these orchids but also the survival of other flora and fauna in the dry forest of the Valle del Cauca River against CC.

AB  - Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) are widely applied in forest mapping to obtain high quality and quantity data. The launch of RS satellites heralded a new beginning in natural resource survey and management. Soon the technique was adopted for mapping the distribution of individual species, such as bamboo. Recognizing the importance of bamboo to livelihoods in rural areas, forest ecosystems, and the economy, this work highlights the importance of RS and GIS in the mapping of bamboo-bearing areas through satellite imagery. The work also analyzes the applicability of RS/GIS to better management and conservation of bamboo resources. Mapping bamboo requires improvement in the traditional classification scheme and thorough ground truthing. Successful classification of the imagery would provide data on the current status of bamboo and assist in modeling future scenarios. In a GIS environment, action plans can be generated for effective bamboo resource planning. Over all, since RS and GIS have tremendous ability to remotely identify and classify bamboo, the methods should be put to better use to utilize the potential offered.

AB  - The study of protected areas and climate change has now spanned two decades. Pioneering work in the late 1980s recognized the potential implications of shifting species range boundaries for static protected areas. Many early recommendations for protected area design were general, emphasizing larger protected areas, buffer zones, and connectivity between reserves. There were limited practical tests of these suggestions. Development of modeling and conservation planning methods in the 1990s allowed more rigorous testing of concepts of reserve and connectivity function in a changing climate. These studies have shown decreasing species representation in existing reserves due to climate change, and the ability of new protected areas to help slow loss of representation in mid-century scenarios. Connectivity on protected area periphery seems more effective than corridors linking protected areas. However, corridors serving other purposes, such as large carnivore movement, may be useful for accommodating species range shifts as well. Assisted migration and ex situ management strategies to complement protected areas are being explored. Finally, in scenarios of the latter half of the century, protected areas and connectivity become increasingly expensive and decreasingly effective, indicating the importance of reducing human-induced climate change.

AB  - Interannual variation in bird-landscape relations is pervasive, and it generates decision dilemmas for conservationists who use such relations to support landscape-level planning, acquisition and management. Interannual variation occurs in two ways. Model consistency refers to agreement among years in the variables and directions of relations in a model for a species. R-2 consistency measures variation in the strengths of association between bird and landscape variables for a species among years. We examined how distributional and biological traits of species, model-selection certainty (likelihood the best model was selected in a given year), and model complexity (number of landscape variables) were associated with interannual variation in bird-landscape relations for 72 species in the Appalachian Mountains, USA. Abundant, narrowly distributed species, and cavity nesters exhibited higher model consistency, but model-selection certainty, not species' traits or model complexity, had the most influence on model and R-2 consistency. Increasing model-selection certainty by improving sampling methods and model-selection strategies may be the most effective way to cope with interannual variation in bird-landscape relations.

AB  - The creation of new populations through reintroductions in their former range is still necessary for the long-term conservation of the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). A large-scale assessment of habitat suitability is a necessary prerequisite for evaluating the possibility of carrying out lynx reintroduction. We modelled habitat suitability for the Iberian lynx in the Iberian Peninsula using MaxEnt. Lynx presence data for 2010-2013 from Andujar-Cardena and Donana populations were used. Habitat variables were quantified using the CORINE Land Cover. This habitat suitability model predicted an environmentally suitable area of 87,747 km(2), which represents 14.08% of the whole Iberian Peninsula. Of the total suitable habitat identified, 45% is located in a large continuous area in the south-western quadrant coinciding with the historical range of the species in the mid 20th century. However, there are also relevant patches mainly in the north-eastern quadrant. About 55% of the potential area suitable for the lynx falls outside protected areas. If Iberian lynx populations are to attain levels that will facilitate their long-term survival, it will be necessary to consider potential habitat for the species throughout the whole of the Iberian Peninsula.

AB  - Climate change is one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline worldwide, through shifting or shrinking habitats of species. Predicting the distribution of suitable habitats for species under climate change is essential for conservation planning. Cyamophila astragalicola is a specialist psyllid dependent on a spiny shrub, endemic to Zagros Mountains of Iran. The current study represents a modeling approach for lesser-known small invertebrates to assess their threat status. Ecological niche modeling was used to assess current suitable habitats of C. astragalicola, to develop model-based predictions of its habitat suitability under different climatic scenarios, and to assess the extinction risk of the species based on IUCN Red List criteria. Results revealed a sharp decline in suitable habitats (97.26% and 99.8% for the years 2050 and 2070, respectively) under the scenario of RCP 8.5. Further, under the two RCP scenarios, C. astragalicola was classified as IUCN Threat 2. A shift toward higher altitudes with lower temperature and higher precipitation was predicted. Results of modeling are based on abiotic factors only. Human interactions are not modeled; hence, the status of the species may be even more dramatic than the models may reveal. Generally, the results of this study indicate the high sensitivity of C. astragalicola to global warming. The narrow distribution range of the species coupled with the low dispersal ability can increase the risk of extinction. Ecological, economic, and social risks associated with the extinction need to be further evaluated to formulate future management policies.

AB  - Establishing which factors determine species distributions is of major relevance for practical applications such as conservation planning. The Amazonian lowlands exhibit considerable internal heterogeneity that is not apparent in existing vegetation maps. We used ferns as a model group to study patterns in plant species distributions and community composition at regional and landscape scales. Fern species composition and environmental data were collected in 109 plots of 250 x 2 m distributed among four sites in Brazilian Amazonia. Interplot distances varied from 1 to ca 670 km. When floristically heterogeneous datasets were analyzed, the use of an extended Sorensen dissimilarity index rather than the traditional Sorensen index improved model fit and made interpretation of the results easier. Major factors associated with species composition varied among sites, difference in cation concentration was a strong predictor of floristic dissimilarity in those sites with pronounced heterogeneity in cation concentration. Difference in clay content was the most relevant variable in sites with uniform cation concentrations. In every case, environmental differences were invariably better than geographic distances in predicting species compositional differences. Our results are consistent with the ideas that: (1) the relative predictive capacity of the explanatory variables depend on the relative lengths of the observed gradients; and (2) environmental gradients can be hierarchically structured such that gradients occur inside gradients. Therefore, site-specific relationships among variables can mask the bigger picture and make it more difficult to unravel the factors structuring plant communities in Amazonia.

AB  - The Eastern Imperial Eagle (EIE) is a top predator exploiting different prey in different parts of its distribution. In this study, we summarise data collected over a long period of time (for 25 consecutive years), identifying key prey species in the different regions, as well as clarifying seasonal preferences in the eagle's diet. Most studies on the EIE food composition covering different parts of the species distribution range analyse the breeding season, while data about the winter diet are scarce. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study detailing the differences in EIE's dietary preferences between the breeding and the winter periods. We identified 4891 specimens belonging to 196 different taxa, which represents the most comprehensive study considering the diet diversity of this threatened species. Mammals represented the largest proportion of the diet, followed by birds and reptiles. Northern White-breasted Hedgehog was the most common prey, accounting for 25.7% of the total prey caught and 26.75% of the biomass. The European Souslik was the second most important prey with 14.35% participation in the eagle's diet, but with a 3.75% contribution to the biomass. As we predicted, prey composition and main prey species varied spatially and seasonally. Modelling differences in the EIE diet, we found that the "territory effect" had the strongest impact on the dietary variations. Diet diversity differed significantly between regions (F = 12.6, df = 4, p = 0.01). During the breeding season, eagles fed mainly on Hedgehogs (29.88%), Sousliks (16.85%) and Storks (7.74%), while the winter diet was predominantly small rodents (44.17%) and songbirds (13.96%). We found that top predators, such as EIE, have successfully adapted to a novel food source, which is abundant in the area. The detected flexibility in the diet of the species and its ability to switch to alternative prey, if available, when the primary prey decreased, should be considered when planning species conservation efforts. Investigating the temporal change of the main prey in the eagle's diet is also crucial for further species conservation measures.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Climate change exacerbates the threat of biological invasions by increasing climatically suitable regions for species to invade outside of their native range. Island ecosystems may be particularly sensitive to the synergistic effects of climate change and biological invasions. In Hawai'i there are 21 non-native bees that have the capacity to spread pathogens and compete for resources with native bees. We performed an ensemble of species distribution models (SDM) for eight non-native bee species (Hymenoptera: Anthophila) in Hawai'i to predict climatically suitable niches across current and future climate scenarios. We found a significant difference in habitat suitability between SDMs that were constructed with specimen records from their native and non-native (Hawai'i) range. Although SDMs predict expansion of suitable habitat into higher elevations under 2070 climate scenarios, species-rich areas are predicted to stay below 500 m elevation. Our models can inform decisions on the management of non-native bees in Hawai'i by assessing risk of invasion into new areas around the archipelago.
   Climate change is predicted to increase the risk of biological invasions by increasing the availability of climatically suitable regions for invasive species. Endemic species on oceanic islands are particularly sensitive to the impact of invasive species due to increased competition for shared resources and disease spread. In our study, we used an ensemble of species distribution models (SDM) to predict habitat suitability for invasive bees under current and future climate scenarios in Hawai'i. SDMs projected on the invasive range were better predicted by georeferenced records from the invasive range in comparison to invasive SDMs predicted by records from the native range. SDMs estimated that climatically suitable regions for the eight invasive bees explored in this study will expand by similar to 934.8% (+/- 3.4% SE). Hotspots for the invasive bees are predicted to expand toward higher elevation regions, although suitable habitat is expected to only progress up to 500 m in elevation in 2070. Given our results, it is unlikely that invasive bees will interact directly with endemic bees found at >500 m in elevation in the future. Management and conservation plans for endemic bees may be improved by understanding how climate change may exacerbate negative interactions between invasive and endemic bee species.

AB  - Animals use and select habitat at multiple hierarchical levels and at different spatial scales within each level. Still, there is little knowledge on the scale effects at different spatial levels of species occupancy patterns. The objective of this study was to examine nonlinear effects and optimal-scale landscape characteristics that affect occupancy of the Siberian flying squirrel, Pteromys volans, in South- and Mid-Finland. We used presence-absence data (n=10,032 plots of 9ha) and novel approach to separate the effects on site-, landscape-, and regional-level occupancy patterns. Our main results were: landscape variables predicted the placement of population patches at least twice as well as they predicted the occupancy of particular sites; the clear optimal value of preferred habitat cover for species landscape-level abundance is a surprisingly low value (10% within a 4km buffer); landscape metrics exert different effects on species occupancy and abundance in high versus low population density regions of our study area. We conclude that knowledge of regional variation in landscape utilization will be essential for successful conservation of the species. The results also support the view that large-scale landscape variables have high predictive power in explaining species abundance. Our study demonstrates the complex response of species occurrence at different levels of population configuration on landscape structure. The study also highlights the need for data in large spatial scale to increase the precision of biodiversity mapping and prediction of future trends.

AB  - In Europe, agricultural practices have progressively evolved towards high productivity leading either to the intensification of productive and accessible areas or to the abandonment of less profitable sites. Both processes have led to the degradation of semi-natural habitats like extensive grasslands, threatening species such as the Eurasian Scops Owl Otus scops that rely on extensively managed agricultural landscapes. In this work, we aimed to assess the habitat preferences of the Scops Owl using habitat suitability models combined with a multi-scale approach. We generated a set of multi-scale predictors, considering both biotic and abiotic variables, built on two newly developed vegetation management and orthopteran abundance models. To select the variables to incorporate in a 'best multi-scale model', we chose the best spatial scale for each variable using univariate models and by calculating their relative importance through multi-model inference. Next, we built ensembles of small models (ESMs) at 10 different scales from 50 to 1000 m, and an additional model with each variable at its best scale ('best multi-scale model'). The latter performed better than most of the other ESMs and allowed the creation of a high-resolution habitat suitability map for the species. Scops Owls showed a preference for dry sites with extensive and well-structured habitats with 30-40% bush cover, and relied strongly on semi-extensive grasslands covering at least 30% of the surface within 300 m of the territory centre and with high orthopteran availability near the centre (50-m radius), revealing a need for good foraging grounds near the nest. At a larger spatial scale within a radius of 1000 m, the habitat suitability of Scops Owls was negatively related to forest cover. The resulting ESM predictions provide valuable tools for conservation planning, highlighting sites in need of particular conservation efforts together with offering estimates of the percentage of habitat types and necessary prey abundance that could be used as targets in future management plans to ensure the persistence of the population.

AB  - Information regarding the oceanic environment is crucial for determining species distributions and their habitat preferences. However, in studies on crustaceans, especially swimming crabs, such information remains poorly utilized, and its effects on crab communities in the Taiwan Strait (TS) has not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between the catch rates of three swimming crab species and environmental factors in the TS. We fitted generalized additive models (GAMs) to logbooks and voyage data recorder data from Taiwanese crab vessels (2011-2015), developed a species distribution model, and predicted catch rates for these three swimming crab species based on the GAM output. The chlorophyll-a(Chl-a) concentration was related to the high catch rates ofChrybdis feriatusandPortunus sanguinolentus, whereas bottom temperature (BT) was related to high catch rates ofPortunus pelagicus. The variance percentages for each crab species indicated that high catch rates ofC. feriatusandP. sanguinolentusoccurred in a Chl-aconcentration > 0.5 mg/m(3), whereasP. pelagicuscatch rates exhibited negative correlations with BTs > 25 degrees C. The model predicted high catch rates ofC. feriatusin the north of the TS during autumn and winter, whereasP. pelagicuswas observed to the south during summer and autumn.P. sanguinolentuswas predicted to be widely distributed around the TS and distributed further to the northern area during autumn and winter. These findings revealed that each species responds to spatiotemporal environmental variations. Understanding the distributions and habitats of these three crabs is vital in fisheries resource management and conservation planning.

AB  - Climate change has modified the structure and functions of ecosystems, affecting human well-being. Evergreen plants in the warm-temperate ecosystems will lose climatically suitable habitats under climate change but have not drawn much scholarly interest. Therefore, the present research aimed to predict the future climatic niches of eight coastal warm-adapted evergreen trees under climate change to provide information for an effective management practice. For this purpose, we used the ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) weighted by the TSS value in modelling the climatic niches of those evergreen trees and then ensembled their future distributions predicted under 20 future climate scenarios. Except for Neolitsea sericea (True Skill Statistic (TSS) = 0.79), all projections for the current climatic niches of evergreens showed excellent predictive powers (TSS > 0.85). The results showed that the climatic niches of the four evergreens-Castanopsis cuspidata, Pittosporum tobira, Raphiolepis indica var. umbellate, and Eurya emarginata-would expand to the northern part of the Korean Peninsula (KP) under climate change, but the ones of the remaining four-Kadsura japonica, Neolitsea sericea, Ilex integra, and Dendropanax morbiferus-would shrink. While the climatic niches of Pittosporum tobira showed the rapidest and greatest expansion under climate change, Dendropanax morbiferus was predicted to experience the greatest loss of habitat. On the other hand, regardless of whether the future distributions of climatically suitable habitats would expand or contract, the highly suitable habitats of all species were predicted to decline under climate change. This may indicate that further climate change will degrade habitat suitability for all species within the distribution boundary and restrict continuous habitat expansions of expanding species or accelerate habitat loss of shrinking species. In addition, the future distributions of most coastal evergreens were found to be confined to coastal areas; therefore, sea-level rise would accelerate their habitat loss under climate change. The present study provides primary and practical knowledge for understanding climate-related coastal vegetation changes for future conservation planning, particularly on the Korean Peninsula.

AB  - The current research investigated the present and future projected distribution of rice (Oryza sativaL.) based on climatic suitability under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. The MaxEnt models predict that rice distribution in Bhutan will undergo major changes in terms of spatial range shift of varying magnitudes by 2060. Under the anthropogenic radiative forcing of RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, ecological space of rice is predicted to change between 1 and 43%. Major changes are likely to take place in major rice-growing ecological zones of the country. This is likely to have a negative impact on the livelihood and food security of the people as crop production might start declining due to unfavourable climatic factors. Therefore, the findings of this study could prove beneficial for forecasting focus sites requiring interventions, including future climate research, planning, policy formulation and conservation of natural resources.

AB  - Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) is a highly productive system and hosts a high fish diversity and is of paramount importance for sustaining protein supply for over 15 million Cambodians. Nevertheless, the ecology and factors influencing the spatial distribution of many fishes within the lake remain poorly understood. Using commercial fishing lot catch data from 1994/1995 to 1999/2000, fishing seasons and environmental data (land cover and bioclimatic variables), we describe spatial distribution of the eight most commercially important fish species, and investigate the effects of environmental factors on their distributions in the TSL. We found a strong variability in fish biomass across areas and between species. Specifically, Channa micropeltes was most abundant in the southern and northern sections of the TSL. Channa striata and Trichopodus microlepis were more common in the northern part of the TSL. Cyclocheilos enoplos, Barbonymus gonionotus, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, and Gymnostomus spp. were abundant in the southern areas of the TSL while Phalacronotus spp. were abundant in few areas in both the north and the south. Flooded forest positively explained the variation in the biomass of P.hypophthalmus, C. striata, C. enopolos, and Phalacronotus spp. Likewise, the lake's open water positively affects the biomass of P.hypophthalmus, C. enopolos, and Phalacronotus spp., while the agricultural field negatively impacts Gymnostomus spp. biomass distribution. We also found that some areas consistently hosted high fish biomass (e.g., lot 2, Kampong Thom; lot 6, Pursat; lot 2, Battambang, etc.). We, therefore, suggest that fisheries management and conservation planning focus on those areas, considering those areas significance as core fish habitat and important for catching fish.

AB  - Protected area networks are the foundation of conservation, even in northern Canada where anthropogenic impact on the landscape is currently limited. However, the value of protected areas may be undermined by climate change in this region where the rate and magnitude is high, and shifts in vegetation communities and associated wildlife species are already underway. Key to developing responses to these changing conditions is anticipating potential impacts and the risks they pose. Capitalizing on an existing modeled dataset for Yukon from Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning ( SNAP), we examine projected shifts in the distribution of 18 clusters of climate parameters, and the vegetation communities currently associated with them (collectively termed "cliomes'') across three 30-year time steps, from the present through the 2090s. By the 2090s, Yukon may lose seven cliomes and gain one. Three regional changes, if accompanied by vegetation redistribution, represent biome shifts: complete loss of climate conditions for arctic tundra in northern Yukon; emergence of climate conditions supporting grasslands in southern Yukon valleys; reduction in climates supporting alpine tundra in favor of boreal forests types across the mountains of central and northern Yukon. Projections suggest that, by the end of the 21st century, higher elevations in southern Yukon change least when compared to the turnover in cliomes exhibited by the high latitude, arctic parks to the north. This analysis can assist with: planning connectivity between protected areas; identifying novel conservation zones to maximize representation of habitats during the emerging changes; designing plans, management and monitoring for individual protected areas.

AB  - Ecological niche models (ENMs) have multiple applications in ecology, evolution and conservation planning. They relate the known locations of a species to characteristics of its environment (usually climate) over its geographical range. Most ENMs are trained using standard 30-year (1961-1990) or 50-year (1951-2000) baselines to represent current climate conditions. Species occurrence records used as input to the models, however, are frequently collected from time periods that differ from those from which the climate is derived. Since climate variability can be significant within and outside baselines, and the distributions of some plants and animals (e.g., annual plants, insects) can adjust to environmental conditions on much shorter time scales, this mismatch between collection records and climatic baselines may affect the utility and accuracy of model outputs. We investigated how the choice of baseline periods influenced modelling efforts, anticipating that climate baselines derived from the same temporal period as the species records would yield improved ENMs. Ten simulated species' distributions were modelled using an ENM (Maxent) for (a) occurrences and climates within the same temporal period, based on eighteen 10-year baselines within the 20th century and (b) all available samples and climate baselines from 1951-2000 and 1961-1990. Each model was projected onto all the available 10-year climate scenarios and compared to the models trained on the corresponding scenario. We show that temporal mismatches of species occurrences and climate baselines can result in significantly poorer distribution models. Such temporal mismatch may be unavoidable for many studies, but we emphasize here the need to match the time range of samples and climate data whenever possible. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Predicting the suitable habitat of a species is one of the adequate and enhancing approach in biodiversity conservation planning and implementation. Species habitat distribution is closely linked with environmental factors and bioclimatic variables used as prediction variables in species distribution models (SDMs). Recent application of satellite remote sensing data and the bioclimatic variables has created an advanced way to improve the SDMs performance. In this study, MaxEnt was used to predict species habitat distribution. Our objectives are to assess the application of satellite remote sensing data in predicting the potential habitat suitability of the arid plant species. We have selected Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce (Ghaf), the national tree of the UAE. We have chosen 33 environmental variables along with 90 species occurrences and for the final model simulation we have used three modeling scenarios. MaxEnt results showed that the model simulation with all key variables has substantially improved the potential habitat suitability prediction with a mean Area Under receiver operating Curve (AUC) value of 0.984, indicating a better predictive accuracy in the integration of satellite remote sensing data, edaphic variables and topographic parameters. Model results showed that the spatial proportions of the potential habitat suitability in the UAE consisted of high (2%), medium (6%) and low (9%) habitat suitability classes. The MaxEnt results revealed that precipitation of the coldest quarter (32.5%), NDVI (12.1%) and elevation (8%), had significant contribution to the potential habitat distribution of UAE Ghaf trees. Cold season precipitation is the most significant climate constraint on the habitat distribution. The most habitat suitability of Ghaf tree in the UAE was within a certain range of NDVI, LST, elevation, aspect, and precipitation patterns. This paper finding could be useful for environmental managers for implementing reforestation not only in UAE but also for the entire middle eastern regions with similar hyper arid conditions.

AB  - Human activities may generate geometrical landscape (i.e. composed of rectilinear and repetitive landscape units) structures that can significantly influence the spatial distribution of birds. While bird distribution in various landscape types has been extensively studied, the role played by landscape configuration and composition in different facets of bird diversity remains unclear. Here, these two main components of landscape characteristics (i.e. configuration and composition) are disentangled and their relative influence on three different facets of bird assemblages: taxonomic and functional characteristics, and the presence of rare species, is tested. We chose four large coastal salinas of Western France as a relevant model of geometrical and human-dominated landscapes where each landscape unit can be easily identified and mapped. The landscape characteristics of these sites were mapped and quantified. Then, terrestrial breeding birds were sampled in 172 point-counts using a standardized protocol. 69 diurnal terrestrial bird species were detected and considered in analyses (waterbirds and owls excluded). Landscape composition was found to have a higher influence on bird communities than landscape configuration, which fits with the "landscape composition hypothesis". More specifically, the most "extreme" landscapes - those with low terrestrial surface areas, low landscape richness and diversity, low cohesion, and very patchy landscapes with complex geometrical shapes - host the lowest bird taxonomic abundance, richness and diversity and functional richness, but are characterized by the presence of rare species ( mainly wetland specialist species, e.g. Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus and species with restricted ranges e.g. Bluethroat Luscinia svecica namnetum). Our results suggest that conservation plans in such geometrical and human-dominated habitats should not only focus on one aspect of landscape characteristics or one aspect of biological diversity but also consider the adverse effects of landscape characteristics on these different facets.

AB  - Identifying suitable habitats of protected species is an essential question in ecology and conservation planning. Modelling approaches have been widely used to identify environmental features that contribute to a species' ecological requirements and distribution. On Reunion Island, a fast-growing French territory located in the south-western Indian Ocean, anthropogenic impacts are mainly concentrated along the coast, representing a potential threat for Indo-Pacific bottlenose (Tursiops aduncus) and spinner (Stenella longirostris) dolphins, two resident coastal species. Beside coastal development, commercial and recreational dolphin-watching are growing, particularly along the west coast. To promote effective local management, habitat modelling was applied using presence-only data collected from 2008 to 2012 on the west coast of the island. Ecological Niche Factor Analyses were used to investigate the effect of physiographic variables on the distribution of these two dolphin species and delineate suitable habitats. It was found that the core habitat of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins was mainly restricted by depth and confined to coastal waters ranging from 4.7 to 75.8 m deep. The species preferentially used soft substrates (sand and mud) and tended to be ubiquitous in terms of substrate type/color used. Foraging activities were significantly related to soft substrates. The diurnal core habitat of spinner dolphins was confined to one discrete area, on the flat portion of the insular shelf, between 45.1 m and 70.7 m of depth. Suitable habitat was mainly related to soft and light-colored substrates, with a clear avoidance of dark-colored substrates. The core habitats of both species were very restrained spatially and therefore vulnerable to human activities. The fine scale habitat mapping achieved in this study represents baseline data to conduct ad hoc impact assessment and support conservation actions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Time-lagged responses of biological variables to landscape modifications are widely recognized, but rarely considered in ecological studies. In order to test for the existence of time-lags in the response of trees, small mammals, birds and frogs to changes in fragment area and connectivity, we studied a fragmented and highly dynamic landscape in the Atlantic forest region. We also investigated the biological correlates associated with differential responses among taxonomic groups. Species richness and abundance for four taxonomic groups were measured in 21 secondary forest fragments during the same period (2000-2002), following a standardized protocol. Data analyses were based on power regressions and model selection procedures. The model inputs included present (2000) and past (1962, 1981) fragment areas and connectivity, as well as observed changes in these parameters. Although past landscape structure was particularly relevant for trees, all taxonomic groups (except small mammals) were affected by landscape dynamics, exhibiting a time-lagged response. Furthermore, fragment area was more important for species groups with lower dispersal capacity, while species with higher dispersal ability had stronger responses to connectivity measures. Although these secondary forest fragments still maintain a large fraction of their original biodiversity, the delay in biological response combined with high rates of deforestation and fast forest regeneration imply in a reduction in the average age of the forest. This also indicates that future species losses are likely, especially those that are more strictly-forest dwellers. Conservation actions should be implemented to reduce species extinction, to maintain old-growth forests and to favour the regeneration process. Our results demonstrate that landscape history can strongly affect the present distribution pattern of species in fragmented landscapes, and should be considered in conservation planning.

AB  - The nested subset pattern has been widely studied in the last 20 years, and recent syntheses have challenged the prevalence of this pattern in nature. We examined the degree of nestedness, its temporal variability and its environmental correlates in stream insects of a boreal drainage system. We also examined differences between nested and idiosyncratic species in site occupancy, niche position and niche breadth.
   Koutajoki drainage basin in northern Finland.
   We used (i) nestedness analyses with three null models for testing the significance of nestedness; (ii) Spearman rank correlation to examine the correlates of nestedness; (iii) outlying mean index analysis to analyse the niche characteristics of species; (iv) and t-test to examine differences in niche breadth, niche position and site occupancy of idiosyncratic and other nested species.
   Stream insect assemblages were significantly nested in each of the three study years. The maximally packed matrices were significantly nested according to the nestedness calculator based on null models I (species frequencies and site richness equiprobable) and II (species frequencies fixed and site richness equiprobable), but non-significant based on a conservative null model III (species frequencies and site richness fixed to those of the observed matrix). The most important correlate of nestedness was stream size, whereas isolation, productivity (total phosphorus) and habitat heterogeneity exhibited non-significant relationship with nestedness. Idiosyncratic species occurred, on average, at more sites than nested species, mirroring the restricted distributions of several nested species that were inclined towards species-rich sites. Idiosyncratic and nested species also differed in niche position and niche breadth, with idiosyncratic species having, on average, less marginal niche positions and wider niches than nested species.
   Stream size correlated with nestedness, possibly because small streams were inhabited only by species able to persist under, or colonize shortly after, disturbances, while most species could occur at larger sites where disturbances are less severe. From the conservation perspective, our findings suggest that stream size really matters, given that sites with high species richness and many rare species are more likely to occur in larger streams. However, also the requirements of idiosyncratic species should be accommodated in conservation planning.

AB  - The green anole Anolis carolinensis invaded the Ogasawara Islands in Japan, drove various native species to extinction, and its distribution expanded 14years after initial establishment. A. carolinensis invaded Okinawa Island, but it has not expanded its distribution in more than 25years, although its density is extremely high in the southern region. To determine whether A. carolinensis has the potential to expand its distribution on Okinawa Island, we performed phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial ND2 DNA sequences to study the origin of A. carolinensis that invaded Okinawa Island. We further used a species distribution model (MaxEnt) based on the distribution of native populations in North America to identify ecologically suitable areas on Okinawa Island. Nucleotide sequence analysis shows that the invader A. carolinensis originated in the western part of the Gulf Coast and inland areas of the United States and that a portion of the anoles on Okinawa was not introduced via the Ogasawara Islands. The MaxEnt predictions indicate that most areas in Okinawa Island are suitable for A. carolinensis. Therefore, A.carolinensis may have the potential to expand its distribution in Okinawa Island. The predictions indicate that habitat suitability is high in areas of high annual mean temperature and urbanized areas. The values of precipitation in summer in the northern region of Okinawa Island were higher compared with those of North America, which reduced the habitat suitability in Okinawa Island. Adaptation to low temperatures, an increase in the mean temperature through global warming, and an increase in open environments through land development will likely expand the distribution of A. carolinensis in Okinawa Island. Therefore, we must continue to monitor the introduced populations and be alert to the possibility that city planning that increases open environments may cause their range to expand.

AB  - Effective conservation of biodiversity requires good ecological information on species, populations and communities. This is particularly true for the Malaysia state of Sarawak in Borneo, whose rich biological diversity remains poorly documented, with many wetland species facing serious threats resulting from habitat alteration, pollution and overexploitation. This study aims to quantify the ecological characteristics of an endemic potamid freshwater crab, Isolapotamon bauense Ng 1987, a species listed as 'Vulnerable' in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. A capture-mark-recapture exercise was conducted at two sites along a stream at Gunung Serambu in the Bau region to better understand the ecology of this species. Our results reveal a sex ratio of 1:1, whereas analysis of carapace width-weight relationship document a negative allometric growth pattern and a relatively low condition factor for intermediate sized specimens. Males and females do not differ significantly in body mass and there is no obvious sexual size dimorphism. Over the month long study, the size frequency of carapace classes indicates the population was dominated by smaller size-classes. A linear regression shows a trend in the number of crabs captured with lower air temperatures and higher relative humidity. It also suggests a strong positive correlation with the depth of associated streams, used as a proxy for soil water saturation. We use the MARK program to estimate the overall population size at 90 m2 sampling area, utilizing Akaike's Information Criterion for model selection. The best model incorporated individual heterogeneity and the effect of rain during the survey on capture probability. The population estimate is 133 individuals with 95 % confidence interval of 106-187. Other ecological aspects of the species, such as local distribution and, habitat and food preferences, will need to be studied in order to develop a concise conservation plan for the species.

AB  - Large Marine Ecosystems such as the Canary Current system off West Africa sustains high abundance of small pelagic prey, which attracts marine predators. Seabirds are top predators often used as biodiversity surrogates and sentinel species of the marine ecosystem health, thus frequently informing marine conservation planning. This study presents the first data on the spatial (GPS-loggers) and trophic (stable isotope analysis) ecology of a tropical seabird-the endangered Cape Verde shearwater Calonectris edwardsii-during both the incubation and the chick-rearing periods of two consecutive years. This information was related with marine environmental predictors (species distribution models), existent areas of conservation concern for seabirds (i.e. marine Important Bird Areas; marine IBAs) and threats to the marine environment in the West African areas heavily used by the shearwaters. There was an apparent inter-annual consistency on the spatial, foraging and trophic ecology of Cape Verde shearwater, but a strong alteration on the foraging strategies of adult breeders among breeding phases (i.e. from incubation to chick-rearing). During incubation, birds mostly targeted a discrete region off West Africa, known by its enhanced productivity profile and thus also highly exploited by international industrial fishery fleets. When chick-rearing, adults exploited the comparatively less productive tropical environment within the islands of Cape Verde, at relatively close distance from their breeding colony. The species enlarged its trophic niche and increased the trophic level of their prey from incubation to chick-rearing, likely to provision their chicks with a more diversified and better quality diet. There was a high overlap between the Cape Verde shearwaters foraging areas with those of European shearwater species that overwinter in this area and known areas of megafauna bycatch off West Africa, but very little overlap with existing Marine Important Bird Areas. Further investigation on the potential nefarious effects of fisheries on seabird communities exploiting the Canary Current system off West Africa is needed. Such negative effects could be alleviated or even dissipated if the 'fisheries-conservation hotspots' identified for the region, would be legislated as Marine Protected Areas.

AB  - Bats are a highly diverse order with substantial economic and ecological value. Similarly, forests in South Africa form a valuable biome supporting unique biotic diversity, yet forest bat communities have not previously been surveyed. We sampled 17 forests, of seven forest types and three forest groups, in the Eastern Cape and southern KwaZulu-Natal provinces, located within the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany global biodiversity hotspot. We utilized capture and acoustic survey methods to compile the first bat species inventory for these forests. Species identification was performed with a combined approach of morphology, echolocation, and DNA barcodes. With this we contributed novel DNA barcodes to the Barcode of Life Data System. A total of 25 species was recorded, with range extensions southward into the Eastern Cape for six species, indicating the region to be more diverse than previously thought. Updated modelled distribution maps for these species are presented. We compiled the first reference call library of hand released bats for South African forest habitats, and the southeast region of the country. We compared species richness, diversity, and dissimilarity of the forest types and found that Scarp forests host the highest species richness and diversity. Patterns of species assemblage similarities between forest groups are attributed to forest biogeographical history and historical dispersal routes of forest fauna. A comprehensive survey, such as this, may assist in the compilation and implementation of forest conservation management plans and future monitoring programs.

AB  - Premise of the Study Methods Community phylogenetic methods incorporate information on evolutionary relationships into studies of organismal assemblages. We used a community phylogenetic framework to investigate relationships and biogeographic affinities and to calculate phylogenetic signal of endemism and invasiveness for the flora of the pine rocklands-a globally critically imperiled ecosystem with a significant portion of its distribution in South Florida, United States. We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships of 538 vascular plant taxa, which represent 92.28% of the vascular flora of the pine rocklands. We estimated phylogenetic signal for endemism and invasiveness using phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models. We determined the native range for each species in the data set and calculated the total number of species sourced from each region and all possible combinations of these regions. Key Results Conclusions The pine rockland flora includes representatives of all major vascular plant lineages, and most species have native ranges in the New World. There was strong phylogenetic signal for endemism, but not for invasiveness. Community phylogenetics has high potential value for conservation planning, particularly for fragmented and endangered ecosystems like the pine rockland. Strong phylogenetic signal for endemic species in our data set, which also tend to be threatened or endangered, can help to identify species at risk, as well as fragments where those species occur, highlighting conservation priorities. Our results indicate, at least in the pine rockland ecosystem, no phylogenetic signal for invasive species, and thus other information must be used to predict the potential for invasiveness.

AB  - Shifts in species distributions are major fingerprint of climate change. Examining changes in species abundance structures at a continental scale enables robust evaluation of climate change influences, but few studies have conducted these evaluations due to limited data and methodological constraints. In this study, we estimate temporal changes in abundance from North American Breeding Bird Survey data at the scale of physiographic strata to examine the relative influence of different components of climatic factors and evaluate the hypothesis that shifting species distributions are multidirectional in resident bird species in North America. We quantify the direction and velocity of the abundance shifts of 57 permanent resident birds over 44 years using a centroid analysis. For species with significant abundance shifts in the centroid analysis, we conduct a more intensive correlative analysis to identify climate components most strongly associated with composite change of abundance within strata. Our analysis focus on two contrasts: the relative importance of climate extremes vs. averages, and of temperature vs. precipitation in strength of association with abundance change. Our study shows that 36 species had significant abundance shifts over the study period. The average velocity of the centroid is 5.89 km.yr(-1). The shifted distance on average covers 259 km, 9% of range extent. Our results strongly suggest that the climate change fingerprint in studied avian distributions is multidirectional. Among 6 directions with significant abundance shifts, the northwestward shift was observed in the largest number of species (n = 13). The temperature/average climate model consistently has greater predictive ability than the precipitation/extreme climate model in explaining strata-level abundance change. Our study shows heterogeneous avian responses to recent environmental changes. It highlights needs for more species-specific approaches to examine contributing factors to recent distributional changes and for comprehensive conservation planning for climate change adaptation.

AB  - Two ecologically and economically important, and threatened Dipterocarp trees Sal (Shorea robusta) and Garjan (Dipterocarpus turbinatus) form mono-specific canopies in dry deciduous, moist deciduous, evergreen, and semievergreen forests across South Asia and continental parts of Southeast Asia. They provide valuable timber and play an important role in the economy of many Asian countries. However, both Dipterocarp trees are threatened by continuing forest clearing, habitat alteration, and global climate change. While climatic regimes in the Asian tropics are changing, research on climate change-driven shifts in the distribution of tropical Asian trees is limited. We applied a bioclimatic modeling approach to these two Dipterocarp trees Sal and Garjan. We used presence-only records for the tree species, five bioclimatic variables, and selected two climatic scenarios (RCP4.5: an optimistic scenario and RCP8.5: a pessimistic scenario) and three global climate models (GCMs) to encompass the full range of variation in the models. We modeled climate space suitability for both species, projected to 2070, using a climate envelope modeling tool "MaxEnt" (the maximum entropy algorithm). Annual precipitation was the key bioclimatic variable in all GCMs for explaining the current and future distributions of Sal and Garjan (Sal: 49.97 +/- 1.33; Garjan: 37.63 +/- 1.19). Our models predict that suitable climate space for Sal will decline by 24% and 34% (the mean of the three GCMs) by 2070 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. In contrast, the consequences of imminent climate change appear less severe for Garjan, with a decline of 17% and 27% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The findings of this study can be used to set conservation guidelines for Sal and Garjan by identifying vulnerable habitats in the region. In addition, the natural habitats of Sal and Garjan can be categorized as low to high risk under changing climates where artificial regeneration should be undertaken for forest restoration.

AB  - One of the major drivers of amphibian population declines is Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We sought to identify the major environmental drivers of Bd prevalence in Texas, USA, by drawing results from museum specimens. We sampled one of the largest museum collections in Texas, the Biodiversity Research and Teaching Collections at Texas A&M University. Our sampling focused on the 9 amphibian species with the widest geographical distribution within the state, where we sub-sampled 30% of each species per decade from 1930 to present via skin swabs, totaling 1501 independent sampling events, and used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to detect pathogen presence. We analyzed several geo-referenced variables describing climatic conditions to identify potential factors influencing the likelihood of presence of Bd using boosted regression trees. Our final model suggests the most influential variables are mean temperature of driest quarter, annual mean temperature, temperature annual range, and mean diurnal range. The most likely suitable range for Bd is currently found in the Blackland Prairie and Cross Timbers ecoregions. Results of our future (to the year 2040) projections suggest that Bd could expand its current distribution. Our model could play an important role when developing an integrated conservation plan through (1) focusing future field work on locations with a high likelihood of presence, (2) assisting in the choice of locations for restoration, and (3) developing future research plans including those necessary for projecting reactions to climate change. Our model also could integrate new presence data of Bd when they become available to enhance prediction precision.

AB  - Little remains of the Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla F.Muell. ex Benth.) woodlands of Australia, primarily due to land clearing for grazing and agriculture. Many threatened species in this region are poorly studied, and the life history traits of some herbaceous species such as ephemeral shoot systems, mean that conservation assessments are difficult. Recent gas pipeline developments have led to an increased need to understand the ecology and genetics of such taxa, in order to advise offset and translocation activities. Xerothamnella herbacea R.Baker is an endangered ephemeral herbaceous species from the Brigalow Belt region, which dies back during prolonged dry conditions. The aim of this study was to map the extent of potentially suitable habitat of this species, including determination of population extent within existing protected area estate. The species population sizes, reproductive activity and evidence of clonal spread, as well as the levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding, across the species range were also assessed to provide guidance for potential translocation and offsetting programs. The genetic results were related to the species suitable habitat distribution to test whether historic or recent habitat fragmentation most explains genetic patterns in this species. Most of the populations of this species were found to be small with less than 100 plants. The species appears not to be limited by its reproductive output, suggesting other factors may limit its abundance. The species populations have moderate to low genetic diversity suggesting the species is genetically viable in the medium term but are inbred which may be partially due to vegetative spread. Geographic proximity does not predict genetic similarity of populations and diversity is not correlated with population size. The results indicate potential translocation or offsetting programs need to account for genetic relationships in their planning. Resprouting ability has potentially assisted the species to slow the pace of genetic diversity loss due to anthropogenic fragmentation.

AB  - Reducing conflict between humans and wildlife is considered a top conservation priority. However, increasingly human-induced disturbances across natural landscapes have escalated encounters between humans and wildlife. In Nepal, forests have been destroyed, fragmented, and developed for human settlements, agricultural produc-tion, and urban centers for decades. As a result, human-wildlife conflict, in the form of crop-raiding, livestock predation, and injuries to humans and wildlife, is common throughout the country. In particular, crop-raiding by macaques is an increasingly common form of human-wildlife conflict. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) have been identified as a top ten crop-raiding wildlife species in Nepal. In order to better understand the nationwide distribution and intensity of human-rhesus macaque conflict (HRMC), we conducted an extensive literature review of reported incidences of HRMC during the period 2000 to 2021 in Nepal. We also created an online survey to obtain nationwide data on the location and severity of HRMC, and modeled the set of ecological factors that affect habitat suitability for rhesus macaques. An ensemble of three different species distribution model (SDM) algorithms were used to analyze these data. We found that almost 44% of Nepal's land area contains suitable habitat for rhesus macaques, with less than 8% of all suitable habitat located in protected national parks. As humans continue to alter and fragment natural landscapes, HRMC in Nepal has intensified. At present, nearly 15% of the country's land area in which human settlements are permitted, is characterized by moderate or high rates of HRMC. We argue that prioritizing programs of forest restoration, strategic management plans designed to connect isolated forest fragments with high rhesus macaque population densities, creating government programs that compensate farmers for income lost due to crop-raiding, and educational outreach that informs local vil-lagers of the importance of conservation and protecting biodiversity, offer the most effective solutions to reduce HRMC in Nepal.

AB  - Comparative studies of extinction risk in vertebrate taxa often find that a small geographic range size is the strongest predictor of a high rate of species decline. This suggests that narrowly distributed species are more vulnerable to human impacts, which may have implications for the predictive use of comparative extinction-risk models in conservation planning. However, this association is potentially circular because many species that have suffered substantial declines now have small geographic ranges, making it difficult to separate the role of range size as a predictor of extinction risk from its role as a response to human impact. Here we use data for Australian mammals to compare models of extinction risk that include current geographic range size with models that include historic range sizes reconstructed for the period before European settlement. We find that current range size is a strong predictor of a species' IUCN Red List classification. However, when historic range sizes are used, range size is non-significant and life-history traits assume primary importance in the model. Models that include current range size also tend to underestimate, levels of latent extinction risk (the discrepancy between a species' current extinction risk and that predicted from its biological traits), giving misleading predictions of the species and regions with greatest potential for future species declines. The results suggest that there is circularity in the use of current range size to predict rates of species decline,:and that species with inherently small distributions are not necessarily the most vulnerable to human impact.

AB  - The octopus Eledone cirrhosa and the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula present the same feeding habits and distributional preferences in the Mediterranean Sea. We explore patterns of spatial overlap between these species to address coexistence and infer possible competition from spatial patterns in the western Mediterranean Sea. A spatially explicit modelling approach revealed that spatial overlap mainly responded to the distribution of shared resources, where coexistence is allowed by different ecological processes. Catshark (k-strategy) was highly abundant and widely distributed. However, the fluctuating population dynamics of octopus (r-strategy) explained the variations in spatial patterns of overlap. Spatial structuring across the study area was observed both in population distributions and in species interactions (coexistence or exclusion). Areas with high resources in terms of specific prey items (Catalan Sea) or alternative supplies, such as niche opportunities and ecosystem functions defined by community diversity (Balearic Islands), favoured species coexistence. Sea surface temperature showed opposite effects on overlap in northern and southern regions of the study area, which were not related to differences in species sensitivity. We suggest a surface trophic link, where different phytoplankton communities at each region might have opposite responses to temperature. This triggers contrasting mechanisms of food transfer to deeper benthic communities that subsequently facilitates species overlap. Characterizing how benthic and pelagic seascape properties shape species interactions across space and time is pivotal to properly address community spatial dynamics and move towards ecosystem-based management for sustainable fisheries and conservation planning.

AB  - The tree rhododendrons include the most widely distributed Himalayan Rhododendron species belonging to the subsection Arborea. Distributions of two members of this subspecies were modelled using bioclimatic data for current conditions (1950-2000). A subset of the least correlated bioclimatic variables was used for ecological niche modelling (ENM). We used an ENM ensemble method in the BiodiversityR R-package to map the suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons based on 217 point location records. Ensemble bioclimatic models for tree rhododendrons had high predictive power with bioclimatic variables, which also separated the climatic spaces for the two species. Tree rhododendrons were found occurring in a wide range of climate and the distributional limits were associated with isothermality, temperature ranges, temperature of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the warmest quarter of the year. The most suitable climatic space for tree rhododendrons was predicted to be in western Yunnan, China, with suitability declining towards the west and east. Its occurrence in a wide range of climatic settings with highly dissected habitats speaks to the adaptive capacity of the species, which might open up future options for their conservation planning in regions where they are listed as threatened.

AB  - Predictable seasonal changes in resources are thought to drive the timing of annual animal migrations; however, we currently understand little about which environmental cues or resources are tracked by different migratory bird species across the planet. Understanding which environmental cues or resources birds track in multiple migratory systems is a prerequisite to developing generalizable conservation plans for migratory birds in a changing global environment. Within the New World, climatic differences experienced by Nearctic-Neotropical migratory (NNM; i.e. breed in North America and spend the nonbreeding period in the Neotropics) and Neotropical austral migratory (NAM; i.e. breed and spend the nonbreeding period wholly within South America) bird species suggest that their migratory strategies may be shaped by unique selective pressures. We used data gathered from individuals fitted with light-level geolocators to build species distribution models (SDMs) to test which environmental factors drive the migratory strategies of species in each system. To do so, we evaluated whether temperature, precipitation, and primary productivity (NDVI) were related to the seasonal distributions of an NNM (Eastern Kingbird [Tyrannus tyrannus]) and NAM species (Fork-tailed Flycatcher [T. savana]). Both Eastern Kingbird and Fork-tailed Flycatcher locations were positively correlated with high precipitation during their nonbreeding seasons. Eastern Kingbird locations were positively correlated with both NDVI and temperature during their breeding season and both pre-and post-breeding migrations. Fork-tailed Flycatcher locations were positively correlated with both temperature and precipitation during both migrations, but only temperature during the breeding season. The value of extending the application of geolocator data, such as in SDMs, is underscored by the finding that precipitation was such an important predictor of the nonbreeding distributions of both types of migrants, as it remains unclear how global climate change will affect wet-dry cycles in the tropics.

AB  - Snow has far-reaching effects on ecosystem processes and biodiversity in high-latitude ecosystems, but these have been poorly considered in climate change impact models(1,2). Here, to forecast future trends in species occurrences and richness, we fitted species-environment models with temperature data from three climate scenarios and simulated up to a 40% decrease in snow cover duration (SCD)(3). We used plot-scale data on 273 vascular plant, moss and lichen species in 1,200 study sites spanning a wide range of environmental conditions typical for mountainous Arctic landscapes (within 165 km(2)). According to the models, a rise in temperature increased overall species richness and caused only one species to lose all suitable habitat. In contrast, a shorter SCD tempered the effect of increasing temperature on species richness and led to accelerated rates of species' local extinctions after a tipping point at 20-30% SCD decrease. All three species groups showed similar extinction rates but contrasting species richness responses. Our simulations indicate that future biodiversity patterns in Arctic regions are highly dependent on the evolution of snow conditions. Climate impact models that ignore the effects of snow cover change may provide biased biodiversity projections, with potentially erratic implications for Arctic nature conservation planning.

AB  - With current declines of vertebrate taxa meeting or exceeding those of historic mass extinction events, there is a growing need to investigate the main drivers of losses. Two of the main drivers of declines are global climate and land-use changes, both affecting multiple groups of taxa. Amphibians are at great risk from these two drivers of change and investigations into the impact of future change could assist with the formation of conservation plans to mitigate losses. Forecasting changes in suitable habitat with ecological niche modeling serves as a useful tool to begin to understand how species may respond to anthropogenic change. We used Maxent to model suitable habitat space of 33 amphibian species within the Midwestern U.S. under multiple future climate change scenarios and used current and predicted changes in land-use to examine the predicted impact of global climate and land-use change. We predicted reductions in suitable habitat for a high proportion of species in all model scenarios, while few species were predicted to gain suitable habitat. No significant differences in percentage change in habitat space were determined between models predicting suitable habitat solely using climate change scenarios or model output that incorporated the impact of land-use change. Species richness of amphibians is predicted to decrease based on future climate and climate + land-use scenarios. In the future, we encourage continuation of the examination of land-use and other global stressors, and further investigations into physiological tolerances of amphibian species to create more robust predictions.

AB  - Accurate and up-to-date biodiversity forecasts enable robust planning for environmental management and conservation of landscapes under a wide range of uses. Future predictions of the species composition of ecological communities complement more frequently reported species richness estimates to better characterize the different dimensions of biodiversity. The models that make community composition forecasts are calibrated with data on species' geographic patterns for the present, which may not be good proxies for future patterns. The future establishment of novel communities represents data on species interactions unaccounted for by these models. However, detecting them in a systematic way presents challenges due to the lack of monitoring data for landscapes with high environmental turnover, where such communities are likely to establish. Here, we propose lightweight monitoring over both ecological and anthropogenic disturbance gradients using passive sensors (i.e., those that operate continuously without much human input) to detect novel communities with the aim of updating models that make community composition forecasts. Monitoring over these two gradients should maximize detection of novel communities and improve understanding of relationships between community composition and environmental change. Further, barriers regarding cost and effort are reduced by using relatively few sensors requiring minimal upkeep. Ongoing updates to community composition forecasts based on novel community data and better understanding of the associated uncertainty should improve future decision-making for both resource management and conservation efforts.

AB  - Ecosystem distributions are expected to shift as a result of global warming, raising concerns about the long-term utility of reserve systems based on coarse-filter ecosystem representation. We tested the extent to which proportional ecosystem representation targets would be maintained under a changing climate by projecting the distribution of the major ecosystems of Alberta, Canada, into the future using bioclimatic envelope models and then calculating the composition of reserves in successive periods. We used the Marxan conservation planning software to generate the suite of reserve systems for our test, varying the representation target and degree of reserve clumping. Our climate envelope projections for the 2080s indicate that virtually all reserves will, in time, be comprised of different ecosystem types than today. Nevertheless, our proportional targets for ecosystem representation were maintained across all time periods, with only minor exceptions. We hypothesize that this stability in representation arises because ecosystems may be serving as proxies for land facets, the stable abiotic landscape features that delineate major arenas of biological activity. The implication is that accommodating climate change may not require abandoning the conventional ecosystem-based approach to reserve design in favour of a strictly abiotic approach, since the two approaches may be largely synonymous.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict in unprotected areas, especially those bordering reserves, has resulted in the global home range and population size reduction of naturally occurring wildlife. Simultaneously, rural communities and commercial farmlands at the interface of human development and natural habitat face severe threats to their livelihoods and agricultural security, often resulting in the vast eradication of real or perceived damage-causing animals (DCAs). The knowledge of local people was relied on to elucidate the dynamic and interwoven social, economic and ecological factors giving rise to the largely undocumented conflict between landowners and wildlife adjacent to the Boland Mountain Complex, South Africa. Subsequently, the spatial location of observed and expected zones of species-specific risk on a regional level was anticipated and mapped using a maximum entropy algorithm. The highest level of tolerance by farmers was shown for primates and ungulates, while tolerance for carnivores, avifauna and invasive or feral species were comparatively lower. The results presented in this manuscript will enable the prioritization of locations and species to create improved mitigation and management plans. It will furthermore provide for more accurate allocation of conservation resources to minimize conflicts, optimize agricultural yield, reduce wildlife off-take, and ultimately ameliorate human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - 1. Species distribution models (SDM) are increasingly applied as predictive tools for purposes of conservation planning and management. Such models rely on the concept of the ecological niche and assume that distribution patterns of the modelled species are at some sort of equilibrium with the environment. This assumption contrasts with empirical evidence indicating that distribution patterns of many species are constrained by dispersal limitation.
   2. We demonstrate that the performance of SDM based on presence-only data can be significantly enhanced by incorporating distance constraints (functions relating the likelihood of species' occurrences at a site to the distance of the site from known presence locations) to the modelling procedure. This result is highly consistent for a variety of niche-based models (ENFA, DOMAIN and Mahalanobis distance), distance functions (nearest neighbour distance, cumulative distance and Gaussian filter) and taxonomic groups (plants, snails and birds, a total of 226 species).
   3. Distance constraints are expected to enhance the accuracy of niche-based models even in the absence of strong dispersal limitation by accounting for mass effects and spatial autocorrelation in environmental factors for which data are not available.
   4. While distance-based methods outperformed niche-based models when all data were used, their accuracy deteriorated sharply with smaller sample sizes. Niche-based methods are shown to cope better with small sample sizes than distance-based methods, demonstrating the potential advantage of niche-based models when calibration data are limited.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Incorporating distance constraints in SDM provides a simple yet powerful method to account for spatial autocorrelation in patterns of species distribution, and is shown empirically to improve significantly the performance of such models. We therefore recommend incorporating distance constraints in future applications of SDM.

AB  - Populations of large mammals have declined at alarming rates, especially in areas with intensified land use where species can only persist in small habitat fragments. To support conservation planning, we developed habitat suitability models for the Walia ibex (Capra walie), an endangered wild goat endemic to the Simen Mountains, Ethiopia. We calibrated several models that differ in statistical properties to estimate the spatial extent of suitable habitats of the Walia ibex in the Simen Mountains, as well as in other parts of the Ethiopian highlands to assess potentially suitable areas outside the current distribution range of the species. We further addressed the potential consequences of future climate change using a climate model with four emission scenarios. Model projections estimated the potential suitable habitat under current climate to 501-672 km(2) in Simen and 6,251-7,732 km(2) in other Ethiopian mountains. Under projected climate change by 2,080, the suitable habitat became larger in Simen but smaller in other parts of Ethiopia. The projected expansion in Simen is contrary to the general expectation of shrinking suitable habitats for high-elevation species under climate warming and may partly be due to the ruggedness of these particular mountains. The Walia ibex has a wide altitudinal range and is able to exploit very steep slopes, allowing it to track the expected vegetation shift to higher altitudes. However, this potential positive impact may not last long under continued climate warming, as the species will not have much more new space left to colonize. Our study indicates that the current distribution range can be substantially increased by reintroducing and/or translocating the species to other areas with suitable habitat. Indeed, to increase the viability and prospects for survival of this flagship species, we strongly recommend human-assisted reintroduction to other Ethiopian mountains. Emulating the successful reintroduction of the Alpine ibex that has spread from a single mountain in Italy to its historical ranges of the Alps in Europe might contribute to saving the Walia ibex from extinction.

AB  - Recent growth of investments in wind energy and power industries has increased concerns about the associated adverse impacts on wildlife. In particular, flying vertebrates are especially at risk, both directly, through an extra mortality rate due to collision with turbines and electrocution, and indirectly through habitat loss or fragmentation. In this study, we propose a modelling approach that combines species distribution models and data managed in geographic information systems to predict and quantify the effects of wind turbines and power lines on the breeding habitat of a soaring migratory bird, the black stork Ciconia nigra, in Italy. The species is recolonizing the country, where it had been driven to extinction in the Middle Age by human persecution. Today, infrastructures such as those considered in our study might in fact hamper this recolonization. Our results show a high probability of presence of the species in several areas in Italy. The most important variables in influencing habitat suitability for C. nigra are the mean temperature of May followed by the distance from urban areas, inland wetlands and hydrographic network. Exposure to wind turbine collision and electrocution resulted to be potentially high. In particular, in Northern Italy the main potential risk of mortality for C. nigra is posed by power lines, whereas in southern regions the species might be mostly threatened by wind turbines. Our approach makes it possible to detect suitable areas that, although not yet colonized by the species, would imply a high mortality risk should the species colonize them in the future. The tool we provide may therefore prove useful to conservationists and landscape planners in order to mitigate the impact of human infrastructures on this species and encourage a more sustainable planning.

AB  - Southwestern white pine (Pinus strobiforrnis; SWWP) is a conifer species that occurs at mid to high elevations in the mountains of Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico. A key component of mixed conifer forests in the region, SWWP is an important species for wildlife and biodiversity. The dual threats of the non-native fungal pathogen that causes white pine blister rust (WPBR) and a warmer, drier projected future climate have created an uncertain future for SWWP. In this study, we used a novel multi-scale optimization approach including an ensemble of four species distribution modeling methods to explore the relationship between SWWP occurrence and environmental variables based on climate, soil, and topography. Spatial projections of these models reflecting the present climate provide an improved range map for this species that can be used to guide field data collection and monitoring of WPBR outbreaks. Future projections based on two emissions scenarios and an ensemble of 15 general circulation models project a large range shift and range contraction by 2080. Changes in the future distribution were particularly extreme under the higher emissions scenario, with a more than 1000 km northerly shift in the mean latitude and 500 m increase in the mean elevation of the species' suitable habitat. This coincided with a range contraction of over 60% and a significant increase in habitat fragmentation. The ability of SWWP to realize its projected future range will depend on colonization at the leading edge of the range shift, including dispersal dynamics, resistance to WPBR, competition with other species, and genetic adaptations to local climate. Our results provide information that can be used to guide monitoring efforts and inform conservation planning for this keystone species.

AB  - 1. Corridors are commonly used to connect fragments of wildlife habitat, yet the identification of conservation corridors typically neglects processes of habitat selection and movement for target organisms. New technologies and analytical tools make it possible to better integrate landscape patterns with behavioural processes. We illustrate the integration of resource selection functions (RSFs) and least-cost path (LCP) analyses for the purpose of corridor planning for two large carnivores.
   2. We used RSFs developed from Global Positioning System telemetry data to predict the seasonal distribution of two large carnivores: grizzly bears Ursus arctos and cougars Puma concolor. We then applied LCP analyses to identify potential corridors in two fragmented montane landscapes Canmore and Crowsnest Pass-in Alberta, Canada.
   3. Grizzly bear habitat selection in both areas positively correlated with greenness in all seasons and soil wetness and proximity to water in the summer when both variables were associated with bear forage. During spring, grizzly bear occurrence in Canmore inversely correlated with road density.
   4. For cougars, habitat selection varied by region: it negatively correlated with road density in Canmore during non-winter and positively correlated with terrain ruggedness in Crowsnest Pass. Cougar occurrence during the non-winter season in Canmore positively correlated with greenness.
   5. For each species, seasonal RSFs were used to develop a cost surface for LCP analyses to identify potential corridor locations in each study area. Overlaying the paths for the two species highlighted where the landscape could support corridors for both species and potential highway crossing zones. The telemetry data supported some of these modelled crossings.
   6. Synthesis and applications. We show how to integrate RSFs and least-cost modelling to identify corridors for conservation. We focus on two large carnivores in the Canadian Rocky Mountains to identify potential corridors in Canmore and provide a framework for corridor planning in Crowsnest. We suggest that our approach is applicable to many other target species in addition to large carnivores in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Simple Summary In the modern era of the anthropocene, an increase in the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has resulted in the global rise of the Earth's temperature. This has resulted in the habitat shift of various plant and animal species. Plant species that are endemic show a narrow distribution range and inhabit higher elevations are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming. The present study discusses the habitat distribution of Valeriana wallichi, an endangered medicinal herb. We also predicted the impact of climate change on its distribution range and niche dynamics. Results reveal significant contraction in the possible habitats of this herb under future climatic scenarios, with RCP 8.5 for 2070 showing the highest habitat loss. Niche equivalency and similarity tests describe that the habitats could be compared but not identical between current and future climatic scenarios. From the current study, we conclude that the habitats of Valeriana wallichii are highly vulnerable to climate shifts. This study can not only be used to alleviate the threat to this plant by documenting the unexplored populations, restoring the degraded habitats through rewilding and launching species recovery plans in the natural habitats but could also be used by various conservation biologists to recover the declining status of various highly valued species across the globe. An increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases necessitates the use of species distribution models (SDMs) in modeling suitable habitats and projecting the impact of climate change on the future range shifts of the species. The present study is based on the BIOMOD ensemble approach to map the currently suitable habitats and predict the impact of climate change on the niche shift of Valeriana wallichii. We also studied its niche dynamics using the ecospat package in R software. Values of the area under curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS) were highly significant (>0.9), which shows that the model has run better. From 19 different bioclimatic variables, only 8 were retained after correlation, among which bio_17 (precipitation of driest quarter), bio_1 (annual mean temperature), and bio_12 (annual mean precipitation) received the highest gain. Under future climate change, the suitable habitats will be significantly contracted by -94% (under representative concentration pathway RCP 8.5 for 2070) and -80.22% (under RCP 8.5 for 2050). There is a slight increase in habitat suitability by +16.69% (RCP 4.5 for 2050) and +8.9% (RCP 8.5 for 2050) under future climate change scenarios. The equivalency and similarity tests of niche dynamics show that the habitat suitability for current and future climatic scenarios is comparable but not identical. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis shows that climatic conditions will be severely affected between current and future scenarios. From this study, we conclude that the habitats of Valeriana wallichii are highly vulnerable to climate shifts. This study can be used to alleviate the threat to this plant by documenting the unexplored populations, restoring the degraded habitats through rewilding, and launching species recovery plans in the natural habitats.

AB  - The franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) is a coastal dolphin endemic to the south-western Atlantic Ocean. Incidental captures in fishing gillnets are the greatest conservation concern for this species. The present study examines the biophysical interactions between the franciscana prey composition and the marine environment. The feeding regime of franciscana was investigated from stomach contents of incidentally caught animals along the southern Brazilian coast. The characteristics of the franciscana habitat may reveal potential factors affecting the distribution and abundance of marine species, thus the franciscana prey (species number and size) was treated as a function of the oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a), and the spatial (latitude and water depth), and temporal (season) parameters, through Linear and Generalized Linear Models (LM and GLM). Season and latitude were important predictors of the franciscana diet, followed by water temperature and depth. Chla parameter only influenced one fish species and therefore was not useful as an explanatory variable for our study. The influence of the predictors and prey distribution of the franciscana diet are similar to that found in the habitat by research cruise data. Some structures analysed (e.g. squid beaks) may remain longer in the stomachs. Therefore, the findings not only suggest a fairly opportunistic behaviour but it is likely that franciscana may occupy, and possibly for long periods, small spatial ranges. This behaviour might be a strategy for minimizing energetic costs by restricting movements to short distance areas, which can be an important factor for conservation planning along the southern Brazilian coast.

AB  - Global climate change and disturbances from human activities lead to habitat loss and changes in habitat quality, resulting in a reduction in biodiversity. The continental coastline of China distributes some cities with highly developed economies and coastal wetlands with rich biodiversity, and both economic development and biodiversity conservation are important topics. In order to clarify the spatial distribution of bird biodiversity in coastal areas, based on the MaxEnt model and GIS spatial analysis, the distribution data of 488 species of birds and 15 environmental variables were used to simulate the suitable distribution areas of birds, and to analyze the spatial distribution and hotspots of bird biodiversity in coastal areas. The main findings of this study are as follows. (1) A total of 488 species in 249 genera of 21 orders and 81 families of birds were involved in the modeling of coastal areas. The main environmental factors affecting the potential distribution of birds in general are: land use, monthly mean diurnal temperature range, and precipitation of the driest month. (2) High value areas of bird richness are distributed in different locations in the four sea areas: In the Bohai Rim region, they are mainly distributed in the Liaohe Estuary Wetland in Liaoning Province, the vicinity of the Yongdingxin River and Haihe River in Tianjin, the eastern part of Tianjin, and the Yellow River and Yellow River Delta Wetland in Shandong Province; In the coastal area of the Yellow Sea, they are primarily found in Kunyu Mountain National Nature Reserve, Laoshan Provincial Nature Reserve in Shandong Province, and Yancheng Wetland Rare Birds National Nature Reserve in Jiangsu Province; In the coastal areas of the East China Sea, they are mainly found at the mouth of the Yangtze River, at the national nature reserve of Dongtan birds on Chongming Island, along the southeastern coast of Zhejiang Province, near the Min River and along the coast of Quanzhou in Fujian Province; In the coastal areas of the South China Sea, they are mainly distributed in the Pearl River Delta wetlands of Guangdong Province, the southeastern coastal areas of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the Shiwanda Mountain National Nature Reserve in Guangxi Province. (3) The spatial trends in the distribution of hotspots of birds of national priority protection in coastal areas are generally consistent, but more concentrated than the distribution of all birds. (4) After the high-value areas of bird richness were superimposed with protected areas, it was found that the intersecting area accounted for a small proportion of the protected area, and many areas near the inland had low bird richness. Finally, the findings provide references for bird biodiversity conservation and planning in coastal areas.

AB  - Knowledge of where a threatened species occurs in a landscape is crucial for determining its habitat requirements and informing its conservation planning and management. We conducted the first broad-scale survey of the Endangered Alligator Rivers Yellow Chat Epthianura crocea tunneyi across much of its known range on drying coastal floodplains in northern Australia. Presence-absence records from 257 sites surveyed in the late dry season (August-December) of 2018 and 2019 were modelled using occupancy/detectability models. Occupancy was estimated to be 0.10 +/- 0.04 with a high detection probability (0.89 +/- 0.07). Modelling of 13 site-level environmental covariates found that chats were more likely to be detected at sites where the native shrub Sesbania sesban was present, were close to hydrogeological features such as depressions or channels, were long unburnt (5+ years) and/or with topsoil damage caused by feral pigs. Our estimates of chat occupancy, detectability, and the covariates that influence their occupancy, have improved our understanding of the role that fire and feral animals have on chat distribution and habitat selection, and can be used as a baseline for future monitoring. We also provide recommendations on how to design and implement future monitoring of this subspecies.

AB  - Knowledge of habitat suitability (HS) is required for effective conservation planning, yet it can be difficult to obtain. In the absence of local HS information, managers often use studies from other areas to guide their decisions, typically without local validation. We tested the hypothesis that HS is consistent across a species range, and thus reliably extrapolated to understudied sites. We focused on the puma, Puma concolor, a widely distributed large carnivore of conservation and management importance. We conducted a meta-analysis of 41 studies to calculate a mean effect size for six of the most common predictor variables used in mammal HS research. Using the estimated effect sizes in a regression model which included all six variables, we created a new HS model for pumas in an understudied site, the Tumbesian Region (TR). We contrasted predictions from this range-wide model with those from three more regionally specific HS models: a model developed in the Caatinga, Brazil (Caatinga model), a model considering only tropical studies (tropical model), and a model using only studies from the United States and Canada (temperate model). We used puma detection rates from camera trap surveys across the TR to validate model predictions. Although mean effect sizes of habitat predictor variables varied across puma range, all models provided useful predictions of HS for pumas in the TR (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] > 0.64). Unexpectedly, the temperate model was best at predicting puma HS in the TR (AUC: 0.77; r(s) = 0.3), followed by the range-wide model (AUC = 0.73; r(s) = 0.29). The tropical and Caatinga models had lower predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.68; r(s) = 0.28 and AUC = 0.64; r(s) = 0.23, respectively). The accuracy of the tropical model improved when the area of potential recent puma extirpation was excluded from the validation data set. These results highlight that although HS for P. concolor varies across the species range, information collected across a wide range of sites may be better than only locally or regionally specific information for informing HS in understudied sites (e.g., for habitat protection, restoration areas). Given the pressing need for actions to address widespread biodiversity declines, existing knowledge can be used to predict HS to data-poor regions and inform conservation planning while also motivating model validations and targeted data collection.

AB  - The prediction of the climate change effect on plant distribution has become a primary research field for conservation practices and planning. The present research predicted future distributions of warm-adapted evergreen trees, Neolitsea sericea (Blume) Koidz. and Camellia japonica L., under climate change in the Korean Peninsula (KP) using an ensemble approach and quantified the predictive uncertainty. For these purposes, we used nine modeling algorithms and the pre-evaluation weighted ensemble method in modelling the current distributions of those evergreen trees; furthermore, we predicted their future distributions under 20 climate change scenarios and averaged the future predictions for ensemble forecasts. The results suggest that both species would expand to the northern part of KP under climate changes; however, the spatial pattern and rate of expansions would be different. C. japonica showed a faster expansion than N. sericea. While C. japonica showed both inland and northward expansions under climate change, N. sericea was mostly distributed in coastal areas. In addition, the highly suitable habitats of N. sericea and C. japonica will decline or shift to the north under climate change. This may indicate that climate change will degrade habitat suitability of those species within the distribution boundary and may restrict their continuous range expansions under further climate changes. Considering the lack of research on the climate-related range shifts of plants in Asia including KP, the present study provides fundamental and practical knowledge for a better understanding of climate-related vegetation changes in Asia as well as in KP.

AB  - Species occur in sympatric assemblages, bound together by ecological relationships and interspecific interactions. Borneo and Sumatra host some of the richest assemblages of biota worldwide. The region, however, faces the highest global deforestation rates, which seriously threaten its unique biodiversity. We used a large camera trap dataset that recorded data for 70 terrestrial species of mammals and birds, to explore the drivers of regional species richness patterns. Using a multi-scale, multivariate modelling framework which quantified the main environmental factors associated with patterns of biodiversity, while simultaneously assessing individual relationships of each species, we determined the ecological drivers of sampled biodiversity, and their contributions to community assemblages. We then mapped predicted species richness, evaluated the effectiveness of protected areas in securing biodiversity hotspots, performed gap analysis to highlight biodiverse areas lacking protection and compared our predictions with species richness maps produced by using IUCN range layers. Finally, we investigated the performance of each species as an indicator of sampled biodiversity. We demonstrate that biodiversity in Borneo and Sumatra is primarily affected by gradients of ecological and anthropogenic factors, and only marginally by topographic and spatial factors. In both islands, species are primarily associated with elevational gradients in vegetation and climate, leading to altitudinal zonation in niche separation as a major factor characterizing the islands' biodiversity. Species richness was highest in north-eastern Borneo and in western Sumatra. We found that most predicted biodiversity hotspots are not formally protected in either island; only 9.2 and 18.2% of the modelled species richness occurred within protected areas in Borneo and Sumatra, respectively. We highlighted that our prediction for Borneo performed better than, and differed drastically from, the IUCN species richness layer, while for Sumatra our modelled species richness layer and the IUCN one were similar, and both showed low predictive power. Our analysis suggests that common and generalist carnivores are the most effective indicators of sampled biodiversity and have high potential as focal, umbrella or indicator species to assist multi-species vertebrate conservation planning. Understanding existing drivers and patterns of biodiversity is critical to support the development of effective community conservation strategies in this rapidly changing region.

AB  - Pathogens, pests and diseases impact heavily on commercial plantation forestry in South Africa, and must thus be considered in any diversified and adaptive management approach. Two important fungal pathogens of Pinus and Eucalyptus species, respectively, are Sphaeropsis sapinea and Cryphonectria cubensis. The aim of this study was to explore the use of bioclimatic modelling to predict the habitat distribution for these pathogens, and to consider potential distribution patterns under conditions of climate change. High-risk areas identified for Sphaeropsis dieback coincide with the summer rainfall hail belt, emphasising the need for planting resistant Pinus spp. in these regions. A much smaller area of South Africa is predicted to be suitable for the occurrence of C. cubensis than for S. sapinea, but a range shift westward in suitable habitat for C. cubensis is predicted under a climate change scenario. Of concern is that many of these areas are currently being planted with disease susceptible Eucalyptus clones. These preliminary results, and further refinement of the model, will Jay a valuable foundation for future risk assessment and strategic management planning in the South African forestry industry.

AB  - Herein, we present the first comprehensive study of anurans biogeography and conservation in an important mountain chain of the Atlantic Forest bioregion (AF), the Mantiqueira Mountain Range (MMR). We use biotic element analyses to test biogeographical units previously established through a preliminary Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity based on the distribution of anuran species found on the MMR. Furthermore, we assess the actual status of species richness, endemism, weighted endemism, and discuss conservation strategies based on habitat loss, and protected areas (PA) representativeness for the Areas of Endemism and biotic elements (BEs) recovered. We found nine biogeographical units in MMR. Biodiversity metrics identified small patches of high biodiversity throughout MMR, including five that match with the BEs. All BEs recovered present a massive rate of habitat loss and four of them are poorly safeguarded in established protected areas. Our analysis enables linking the BEs of anurans to different areas topographically delimited along the MMR, probably due to the historical process related to climate shifts of the AF. We hypothesize that vicariant speciation should have been a strong driver of diversification in Anura. However, the current MMR protected area system is not safeguarding most of the areas of biogeographical relevance detected in our analyses. The results found here could be used to provide guidance to establish or review current protected areas delimitations, which demonstrate the inefficiency of the current PA system in safeguarding biodiversity. The ad hoc manner to establish protected areas is failing to preserve anuran biodiversity and therefore the evolutionary history of MMR. Although our results are focused solely on anurans, the biogeographical units found represent the biogeographic history of MMR and should be used as an objective and effective criteria to improve the conservation strategies and planning of protective areas.

AB  - Understanding biodiversity patterns depends on data collection, which in marine environments can be prohibitively expensive. Transferable predictive models could therefore provide time- and cost-effective tools for understanding biodiversity-environment relationships. We used fish species counts and spatial and environmental predictors to develop predictive models of fish species richness (S) for two major coral reefs located in separate ocean basins: Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR; Queensland) and Ningaloo Reef (NR; Western Australia). We tested the ability of the GBR model to predict S at NR (its transferability) under various scenarios using different sampling durations, years sampled and transect sizes. Based on R-2, the GBR model poorly predicted S at NR (R-2<16%) with few predicted values strongly correlated with observations. However, comparable spatial patterns in S across NR were predicted by both the NR and the GBR models when calibrated at similar spatio-temporal scales. This result suggests that poor validation of the transferred models may indicate low deviance explained by the predictors in the new system (where other predictors not included might have a more direct effect on the response) and that in some situations, model transferability may be considerably improved by using data sets of similar spatio-temporal scales. Therefore, data filtering by time and space may be required prior to transferring models.Policy implications. Transferable models can provide initial estimates of fish species richness patterns in poorly sampled systems, and thereby guide the design of better and more efficient sampling programs. Further improvements in model transferability will increase their predictive power and utility in conservation planning and management.

AB  - The distributional ranges of many species are contracting with habitat conversion and climate change. For vertebrates, informed strategies for translocations are an essential option for decisions about their conservation management. The pygmy bluetongue lizard, Tiliqua adelaidensis, is an endangered reptile with a highly restricted distribution, known from only a small number of natural grassland fragments in South Australia. Land-use changes over the last century have converted perennial native grasslands into croplands, pastures and urban areas, causing substantial contraction of the species' range due to loss of essential habitat. Indeed, the species was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1992. We develop coupled-models that link habitat suitability with stochastic demographic processes to estimate extinction risk and to explore the efficacy of potential climate adaptation options. These coupled-models offer improvements over simple bioclimatic envelope models for estimating the impacts of climate change on persistence probability. Applying this coupled-model approach to T. adelaidensis, we show that: (i) climate-driven changes will adversely impact the expected minimum abundance of populations and could cause extinction without management intervention, (ii) adding artificial burrows might enhance local population density, however, without targeted translocations this measure has a limited effect on extinction risk, (iii) managed relocations are critical for safeguarding lizard population persistence, as a sole or joint action and (iv) where to source and where to relocate animals in a program of translocations depends on the velocity, extent and nonlinearities in rates of climate-induced habitat change. These results underscore the need to consider managed relocations as part of any multifaceted plan to compensate the effects of habitat loss or shifting environmental conditions on species with low dispersal capacity. More broadly, we provide the first step towards a more comprehensive framework for integrating extinction risk, managed relocations and climate change information into range-wide conservation management.

AB  - Grassland and shrub-steppe ecosystems are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities. Loss of native habitats may negatively impact important small mammal prey species. Little information, however, is available on the impact of habitat variability on density of small mammal prey species at broad spatial scales. We examined the relationship between small mammal density and remotely-sensed environmental covariates in shrub-steppe and grassland ecosystems in Wyoming, USA. We sampled four sciurid and leporid species groups using line transect methods, and used hierarchical distance-sampling to model density in response to variation in vegetation, climate, topographic, and anthropogenic variables, while accounting for variation in detection probability. We created spatial predictions of each species' density and distribution. Sciurid and leporid species exhibited mixed responses to vegetation, such that changes to native habitat will likely affect prey species differently. Density of white-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys leucurus), Wyoming ground squirrels (Urocitellus elegans), and leporids correlated negatively with proportion of shrub or sagebrush cover and positively with herbaceous cover or bare ground, whereas least chipmunks showed a positive correlation with shrub cover and a negative correlation with herbaceous cover. Spatial predictions from our models provide a landscape-scale metric of above-ground prey density, which will facilitate the development of conservation plans for these taxa and their predators at spatial scales relevant to management.

AB  - 1. Little is known about the biology or conservation status of Lucanus elaphus Fabricius in North America despite well-documented declines of a related species, Lucanus cervus (L.), in Europe. This study provides information critical to developing conservation plans for L. elaphus including the species' larval substrate requirements, genetic data and range-wide estimates of habitat suitability.
   2. In Mississippi floodplain forests, larval L. elaphus were recovered from a wide range of log sizes and rot types and were either found tunnelling within the wood or feeding beneath logs at the soil-wood interface. The species appears to require 1-2 years to complete development, exhibits a 1:1 sex ratio and is parasitised by Zelia vertebrata (Say) (Diptera: Tachinidae).
   3. Flight intercept traps placed at three heights at both the edge and interior of hardwood-dominated forests in Georgia yielded six adult male L. elaphus, all of which were captured in traps placed at 15 m on the forest edge.
   4. Because L. elaphus larvae are morphologically indistinguishable from related species, DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene were generated to facilitate molecular identification. Genetic data revealed modest intra-specific variation, with up to 1.3% sequence divergence among haplotypes sampled from the same forest.
   5. Based on assembled occurrence records, ecological niche models suggest that environmental conditions are suitable for L. elaphus across much of the southeastern United States, provided that adequate lowland forest cover and dead wood substrates are available.

AB  - Aim Climate change is predicted to alter the distribution and abundance of marine species, including canopy-forming seaweeds which provide important ecosystem functions and services. We asked whether continued warming will affect the distribution of six common canopy-forming species: mid-intertidal fucoids (Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus vesiculosus), low-intertidal Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), subtidal laminarian kelps (Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata) and the invasive Codium fragile. Location Northwest Atlantic. Methods We used occurrence records and the correlative presence-only species distribution model Maxent to determine present-day distribution. This distribution was compared to each species' warm-water physiological thresholds indicating areas of stable or reduced growth and mortality. Present-day models were then projected to mid-century (2040-2050) and end-century (2090-2100) using two contrasting carbon emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and 8.5) and two global climate models from CMIP5 based on changes in ocean temperatures. Results Projected range shifts were minimal under low emissions (RCP2.6), but substantial species-specific range shifts were projected under high emissions (RCP8.5), with all species except C. fragile predicted to experience a northward shift in their southern (warm) edge of <= 406 km by the year 2100. Northward expansions outweighed southern extirpations for fucoids and C. crispus leading to overall range expansions, while range contractions were projected for kelps and C. fragile. Model projections generally agreed with physiological thresholds but were more conservative suggesting that range shifts for kelps may be underpredicted. Main conclusions Our results highlight the benefits to be gained from strong climate change mitigation (RCP2.6), which would limit changes in rocky shore community distribution and composition. The business-as-usual RCP8.5 scenario projected major range shifts, seaweed community reorganization and transitions in dominant species south of Newfoundland by 2100 (similar to 47 degrees N). As canopy-forming seaweeds provide essential habitat, carbon storage, nutrient cycling and commercial value, understanding their response to continued climate warming is critical to inform coastal management and conservation planning.

AB  - In the western Serengeti of Tanzania, African elephant Loxodonta africana populations are increasing, which is rare across the species' range. Here, conservation objectives come into conflict with competing interests such as agriculture. Elephants regularly damage crops, which threatens livelihoods and undermines local support for conservation. For damage reduction efforts to be successful, limited resources must be used efficiently and strategies for mitigation and prevention should be informed by an understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of crop damage. We assessed historical records of crop damage by elephants to describe the dynamics and context of damage in the western Serengeti. We used binary data and generalized additive models to predict the probability of crop damage at the village level in relation to landscape features and metrics of human disturbance. During 2012-2014 there were 3,380 reports of crop damage by elephants submitted to authorities in 42 villages. Damage was concentrated in villages adjacent to a reserve boundary and peaked during periods of crop maturity and harvest. The village-level probability of crop damage was negatively associated with distance from a reserve, positively with length of the boundary shared with a reserve, and peaked at moderate levels of indicators of human presence. Spatially aggregated historical records can provide protected area managers and regional government agencies with important insights into the distribution of conflict across the landscape and between seasons, and can guide efforts to optimize resource allocation and future land use planning efforts.

AB  - The temperate waters of the North-Eastern Atlantic have a long history of maritime resource richness and, as a result, the European Union is endeavouring to maintain regional productivity and biodiversity. At the intersection of these aims lies potential conflict, signalling the need for integrated, cross-border management approaches. This paper focuses on the marine megafauna of the region. This guild of consumers was formerly abundant, but is now depleted and protected under various national and international legislative structures. We present a meta-analysis of available megafauna datasets using presence-only distribution models to characterise suitable habitat and identify spatially-important regions within the English Channel and southern bight of the North Sea. The integration of studies from dedicated and opportunistic observer programmes in the United Kingdom and France provide a valuable perspective on the spatial and seasonal distribution of various taxonomic groups, including large pelagic fishes and sharks, marine mammals, seabirds and marine turtles. The Western English Channel emerged as a hotspot of biodiversity for megafauna, while species richness was low in the Eastern English Channel. Spatial conservation planning is complicated by the highly mobile nature of marine megafauna, however they are important components of the marine environment and understanding their distribution is a first crucial step toward their inclusion into marine ecosystem management.

AB  - Understanding landscape impacts on gene flow is necessary to plan comprehensive management and conservation strategies of both the species of interest and its habitat. Nevertheless, only a few studies have focused on the landscape genetic connectivity of the European wildcat, an umbrella species whose conservation allows the preservation of numerous other species and habitat types. We applied population and landscape genetics approaches, using genotypes at 30 microsatellites from 232 genetically-identified wildcats to determine if, and how, landscape impacted gene flow throughout France. Analyses were performed independently within two population patches: the historical north-eastern patch and the central patch considered as the colonization front. Our results showed that gene flow occurred at large spatial scales but also revealed significant spatial genetic structures within population patches. In both population patches, arable areas, pastures and permanent grasslands and lowly fragmented forested areas were permeable to gene flow, suggesting that shelters and dietary resources are among the most important parameters for French wildcat landscape connectivity, while distance to forest had no detectable effect. Anthropized areas appeared highly resistant in the north-eastern patch but highly permeable in the central patch, suggesting that different behaviours can be observed according to the demographic context in which populations are found. In line with this hypothesis, spatial distribution of genetic variability seemed uneven in the north-eastern patch and more clinal in the central patch. Overall, our results highlighted that European wildcat might be a habitat generalist species and also the importance of performing spatial replication in landscape genetics studies.

AB  - Significant changes in the climates of Central America are expected over the next century. Lowland rainforests harbor high alpha diversity on local scales (<1 km(2)), yet montane landscapes often support higher beta diversity on 10-100 km(2) scales. Climate change will likely disrupt the altitudinal zonation of montane communities that produces such landscape diversity. Projections of biotic response to climate change have often used broad-scale modelling of geographical ranges, but understanding likely impacts on population viability is also necessary for anticipating local and global extinctions. We model species' abundances and estimate range shifts for birds in the Tilaran Mountains of Costa Rica, asking whether projected changes in temperature and rainfall could be sufficient to imperil high-elevation endemics and whether these variables will likely impact communities similarly. We find that nearly half of 77 forest bird species can be expected to decline in the next century. Almost half of species projected to decline are endemic to Central America, and seven of eight species projected to become locally extinct are endemic to the highlands of Costa Rica and Panama. Logistic-regression modelling of distributions and similarity in projections produced by temperature and rainfall models suggest that changes in both variables will be important. Although these projections are probably conservative because they do not explicitly incorporate biological or climate variable interactions, they provide a starting point for incorporating more realistic biological complexity into community-change models. Prudent conservation planning for tropical mountains should focus on regions with room for altitudinal reorganization of communities comprised of ecological specialists. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Question Given the current state of knowledge on plant species richness in Catalonia, how can we improve definition of sampled species richness patterns? We propose a concrete methodology that will highlight the most speciose areas and those areas that are insufficiently sampled. Location Catalonia, covering 31 980 km2 in northeast Spain. Methods This study provides a quantitative assessment of plant richness using sampling units of 10 km x 10 km (n = 319). Generalized linear models (GLM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and a maximum entropy model (Maxent) were used for all plant species contained in the Catalonia Database of Biodiversity (Banc de Dades de Biodiversitat de Catalunya, BDBC). The projected presence/absence maps were combined to create species richness maps based on distribution models for 2738 species. Results The modelling techniques were highly correlated, and we did not distinguish any differences in projections of geographic patterns of species richness among the modelling algorithms. However, MARS and Maxent achieved the best prediction success, whereas GLM tended to over-predict species number per quadrat. The MARS map gave the highest predictive performance based on both Kappa and the true skill statistic, and for the two components of disagreement (quantity and allocation disagreement). We were able to identify one previously known region of high diversity, the Pyrenees, and two additional areas, the coastal range and the pre-coastal mountain range. Conclusions We obtain improved distribution patterns for plant species in Catalonia over the previously sampled patterns, and, most importantly, we provide an estimate of the number of species present in those areas where sampling data are incomplete, with an expected 300 species. The model-predicted richness maps presented here can be used to detect zones with low and high species richness and to develop strategies for either restoring or protecting landscape biodiversity as part of national conservation plans.

AB  - Climate is one of the most important elements affecting the distribution of species, and it is expected that the distribution of species will be widely influenced by climate change. In plants, edaphic factors also play a special role along with climate in determining the distribution range. The current study aimed to predict the future distribution of the Persian manna (Astragalus adscendens), an endemic perennial shrub in Zagros Mountains of Western Iran. For this purpose, two sets of static (i.e. edaphic and physiographic) and dynamic (i.e. climatic) data and an ensemble approach were used to develop two edaphic-physiographic and climatic models. Current and future suitability maps are representative of the climatic and the edaphic-physiographic niches of A. Adscendens that were obtained based on climatic suitable areas filtered by edaphic-physiographic model. The filtered map has less suitable habitats compared to the climatic model. Three dynamic variables (mean temperature of wettest quarter, temperature seasonality, temperature annual range) and two static variables (altitude and volumetric fraction of coarse fragments) were identified as the most important factors in determining the habitat of A. Adscendens. The importance of altitude was greater than latitude in maintaining or losing suitable habitats under different climate change scenarios, suggesting that the species will not have range expansion or northward shift due to no significant shift in latitude and longitude. Results revealed a sharp decline in the suitable habitats in such that 67% and 91% of the current habitat may be lost by the year 2050 and 2070, respectively. Area reduction was more extreme in future scenarios with the higher level of CO2 emission. Range contraction of A. Adscendens will increases the risk of extinction. This study provides insights into the response of mountain plants, especially range restricted species, to climate change, revealing major dimensions of plant niche. Therefore, developing habitat management and conservation plans to preserve the predicted habitats of such species are required to preserve the predicted sustainable habitats.

AB  - All four chimpanzee sub-species populations are declining due to multiple factors including human-caused habitat loss. Effective conservation efforts are therefore needed to ensure their long-term survival. Habitat suitability models serve as useful tools for conservation planning by depicting relative environmental suitability in geographic space over time. Previous studies mapping chimpanzee habitat suitability have been limited to small regions or coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we used Random Forests regression to downscale a coarse resolution habitat suitability calibration dataset to estimate habitat suitability over the entire chimpanzee range at 30-m resolution. Our model predicted habitat suitability well with an r(2) of 0.82 (+/-0.002) based on 50-fold cross validation where 75% of the data was used for model calibration and 25% for model testing; however, there was considerable variation in the predictive capability among the four sub-species modeled individually. We tested the influence of several variables derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) that included metrics of forest canopy and structure for four three-year time periods between 2000 and 2012. Elevation, Landsat ETM+ band 5 and Landsat derived canopy cover were the strongest predictors; highly suitable areas were associated with dense tree canopy cover for all but the Nigeria-Cameroon and Central Chimpanzee sub-species. Because the models were sensitive to such temporally based predictors, our results are the first to highlight the value of integrating continuously updated variables derived from satellite remote sensing into temporally dynamic habitat suitability models to support near real-time monitoring of habitat status and decision support systems.

AB  - Habitat loss and hunting threaten bonobos (Pan paniscus), Endangered (IUCN) great apes endemic to lowland rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Conservation planning requires a current, data-driven, rangewide map of probable bonobo distribution and an understanding of key attributes of areas used by bonobos. We present a rangewide suitability model for bonobos based on a maximum entropy algorithm in which data associated with locations of bonobo nests helped predict suitable conditions across the species' entire range. We systematically evaluated available biotic and abiotic factors, including a bonobo-specific forest fragmentation layer (forest edge density), and produced a final model revealing the importance of simple threat-based factors in a data poor environment. We confronted the issue of survey bias in presence-only models and devised a novel evaluation approach applicable to other taxa by comparing models built with data from geographically distinct sub-regions that had higher survey effort. The model's classification accuracy was high (AUC = 0.82). Distance from agriculture and forest edge density best predicted bonobo occurrence with bonobo nests more likely to occur farther from agriculture and in areas of lower edge density. These results suggest that bonobos either avoid areas of higher human activity, fragmented forests, or both, and that humans reduce the effective habitat of bonobos. The model results contribute to an increased understanding of threats to bonobo populations, as well as help identify priority areas for future surveys and determine core bonobo protection areas.

AB  - Aim We addressed four objectives: (1) Determine the regional responses of species, size classes and a vegetation type to climate and parent material predictors, including their distributions in environmental space and the relative contributions of the predictors to explained variation. (2) Determine whether size classes of a species respond similarly to climate and parent material. (3) Assess the extent to which the predicted regional distribution of a vegetation type can be approximated by the distribution of its diagnostic species and vice versa. The establishment of a consistent relationship between the distribution of a vegetation type and its diagnostic species would facilitate change detection, management and conservation planning by allowing the use of one distribution to generate the other when data availability is limited. (4) Examine landscape-scale environmental variability in predicted species and vegetation type distributions.

Ex Hildebr. size classes, (2) P. ponderosa, A. concolor and Quercus gambelii Nutt. combined size classes, and (3) a P. ponderosa forest type widely distributed in the south-western USA.
   Results and main conclusions Pinus ponderosa and A. concolor models generally were judged to be successful. Quercus gambelii models were judged unsuccessful, which may result from the influence of variables not modelled, such as soil moisture, disturbance, biotic factors and other site limiting factors. Size classes differed in the range of environmental conditions associated with high occurrence probabilities within and between species, reflecting differences in the effects of climate variability and anthropogenic changes, such as fire suppression, on the distribution of each size class. Pinus ponderosa alliance was predicted to be distributed over a narrower range of environmental conditions than P. ponderosa species models, therefore limiting the use of this vegetation type as a surrogate for the distribution of the dominant species, and vice versa. Maps of combinations of environmental variables that produced a high probability of P. ponderosa occurrence showed that some landscapes predicted to contain the species exhibited diverse environmental conditions over short distances. The use of regional environmental relationships to characterize areas with high local environmental variability may facilitate identification of areas of potential rapid biotic change.

AB  - Most of the sand dunes close to the Mediterranean coast of Egypt have been destroyed due to human pressures. The remaining dunes are under extreme threat due to unplanned development. This study aims to explore the floristic patterns and detect which drivers threaten their conservation status. Eighty-five random plots of 100 m(2) each along 12 transects perpendicular to the seashore in the northwestern coastal dunes were sampled. Classification of plots using plant cover percentage was carried out through agglomerative hierarchical clustering and principal coordinate analysis. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and variance partitioning (VP) were used to define the drivers that influence the floristic patterns. Therophytes and chamaephytes represent 30% of each of the 113 vascular plant species recorded in the present study. Four clusters of plant species corresponding to four dune-types were identified: Ammophila arenaria - Ononis vaginalis in foredunes, Echinops spinosissimus- Launaea fragilis in embryonic dunes, Echinops spinosissimus- Allium erdelii in transitional and Echinops spinosissimus- Thymelaea hirsuta in stabilized dunes. Stabilized dunes showed the highest diversity (species richness H-dune = 1.37, evenness E-dune = 0.88) and rarity indices (R = 0.52) as well as a steeper rarefaction curve. CCA disclosed that organic matter and CaCO3 content, distance from the coastline, overcutting, trampling, and urbanization were correlated with the floristic patterns. VP showed that the examined variables justified for 53% of the variance in the floristic composition. Our results can be considered by managers to fulfill an appropriate conservation plan to preserve and manage the coastal dunes in arid regions.

AB  - An ecologically representative, well-connected, and effectively managed system of marine protected areas (MPAs) has positive ecological and environmental effects as well as social and economic benefits. Although progress in expanding the coverage of MPAs has been made, the application of management tools has not yet been implemented in most of these areas. In this work, distribution models were applied to nine benthic habitats on a Mediterranean seamount within an MPA for conservation purposes. Benthic habitat occurrences were identified from 55 remotely operated vehicle (ROV) transects, at depths from 76 to 700 m, and data derived from multibeam bathymetry. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were applied to link the presence of each benthic habitat to local environmental proxies (depth, slope, backscatter, aspect, and bathymetric position index, BPI). The main environmental drivers of habitat distribution were depth, slope, and BPI. Based on this result, five different geomorphological areas were distinguished. A full coverage map indicating the potential benthic habitat distribution on the seamount was obtained to inform spatial management. The distribution of those habitats identified as vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) was used to make recommendations on zonation for developing the management plan of the MPA. This process reveals itself as an appropriate methodological approach that can be developed in other areas of the Natura 2000 marine network.

AB  - Human-carnivore conflict is hampering carnivore conservation worldwide. Conflicts between humans and wolves (Canis lupus) in western Iran, especially Hamedan province (HP), occur in the form of livestock depredation and predatory attacks on people. These conflicts have become a major concern for the lives and livelihoods of the local people as well as an obstacle for conservation of the wolf. To determine the most important predictors of such conflicts and to identify the distribution of areas with potential risk of wolf attack on humans and livestock in HP, we employed Maximum Entropy (Maxent) algorithm to build predictive models with reported conflict data from 2001 to 2010. The resulting models correctly assigned subsequent attack sites from 2011 and 2012 to high-risk areas. We found that variables related to land use/cover types affected by anthropogenic influences on the landscape, such as irrigated farms and human settlements, were the most important in predicting wolf attack risk levels. The risk maps developed in this study are useful tools for identifying conflict hotspots and facilitate policymaking and action planning for conflict mitigation in western Iran.

AB  - Analysis of potential areas for crop establishment is necessary for sustainable agricultural planning, conservation of natural ecosystems, and achievement of food security's current global objective. This study aims to model the current potential distribution of the optimal areas for Hass avocado crop in Mexico, along with the likely impact of climate change on the crops and the surrounding mountain ecosystems in the state of Michoacan, the principal producer. The maximum entropy approach was used to model the current and future potential distribution of the avocado using points of presence of avocado cultivation in Mexico and climatic variables under 10 global climate models (GCMs) and three representative concentration pathways (RCPs) from the IPCC. We estimated a current potential area for the establishment of Hass avocado crops in Mexico of 54 597 km(2), associated with the temperate forests of the Transversal Volcanic Belt and the Sierra Madre del Sur. The loss of area for the establishment of avocado crops in Mexico was 31.1% under the most optimistic scenario, RCP 2.6, whereas 43.0% would be lost under the most pessimistic scenario, RCP 8.5. Currently, the potential distribution for the establishment of Hass avocado crops in the state of Michoacan is 22 561 km(2). Given optimistic scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 of climate change by 2050, temperate forests mountain would represent 59 and 72.3%, respectively, of the potential area for establishing avocado in the state. Commercial pressure and climate change can lead to forest mountain ecosystem deforestation to establish new avocado crops and exacerbate water resource scarcity problems, jeopardising the entire production system's sustainability. Territorial planning should prioritise conservation policies to avoid land-use change and establish strategies to maintain avocado crop sustainability in the long-term under climate change scenarios.

AB  - Aim: This research assessed the distribution of leopard to predict the habitat suitability in Taman Negara National Park and adjacent forest area.
   Methodology: Environmental factors for habitat suitability were derived from geographical information system (GIS) data such as elevation, slope, landuse, distance from urban and distance from river. Leopard presence data from 1993 to 2008 were integrated with the environmental parameters using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to assess habitat suitability across the study area.
   Results: The results showed that distance from river contributed the most (39.3%) in the habitat suitability modeling followed by distance from urban (31.4%), elevation (12.3%), land use types (10.1%), and slope (6.9%). Distance from river and urban showed highest contribution that influenced leopard distribution in which most suitable habitat occurred in proximity with river and further from urban. Habitat suitability of leopard were distributed among 48% over 2,218,389 ha of the study area.
   Interpretation: The findings of this study provides knowledge on how the species move and exploit different habitat niches for more effective conservation management. It provide models for future wildlife conservation and urban planning.

AB  - Restoration of depleted populations is an important method in biological conservation. Reintroduction strategies frequently aim to restore stable, increasing, self-sustaining populations. Knowledge of asymptotic system dynamics may provide advantage in selecting reintroduction strategies. We introduce interactive software that is designed to identify strategies for release of females that are immediately aligned with stable population dynamics from species represented by 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-stage life history strategies. The software allows managers to input a matrix of interest, the desired number of breeding females, and the desired management timeline, and calls upon stable population theory to give release strategies that are in concert with both stable population status and the management goals. We demonstrate how the software can aid in assessing various strategies ahead of a hypothetical restoration. For the purpose of demonstration of the tool only, we use published vital rates of an ungulate species, but remark that the selection of species for demonstration is not central to the use of this tool. Adaption of this tool to real-life restorations of any 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-stage iteroparous species may aid in understanding how to minimize undesirable recovery complications that may naturally arise from transient population dynamics. The software is freely available at: https//cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/tools/stapopd.

AB  - The introduction of alien species is one of the main threat to native biodiversity worldwide. The spreading of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus and Paysandisia archon across the Mediterranean basin caused enormous damages to cultivated palms, representing a paradigmatic case of uncontrolled diffusion of invasive alien pests. The infestation of natural populations of Chamaerops humilis, which has a particular conservation relevance being the only native palm species in Western Europe, by the two pests can be a serious threat. Nevertheless, no clear evaluation of this risk is available. I provided a first estimation of the potential geographic extent of this threat, comparing the specific climatic niches of the three species and identifying high-conflict areas and potential refuges for C. humilis through a spatial explicit approach based on niche modeling. I evidenced that the climatic niche of the palm is similar to those of the two pests. This produces frequent co-occurrence of host and pests causing potential high levels of pressure on palm populations. More specifically, R. ferrugineus represents a very widespread threat to palms, with conflict areas in most of the coasts and islands included in the C. humilis distribution. On the contrary, P. archon represents a threat only in the northeastern part of the palm range, and large potential refuges occur in southwestern Iberia, North Africa, and several islands. However, the threat by P. archon can be locally stronger than by R. ferrugineus. Programs of assessment, monitoring, and containment in host-pest conflict areas and measures of protection, prevention, and monitoring in refuge areas could mitigate the threat to C. humilis, avoiding the impact that the same pests have on cultivated palms across Europe.

AB  - The Qinling mountainous region is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots and provides refuges for many endangered endemic animals. The golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) are considered as a flagship species in this area. Here, we depicted the genetic structure and evolutionary history via microsatellite markers and combination with the ecological niche models (ENMs) to elucidate the intraspecific divergent and the impacts of the population demography on our focal species. Our results revealed three distinct subpopulations of R. roxellana and also uncovered asymmetric historical and symmetric contemporary gene flow that existed. Our evolutionary dynamics analyses based on diyabc suggested that the intraspecific divergence accompanied with effective population sizes changes. The ENM result implied that the distribution range of this species experienced expansion during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Our results highlighted that geological factors could contribute to the high genetic differentiation within the R. roxellana in the Qinling Mountains. We also provided a new insight into conservation management plans with endangered species in this region.

AB  - The status of the endemic and endangered lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus) has not been properly assessed in several regions of the Western Ghats of southern India. We conducted a study in Parambikulam Forest Reserve in the state of Kerala to determine the distribution, demography, and status of lion-tailed macaques. We laid 5km(2) grid cells on the map of the study area (644km(2)) and made four replicated walks in each grid cell using GPS. We gathered data on lion-tailed macaque group locations, demography, and site covariates including trail length, duration of walk, proportion of evergreen forest, height of tallest trees, and human disturbance index. We also performed occupancy modeling using PRESENCE ver. 3.0. We estimated a minimum of 17 groups of macaques in these hills. Low detection and occupancy probabilities indicated a low density of lion-tailed macaques in the study area. Height of the tallest trees correlated positively whereas human disturbance and proportion of evergreen forest correlated negatively with occupancy in grid cells. We also used data from earlier studies carried out in the surrounding Anamalai Tiger Reserve and Nelliyampathy Hills to discuss the conservation status in the large Anamalai Hills Landscape. This landscape harbors an estimated population of 1108 individuals of lion-tailed macaques, which is about one third of the entire estimated wild population of this species. A conservation plan for this landscape could be used as a model for conservation in other regions of the Western Ghats.

AB  - We present a method for developing a knowledge base to give wildlife managers timely access to pertinent information. This knowledge-based approach to species management in Namibia focuses on anthologies and management strategies for high-value mammal species. To manage wildlife resources sustainably access to an appropriate knowledge base is essential. The strategic species management approach promotes planning on local, national, and international levels. A hypermedia Information System for Rare Species Management (IRAs) and a decision support system (Wildlife Introduction Advisor) are described. Unlike print media, which become dated, hypermedia is easily updated. The non-sequential nature of hypermedia allows information extraction according to the readers needs. Due to this flexibility hypermedia supports adaptive management and information sharing. Usability evaluation of the IRAs system disproved our assumption that established wildlife conservation categories such as habitat, distribution, and numbers are appropriate and sufficient to structure species information. This result led to a restructuring of the information according to management objectives. Evaluation of the Wildlife Introduction Advisor indicates that the model performs reliably and is robust towards input error. Human experts seem to be susceptible to bias. The economic benefits associated with wildlife translocations demand accountability through a well-defined, transparent distribution process. In Namibia this demand is achieved through the use of a knowledge-based decision support tool.

AB  - Electrocution from power infrastructure threatens many primate species, yet knowledge of effective evidence-based mitigation strategies is limited. Mitigation planning requires an understanding of the spatial distribution of electrocutions to prioritize high-risk areas. In Diani, a coastal Kenyan town, electrocution is an important cause of death for five primate species. In this study we aim to describe the spatial patterns of electrocutions and electric shock incidents (collectively referred to as electrocutions hereafter) and identify electrocution hotspots to guide an effective primate conservation approach in Diani. Colobus Conservation, a not-for-profit organization, has recorded electrocutions and annual primate census data since 1998. We georeferenced 329 electrocution data points and analyzed them using QGIS. We identified and compared hotspots across species, seasons, and time using kernel density estimation and Getis-Ord-Gi*. We employed spatial regression models to test whether primate population density and power line density predicted the location of electrocution hotspots. Electrocutions occurred in hotspots that showed little variation in location between species and seasons. The limited variation in hotspot location over time likely occurred as a result of new building development in Diani and variability in primate detection rates by community members. Primate density and power line density were significant predictors of electrocution density for Angolan black-and-white colobus (Colobus angolensis palliatus) and Sykes monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis albogularis), but the relationship was weak, suggesting the presence of additional risk factors. This study provides a framework for systematic spatial prioritization of power lines that can be used to reduce primate electrocutions in Diani, and can be adopted in other areas of the world where primates are at risk from electrocution.

AB  - 1. In the absence of knowledge of the large-scale structure and distribution of marine biota, bioregionalisations, that is, spatial classifications of data on a range of environmental and/or biological attributes, are often viewed as one of the most appropriate frameworks within which to develop networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). However, despite their potential usefulness, few studies have assessed whether bioregionalisations can be used for management of species other than those it was derived from or whether bioregionalisations capture fully fine-scale community-level biodiversity patterns. 2. We investigated the large-scale structure and distribution of demersal fishes and macroinvertebrates in south-eastern Australia, using rank abundance distributions (RADs). We used a recently developed community modelling method that allows their multivariate distribution to vary according to environmental gradients, assessing the congruency of mapped biogeographic patterns between the different taxa, and in the light of the Interim Marine and Coastal Regionalisation for Australia (IMCRA). 3. A clear pattern in our analysis based on RADs showed a large difference in assemblage structure (i.e. in abundance, richness and evenness) between South Australia, where assemblages were generally more species rich and even, and Victoria and Tasmania, where assemblages were generally more species poor and uneven. The strong longitudinal pattern in species richness and evenness was generally congruent for both demersal fishes and macroinvertebrates and related to regional differences in oceanography. 4. We found that the regions of highest species richness were found in the core bioregions rather than transition bioregions as defined in the IMCRA and for both taxa. Moreover, we found that not all assemblage structures were equally alike and that South Australia had the greatest range of unique assemblage structures. 5. Synthesis and applications. While bioregionalisations are typically based on data from a single taxon, our findings highlight that they can be used as a surrogate for biological patterns seen in other taxa. Bioregionalisations, however, may not capture fully fine-scale community-level biodiversity patterns, and this may compromise the ability of protected area networks to protect the full variability in assemblage types. We suggest that it may be necessary to validate existing regionalisations with additional data and analyses such as the RAD analyses conducted here.

AB  - The term river herring collectively refers to alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and blueback herring (A. aestivalis), two anadromous fishes distributed along the east coast of North America. Historically, river herring spawning migrations supported important fisheries, and their spawning runs continue to be of cultural significance to many coastal communities. Recently, substantial declines in spawning run size prompted a petition to consider river herring for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA status review process requires an evaluation of a species' response to multiple stressors, including climate change. For anadromous species that utilize a range of habitats throughout their life cycle, the response to a changing global climate is inherently complex and likely varies regionally. River herring occupy marine habitat for most of their lives, and we demonstrate that their relative abundance in the ocean has been increasing in recent years. We project potential effects of ocean warming along the US Atlantic coast on river herring in two seasons (spring and fall), and two future periods (2020-2060 and 2060-2100) by linking species distribution models to projected temperature changes from global climate models. Our analyses indicate that climate change will likely result in reductions in total suitable habitat across the study region, which will alter the marine distribution of river herring. We also project that density will likely decrease for both species in fall, but may increase in spring. Finally, we demonstrate that river herring may have increased sensitivity to climate change under a low abundance scenario. This result could be an important consideration for resource managers when planning for climate change because establishing effective conservation efforts in the near term may improve population resiliency and provide lasting benefits to river herring populations.

AB  - The fat dormouse (Glis glis L.) is a small arboreal and extreme habitat specialist mammal that is tightly linked to the deciduous mixed forests dominated by Beech (Fagus orientalis) and oaks (Quercus sp.). Despite its status in Iran as a least concern species, dormice face high risk of extinction in some parts of Europe. The unique life history and large scale distribution of the species in the Palearctic region made it as an ideal model species. This habitat specialist rodent is particularly sensitive to size and connectivity of the forest patches. The fat dormouse shows very deep molecular and morphological divergence in its eastern most parts of its global distribution, in the Hyrcanian refugium of the Northern Iran. Therefore modeling its distributional range can leads to identify biodiversity hotspots and planning conservation activities. The meteorological data, land cover types, topographical variables and geo-referenced points representing geographical locations of the fat dormouse populations (latitude/longitude) in the study area were used as the primary MaxEnt model input data. The predictive accuracy of the Fat Dormouse ecological niche model was significant (training accuracy of 93.3%). This approach successfully identified the areas of the fat dormouse presence across the study area. The result suggests that the maximum entropy modeling approach can be implemented in the next step towards the development of new tools for monitoring the habitat fragmentation and identifying biodiversity hotspots.

AB  - Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production industry in the world yet research and guidance demonstrating strategic multi-objective zoning for sector expansion is scarce. Quantifying and mitigating conflicts and impact on sensitive coastal environments through jointly-optimized objectives for aquaculture and biodiversity simultaneously has not been tested yet.
   We here develop and evaluate six alternative planning scenarios for one of the European Union's highest priority bivalve shellfish aquaculture areas, the Emilia-Romagna Region in Italy. We i) develop an aquaculture profitability surface as a function of the distance from main ports, and in parallel build a fine-scale aquaculture suitability distribution surface for important commercial species using multi-criteria analysis; ii) prioritize protected areas for biodiversity while testing how different considerations of human impacts influence priorities; iii) simultaneously plan for aquaculture and biodiversity while minimizing impacts on other maritime activities. We compare results from different scenarios according to how well they capture suitable aquaculture habitats and minimize impacts. We introduce a new evaluation method for scenario comparison in spatial optimization using a nearest-neighbor analysis for spatial pattern similarities. Lastly, we test the "value of information" provided by our investment in developing the fine-scale suitability surface to improve efficiencies.
   We find that an integrated multi-objective zoning approach, which simultaneously optimizes for biodiversity and aquaculture, supports more efficient planning than traditional sector specific growth strategies. We also discovered that the fine-scale suitability model delivered a 5% more efficient solution than the simple distance function, highlighting the role of proxy cost surfaces and diminished returns from investing in comprehensive habitat suitability analysis in regions without much variation in key parameters.
   We offer evidence of improved efficiency and practical guidance for integrated planning in Blue Growth agendas. Our analysis can be applied in any context where multiple objectives occur for aquaculture sector growth and biodiversity conservation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Invasive species have been the focus of ecologists due to their undesired impacts on the environment. The extent and rapid increase in invasive plant species is recognized as a natural cause of global-biodiversity loss and degrading ecosystem services. Biological invasions can affect ecosystems across a wide spectrum of bioclimatic conditions. Understanding the impact of climate change on species invasion is crucial for sustainable biodiversity conservation. In this study, the possibility of mapping the distribution of invasive Prosopis juliflora (Swartz) DC. was shown using present background data in Khuzestan Province, Iran. After removing the spatial bias of background data by creating weighted sampling bias grids for the occurrence dataset, we applied six modelling algorithms (generalized additive model (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), random forest (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and ensemble model) to predict invasion distribution of the species under current and future climate conditions for both optimistic (RCP 2.6) and pessimistic (RCP 8.5) scenarios for the years 2050 and 2070, respectively. Predictor variables including weighted mean of CHELSA (climatologies at high resolution for the Earth's land surface areas)-bioclimatic variables and geostatistical-based bioclimatic variables (1979-2020), physiographic variables extracted from shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) and some human factors were used in modelling process. To avoid causing a biased selection of predictors or model coefficients, we resolved the spatial autocorrelation of presence points and multi-collinearity of the predictors. As in a conventional receiver operating characteristic (ROC), the area under curve (AUC) is calculated using presence and absence observations to measure the probability and the two error components are weighted equally. All models were evaluated using partial ROC at different thresholds and other statistical indices derived from confusion matrix. Sensitivity analysis showed that mean diurnal range (Bio2) and annual precipitation (Bio12) explained more than 50% of the changes in the invasion distribution and played a pivotal role in mapping habitat suitability of P. juliflora. At all thresholds, the ensemble model showed a significant difference in comparison with single model. However, MaxEnt and RF outperformed the others models. Under climate change scenarios, it is predicted that suitable areas for this invasive species will increase in Khuzestan Province, and increasing climatically suitable areas for the species in future will facilitate its future distribution. These findings can support the conservation planning and management efforts in ecological engineering and be used in formulating preventive measures.

AB  - Unveiling the scale at which organisms respond to habitat features is crucial to understand how they are influenced by anthropogenic environmental changes. We implemented species distribution models (SDMs) based on multiple-scale landscape pattern analysis for four bat species representative of different foraging guilds: Nyctalus leisleri, Rhinolophus hipposideros, Myotis emarginatus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus.
   (a) to assess the environmental factors and the influence of scale on the habitat suitability of bats; (b) to develop an objective methodology to select the best performing variables from a large variable dataset.
   We performed the study in central Italy (Tuscany): 381 variables were derived from topographical and habitat maps using a moving windows analysis set at three spatial scales (1, 5 and 10 km) that are ecologically meaningful for bats. For each species, we ran 381 univariate models to select the variables for multivariate SDMs.
   All the variables retained in the SDMs described spatial pattern indices underlining the importance of landscape structure for species distribution. Species reacted differently in terms of both scale and landscape pattern. P. pipistrellus only responded to variables at 10 km; N. leisleri and M. emarginatus did so at two scales (5 and 10 km); whereas R. hipposideros also responded to variables at 1 km.
   Our findings make it possible to tailor SDMs according to species-specific landscape pattern requirements at appropriate scales. Our approach, which can be easily extended to other taxa and different spatial scales, represents a significant step towards more effective land management planning.

AB  - Nutria (Myocastor coypus) is a native aquatic rodent to South America, and was introduced to Europe, Asia, Africa and North America for fur farming. The South American nutria or coypu is now considered a pest in the area of introduction, because of its negative impact on biological diversity and ecological relationships. Having information on the invasion range of exotic species is crucial for understanding the ecology of invasive spread and for making good conservation and management planning to address this problem. At the beginning of the 20th century, nutria was introduced into Asia. Nutria was recorded for the first time in Iran in 1995. In the present study we proposed a multiple spatial scale approach to predict the invasion trends of the nutria in Iran, and to define up the "suitable scale" for predicting the invasion trends of this species. Our results highlighted the importance of environmental variables including vegetation density (for food and nesting) and water resource (streams, rivers, and lakes) in distribution of the nutria. Potential areas for the presence of the nutria are located near the Caspian Sea, west and central Iran which receive more precipitation than other parts of the country. Therefore, these parts of Iran may face a much greater risk of invasion risk in the future. Moreover, these results can show the possible risk of nutria invasion to the northern and western neighbors of Iran. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The reintroduction of large mammals is often considered a priority conservation action in highly industrialized countries in which many of these species have been depleted. However, species reintroduction after decades of absence may involve important risks for human activities and ecological communities, such as favoring the spread of diseases. An example of a potentially troublesome reintroduction is the wild boar, which may act as a reservoir of diseases, e. g., classical swine fever, and cause high economic losses, and has become a species of concern in several European countries for both ecological and recreational reasons. Failure to prevent the disease consequences of species restoration can negate its conservation benefits. Here we evaluated the probability of both successfully reintroducing wild boar into Denmark and limiting their contact with domestic pig farms to which they might spread disease. For this purpose, we developed a spatially explicit, individual-based population model that incorporates information on boar habitat and demography information from Central European populations. We then compared model predictions with the spatial distribution of farms to achieve a spatial assessment of the contact risk. The most restrictive model scenario predicted that nearly 6% of Denmark provides habitat conditions that would allow wild boar to reproduce. The best habitats for reintroduction were aggregated in seven different areas throughout the country in which the extinction probability was < 5%. However, the expected population expansion was very limited in most of these areas. Both the number of suitable areas and the potential for population expansion greatly increased when we relaxed our habitat assumptions about boar forest requirements; this provided a more conservative scenario for a cautious risk analysis. We additionally found that part of the risk of contact with piggeries was associated with the magnitude of the expansion, although the nonrandom spatial pattern of farm distribution also had a strong influence. The partitioning of risks into those related to population expansion and those related to farm distribution allowed us to identify trade-offs between restoring boar populations and minimizing risks in different potential areas and under different risk scenarios; as a result, we rejected some of the particularly high-risk areas for potential reintroduction of the species. Our approach illustrates how the joint quantification of anticipated reintroduction success and associated risks can guide efforts aimed at reconciling species recovery and the affected health and economic interests.

AB  - The "translocation of species into habitable locations outside of their current ranges, termed assisted migration, has been proposed as a means of saving vulnerable species from extinction as a result of climate change. We explore the use of this controversial technique using a threatened keystone species in western North America, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), as a case study. Species distribution models predict that whitebark pine will be extirpated from most of its current range as temperatures rise over the next 70 years. However, the same models indicate that a large area within northwestern British Columbia, Canada, is climatically suitable for the species under current conditions and will remain so throughout the 21st century. To test the capacity of whitebark pine to establish relative to Climatic and habitat features within its predicted climatic range, we planted seeds from seven populations in eight locations spanning from 600 km southeast to 800 km northwest of the northern boundary of the current species range. During the first three growing seasons, germination occurred in all locations. Nearly three times as many treated (induced maturation and broken dormancy) than untreated seeds germinated, and most treated seeds germinated a year earlier than the untreated seeds. Germination, survival, and growth were primarily influenced by seed mass, site climate conditions related to the duration of snow cover, and provenance temperature. Our experiment provides a preliminary test of models predicting the existence of climatically suitable whitebark pine habitat north of the current species ranges. More broadly, our techniques and results inform the development of scientific guidelines for assisting the migration of other species that are highly threatened by climate change. Applied case studies of this kind are critical for assessing the utility of species distribution models as conservation planning tools.

AB  - In Mediterranean ecosystems, rabbits are a key prey species for many predators, such as the Iberian lynx, which is threatened with extinction and has gone extinct locally in several regions of its historical distribution range. One of these regions is Serra da Malcata Nature Reserve, Portugal, which is also currently proposed as a potential site for reintroduction. We intended to investigate annual variation, potential time trends and the effects of management practices on the rabbit population in Serra da Malcata as a model for future potential reintroduction areas. The rabbit population was monitored over 12 years (from 1997 to 2009) by counting latrines along linear transects. These data were used to estimate rabbit occupancy, colonization and extinction patterns using a likelihood-based method including habitat, population and topographic covariate effects. Our results suggest that initial occupancy, when management practices were absent, was driven by the presence of Erica spp. and Cistus ladanifer shrubs and by distance to summits. Site colonization was positively influenced by the presence of edges between shrubs and pastureland and by patterns of rabbit distribution in the previous sampling season. On the other hand, local extinction was negatively influenced by edges. We conclude that the increase in rabbit occupancy and local colonization patterns was clearly associated with management actions (particularly, the creation of pasturelands), although the recovery of the species was noticeably limited by previous patterns of spatial distribution.

AB  - Scale is a vital component to consider in ecological research, and spatial resolution or grain size is one of its key facets. Species distribution models (SDMs) are prime examples of ecological research in which grain size is an important component. Despite this, SDMs rarely explicitly examine the effects of varying the grain size of the predictors for species with different niche breadths. To investigate the effect of grain size and niche breadth on SDMs, we simulated four virtual species with different grain sizes/niche breadths using three environmental predictors (elevation, aspect, and percent forest) across two real landscapes of differing heterogeneity in predictor values. We aggregated these predictors to seven different grain sizes and modeled the distribution of each of our simulated species using MaxEnt and GLM techniques at each grain size. We examined model accuracy using the AUC statistic, Pearson's correlations of predicted suitability with the true suitability, and the binary area of presence determined from suitability above the maximum true skill statistic (TSS) threshold. Habitat specialists were more accurately modeled than generalist species, and the models constructed at the grain size from which a species was derived generally performed the best. The accuracy of models in the homogenous landscape deteriorated with increasing grain size to a greater degree than models in the heterogenous landscape. Variable effects on the model varied with grain size, with elevation increasing in importance as grain size increased while aspect lost importance. The area of predicted presence was drastically affected by grain size, with larger grain sizes over predicting this value by up to a factor of 14. Our results have implications for species distribution modeling and conservation planning, and we suggest more studies include analysis of grain size as part of their protocol.

AB  - Species distribution models, linked to climate projections, are widely used in extinction-risk assessment and conservation planning. However, the degree of confidence that we can place on future climate-change projections depends on global climate-model performance and involves uncertainties that need to be assessed rigorously via climate-model evaluation. Performance assessments are important because the choice of climate model influences projections of species' range movement and extinction risk. A consensus view from the climate modeling community is that no single climate model is superior in its ability to forecast key climatic features. Despite this, the advantages of using multi-model ensemble-averaged climate forecasts to account for climate-model uncertainties have not been recognized by ecologists. Here we propose a method to use a range of skill and convergence metrics to rank commonly used atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) according to their skill in reproducing 20-year observed patterns of regional and global climates of interest, and to assess their consistency with other AOGCMs. By eliminating poorly performing models and averaging the remainder with equal weights, we show how downscaled annual multi-climate-model ensemble-averaged forecasts, which have a strong regional focus, can be generated. We demonstrate that: (1) model ranking (match of simulated to observed conditions) differs according to the skill metric used, as well as the climate variable and season considered; (2) although the multi-model averaged result tends to outperform single models at a global scale, at the continental scale at least some models can perform better than the multi-model average; and (3) forecasts for the Australian region, which are often based on a single AOGCM (CSIRO-3.0), show spatial patterns of change that differ noticeably from ensemble-average projections based on a subset of better-performing AOGCMs. Our suggested approach-novel in the ecology discipline-provides a straightforward, consistent, and defensible method for conservation practitioners and natural-resource managers to generate estimates of future climate change at a spatial resolution suitable for biodiversity impact studies.

AB  - Ecological niche models can be a useful tool to identify candidate reintroduction sites for endangered species but have been infrequently used for this purpose. In this paper, we (1) develop activity-specific ecological niche models (nesting, roosting, and feeding) for the critically endangered California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) to aid in reintroduction planning in California, Oregon, and Washington, USA, (2) test the accuracy of these models using empirical data withheld from model development, and (3) integrate model results with information on condor movement ecology and biology to produce predictive maps of reintroduction site suitability. Our approach, which disentangles niche models into activity-specific components, has applications for other species where it is routinely assumed (often incorrectly) that individuals fulfill all requirements for life within a single environmental space. Ecological niche models conformed to our understanding of California condor ecology, had good predictive performance when tested with data withheld from model development, and aided in the identification of several candidate reintroduction areas outside of the current distribution of the species. Our results suggest there are large unoccupied regions of the California condor's historical range that have retained ecological features similar to currently occupied habitats, and thus could be considered for future reintroduction efforts. Combining our activity-specific ENMs with ground reconnaissance and information on other threat factors that could not be directly incorporated into empirical ENMs will ultimately improve our ability to select successful reintroduction sites for the California condor.

AB  - Floodplains are highly complex and dynamic systems in terms of their hydrology. Thus, they comprise a wide habitat heterogeneity and therefore harbour highly specialized species. For future projections of habitat and species diversity, process-based models simulating ecohydrological conditions and resulting habitat and species distributions are needed. We present a new modelling framework that includes a physically based, surface water-groundwater model coupled with a habitat model. Using the model framework, we simulate the occurrence of 23 flood meadow plant species in a Rhine River floodplain. To benchmark the data, results are compared with a conventional approach with simple spatial hydrological information. Our results show that models with predictors obtained from the surface water-groundwater model are significantly more accurate for rare and endangered species, as well as for typical flood meadow species. A total of 15 hydrological predictors were defined, which look relevant and promising for a good prediction, but at the same time reflect very different hydrological conditions. The standard deviation of the groundwater level, wet soil conditions, and inundation belong to the most relevant predictors for an accurate prediction. Therefore, we recommend including more specific hydrological information in habitat models of species in complex floodplain ecosystems. Such spatial explicit habitat models can also open up further possibilities, such as the projection of global change impact studies or nature conservation planning.

AB  - The ongoing invasion of coral reefs in the greater Caribbean region by Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois spp.) poses challenges for managers. Although the dynamics and ecological effects of lionfish invasions have been examined in detail at the scale of individual reefs, relatively little information is available on the patterns of the invasion over larger areas. This study combined species counts and microhabitat observations from SCUBA surveys with satellite-derived bathymetry and habitat data to create predictive species distribution maps of lionfish in a 58 km(2) region along the southern edge of the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Models predicted lionfish presence, absence, and density, and were created iteratively using various resolutions and types of data to mimic the datasets that may be available to management in the region. The best-fit model for presence and absence, which combined physical variables derived from remotely sensed satellite data and diver-collected microhabitat data, predicted 89% of lionfish presence and absence. The best-fit model for lionfish density used 2 resolutions of physical habitat data as well as biological data on densities of large native groupers and accurately predicted 67% lionfish density. These results suggest that physical habitat may be more important for initial lionfish presence and that biotic interactions influence lionfish density on the reefs. Understanding the limitations and value of each type of data when creating models may be advantageous for planning targeted lionfish removals and prioritizing sites for conservation efforts.

AB  - There is recent evidence to suggest that domestic livestock deplete the density and diversity of wild herbivores in the cold deserts of the Trans-Himalaya by imposing resource limitations. To ascertain the degree and nature of threats faced by Himalayan ibex (Capra sibirica) from seven livestock species, we studied their resource use patterns over space, habitat and food dimensions in the pastures of Pin Valley National Park in the Spiti region of the Indian Himalaya. Species diet profiles were obtained by direct observations. We assessed the similarity in habitat use and diets of ibex and livestock using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling. We estimated the influence of the spatial distribution of livestock on habitat and diet choice of ibex by examining their co-occurrence patterns in cells overlaid on the pastures. The observed co-occurrence of ibex and livestock in cells was compared with null-models generated through Monte Carlo simulations. The results suggest that goats and sheep impose resource limitations on ibex and exclude them from certain pastures. In the remaining suitable habitat, ibex share forage with horses. Ibex remained relatively unaffected by other livestock such as yaks, donkeys and cattle. However, most livestock removed large amounts of forage from the pastures (nearly 250 kg of dry matter/day by certain species), thereby reducing forage availability for ibex. Pertinent conservation issues are discussed in the light of multiple-use of parks and current socio-economic transitions in the region, which call for integrating social and ecological feedback into management planning.

AB  - Identification of priority areas is a fundamental goal in conservation biology. Because of a lack of detailed information about species distributions, conservation targets in the Zhoushan Archipelago (China) were established on the basis of a species-area-habitat relationship (choros model) combined with an environmental cluster analysis (ECA). An environmental-distinctness index was introduced to rank areas in the dendrogram obtained with the ECA. To reduce the effects of spatial autocorrelation, the ECA was performed considering spatial constraints. To test the validity of the proposed index, a principal component analysis-based environmental diversity approach was also performed. The priority set of islands obtained from the spatially constrained cluster analysis coupled with the environmental-distinctness index had high congruence with that from the traditional environmental-diversity approach. Nevertheless, the environmental-distinctness index offered the advantage of giving hotspot rankings that could be readily integrated with those obtained from the choros model. Although the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test showed no significant difference among the rankings from constrained and unconstrained clustering process, as indicated by cophenetic correlation, spatially constrained cluster analysis performed better than the unconstrained cluster analysis, which suggests the importance of incorporating spatial autocorrelation into ECA. Overall, the integration of the choros model and the ECA showed that the islands Liuheng, Mayi, Zhoushan, Fodu, and Huaniao may be good candidates on which to focus future efforts to conserve regional biodiversity. The 4 types of priority areas, generated from the combination of the 2 approaches, were explained in descending order on the basis of their conservation importance: hotspots with distinct environmental conditions, hotspots with general environmental conditions, areas that are not hotspots with distinct environmental conditions, and areas that are not hotspots with general environmental conditions.

AB  - It is commonly understood that the cumulative impact of increased habitat destruction on biological systems does not scale linearly. Despite this, current environmental decision-making strategies often fail to incorporate these non-linearities because impact assessments are regularly performed independently without considering contributions to future cumulative impacts, which are, instead, externalised to the environment. Here we used a stochastic modelling framework to examine the effect of three decision-making strategies - externalised, individually-borne and shared cumulative costs - on the number of species driven to extinction by the development of a region. We also tested how different levels of vulnerability (quantified as the correlation between development benefits and species richness) and irreplaceability (expressed as the average area of occupancy of an assemblage) influence the outcomes of development. Overall, the inclusion of cumulative impacts in our simulations resulted in the destruction of fewer patches and, as a consequence, more modest benefits obtained from developments. Moreover, these patterns were strongest when cumulative costs were shared by all developers. The most striking finding was that the distinction between decision-making strategies was highest in landscapes of high vulnerability and irreplaceability. Environmental decision-makers are recommended to commit to a strategy for incorporating the cumulative costs of development because, as this study suggests, this affects the endpoints of conservation and development considerably; especially in the most vulnerable and irreplaceable landscapes.

AB  - Species-environment relationships for highly mobile species outside of the breeding season are often highly dynamic in response to the collective effects of ever-changing climatic conditions, food resources, and anthropogenic disturbance. Capturing dynamic space-use patterns in a model-based framework is critical as model inference often drives place-based conservation planning. We applied dynamic occupancy models to broad-scale golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos survey data collected annually from 2006 to 2012 during the late summer post-fledging period in the western US. We defined survey sites as 10 km transect segments with a 1 km buffer on either transect side (n = 3540). Derived estimates of occupancy were low (4.4-7.9%) and turnover rates - the probability that occupied sites were newly occupied - were high (88-94%), demonstrating that annual transiency in occupancy dominates late summer behavior for golden eagles. Despite low philopatry during late summer, variation in golden eagle occupancy could be explained by a suite of land cover and annual-varying covariates including gross primary productivity, drought severity, and human disturbance. Our summary of 13 years of predicted occupancy by golden eagles across the western United States identified areas that are consistently used and that may contribute significantly to golden eagle conservation. Restricting development and targeting mitigation efforts in these areas offers practitioners a framework for conservation prioritization.

AB  - The rapid development of transport infrastructure is a major threat to endangered species worldwide. Roads and railways can increase animal mortality, fragment habitats, and exacerbate other threats to biodiversity. Predictive models that forecast the future impacts to endangered species can guide land-use planning in ways that proactively reduce the negative effects of transport infrastructure. Agent-based models are well suited for predictive scenario testing, yet their application to endangered species conservation is rare. Here, we developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model to forecast the effects of transport infrastructure on an isolated tiger (Panthera tigris) population in Nepal's Chitwan National Park-a global biodiversity hotspot. Specifically, our model evaluated the independent and interactive effects of two mechanisms by which transport infrastructure may affect tigers: (a) increasing tiger mortality, e.g., via collisions with vehicles, and (b) depleting prey near infrastructure. We projected potential impacts on tiger population dynamics based on the: (i) existing transportation network in and near the park, and (ii) the inclusion of a proposed railway intersecting through the park's buffer zone. Our model predicted that existing roads would kill 46 tigers over 20 years via increased mortality, and reduced the adult tiger population by 39% (133 to 81). Adding the proposed railway directly killed 10 more tigers over those 20 years; deaths that reduced the overall tiger population by 30 more individuals (81 to 51). Road-induced mortality also decreased the proportion of time a tiger occupied a given site by 5 years in the 20-year simulation. Interestingly, we found that transportation-induced depletion of prey decreased tiger occupancy by nearly 20% in sites dose to roads and the railway, thereby reducing tiger exposure to transportation-induced mortality. The results of our model constitute a strong argument for taking into account prey distributions into the planning of roads and railways. Our model can promote tiger-friendly transportation development, for example, by improving Environmental Impact Assessments, identifying "no go" zones where transport infrastructure should be prohibited, and recommending alternative placement of roads and railways.
