AB  - Managers require quantitative yet tractable tools that identify areas for restoration yielding effective benefits for targeted wildlife species and the ecosystems they inhabit. As a contemporary example of high national significance for conservation, the persistence of Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in the Great Basin is compromised by strongly interacting stressors of conifer expansion, annual grass invasion, and more frequent wildfires occurring in sagebrush ecosystems. Associated restoration treatments to a sagebrush-dominated state are often costly and may yield relatively little ecological benefit to sage-grouse if implemented without estimating how Sage-grouse may respond to treatments, or do not consider underlying processes influencing sagebrush ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasive species. Here, we describe example applications of a spatially explicit conservation planning tool (CPT) to inform prioritization of: (1) removal of conifers (i.e., pinyon-juniper); and (2) wildfire restoration aimed at improving habitat conditions for the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment of Sage-grouse along the California-Nevada state line. The CPT measures ecological benefits to sage-grouse for a given management action through a composite index comprised of resource selection functions and estimates of abundance and space use. For pinyon-juniper removal, we simulated changes in land-cover composition following the removal of sparse trees with intact understories, and ranked treatments on the basis of changes in ecological benefits per dollar-unit of cost. For wildfire restoration, we formulated a conditional model to simulate scenarios for land cover changes (e.g., sagebrush to annual grass) given estimated fire severity and underlying ecosystem processes influencing resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasion by annual grasses. For both applications, we compared CPT rankings to land cover changes along with sagebrush resistance and resilience metrics. Model results demonstrated how the CPT can be an important step in identifying management projects that yield the highest quantifiable benefit to Sage-grouse while avoiding costly misallocation of resources, and highlight the importance of considering changes in sage-grouse ecological response and factors influencing sagebrush ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasion. This unique framework can be adopted to help inform other management questions aimed at improving habitat for other species across sagebrush and other ecosystems.

AB  - Seeking more precise knowledge of avian endemism on the east slope of the Andes in Peru and Bolivia, one of the most diverse faunal regions on Earth, we used distribution models based on locality records and 10-12 uncorrelated environmental variables to map the distributions of 115 species. Both maximum-entropy and deductive models reveal three areas of endemism, broadly supporting previous assessments of endemism in the region but showing much more detail. Regions such as the southwestern Cordillera de Vilcabamba and the Rio Mapacho-Yavero valley in Cusco, Peru, and the Cordillera de Apolobamba in western Bolivia support a greater richness of endemic species than has been recognized, a result likely attributable to the ability of predictive models to partially control for biases in survey effort. National-level protected areas cover >= 1,000 km(2) of the ranges, or four-fifths of the ranges of species with distributions < 1,000 km(2), of 77% of the endemic species. However, an analysis of summed irreplaceability, which emphasizes the locations of the most narrowly distributed endemics, showed that only 18% of these critical areas are currently protected. The fine-scale maps of endemic areas are suitable for regional and local-scale conservation planning, activities that can fill current gaps in protection of many species.

AB  - Wildlife species' habitats throughout North America are subject to direct and indirect consequences of climate change. Vulnerability assessments for the Intermountain West regard wildlife and vegetation and their disturbance as two key resource areas in terms of ecosystems when considering climate change issues. Despite the adaptability potential of certain wildlife, increased temperature estimates of 1.67-2 degrees C by 2050 increase the likelihood and severity of droughts, floods, heatwaves and wildfires in Utah. As a consequence, resilient flora and fauna could be displaced. The aim of this study was to locate areas of habitat for an exemplary species, i.e., sage-grouse, based on current climate conditions and pinpoint areas of future habitat based on climate projections. The locations of wildlife were collected from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) observations in addition to normal temperature and precipitation, vegetation cover and other ecosystem-related data. Four machine learning algorithms were then used to locate the current sites of wildlife habitats and predict suitable future sites where wildlife would likely relocate to, dependent on the effects of climate change and based on a timeframe of scientifically backed temperature-increase estimates. Our findings show that Random Forest outperforms other competing models, with an accuracy of 0.897, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.917 and 0.885, respectively, and has great potential in Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), which can provide useful insights into habitat predictions. Based on this model, our predictions show that sage-grouse habitats in Utah will continue to decrease over the coming years due to climate change, producing a highly fragmented habitat and causing a loss of close to 70% of their current habitat. Priority Areas of Conservation (PACs) and protected areas might be deemed insufficient to halt this habitat loss, and more effort should be put into maintaining connectivity between patches to ensure the movement and genetic diversity within the sage-grouse population. The underlying data-driven methodical approach of this study could be useful for environmentalists, researchers, decision-makers, and policymakers, among others.

AB  - Soil nutrient content plays a key role in plant growth through mineral nutrition and toxicity. Its impact on plant species and community distribution is studied on a large geographical scale through surrogates like topography or geology. We investigated the importance of soil pH and C:N ratio, as direct nutritional gradients, to determine, with climatic factors, the spatial distribution of plant communities over large territories.
   We studied the distribution of six beech habitats of the NATURA 2000 network throughout France (550,000 km(2)).
   Models were calibrated with 2108 floristic plots classified in the NATURA 2000 system and including climatic and topographic variables and soil nutritional measurements carried out in a laboratory. Logistic regression was used to model habitat distribution according to environmental variables. Climatic layers, a digital elevation model and maps of soil pH and nitrogen content, created using plant indicator values and large floristic databases, were used to map the sites suitable for beech communities. Distribution models were evaluated with an independent set of 2091 phytosociological plots.
   pH and nitrogen supply were the key distribution drivers for four of the six beech communities on a national scale. Their use in the distribution models distinguished within homogeneous climatic territories a gradient of nutritional conditions from acidic areas, suitable for nutrient-poor beech communities, to calcareous areas suitable for nutrient-rich ones. Predicted maps of beech habitats fit the spatial distribution of validation plots.
   Soil pH and nitrogen supply strongly improve predictions of forest community distribution carried out with climatic variables on a broad geographical scale. They allow delineation of areas with nutritional conditions suitable for each community, as well as the realization of predictive high-resolution maps over large areas useful for sustainable and conservation management.

AB  - Three different systems of designating protected areas in a Mediterranean region in southeastern Spain were studied, referring to their effectiveness and efficiency for protecting both the breeding territories and the suitable habitat of a set of ten raptor species. Taking into consideration the varying degrees of endangerment of these species, a map of multispecies conservation values was also drawn up and superimposed on the three protected-area systems studied. In order to compare the levels of protection afforded by the three systems, we considered two indices that measured their relative effectiveness and efficiency. The effectiveness estimated the proportion of territories or optimal habitat protected by the networks while efficiency implicitly considered the area of each system (percentage of breeding territories or optimal habitat protected per 1% of land protected). Overall, our results showed that the most efficient system was that formed by the set of regional parks and reserves (17 protected breeding territories per 100 km(2)), although, given its small total area, it was by far the least effective (only protecting the 21% of the breeding territories of all species and 17% of the area of high conservation value). The systems formed by the Special Protection Areas (designated under the EU "Birds Directive") and by the Special Conservation Areas (designated under the EU "Habitats Directive") notably increased the percentages of protected territories of all species (61%) and area of high conservation value (57%), but their efficiency was not as high as expected in most cases. The overall level of protection was high for all species except for the Lesser Kestrel (Falco naumanni), an endangered falcon that inhabits pseudo-steppe and traditional agricultural habitats, which are clearly underrepresented in the protected-area network of the study region.

AB  - The degree to which tree species will shift in response to climate change is uncertain yet critical to understand for assessing ecosystem vulnerability. We analyze results from recent studies that model potential tree species habitat across the eastern United States during the coming century. Our goals were to quantify and spatially analyze habitat projections and their congruence under multiple climate scenarios and to assess the implications of habitat change for forest vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in and around protected areas. We assessed habitat projections of species habitat extent and forest composition for 35 tree species under climate change from 2000 to 2100 within National Park Service management units in the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ALCC), spanning an approximately 1,500 km latitudinal gradient. Our results show that forest composition and species ranges could change substantially under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and that model correspondence was stronger for projections of habitat declines than increases. Model correspondence generally increased at finer spatial scales, but varied by tree species and focal area. In the ALCC, forest composition was projected to change the most in protected area centered ecosystems (PACEs). Northeastern PACEs were projected to be suitable for tree species currently in southeastern PACEs, suggesting that intermediate suitable habitat regions could promote tree species persistence and mitigate the impacts of climate change on eastern forests. These results suggest that climate-specific management of eastern U.S. forest ecosystems will be critical but challenging, requiring integrated assessment and management of PACEs and protected areas as well as higher-resolution monitoring and modeling to inform spatially explicit management decisions within eastern U.S. parks.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning provides a framework to identify representative areas of biodiversity, but its effectiveness depends on the choice of surrogates and targets. Mexico has conducted participatory and comprehensive gap analyses. We present the results of two independent surrogate assessments to test the criteria used in Mexico's spatial conservation prioritization. We tested the surrogate efficiency of range restricted, endemic, and threatened mammals and the influence of target-setting on the spatial configuration of the conservation network, as well as the performance of taxonomic-based surrogates. Results show that target-setting heavily influences the spatial configuration and irreplaceability values of the conservation area network. Representation effectiveness and coverage of species distribution was sensitive to surrogate selection but not to target-setting. Threatened and rare species were poorly represented when other surrogate species were used, while threatened mammals represented 90% of all species. The effectiveness of networks designed for a single vertebrate taxon varied greatly; reptiles and amphibians performed better than random achieving high species representation.

AB  - Based on species occurrence records of museum collections, published literature, and unpublished records shared by mammalian experts, we compiled a distribution database for 59 terrestrial mammals populating the extensively protected Dobrogea Region of Romania. The spatial patterns of mammal distribution and diversity was evaluated and systematic conservation planning applied to identify priority areas for their conservation. The spatial analyses revealed that intensive sampling was not directly correlated to mammal diversity but rather to accessibility for inventory. The spatial prioritisation analysis indicated a relatively aggregated pattern of areas with a high or low conservation value with virtually no connecting corridors between them. The significant overlap between Natura 2000 sites and national protected areas induced an over-optimistic vision of the effectiveness and representativeness of existing Natura 2000 network for species found in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive. These results represent a key step in identifying core areas for the protection of mammal diversity and dispersal corridors for improved connectivity, and to guide future conservation efforts in increasing the effectiveness of the existing protected areas in the context of environmental changes.

AB  - Place-based management in the open ocean faces unique challenges in delineating boundaries around temporally and spatially dynamic systems that span broad geographic scales and multiple management jurisdictions, especially in the 'high seas'. Geospatial technologies are critical for the successful design of pelagic conservation areas, because they provide information on the spatially and temporally dynamic oceanographic features responsible for driving species distribution and abundance in the open ocean, the movements of protected species, and the spatial patterns of distribution of potential threats. Nevertheless, there are major challenges to implementing these geospatial approaches in the open ocean. This Theme Section seeks to bridge the gap between geospatial science and marine conservation by discussing the use of innovative approaches to support effective marine conservation planning strategies for pelagic ecosystems. We highlight the results of this collection of contributions in 3 main sections: (1) conceptual advances in pelagic conservation; (2) novel information technologies and methodologies; and (3) case studies in the California Current and Pacific Ocean.

AB  - Invasive species have been the focus of ecologists due to their undesired impacts on the environment. The extent and rapid increase in invasive plant species is recognized as a natural cause of global-biodiversity loss and degrading ecosystem services. Biological invasions can affect ecosystems across a wide spectrum of bioclimatic conditions. Understanding the impact of climate change on species invasion is crucial for sustainable biodiversity conservation. In this study, the possibility of mapping the distribution of invasive Prosopis juliflora (Swartz) DC. was shown using present background data in Khuzestan Province, Iran. After removing the spatial bias of background data by creating weighted sampling bias grids for the occurrence dataset, we applied six modelling algorithms (generalized additive model (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), random forest (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and ensemble model) to predict invasion distribution of the species under current and future climate conditions for both optimistic (RCP 2.6) and pessimistic (RCP 8.5) scenarios for the years 2050 and 2070, respectively. Predictor variables including weighted mean of CHELSA (climatologies at high resolution for the Earth's land surface areas)-bioclimatic variables and geostatistical-based bioclimatic variables (1979-2020), physiographic variables extracted from shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) and some human factors were used in modelling process. To avoid causing a biased selection of predictors or model coefficients, we resolved the spatial autocorrelation of presence points and multi-collinearity of the predictors. As in a conventional receiver operating characteristic (ROC), the area under curve (AUC) is calculated using presence and absence observations to measure the probability and the two error components are weighted equally. All models were evaluated using partial ROC at different thresholds and other statistical indices derived from confusion matrix. Sensitivity analysis showed that mean diurnal range (Bio2) and annual precipitation (Bio12) explained more than 50% of the changes in the invasion distribution and played a pivotal role in mapping habitat suitability of P. juliflora. At all thresholds, the ensemble model showed a significant difference in comparison with single model. However, MaxEnt and RF outperformed the others models. Under climate change scenarios, it is predicted that suitable areas for this invasive species will increase in Khuzestan Province, and increasing climatically suitable areas for the species in future will facilitate its future distribution. These findings can support the conservation planning and management efforts in ecological engineering and be used in formulating preventive measures.

AB  - Climate change is reaching several tipping points, likely resulting in habitat shifts at a global scale. Such changes could have serious consequences for migratory species. For instance, climatic changes may impact the distribution of breeding and non-breeding ranges, resulting in longer migration distances for some species. The flycatchers (Tyrannidae) are the largest family of birds in New World. They are small insectivorous birds with different distributions and migratory strategies, including both tropical and temperate species. Here, we aim to map the climatically suitable ranges for Tyrannidae in the future, compare them to their present ranges, and quantify the changes in range size and in migratory distance. We show different impacts on species that breed in the northern vs. southern hemisphere. Furthermore, results suggest that tropical and temperate species would suffer from different stressors. Neotropical austral migrant species would lose part of their breeding ranges, while Nearctic-Neotropical species would need to fly longer distances to reach the same climatic conditions of their current breeding ranges. Because past climate shifts have shaped the evolution of bird migration, these insights are also key for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the evolution and regulation of bird migration, and for conservation planning.

AB  - Predicting how environmental factors affect the distribution of species is a fundamental goal of conservation biology. Conservation biologists rely on species distribution and abundance models to identify key habitat characteristics for species. Occupancy modeling is frequently promoted as a practical alternative to use of abundance in identifying habitat quality. While occupancy and abundance are potentially governed by different limiting factors operating at different scales, few studies have directly compared predictive models for these approaches in the same system. We evaluated how much occupancy and abundance are driven by the same environmental factors for a species of conservation concern, the greater short-horned lizard (Phrynosoma hernandesi). Occupancy was most strongly dictated by precipitation, temperature, and density of ant mounds. While these factors were also in the best-supported predictive models for lizard abundance, the magnitude of the effects varied, with the sign of the effect changing for temperature and precipitation. These discrepancies show that while occupancy modeling can be an efficient approach for conservation planning, predictors of occupancy probability should not automatically be equated with predictors of population abundance. Understanding the differences in factors that control occupancy versus abundance can help us to identify habitat requirements and mitigate the loss of threatened species.

AB  - Ecological systems are inherently complex. The processes that affect the distributions of animals and plants operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales, presenting a unique challenge for the development and coordination of effective conservation strategies, particularly for wide-ranging species. In order to study ecological systems across scales,. data must be collected at fine resolutions across broad spatial and temporal extents. Crowdsourcing has emerged as an efficient way to gather these data by engaging large numbers of people to record observations. However, data gathered by crowdsourced projects are often biased due to the opportunistic approach of data collection. In this article, we propose a general class of models called AdaSTEM (for adaptive spatiotemporal exploratory models) that are designed to meet these challenges by adapting to multiple scales while exploiting variation, in data density common with crowdsourced data. To illustrate the use of AdaSTEM, we produce intraseasonal distribution estimates of long-distance migrations across the Western Hemisphere using data from eBird, a citizen science project that utilizes volunteers to collect observations of birds. Subsequently, model diagnostics are used to quantify and visualize the scale and quality of distribution estimates. This analysis shows how AdaSTEM can automatically adapt to complex spatiotemporal processes across a range of scales, thus providing essential information for full-life cycle conservation planning of broadly distributed species, communities, and ecosystems.

AB  - Protected Areas (PAs) are core components of conservation strategies, but the networks they form are rarely assessed for their effectiveness over time. We tested different aspects of effectiveness of the British PA network in achieving long-term biodiversity outcomes, including species representativeness of initial location choices and network resilience (in terms of species persistence). Using 10 x 10 km cells, 'landscapes', with contrasting cover of protected areas managed specifically for biodiversity conservation, we evaluated these aspects of effectiveness by analysing species distribution changes of over 2800 species of animals and plants from 1974 to 2014. Landscapes that contained PAs in 1974 had higher species representativeness than landscapes without PAs, but landscapes with low PA coverage ( median) were more representative than those with high PA coverage ( median). Many species distributions have declined since 1974, and the distributional trends of declining and priority species were similar (on average) in landscapes containing PAs and in the wider countryside, implying PA-containing landscapes were not resilient to landscape-scale pressures. Nonetheless, PAs did have a small positive impact over time on landscape-scale representation trends of declining species, and priority species. Regardless of PA coverage, topographically heterogeneous landscapes were more likely to retain priority species between 1974 and 2014, and less likely to be colonised by expanding species. Despite landscapes with low PA coverage disproportionately contributing to overall PA network representativeness, they are less resilient than landscapes with high PA coverage, which jeopardises their value in the long-term and will require landscapescale habitat conservation and restoration to address.

AB  - Protected Areas (PA) play a pivotal role in conservation biology. Climate change challenges the concept of static PAs as species may not find suitable climatic conditions in the PAs designed to protect them in the future. Here, we assess this emerging mismatch for the endemic mountain flora of the Iranian Plateau, the main part of the Irano-Anatolian global biodiversity hotspot. We compare the climatic requirements of each of 1277 endemic plant species with the climatic conditions offered by those parts of the Iranian PA network that are within the dispersal range of each species. We undertake this comparison for current climatic conditions and the conditions predicted for the years 2050 and 2070 under the climatic scenarios RCP4.5 und RCP8.5. We find that 50 % of the species climatic niche space is represented in the PA network under current conditions. Depending on the cli-matic scenario and time frame, representation will decrease to 15-25 % in the future. Species of lowest and highest elevations, and, in particular, species with narrow ranges, are predicted to face the most pronounced losses of climatic representation in PAs. We conclude that the contribution of the current Iranian PA network to protecting the rich endemic flora of the country under climate change is limited. The network overrepresents climatically homogenous desert ecosystems and neglects endemism hotspots of high mountain chains. Efficient conservation planning in this biodiversity hotspot should focus on expanding elevational gradients within PAs and prioritize the protection of narrow range, low and high elevation species.

AB  - Phylogenetic approaches have much promise for the setting of conservation priorities and resource allocation. There has been significant development of analytical methods for the measurement of phylogenetic diversity within and among ecological communities as a way of setting conservation priorities. Application of these tools to insects has been low as has been the uptake by conservation managers. A critical reason for the lack of uptake includes the scarcity of detailed phylogenetic and species distribution data from much of insect diversity. Environmental DNA technologies offer a means for the high throughout collection of phylogenetic data across landscapes for conservation planning.

AB  - Malaysia is recognized as a megadiverse country and biodiversity hotspot which necessitates sufficient levels of habitat protection and effective conservation management. However, conservation planning in Malaysia has hitherto relied largely on species distribution data without taking into account the rich evolutionary history of taxa. This represents the first study that integrates spatial and evolutionary approaches to identify important centers of diversity, endemism, and bioregionalization that can be earmarked for conservation priorities in Peninsular Malaysia. Using georeferenced species occurrences, comprehensive phylogenies, and threat assessments of frogs and lizards, we employed a spatial phylogenetics framework that incorporates various diversity metrics including weighted endemism, phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic endemism, and evolutionary distinctiveness and global endangerment. Ten areas of high conservation value were identified via the intersection of these metrics-northern Perlis, Langkawi Geopark, southern Bintang range, Cameron Highlands, Fraser's Hill, Benom-Krau complex, Selangor-Genting complex, Endau-Rompin National Park, Seribuat Archipelago (Tioman and Pemanggil Islands), and southern Johor. Of these, Cameron Highlands requires the highest conservation priority based on the high numbers of endangered and evolutionary distinct species coupled with severe environmental degradation and inadequately protected areas. Other areas, especially in the northwestern (states of Kedah and Penang) and northeastern regions (state of Kelantan) were not only identified as areas of high conservation value but also areas of biogeographic importance. Taken together, frogs and lizards demonstrate distinct east-west and north-south patterns of bioregionalization that are largely modulated by mountain ranges. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding the ecological consequences of conservation policies on wildlife is critical for species conservation and policy implementation. China began to call for establishing a national park system in 2013 and used national parks as the predominant feature for its system of protected areas in 2019. Payment for ecosystem services (PES) and relocation constitute two important management strategies in new Chinese national parks and protected area system. To better understand the potential outcomes of such programs, we studied the winter foraging distribution of the threatened Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis), a flagship species of plateau wetlands, in Dashanbao Protected Area, SW China. Field survey data were combined with environmental variables and land use maps to model winter foraging habitat with respect to human settlements subject to PES and relocation. High suitability for foraging was mapped in the core zone around crane roosting sites, villages, and far from disturbance (e.g. main roads). Aiming at converting farmland to wetland, the payment for ecosystem services programs increased probability of occurrence of cranes by changing land cover in appropriate areas relative to crane roosts and other spatially distributed variables. Surprisingly, areas within 1 km of villages were recognized as highly suitable foraging habitats for cranes, which depend on waste grain in farmland in winter, revealing the potential risk of relocation-induced food shortage for wintering cranes. We argue that as an effective strategy in improving wildlife habitat, PES should be encouraged and relocation programs that change the existing long-term established human-wildlife interactions should be implemented only under full understanding of these relationships. As a pioneer study of the effects of conservation policy on wetland ecosystems in China, this study could shed light on conservation management for such ecosystem and species showing high dependence on a human modified environment. Future work should also focus on the social effects of these conservation strategies, especially relocation, during national park planning in China.

AB  - Conservation planning is sensitive to a number of scale-related issues, such as the spatial extent of the planning area, or the size of units of planning. An extensive literature has reported a decline in efficiency of conservation outputs when planning at small spatial scales or when using large planning units. However, other key issues remain, such as the grain size used to represent the spatial distribution of conservation features. Here, we evaluate the effect of grain size of species distribution data versus size of planning units on a set of performance measures describing efficiency (ratio of area where species are represented/total area needed), rate of commission errors (species erroneously expected to occur), representativeness (proportion of species achieving the target) and a novel measure of overall conservation uncertainty (integrating commission errors and uncertainty in the actual locations where species occur). We compared priority areas for the conservation of freshwater fish in the Daly River basin (northern Australia). Our study demonstrates that the effect of grain size of species distribution data was more important than planning unit size on conservation planning performance, with an increase in commission errors up to 80% and conservation uncertainty over 90% when coarse data were used. This was more pronounced for rare than common species, where the mismatch between coarse representations of biodiversity patterns and the smaller areas of actual occupancy of species was more evident. Special attention should be paid to the high risk of misallocation of limited budgets when planning in heterogeneous or disturbed environments, where biodiversity is patchily distributed, or when planning for conservation of rare species.

AB  - Aim To quantify the role of multiple biodiversity drivers - pollution, woodland structure and climate - controlling lichen epiphyte composition and diversity.
   Location Scotland, north-west Europe.
   Methods Four compatible datasets were assembled: site-scale species distribution data (response) and base-line modelled data on climate, pollution loads and extent of old-growth woodland (explanatory variables). First, partial-canonical correspondence analysis was used: (1) to compare the importance of environmental variables to pure spatial effects and (2) to partition the importance of environmental variables in explaining species composition. Secondly, patterns of species richness were investigated using multiple least-squares regression.
   Results Old-growth woodland was the most important control of species richness. Pollution was the most important explanatory variable for species composition. The impact of pollution on composition (and to a lesser extent on richness) is explained: (1) By recovery of lichens with declining SO2 pollution, although with epiphyte composition shifted by the recent effects of N-pollution and (2) By the limited spatial extent of severe pollution, and generally low-to-moderate pollution loads across our study area, combined with the positive effect of old-growth woodland extent in controlling species richness. The effect of climate and old-growth woodland on species composition covaried, supporting an interaction between habitat quality and climatic setting, which may be important in understanding the epiphyte response to climate change.
   Conclusions Advances in conservation planning will likely require an integrated approach to understanding simultaneous effects of multiple drivers, providing opportunities for integrated management strategies. Our study provides a preliminary example of this approach by combining three key biodiversity drivers into a single framework for lichen epiphytes. Thus, reducing pollution loads may make old-growth woodland that currently exists in a polluted landscape available for colonization, thereby extending the available habitat for epiphytes, and facilitating an effective species response to climate change.

AB  - Agriculture, global biodiversity and distribution of species are increasingly influenced by changing climate. Assessing the future distribution of biodiversity under different climate change scenarios is an essential step towards conservation planning and policy implementations. To understand the climate change impacts, the present study usedGarcinia gummi-guttacash crop species as a case study that is even exported, adding the nation's foreign reserve. Given the importance of this crop for local and national economy, the main objectives of the study were to analyse the impact of present and future climates on ecologically susceptibleG. gummi-guttaspecies in the Western Ghats based on maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). Future projections with RCP scenarios for 2050 and 2070 were made using the data of 84 species occurrence and climatic variables of three climate models from IPCC 5th assessment. The contribution of climatic variables was analysed by jackknife test, and 0.888 of AOC indicates high accuracy of the model results. It was found that annual precipitation, coldest quarter precipitation, and precipitation seasonality were the key determining factors for the suitability of this species. In addition, the results of all scenarios showed that the current suitability of the species would be dramatically decreased by 2050 and 2070. The study suggests how the MaxEnt approach can be an important tool for agricultural development, management of species habitats, conservation of biodiversity, and climate change rehabitation planning.

AB  - Outputs of species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used as indicators of climate conditions favorable for species occurrence. When using these outputs to inform planning and decision making, it is essential that the uncertainties associated with the projections of present-day and future climatic suitability are carefully considered. Climate change assessments routinely consider the uncertainty introduced into SDM outputs by differences in future climate projections, and other uncertainty sources, such as the choice of the threshold to convert simulated probabilities to binary climatically suitable areas, are also oftentimes considered. However, the uncertainty introduced by the limitations of the species occurrence data used in the SDM calibration is rarely evaluated. These limitations, which include location error, sampling bias, and species misidentification, may reduce the utility of SDM outputs in conservation research and practice. Using understory bamboo species in southwest China as examples, here we demonstrate that species occurrences obtained using remote sensing offer an additional dataset for calibrating SDMs that, in conjunction with conventional observations and employing an ensemble approach of outputs from multiple models, provide an estimate of the uncertainty introduced by the species occurrence data. A biweekly time series of the satellite-based Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRI) was employed to estimate bamboo occurrence based on phenological signatures of the bamboo species and their overstory canopies. Using Maxent, a popular modeling framework, present-day and projected future climatic suitability were assessed separately for conventional species presence observations from the Fourth National Giant Panda Survey and for the remotely-sensed presence estimates. The ensemble of model outputs suggests that the uncertainty introduced by the species occurrence data, along with the interaction with other sources of uncertainty, may be as substantial as the uncertainty introduced by the use of different climate scenarios or by the threshold used to estimate binary climatically suitable areas. Ignoring the uncertainty introduced by the limitations of the species occurrences may compromise the interpretation of SDM outputs and reduce their usefulness for conservation planning. Remote sensing is a largely untapped resource for assessing uncertainty in SDM simulations.

AB  - Large protected areas are essential for the long-term conservation of wide-ranging or low density large carnivore populations. However, small protected areas can also contribute to carnivore conservation if they have sufficient prey density, if wildlife crime is controlled and if they are connected to other protected areas and/or embedded within a larger matrix of at least partially suitable habitat. In the central highlands of Sri Lanka, the 31.6 km(2) Horton Plains National Park (HPNP) is a mosaic of tropical montane cloud forest and patana grassland set within a mosaic landscape of forest and agriculture. We conducted a camera trapping study in 2017 and 2018 to estimate leopard densities in HPNP and predict their activity centers. A Bayesian multi-session spatially-explicit capture-recapture analysis of 249 independent captures across two 4-month camera trapping campaigns returned density estimates of 10.6 per 100 km(2) (95% HDI = 8.0-16.0) in 2017 and 15.1 per 100 km(2) (95% HDI = 13.3-18.7) in 2018. Female capture rates and activity centers remained stable over the two survey periods, indicating fidelity to the grasslands. In contrast, most male activity centers were predicted to fall outside of the park, which implied that a significant proportion of males' activity occurred outside HPNP, likely with occasional returns to the prey-dense grassland area. As a result, HPNP is unlikely to be sufficient on its own to sustain the estimated leopard densitiesdparticularly for malesdwithout contribution from the surrounding landscape. Thus, although the Department of Wildlife Conservation maintains jurisdiction over wildlife anywhere in the country, interagency collaboration in research, management and conservation should be encouraged owing to multiple jurisdictions over land management that will affect habitat suitability for leopards. Finally, we highlight the potential benefits of maintaining an updated camera trap database for outreach and potential conflict management. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The continuous p-median approach to environmental diversity (ED) is a reliable way to identify sites that efficiently represent species. A recently developed maximum dispersion (maxdisp) approach to ED is computationally simpler, does not require the user to reduce environmental space to two dimensions, and performed better than continuous p-median for datasets of South African animals. We tested whether maxdisp performs as well as continuous p-median for 12 datasets that included plants and other continents, and whether particular types of environmental variables produced consistently better models of ED. We selected 12 species inventories and atlases to span a broad range of taxa (plants, birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians), spatial extents, and resolutions. For each dataset, we used continuous p-median ED and maxdisp ED in combination with five sets of environmental variables (five combinations of temperature, precipitation, insolation, NDVI, and topographic variables) to select environmentally diverse sites. We used the species accumulation index (SAI) to evaluate the efficiency of ED in representing species for each approach and set of environmental variables. Maxdisp ED represented species better than continuous p-median ED in five of 12 biodiversity datasets, and about the same for the other seven biodiversity datasets. Efficiency of ED also varied with type of variables used to define environmental space, but no particular combination of variables consistently performed best. We conclude that maxdisp ED performs at least as well as continuous p-median ED, and has the advantage of faster and simpler computation. Surprisingly, using all 38 environmental variables was not consistently better than using subsets of variables, nor did any subset emerge as consistently best or worst; further work is needed to identify the best variables to define environmental space. Results can help ecologists and conservationists select sites for species representation and assist in conservation planning.

AB  - Networks of ponds (pondscapes) are becoming increasingly significant for resilient landscape planning in rural areas. Farmland and forestry ponds are habitat islands that support heterogeneous communities of aquatic organisms.
   Species richness, Dragonfly Biotic Index (DBI), Shannon's index, and species composition are used here to assess the complementary conservation value of adult dragonfly assemblages associated with forty ponds across a protected area-sugarcane-forestry mosaic.
   Despite differences in environmental variables among the various ponds, dragonfly species richness, DBI, Shannon index scores, as well as responses to particular environmental variables, did not differ between ponds in sugarcane, plantation forestry, and protected areas. Dragonfly composition differed in response to vegetation cover.
   Our results highlight the importance of catchment and regional management for all ponds within the pondscape, and show that ponds in the transformed areas (i.e. sugarcane and forestry areas) are important contributors to regional conservation. As the various ponds were complementary in their dragonfly assemblages, we recommend conservation focus at the level of the pondscape rather than on individual ponds.

AB  - Butterfly assemblages were studied from 2004 to 2007 at sites along the San Diego River. The purpose was to provide baseline information in the face of possible river improvement projects. We sampled in a protected area and in urban environments in hopes of identifying butterfly assemblages associated with a variety of riparian types. Multivariate analysis identified environmental variables significantly associated with butterfly assemblages such as riparian rank, soil moisture, air temperature, wind speed, nectar abundance, and forb & graminoid richness. There were significant correlations between butterfly species richness, butterfly abundance and a variety of environmental variables, including % shade. Sites located in the Mission Trails Regional Park contained unique butterfly species and were considered high value reference sites. Some butterflies of conservation interest were encountered such as: Panoquina errans Skinner, 1892 (Hesperiidae), Zerene eurydice Boisduval, 1855 (Pieridae), Tharsalea hernias W.H. Edwards, 1870 (Lycaenidae), and Apodemia virgulti Behr, 1865 (Riodiniclae). A butterfly-centric metric was derived using species richness and significant variables identified via multivariate analysis to aid in management/monitoring of San Diego riparian sites.

AB  - Concerns about the impacts of climate change loom large among biodiversity scientists. A pressing issue is the role of Protected Area networks under future climate change, because of the shifting of species distributions polewards due to climate warming. In this study we use two techniques in conservation science, first, to estimate the likely impacts on the distributions of mammals and butterflies in Egypt (MaxEnt), and second, to measure the effectiveness of Egypt's Protected Area network (Zonation). We predict that future climate will have significant effects on species richness and the relative value for conservation of sites in Egypt: some areas will increase in species richness, whilst others will decrease significantly. Currently, the sites of highest relative conservation value are found in the Nile Delta, southeastern and Sinai regions of Egypt and along the Mediterranean and Red Sea coastlines, with Protected Areas having a higher conservation value than unprotected areas. Under future climate scenarios the relative conservation value of Protected Areas are predicted initially to decline and then gradually increase by the 2080s. It is predicted that many areas, especially the Nile Delta and the southeast, will require extra protection in the future; areas that are currently not protected, but have high species richness and conservation value, may need to be protected to prevent loss of biodiversity.

AB  - We used distribution data of 121 cactus species endemic to the Chihuahuan Desert to test the effectiveness of the region's protected area network. The analysis of species distribution using a 30' latitude x 30' longitude grid facilitated the identification and categorization of areas of endemism. We found a low degree of coincidence between protected areas and the areas of cactus endemism, and only 63.6% of the 121 species occur in protected areas. A complementarity analysis showed that 10 of the protected areas contain the 77 species that occur in protected areas. The four top priority areas protect 65 (84.4%) of these 77 species The 44 unprotected species are mainly micro-endemic and taxonomically distinctive taxa widely scattered in the region. The complementarity analysis applied to these species showed that all of them can be contained in a minimum of 24 grid squares, representing 32.9% of the total area occupied. Their strong spatial dispersion, along with their narrow endemism, is a major conservation challenge. We conclude that the current protected area network is insufficient to protect the rich assemblage of cacti endemic to the Chihuahuan Desert. Conservation efforts in this region should be enhanced by increasing the effectiveness of the already existing protected areas and by the creation of additional protected areas, specifically micro-reserves, to provide refuge for the unprotected species.

AB  - The Romanian Carpathian Mountains provide one of the largest areas suitable for brown bear (Ursus arctos) in Europe, but the long history of logging has reduced old-growth forest to fragments. Continuous timber extraction, along with new recreation opportunities from motorized vehicles, may affect brown bear denning habitat through disturbance. As such, understanding den site selection at the landscape and local levels is important for the conservation and sustainable management of the Romanian brown bear population. We used data on 86 den sites collected between 2010 and 2013 in Southeastern Carpathians and developed Resource Selection Functions for second-order (landscape-level) and third-order (local level) den habitat selection, using habitat structure and topographic attributes of den locations. The altitude of dens ranged between 440 and 1,320 m, with a mean slope of 19.7 +/- 0.8%. Aspect was evenly distributed between southwest (22.9% of the dens), east (20.5%), south (18.1%), and southeast (15.7%). Dens stabilized by boulders were dominant (68%), and had maximum mean length = 149.2 +/- 5.6 cm, width = 109.1 +/- 4.8 cm, and height = 113.8 +/- 10.5 cm. At both local and the landscape scales, bears selected for steeper slope and higher percent coverage of mixed (beech-fir-spruce [Fagus sylvatica-Abies alba-Picea abies]) forest. At the landscape scale, bears also selected dens at higher altitude, and with greater coverage of old forest, and away from urban areas and recent clear-cuts. Our spatial predictions have the potential to inform forest management by identifying areas where disturbance of brown bear denning habitat should be avoided or limited, thus contributing to brown bear management and conservation planning in the Romanian Carpathians.

AB  - Given the rate of projected environmental change for the 21st century, urgent adaptation and mitigation measures are required to slow down the on-going erosion of biodiversity. Even though increasing evidence shows that recent human-induced environmental changes have already triggered species' range shifts, changes in phenology and species' extinctions, accurate projections of species' responses to future environmental changes are more difficult to ascertain. This is problematic, since there is a growing awareness of the need to adopt proactive conservation planning measures using forecasts of species' responses to future environmental changes.
   There is a substantial body of literature describing and assessing the impacts of various scenarios of climate and land-use change on species' distributions. Model predictions include a wide range of assumptions and limitations that are widely acknowledged but compromise their use for developing reliable adaptation and mitigation strategies for biodiversity. Indeed, amongst the most used models, few, if any, explicitly deal with migration processes, the dynamics of population at the "trailing edge" of shifting populations, species' interactions and the interaction between the effects of climate and land-use.
   In this review, we propose two main avenues to progress the understanding and prediction of the different processes A occurring on the leading and trailing edge of the species' distribution in response to any global change phenomena. Deliberately focusing on plant species, we first explore the different ways to incorporate species' migration in the existing modelling approaches, given data and knowledge limitations and the dual effects of climate and land-use factors. Secondly, we explore the mechanisms and processes happening at the trailing edge of a shifting species' distribution and how to implement them into a modelling approach. We finally conclude this review with clear guidelines on how such modelling improvements will benefit conservation strategies in a changing world. (c) 2007 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

AB  - Target-based planning is an integral component of systematic conservation planning. Using empirical data, we investigate a prior conceptual proposition that target-based planning may lead to lower average protection levels across biodiversity features due to its prescriptive nature where conservation outcome is measured in terms of achievement of many independently developed targets. We used spatial distribution models and externally provided targets set for 253 biodiversity features from the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany hotspot and compared target-based planning to alternative approaches, such as maximum-utility planning, which can operate without the specification of strict targets. We found that target-based planning retained on average a significantly lower fraction of the distributions of all biodiversity features than did alternative methods. This sub-optimality fundamentally follows from the nestedness of species distributions being ignored in target setting, leading to investment in features that occur in relatively species-poor and expensive areas. Consequently, benefit-based alternatives to target-based planning will achieve higher overall conservation performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Southeast Asia has arguably the highest biodiversity loss due to the high deforestation rate and hunting pressure. In the region, 55 species of the family Phasianidae can be found in all available land habitats from lowland plains up to high-elevation mountainous areas. As ground-dwelling birds, these species are sensitive to habitat disturbance and hunting pressure, making them ideal to evaluate the status of remaining Southeast Asian forest habitats. The aims of this work are, therefore, to define for each Phasianidae species: (1) the extent of forest cover, suitable habitat and large forest patches currently available in the region and their decline over the years between 2000 and 2018 (six estimated generations) and (2) assess the threats using a Bayesian Belief Network approach combining data on forest loss hotspots and hunting pressure. Moreover, we defined the spatial distribution of Phasianidae diversity hotspots and relative threats in the region. The results show that over the 18-year study period, the forest cover, suitable habitat and Phasianidae diversity in Southeast Asia declined overall. The remaining forest habitats currently have low species diversity and face medium to high threat levels from habitat loss and hunting pressure. Population monitoring and higher protection levels both inside and outside protected areas are essential for the species' long term survival. We recommend using Phasianidae as indicator species to monitor the overall habitat conservation status in Southeast Asia.

AB  - To use models of species distributions effectively in conservation planning, it is important to determine the predictive accuracy of such models. Extensive modelling of the distribution of vascular plant and vertebrate fauna species within north-east New South Wales has been undertaken by linking field survey data to environmental and geographical predictors using logistic regression. These models have been used in the development of a comprehensive and adequate reserve system within the region. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of models for 153 small reptile, arboreal marsupial, diurnal bird and vascular plant species for which independent evaluation data were available.
   The predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the relative operating characteristic curve to measure discrimination capacity. Good discrimination ability implies that a model's predictions provide an acceptable index of species occurrence.
   The discrimination capacity of 89% of the models was significantly better than random, with 70% of the models providing high levels of discrimination. Predictions generated by this type of modelling therefore provide a reasonably sound basis for regional conservation planning.
   The discrimination ability of models was highest for the less mobile biological groups, particularly the vascular plants and small reptiles. In the case of diurnal birds, poor performing models tended to be for species which occur mainly within specific habitats not well sampled by either the model development or evaluation data, highly mobile species, species that are locally nomadic or those that display very broad habitat requirements. Particular care needs to be exercised when employing models for these types of species in conservation planning. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - Conservation scientists have adapted conservation planning principles designed for protection of habitats ranging from terrestrial to freshwater ecosystems. We applied current approaches in conservation planning to prioritize California watersheds for management of biodiversity. For all watersheds, we compiled data on the presence/absence of herpetofauna and fishes; observations of freshwater-dependent mammals, selected invertebrates, and plants; maps of freshwater habitat types; measures of habitat condition and vulnerability; and current management status. We analyzed species-distribution data to identify areas of high freshwater conservation value that optimized representation of target taxa on the landscape and leveraged existing protected areas. The resulting priority network encompasses 34% of the area of California and includes >= 10% of the geographic range for all target taxa. High-value watersheds supported nontarget freshwater taxa and habitats, and focusing on target taxa may provide broad conservation value. Most of the priority conservation network occurs on public lands (69% by area), and 46% overlaps with protected areas already managed for biodiversity. A significant proportion of the network area is on private land and underscores the value of programs that incentivize landowners to manage freshwater species and habitats. The priority conservation areas encompass more freshwater habitats/ha than existing protected areas. Land use (agriculture and urbanization), altered fire regimes, nonnative fish communities, and flow impairment are the most important threats to freshwater habitat in the priority network, whereas factors associated with changing climate are the key drivers of habitat vulnerability. Our study is a guide to a comprehensive approach to freshwater conservation currently lacking in California. Conservation resources are often limited, so prioritization tools are valuable assets to land and water managers.

AB  - The transition from natural habitat to agricultural land use is widely regarded as one of the leading drivers of biodiversity loss. Despite this, most wildlife still lives outside protected areas on private agricultural land, particularly on rangeland used for livestock grazing. Understanding which species persist and which decline in agricultural landscapes is important for global biodiversity monitoring, management and conservation. In this study, we used hierarchical multi-species occupancy modelling to estimate terrestrial vertebrate (body mass > 0.5 kg) richness in the Karoo, a semi-arid region of South Africa. We evaluated species-specific responses to different anthropogenic and environmental variables in rangeland and a nearby protected area of similar size. We grouped mammal species according to trophic guild and body size and compared their occurrence between areas. In total we detected 42 species over 4035 6-day pooled trap nights across 322 sites. Community species richness was not significantly different between the two types of land use and decreased with increasing elevation in the protected area. Human disturbance did not affect individual species occupancy in either area. Carnivores, omnivores and medium-sized species occupancy probabilities were similar between the two areas but were higher for herbivores and large species in the protected area and for insectivores and small species in rangeland. Our results reveal that drylands in the South African Karoo region, including rangeland used for small-livestock fanning, support a diverse community of terrestrial vertebrates. Private landowners are thus important custodians of key components of indigenous biodiversity outside of protected areas, especially in low-lying areas.

AB  - We studied 30 streams in eastern Amazonia, 17 of which were located within a protected area (PA) and the other 13 in the surrounding zone, with the objective of evaluating the diversity of adult Odonata and if there was a difference between the physical habitat variables of the two environments. We hypothesized that a greater diversity of odonate species would be found in the PA due to a greater complexity of habitats. This hypothesis was rejected, however, due to the greater odonate diversity found in the surrounding zone in comparison with the PA. Differences were also found in the species composition of the two environments. Our results indicate that there are differences between the environmental variables in the areas, and the few alterations observed in the surrounding zone may have contributed to the formation of new conditions and habitats appropriate for species that may have been rare. The PA, despite having reduced species richness and abundance in comparison with the surrounding zone, was nevertheless characterized by a more heterogeneous species composition. A quarter of the species were common to both environments, while 34 % were exclusive to the surrounding zone. In this case, it appears that the combination of the protected area and the surrounding zone, which has a low level of disturbance, conserves a wider range of specialist species than either area on its own. The great challenge in the future is finding a way to identify the disturbance levels that would be acceptable, and to prevent over-exploitation of resources in such areas.

AB  - The European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis (L., 1758), is threatened throughout its distribution, prompting management of habitats and populations for conservation. Quantitative data on habitat requirements for this species are needed to better evaluate which areas are the most suitable, or what actions can improve habitat suitability. We studied relationships between the distribution and abundance of E. orbicularis and the environment by analysing water quality and features of 39 wetland and upland habitats in the Po River delta of northern Italy; visual transects and point counts were used to determine turtle presence and relative abundance. Emys orbicularis occurs more frequently and abundantly in permanent wetlands surrounded by woodlands, and its presence does not appear to be related to water eutrophication. Woodlands strongly influence adjacent wetland features and may be important for turtles' terrestrial activities such as nesting and dispersal. Habitat management and conservation plans for E. orbicularis should include protection of extensive terrestrial woodland habitat containing diverse wetland systems, to support turtle survival at different life-history stages. The requirements for wetlands and natural terrestrial habitat are difficult to meet in the currently human-dominated European lowlands; nevertheless, conservation plans for this species should take a broad-scale approach.

AB  - Predictive vegetation mapping can be defined as predicting the geographic distribution of the vegetation composition across a landscape from mapped environmental variables. Computerized predictive vegetation mapping is made possible by the availability of digital maps of topography and other environmental variables such as soils, geology and climate variables, and geographic information system software for manipulating these data. Especially important to predictive vegetation mapping are interpolated climatic variables related to physiological tolerances, and topographic variables, derived from digital elevation grids, related to site energy and moisture balance. Predictive vegetation mapping is founded in ecological niche theory and gradient analysis, and driven by the need to map vegetation patterns over large areas for resource conservation planning, and to predict the effects of environmental change on vegetation distributions. Predictive vegetation mapping has advanced over the past two decades especially in conjunction with the development of remote sensing-based vegetation mapping and digital geographic information analysis. A number of statistical and, more recently, machine-learning methods have been used to develop and implement predictive vegetation models.

AB  - Biodiversity hotspots at the global and national scale have contributed important information for biodiversity conservation; however, in hotspot designation two kinds of "gap" greatly limit conservation planning, which this study identifies as the "scale gap" and the "conservation gap". To address the gap, we integrated systematic conservation planning (SCP) with gap analysis to optimize solutions of protected areas planning at local scales. In this study, we presented a quantitative spatial methodology for prioritization and downscaled to a planning case study in the province of Shanxi, China. First, the spatial distribution of 54 threatened plant species were mapped at fine resolution, and scenarios of conservation targets for taxa were generated according to species attributes, which are both the necessary inputs in selection algorithm of priority conservation. Then we determined 17 priority conservation areas using SCP, which only cover 5% of the total area but could represent 100% of the threatened plant species in Shanxi Province. We confirmed that priority conservation areas determined based on SCP can achieve maximum efficiency of conservation, especially considering representation of small-ranged species. Further, through overlapping priority conservation areas with nature reserves, six conservation gaps were identified for future conservation efforts. Our findings provide suggestions for protected areas network planning of botanical conservation in real-world contexts. The proposed method of integrating SCP with gap analysis can be generally used in bridging the gap between biodiversity priority areas and protected areas in proactive planning and management protocol for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Biomass and species diversity (richness and evenness) of littoral organisms were explored in 27 sites in three basins of the large Lake Saimaa system in eastern Finland. The basins differed in degree of nutrient loading and trophic status. Six organismal groups, i.e., phytoplankton, periphyton, macrophytes, crustacean zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish were studied. Factors affecting the biomass and diversity of these groups were explored by multiple stepwise regression analysis. The biomass of different groups was explained by the same variables, mainly nutrients, while diversity was associated with different environmental factors among the studied groups. The biomass of periphyton, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish correlated significantly with each other. There was also an apparent association between the biomass of macrophytes and that of benthic invertebrates. However, no significant correlations were found among the diversity of the studied groups. In accordance with previous studies, our results did not support the existence of species-rich hotspots or the possibility of using any surrogate taxon to reveal overall biodiversity. Thus, for conservation planning, biological surveys should include extensive collection of taxonomic groups and organisms at all trophic levels.

AB  - One of the key purposes of conservation selection strategies is to design a network of sites to support relevant biodiversity components and, therefore, decrease the risk of populations becoming isolated. To this end, it is important to be aware of the habitat locations of the target species and the threats of human activities, in order to identify areas of a high conservation priority. This paper takes the Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province (Iran) as a case study, to highlight a network optimization for six target species of conservation concern, including the Persian leopard, Panthera pardus Pocock, wild sheep, Ovis orientalis Gmelin and wild goat, Capra aegagrus Erxleben. To run the optimization, we first generated the following input data: we modelled suitable habitats, using the InVEST model (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) and simulated the ecological impact of road networks (Spatial Road Disturbance Index (SPROADI), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the Landscape Ecological Risk Index (ERI)). A visual inspection of the input data revealed that a large percentage of the study area constitutes a suitable habitat for the target species, however, the disturbances caused by the road demonstrate that the central and north-eastern regions of the study area are significantly affected. Indeed, approximately 10% and 25% of the study area are in the high and medium risk categories, respectively. Optimization using Marxan, shows that the north-western and southern regions of the study area should be given high conservation priority, necessary for an efficient conservation network. Habitats located in the north-central region should act as stepping-stone areas or corridors between the isolated regions in the north-east and the wellconnected areas in the north-west and south. Overall, the findings of the present study show that the current network of protected areas is not contradictory to that suggested by Marxan, but has deficiencies in terms of size and stepping-stones.

AB  - Most habitat models developed for defining priority conservation sites target areas currently exhibiting suitable habitat conditions. For species whose habitats have been altered by land use practices, these models may fail to identify sites with the potential of producing suitable habitats, if management practices were modified. Using capercaillie Tetrao urogallus as an example, we propose a model for evaluating the potential of ecological conditions at the landscape level to provide suitable habitat at the local scale. Initially, we evaluated the influence of selected landscape parameters on the structural characteristics of vegetation relevant to capercaillie. Then we used capercaillie presence data and an ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) to identify landscape and land use variables relevant to capercaillie habitat selection. We also studied the effect of scale on predictive model quality. Despite high variance, correlations between landscape variables and forest structure were detected. The greatest influence on forest structure was recorded for climate and soil conditions, which were also found to be the best predictors of capercaillie habitat selection in the ENFA. The final model, retaining only two landscape variables (soil conditions and days with snow) and three land use variables (proportion of forest, distance to roads and forest-agricultural borders), explained a high degree of capercaillie habitat selection, even before considering patch size and connectivity. By restricting the analyses to areas with stable subpopulations and a set of relatively stable landscape variables capable of explaining habitat quality at a local scale, we were able to identify areas with long-term relevance to conservation of capercaillie.

AB  - Restoration of native vegetation is required in many regions of the world, but determining priority locations for revegetation is a complex problem. We consider the problem of determining spatial and temporal priorities for revegetation to maximize habitat for 62 bird species within a heavily cleared agricultural region, 11 000 km(2) in area. We show how a reserve-selection framework can be applied to a complex, large-scale restoration-planning problem to account for multi-species objectives and connectivity requirements at a spatial extent and resolution relevant to management. Our approach explicitly accounts for time lags in planting and development of habitat resources, which is intended to avoid future population bottlenecks caused by delayed provision of critical resources, such as tree hollows. We coupled species-specific models of expected habitat quality and fragmentation effects with the dynamics of habitat suitability following replanting to produce species-specific maps for future times. Spatial priorities for restoration were determined by ranking locations (150-m grid cells) by their expected contribution to species habitat through time using the conservation planning tool, "Zonation.'' We evaluated solutions by calculating expected trajectories of habitat availability for each species. We produced a spatially explicit revegetation schedule for the region that resulted in a balanced increase in habitat for all species. Priority areas for revegetation generally were clustered around existing vegetation, although not always. Areas on richer soils and with high rainfall were more highly ranked, reflecting their potential to support high-quality habitats that have been disproportionately cleared for agriculture. Accounting for delayed development of habitat resources altered the rank-order of locations in the derived revegetation plan and led to improved expected outcomes for fragmentation-sensitive species. This work demonstrates the potential for systematic restoration planning at large scales that accounts for multiple objectives, which is urgently needed by land and natural resource managers.

AB  - Evaluating bird population trends requires baseline data. In, North America the earliest population data available are those from the late 1960s. Forest conditions in the northern Great Lake states (U.S.A.), however, have undergone succession since the region was originally cut over around the turn of the twentieth century, and it is expected that bird populations have undergone concomitant change. We propose pre-Euro-American settlement as an alternative baseline for assessing changes in bird populations. We evaluated the amount, quality, and distribution of breeding bird habitat during the mid-1800s and early 1990s for three forest birds. the Pine Warbler (Dendroica pinus), Blackburnian Warbler (D. fusca), and Black-throated Green Warbler (D. virens). We constructed models of bird and habitat relationships based on literature review and regional data sets of bird abundance and applied these models to widely available vegetation data. Original public-land survey records represented historical habitat conditions, and a combination of forest inventory and national land-cover data represented current conditions. We assessed model robustness by comparing current habitat distribution to actual breeding bird locations from the Wisconsin Breeding Bird Atlas. The model showed little change in the overall amount of Pine Warbler habitat, whereas both the Blackburnian Warber and the Black-throated Green Warbler have experienced substantial habitat losses. For the species we examined, habitat quality has degraded since presettlement and the spatial distribution of habitat shifted among ecoregions, with range expansion accompanying forest incursion into previously open habitats or The replacement of native forests with pine plantations. Sources of habitat loss and degradation include loss of conifers and loss of large trees. Using widely available data sources in a habitat suitability model framework, our method provides a long-term analysis of change in bird habitat and a presettlement baseline for assessing current conservation priority.

AB  - Rapid anthropogenic climate change is a major threat to ocean biodiversity, increasing the challenge for marine conservation. Strategic conservation planning, and more recently marine spatial planning (MSP) are among the most promising management tools to operationalize and enforce marine conservation. As yet, climate change is seldom incorporated into these plans, potentially curtailing the effectiveness of designated conservation areas under novel environmental conditions. Reliable assessment of current and future climate change threats requires the ability to map climate-driven eco-evolutionary changes and the identification of vulnerable and resistant populations. Here we explore the heretofore largely unrecognized value of information gained from physiological, ecological and evolutionary studies to MSP under ongoing climate change. For example, we explore how climate threats do not necessarily follow latitudinal gradients, such that both risk hotspots and refugia occur in mosaic distributions along species ranges - patterns that may be undetectable without knowledge of biological vulnerabilities at regional and local scales. Because co-occurring species can exhibit markedly different vulnerabilities to the same environmental changes, making ecological predictions requires, when possible, measuring the fundamental niches of key species (e.g., with the use of thermotolerance experiments). Forecasting also requires development of tools to identify the likelihood of community-level thresholds or tipping points (e.g., with the use of near-real world mesocosms), and assessment of the potential of populations for adaptation (e.g., with common garden experiments). Such research will facilitate better predictive models for the fate of populations, species, ecosystems and their functions. Ultimately, unfolding the complexity of the processes underlying climate change impacts will facilitate quantifying and reducing uncertainty in spatial planning decision processes and will enable the development of practical tools to validate adaptive conservation strategies.

AB  - In France, the white-clawed crayfish (Austropotomabius pallipes) is more and more restricted to head-water river systems and connections between residual populations are increasingly limited. In conservation biology, to address the question of habitat suitability, it is necessary to know if this species functions in a metapopulational context. At present, many studies on habitat are restricted to water parameters. This six-year study on a small forest brook in Normandy (Western France) deals with the quality of a population and its functional stability, using biomass dynamics to assess the patch suitability. A good quality of residual populations appears crucial in constructing conservation reserves, before restoring the connectivity. Upstream, the scarcity of favourable habitats limited the carrying capacity for young-of-the-year. The shallow slope accentuated the temporary deposition of sediments due to forestry activities, which lead to a temporary ecological trap effect. Although this zone should be a population sink, instead it presumably became a source of juveniles for the downstream zone. Downstream, the complexity of the area lead to three times the mean density found upstream, but with a higher inter-annual variability. The production levels were stable in time, as shown by the P/B ratios that reflected processes of compensation and functional regulation. This parameter may be the best indicator of habitat suitability and the population qualities required for conservation planning. The compensating features observed between the two zones made up for the annual variability in vital rates, i.e.: low density and better growth upstream, high density and weaker growth downstream. This leads to a certain stability of the population in the brook as a whole. Therefore, the brook seems to function in a metapopulational context at the local level, representing a patch of sufficient size to buffer local random variation and ensure preservation of the species.

AB  - In a scenario where escalating human activities lead to several environmental changes and, consequently, affect mammal abundance and distribution, beta-diversity may increase due to differences among sites. Using the ecological uniqueness approach, we analyzed beta-diversity patterns of ground-dwelling mammal communities recorded through comprehensive camera trap monitoring within eight tropical forests protected areas in Mesoamerica and South America under variable landscape contexts. We aimed to investigate whether the contribution of single sites (LCBD) and single species (SCBD) to overall beta-diversity could be explained by community metrics and environmental variables, and by species metrics and biological traits, respectively. Total beta-diversity was also partitioned into species replacement and richness difference. We related LCBD to species richness, total relative abundance, functional indices, and environmental variables (tree basal area, protected area size, NDVI, and precipitation seasonality), and SCBD to species naive occupancy, relative abundance, and morphoecological traits via beta regression. Our findings showed that LCBD was primarily explained by variation in species richness, rather than relative abundance and functional metrics. Protected area size and tree basal area were also important in explaining variation in LCBD. SCBD was strongly related to naive occupancy and relative abundance, but not to biological traits, such as body mass, trophic energy level, activity cycle, and taxonomic category. Local II diversity was a result of species replacements and to a lesser extent differences in species richness. Our approach was useful in examining and comparing the ecological uniqueness among different sites, revealing the regional scale current status of mammal diversity. High LCBD values comprised sites embedded within smaller habitat extents, hosting lower tree basal areas, and harboring low species richness. SCBD showed that relatively ubiquitous species that occur at variable abundances across sites contributed most to II-diversity. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate and land-cover changes are major threats to biodiversity, and their impacts are expected to intensify in the future. Protected areas (PAs) are crucial for biodiversity conservation. However, their effectiveness under future climate and land-cover changes remains to be evaluated. Moreover, the impacts of climate and land-cover changes on multi-dimensions of biodiversity are rarely considered when expanding PAs. Using distributions of 8,732 woody species in China and species distribution models, we identified species that will be threatened by future climate and land-cover changes (i.e. species with significant projected loss of suitable habitats by the 2070s) under different dispersal scenarios. We then estimated the geographical patterns in species richness (SR) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) of threatened species, evaluated the effectiveness (i.e. the changes in SR and PD) of Chinese PAs and identified conservation priorities for future PA expansion. Approximately 12%-38% of woody species will be threatened under different scenarios. These species tend to be clustered in the tree of life, and their SR and PD show consistent spatial patterns, being highest at low latitudes. PAs currently protect 90% of threatened species. However, their SR and PD of threatened species within PAs will decrease by 30%-40% by the 2070s, which reduces the PA effectiveness, especially for PAs at low elevations and those with low topographic heterogeneity and high natural vegetation loss. The conservation priorities identified from the SR and PD of the threatened species are mainly in mountains in southern China, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and Taiwan Island. PA expansion and ecological corridors in these regions are needed to conserve threatened species. Synthesis and applications. We present a systematic study of the impacts of future climate and land-cover changes on the conservation status of woody species and PA effectiveness in China. Our results suggest that future climate and land-cover changes will reduce PA effectiveness, and the spatial prioritization of biodiversity conservation should consider the influences of future global changes on biodiversity. These results shed new light on the conservation priorities for the post-2020 expansion of PAs in China.

AB  - The importance of the spatial as well as the temporal structure of habitat patches for urban biodiversity has been recognised, but rarely quantified. In dynamic environments the rate of habitat destruction and recreation (i.e. the landscape turnover rate), the minimum amount of potential habitat, its spatial configuration as well as the environmental conditions determining habitat quality are crucial factors for species occurrence. We analysed species responses to environmental parameters and to the spatio-temporal configuration of urban brownfield habitats in a multi-species approach (37 plant and 43 insect species). Species presence/absence data and soil parameters, site age, vegetation structure and landscape context were recorded by random stratified sampling at 133 study plots in industrial areas in the city of Bremen (Germany). Based on the field data, we predicted species occurrences by species distribution models using a multi-model inference approach. Predicted species communities were driven by successional age both at the scale of a single building lot and at the landscape scale. Minimum average succession time of brownfield habitats required to support all and especially regionally rare species depended on the proportion of available open space; the larger the potential habitat area the faster the acceptable turnover. Most plant, grasshopper, and leafhopper species modelled could be maintained at an intermediate turnover rate (mean age of 10-15 years) and a proportion of open sites of at least 40%. Our modelling approach provides the opportunity of inferring optimal spatio-temporal landscape configurations for urban conservation management from patch scale species-environment relationships. The results indicate that urban planning should incorporate land use dynamics into the management of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) play a critical role in conserving biodiversity and maintaining viable populations of threatened species. Yet, as global change could reduce the future effectiveness of existing PAs in covering high species richness, updating the boundaries of existing PAs or creating new ones might become necessary to uphold conservation goals. Modelling tools are increasingly used by policymakers to support the spatial prioritization of biodiversity conservation, enabling the inclusion of scenarios of environmental changes to achieve specific targets. Here, using the Western Swiss Alps as a case study, we show how integrating species richness derived from species distribution model predictions for four taxonomic groups under present and future climate and land-use conditions into two conservation prioritization schemes can help optimize extant and future PAs. The first scheme, the "Priority Scores Method" identified priority areas for the expansion of the existing PA network. The second scheme, using the zonation software, allowed identifying priority conservation areas while incorporating global change scenarios and political costs. We found that existing mountain PAs are currently not situated in the most environmentally nor politically suitable locations when maximizing alpha diversity for the studied taxonomic groups and that current PAs could become even less optimum under the future climate and land-use change scenarios. This analysis has focused on general areas of high species richness or species of conservation concern and did not account for special habitats or functional groups that could have been used to create the existing network. We conclude that such an integrated framework could support more effective conservation planning and could be similarly applied to other landscapes or other biodiversity conservation indices.

AB  - Several biodiversity features can be linked to landscape heterogeneity, that, in turn, can be informative for management and conservation purposes. Usually, the more the landscape is complex the more the biodiversity increases. Biodiversity indicators can be a useful tool to assess biodiversity status, in function of landscape heterogeneity. In this study, we developed a biodiversity indicator, based on Shannon diversity index and built from distribution maps of protected species. With such an approach, we seek to evaluate the feasibility of using a combination of target species as a surrogate for assessing the status of the whole bird community. Our approach was spread over multiple spatial scales, to determine which was the most informative. We selected four species protected by European regulation and generated a presence-absence map from species distribution modelling. We, therefore, used the FRAGSTATS biodiversity metric to calculate Shannon index for the overlapped presence-absence maps, at two spatial scales (500 m and 1000 m). Then, the relationships with the whole community was assessed through generalised least square models, at the spatial scale of 4 ha, 9 ha and 25 ha. Results showed that the higher rate of variability of community was explained by the biodiversity indicator at 1000 m scale. Indeed, the more informative spatial scale for the whole bird community was 9 ha. In addition, a pattern emerged about the relationships between biodiversity indicator and community richness, that is worth of further research. Our study demonstrates that the usefulness of surrogate species for biodiversity and community assessment can become clear only at a certain spatial scales. Indeed, they can be highly predictive of the whole community, and highly informative for conservation planning. Moreover, their use can optimize biodiversity monitoring and conservation, focusing on a small number of noteworthy species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the vulnerability of tree species to anthropogenic threats is important for the efficient planning of restoration and conservation efforts. We quantified and compared the effects of future climate change and four current threats (fire, habitat conversion, overgrazing and overexploitation) on the 50 most common tree species of the tropical dry forests of northwestern Peru and southern Ecuador. We used an ensemble modelling approach to predict species distribution ranges, employed freely accessible spatial datasets to map threat exposures, and developed a trait-based scoring approach to estimate species-specific sensitivities, using differentiated trait weights in accordance with their expected importance in determining species sensitivities to specific threats. Species-specific vulnerability maps were constructed from the product of the exposure maps and the sensitivity estimates. We found that all 50 species face considerable threats, with an average of 46% of species' distribution ranges displaying high or very high vulnerability to at least one of the five threats. Our results suggest that current levels of habitat conversion, overexploitation and overgrazing pose larger threats to most of the studied species than climate change. We present a spatially explicit planning strategy for species-specific restoration and conservation actions, proposing management interventions to focus on (a) in situ conservation of tree populations and seed collection for tree planting activities in areas with low vulnerability to climate change and current threats; (b) ex situ conservation or translocation of populations in areas with high climate change vulnerability; and (c) active planting or assisted regeneration in areas under high current threat vulnerability but low climate change vulnerability, provided that interventions are in place to lower threat pressure. We provide an online, user-friendly tool to visualize both the vulnerability maps and the maps indicating priority restoration and conservation actions.

AB  - AimInterest in species distribution models (SDMs) and related niche studies has increased dramatically in recent years, with several books and reviews being prepared since 2000. The earliest SDM studies are dealt with only briefly even in the books. Consequently, many researchers are unaware of when the first SDM software package (bioclim) was developed and how a broad range of applications using the package was explored within the first 8years following its release. The purpose of this study is to clarify these early developments and initial applications, as well as to highlight bioclim's continuing relevance to current studies.
   LocationMainly Australia and New Zealand, but also some global applications.
   MethodsWe outline the development of the bioclim package, early applications (1984-1991) and its current relevance.
   Resultsbioclim was the first SDM package to be widely used. Early applications explored many of the possible uses of SDMs in conservation biogeography, such as quantifying the environmental niche of species, identifying areas where a species might be invasive, assisting conservation planning and assessing the likely impacts of climate change on species distributions.
   Main conclusionsUnderstanding this pioneering work is worthwhile as bioclim was for many years one of the leading SDM packages and remains widely used. Climate interpolation methods developed for bioclim were used to create the WorldClim database, the most common source of climate data for SDM studies, and bioclim variables are used in about 76% of recent published MaxEnt analyses of terrestrial ecosystems. Also, some of the bioclim studies from the late 1980s, such as measuring niche (both realized and fundamental) and assessing possible impacts of climate change, are still highly relevant to key conservation biogeography issues.

AB  - The significant shortfall in global marine protection targets is likely to continue to drive rapid growth in marine protected areas (MPAs). Systematic conservation planning to fill gaps in marine protection requires sufficient knowledge of both the distribution of biodiversity and the threats to species and ecosystems. Yet such data are lacking for much of the marine environment, creating significant challenges for planning effective marine protection. In the absence of habitat mapping data, critical environmental variables associated with species' distributions can be used to model the spatial distribution of different environments. Although this approach has been used in some jurisdictions to assist MPA planners, the increased availability and resolution of spatial data now provide an opportunity to improve assessments of MPA representation. Capitalizing on advances in spatial data, this study uses a range of biological and physical environmental attributes to model the distribution of Australian marine environments. Given many Australian MPAs were implemented without knowledge of the distribution of species and benthic habitats, this Bio-physical model is used to assess MPA coverage and equality of protection for Australian marine environments. Results of the Bio-physical model revealed that Australian MPAs overrepresent warm, offshore waters (such as the Coral Sea) and underrepresent temperate environments. Furthermore, the distribution of protection in Australian MPAs is heavily skewed, with no-take protection disproportionately targeting tropical environments, leaving major gaps in the protection of both temperate and nearshore habitats. Without comprehensive habitat mapping, the representativeness and adequacy of an MPA system cannot be accurately evaluated, nor can the required expansion of MPAs be planned effectively. In the interim, the biological and physical attributes chosen for this model provide useful proxies to assist in efforts to better target current and future protection based on the most up-to-date knowledge.

AB  - Increasing human activity along the coast has amplified the extinction risk of inshore delphinids. Informed selection and prioritisation of areas for the conservation of inshore delphinids requires a comprehensive understanding of their distribution and habitat use. In this study, we applied an ensemble species distribution modelling approach, combining results of six modelling algorithms to identify areas of high probability of occurrence of the globally Vulnerable Australian humpback dolphin in northern Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), north-western Australia. Model outputs were based on sighting data collected during systematic, boat-based surveys between 2013 and 2015, and in relation to various ecogeographic variables. Water depth and distance to coast were identified as the most important variables influencing dolphin presence, with dolphins showing a preference for shallow waters (5-15 m) less than 2 km from the coast. Areas of high probability (>0.6) of dolphin occurrence were primarily (90%) in multiple use areas where extractive human activities are permitted, and were poorly represented in sanctuary (no-take) zones. This spatial mismatch emphasises the need to reassess for future spatial planning and marine park management plan reviews for NMP. Shallow, coastal waters identified here should be considered priority areas for the conservation of this Vulnerable species.

AB  - Analyses of animal species distribution in a neutral or minimally-interrupted habitat provide a baseline that is essential for assessment of population status, identification of key habitat, and conservation planning for habitat protection and restoration. In this study, we surveyed the occurrence of the Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) and corresponding habitat characteristics, including bathymetry, benthic slope and fish resources, in the newly established He-wang-miao reserve. Based on sightings from field surveys, the extent of occurrence of the finless porpoise was 9.532 km(2). General linear model analysis indicated the distribution of the finless porpoise was influenced by water depth and fish density. Habitat preference analysis illustrated a proxy to identify key habitat for the finless porpoise: moderate water depth (between 7 m and 12 m), flat benthic slope (lower than 2) and moderately-high fish density (0.6 ind/m(3) and 1.2 ind/m(3)). We proposed that this proxy has great potential for conservation planning to identify habitat conservation priorities in the Yangtze River and to guide management actions such as ex situ reserve selection and habitat restoration.

AB  - The historic and contemporary distribution for the Psittacidae family in Mexico using the greatest database assembled until now was estimated. The ecological niche models were generated with the MaxEnt algorithm. Temperature and precipitation were used, as well as an analysis of vegetation and availability of protected areas established until 2015. The models did not present omission errors and allow to have updated estimates for each species. The species with the greatest potential distribution was Amazona albifrons, and Amazona auropalliata had the smallest one. The results indicate that all the species have lost suitable habitat area, especially Ara macao, Amazona auropalliata and A. oratrix. Although tropical forests are present on most species distributions, temperate forests had a high cover percentage for 6 species. The proportion of protected area for each species was higher when compared with previous estimates from the year 2000. The precise estimate of the distribution of Mexican Psittacidae has international conservation implications, as 6 species are endemic and 4 species may present their greater potential distribution in Mexico according to IUCN information. Due to habitat loss some species have a high vulnerability, present and future, making it necessary to examine the relationship between environmental suitability and patterns of population abundance. The use of ecological niche models to evaluate distributional changes associated with climate change may be also necessary.

AB  - Objectives: Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are used to produce predictions of potential Leguminosae diversity in West Central Africa. Those predictions are evaluated subsequently using expert opinion. The established methodology of combining all SDMs is refined to assess species diversity within five defined vegetation types. Potential species diversity is thus predicted for each vegetation type respectively. The primary aim of the new methodology is to define, in more detail, areas of species richness for conservation planning.
   Methodology: Using Maxent, SDMs based on a suite of 14 environmental predictors were generated for 185 West Central African Leguminosae species, each categorised according to one of five vegetation types: Afromontane, coastal, non-flooded forest, open formations, or riverine forest. The relative contribution of each environmental variable was compared between different vegetation types using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis followed by a post-hoc Kruskal-Wallis Paired Comparison contrast. Legume species diversity patterns were explored initially using the typical method of stacking all SDMs. Subsequently, five different ensemble models were generated by partitioning SDMs according to vegetation category. Ecological modelers worked with legume specialists to improve data integrity and integrate expert opinion in the interpretation of individual species models and potential species richness predictions for different vegetation types.
   Results/Conclusions: Of the 14 environmental predictors used, five showed no difference in their relative contribution to the different vegetation models. Of the nine discriminating variables, the majority were related to temperature variation. The set of variables that played a major role in the Afromontane species diversity model differed significantly from the sets of variables of greatest relative important in other vegetation categories. The traditional approach of stacking all SDMs indicated overall centers of diversity in the region but the maps indicating potential species richness by vegetation type offered more detailed information on which conservation efforts can be focused.

AB  - The importance of targeting ecological and evolutionary processes in reserve design has been widely acknowledged in the literature but rarely implemented on islands. Using Socotran reptiles as models, we aim to relate richness of widespread and restricted-range species directly with landscape variables and to compare the impact of setting conservation targets for lineages versus species. Socotra Island is a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, containing high levels of endemism in relation to its area, especially of reptiles, the vertebrates with the most comprehensive available genetic data. We predicted the occurrences of reptile species using distribution models and used a novel approach to interpolate maps of spatial phylogenetic patterns. Patterns of intra and interspecifc diversity and differences between spatial outputs of lineage and species richness were related to eco-geographic variables. We evaluated differences in target achievement for each conservation unit within protected areas (PAs) under the current Zoning Plan (ZP) using gap and reserve design analyses. Although intraspecific richness was strongly correlated with interspecific richness, differences in their spatial distribution reached similar to 30% in some areas. Differences were more pronounced for wide-ranging than restricted-range taxa. Gap analysis indicates that most conservation units are under-represented in sanctuaries and that intra and interspecific richness were significantly higher outside PAs. This work will guide local-scale conservation planning as the ZP is due to be re-evaluated. This is one of the few studies on islands using genetic data from an entire class of vertebrates to incorporate lineage diversity in reserve design. This study provides an alternative methodological framework for supporting the use of landscape and genetic tools in reserve design, circumventing the use of phylogenetic distances and deterministic spatial interpolation of lineage diversity that can be widely applied to other systems.

AB  - Phylogenetically closely related species are often assumed to have similar responses to environmental conditions, but species-specific responses have also been described. These two scenarios may have different conservation implications. We tested these two hypotheses for Prionailurus cats (P. rubiginosus, P. bengalensis, P. viverrinus) in the Indian subcontinent and show its implications on species current protected area coverage and climatic suitability trends through time. We fitted ecological niche models with current environmental conditions and calculated niche overlap. In addition, we developed a model for the Jungle Cat Felis chaus to compare species responses and niche overlap estimates within Prionailurus with those for a related sympatric small cat species. Then we estimated the proportion of current suitable environment covered by protected area and projected climatic models from past (last interglacial) to future (2070; RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) conditions to show implications on population management and conservation. The hypothesis of a similar response and niche overlap among closely related species is not supported. Protected area coverage was lowest for P. viverrinus (mean=0.071, SD=0.012) and highest for P. bengalensis (mean=0.088, SD=0.006). In addition, the proportion of the subcontinent with suitable climate varied through time and was species-specific. For P. bengalensis, climatic suitability shrunk since at least the mid-Holocene, a trend that can be intensified by human-induced climate warming. Concerning P. viverrinus, most predictions show stable future climatic suitability, but a few indicated potential loss. Climatic suitability for P. rubiginous was predicted to remain stable but the species exhibited a negative association with intensive agriculture. Similar responses to environmental change by phylogenetically closely related species should not be assumed and have implications on protected area coverage and natural trends of species climatic suitability over time. This should be taken into account during conservation and management actions.

AB  - Climate envelope models are widely used to describe potential future distribution of species under different climate change scenarios. It is broadly recognized that there are both strengths and limitations to using climate envelope models and that outcomes are sensitive to initial assumptions, inputs, and modeling methods Selection of predictor variables, a central step in modeling, is one of the areas where different techniques can yield varying results. Selection of climate variables to use as predictors is often done using statistical approaches that develop correlations between occurrences and climate data. These approaches have received criticism in that they rely on the statistical properties of the data rather than directly incorporating biological information about species responses to temperature and precipitation. We evaluated and compared models and prediction maps for 15 threatened or endangered species in Florida based on two variable selection techniques: expert opinion and a statistical method. We compared model performance between these two approaches for contemporary predictions, and the spatial correlation, spatial overlap and area predicted for contemporary and future climate predictions. In general, experts identified more variables as being important than the statistical method and there was low overlap in the variable sets (<40%) between the two methods Despite these differences in variable sets (expert versus statistical), models had high performance metrics (>0.9 for area under the curve (AUC) and >0.7 for true skill statistic (TSS). Spatial overlap, which compares the spatial configuration between maps constructed using the different variable selection techniques, was only moderate overall (about 60%), with a great deal of variability across species. Difference in spatial overlap was even greater under future climate projections, indicating additional divergence of model outputs from different variable selection techniques. Our work is in agreement with other studies which have found that for broad-scale species distribution modeling, using statistical methods of variable selection is a useful first step, especially when there is a need to model a large number of species or expert knowledge of the species is limited. Expert input can then be used to refine models that seem unrealistic or for species that experts believe are particularly sensitive to change. It also emphasizes the importance of using multiple models to reduce uncertainty and improve map outputs for conservation planning. Where outputs overlap or show the same direction of change there is greater certainty in the predictions. Areas of disagreement can be used for learning by asking why the models do not agree, and may highlight areas where additional on-the-ground data collection could improve the models.

AB  - Ponds are among the most diverse and yet threatened components of freshwater biodiversity. The conservation of ponds would greatly benefit from the identification of surrogate taxa in preliminary assessments aimed at detecting ponds of potentially high biodiversity value. Here, we used predictive co-correspondence analysis (Co-CA) to quantify the strength of plant species composition and plant community types in predicting multivariate patterns in water beetle assemblages, based on data from 54 farmland ponds in Ireland. The predictive accuracy of a number of environmental variables as well as that of plant diversity (species richness and evenness) was calculated using predictive canonical correspondence analysis (CCA-PLS). The study ponds supported over 30% of the Irish water beetle fauna (76 species), with five species having some form of IUCN Red List Status in Ireland, as well as 67 wetland plant species, including a nationally rare one. Co-CA showed that plant species composition had a positive predictive accuracy, which was significantly higher compared to that of data at the plant community type level. Although environmental variables showed a higher predictive capacity compared to that of plant species composition, the difference was not significant. Explanatory CCA analyses showed that plants and beetles both responded to the same subset of environmental conditions, which explained approximately 18% of the variation in both plant and beetle species composition. Regional differences as well as permanency, substratum, and grazing intensity affected the composition of both plant and beetle assemblages. These findings have important implications in conservation planning. First, wetland plants can be effectively used as a surrogate taxon in the identification of conservation-priority ponds. Second, conservation strategies aimed at maintaining and enhancing pond biodiversity should be based on considerations on plant species composition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We described potential changes in the geographic distribution and occurrence probability of Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc. and Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. et Maxim.) Maxim. in the counties of northeast China. This information was used to identify priority areas for protection and provide protection and management recommendations within each studied county. The two species were mapped in 2884 study plots throughout this region over a 4-year period (38A degrees 40'N-53A degrees 30'N, 115A degrees 05'E-135A degrees 02'E). We used the species distribution models (Maxent), systematic conservation planning models (Marxan), and Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS 10.0). The distributions of two species were correlated in the study area, enabling unique and economically viable joint conservation measures to be implemented. Three models were combined to identify feasible priority conservation sites. We used local spatial statistics to assess all identified conservation areas in relation to potential climate change based shifts in the geographic distribution of the two species. Model-based conservation strategies were used to identify effective measures to protect and utilize these two tree species in the study region. This study presents a novel technique for assessing wild plant distributions, in addition to serving as a model for the conservation of other species within the framework of general forest management, ecological construction, and geographical surveying.

AB  - The Bale Mountains of Ethiopia contain the largest contiguous area of alpine habitat in Africa. The region provides critical water resources and other essential environmental services to highland communities, endemic wildlife, and millions of downstream people in East Africa. Increasing land use change has created concern over degradation to headwater wetlands and potential impacts on hydrologic regimes. Baseline understanding of wetland dynamics is lacking, however, and little is known about their function in the regional hydrologic system. We used remote sensing, machine learning, and field surveys to map the distribution of Afroalpine wetlands in the Bale Mountains. We developed a wetland typology based on hydrogeomorphic characteristics and a conceptual model of surface-groundwater flow. Our results show that wetland extent more than doubles between wet and dry seasons and that only 4 percent of the Afroalpine zone is saturated year-round. We also found evidence of a hydrologic continuum based on volcanic and glacial legacies, with wetlands at elevations above approximately 3,800 m asl likely to be ephemeral and wetlands at lower elevations tending to be perennial. Further interpretation suggests that local geology is a principal control on wetland distribution and hydrologic attenuation in the Bale Mountains. This lays the foundation for further research into surface-groundwater connectivity, climate change impacts, and conservation planning. Key Words: Afroalpine, Ethiopian highlands, HGM classification, mountain water tower, tropical alpine.

AB  - We tested the prediction that climate-driven changes might alter bird species composition in reserves of the Cerrado region of Brazil. First, we modelled the current distributions and the potential future projections of 38 endemic or rare bird species. We used eight modelling techniques within the BIOMOD computational framework in an ensemble-forecasting approach to reach a consensus scenario. Then we compared current and future (2046-2060) distributions under different scenarios (reserve size and bird dispersal) with the current Brazilian reserve system to assess the adequacy of protection (representation) of each species and detect gaps in their protection. Finally, to identify areas with high probability of occurrence of several species, we calculated cumulative climatic suitability of all 38 species for both current and future scenarios. None of the 38 species is covered under any current or future scenarios, revealing that the current reserve system is highly inefficient in conserving the analyzed bird species. The implementation of new reserves to cover species in current and future climate scenarios is recommended in areas in the south-eastern part of the Cerrado region and in the mountains of east Brazil. Due to the already high land use of the southeast region of the Cerrado, the application of non-traditional conservation measures should be evaluated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of statistical models to predict the distribution of marine species is becoming an increasingly important tool in conservation planning and fisheries management. In this study, we first aim at testing the relevance of a hybrid methodological approach that combines Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and Regression Kriging (RK) to predict distribution of marine species.
   We exemplify this approach by modelling the spatial distribution of 27 commercial marine species based on bottom trawls survey data carried out in the Gulf of Gabes. Then, the model outputs were used for the identification of areas required to meet the conservation targets of Artificial Anti-trawling Reefs. To do so, we proposed a fuzzy logic framework that allows accounting for the uncertainly arising from different model predictions. For each species, the model predictive accuracy was classified as 'high' with a mean AUC and Kappa criterion of 0.90 and 0.72, respectively. A better result was observed when a large number of occurrences are used to develop the model. When confirmed absences data are not available, we recommend the use of this method combining ENFA and RK predictions to deal with the imperfect ability to detect a species and to incorporate spatial dependence in predictions. The map resulting from the fuzzy overlay shows three main areas with a high conservation criterion, which is in agreement with ecological expert knowledge, and hence confirms the relevance of the proposed methodology.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that topographic/soil gradient and ecological succession are the main factors driving the high tree diversity in a protected area in Amazonia/Cerrado transition. The gradient is a slope composed by savanna-like vegetation of rocky cerrado on the top, typical and dense savanna cerrado in the middle, and cerradao ecotonal forest in the bottom. The ecological succession is a result of Cerrado encroachment when protected from fire. The cerradao and dense cerrado were associated to higher values of clay, silt, Mg and organic matter, whereas the typical and rocky cerrado were the opposite, with highest sand, altitude and Al. The PCA analysis revealed 73% of the influence of such habitat conditions in the species distribution along the slope. The most important determinants of species distribution are the topography and soil properties, specially texture, organic matter and concentrations of Mg. The species richness was higher in the dense and typical cerrado (intermediate slope), probably due to the mutual influence of the top flora of rocky cerrado and the lower gradient flora of cerradao. The influences of topography and soil texture is probably related to the water availability, where the sandy soil and full drainage in the top of the slope provide less water supply to the vegetation (rocky cerrado) compared to the bottom (cerradao). Patches of fire-protected Cerrado encroachment are common in Bacaba Park, with forest and savanna species coexisting. The substitutions of species across space and time, corroborates our hypothesis about the successional and topographic/edaphic variations acting as the main determinant of high tree diversity in the protected area.

AB  - Identifying and improving the existing ecological security patterns (ESPs) are of great importance to promoting ecological security and achieving sustainable development goals. The Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR) is an area with a sensitive, fragile, and complex ecological environment in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River. The construction of ESPs for the TGRR is significant for maintaining regional ecosystem stability and promoting peaceful coexistence between humans and nature. The main objective of the study is to identify the ecological nodes, ecological corridors, and ecological sources that play essential roles in the ecosystem. Based on land use data and human interference factors, we have evaluated the current habitat quality using the InVEST model and identified vital ecological sources for the TGRR. The negative exponential transformation function was used to convert habitat suitability into a landscape resistance layer. Circuit theory modeling was utilized to identify ecological corridors, and the final ESPs of the TGRR were then constructed. Results showed that (a) the spatial distribution of habitat varied significantly in the TGRR. The optimal habitats were concentrated in the northeast, east, and southwest, accounting for 45.98% of the total suitable habitats; (b) habitat quality varied through space, with habitat quality being higher in the northeast and lower in the western regions. (c) Ecological sources were distributed primarily in the forests with high vegetation coverage in the east. The total area of ecological sources was about 15,412 km(2), approximately accounting for 34% of the study area; (d) the ESPs were dominated by ecological sources composed of forests, which were radially connected by ecological corridors. In total, these included 14 significant ecological sources, 25 clusters of ecological corridors, and 23 ecological nodes. The results are of great significance to promote the ecological security of the TGRR and could provide theoretical support for biodiversity conservation and territorial space planning for the Three Gorges Region.

AB  - Habitat evaluation is considered an essential step for assessing the potential for an area to support a viable reintroduced population. Remote sensing techniques can support such investigations, by greatly enhancing the temporal and spatial coverage of habitat assessments. This study makes use of freely available earth observation data to evaluate the suitability of the Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim Game Reserve in central Chad for the reintroduction of the Scimitar-horned Oryx. The reserve was the last stronghold of the species within its historical range, prior to extinction in the wild in the 1980s, providing a basis for reintroduction. Results show that since the 1980s, there has been a steady increase in average annual precipitation and satellite-derived estimates of primary production. The spatial downscaling of the average trend in primary production showed that the north of the protected area exhibited a drying trend over the period 1982-2008, while the south was associated with intense greening. As a result, the subdesert transition zone preferred by oryx is currently narrowing. If this is correct, this implies a potential reduction of favourable habitat for the oryx, which could have detrimental effects on the success of establishing a self-sustaining reintroduced population.

AB  - We investigated drivers of reef shark demography across a large and isolated marine protected area, the British Indian Ocean Territory Marine Reserve, using stereo baited remote underwater video systems. We modelled shark abundance against biotic and abiotic variables at 35 sites across the reserve and found that the biomass of low trophic order fish (specifically planktivores) had the greatest effect on shark abundance, although models also included habitat variables (depth, coral cover and site type). There was significant variation in the composition of the shark assemblage at different atolls within the reserve. In particular, the deepest habitat sampled (a seamount at 70-80m visited for the first time in this study) recorded large numbers of scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) not observed elsewhere. Size structure of the most abundant and common species, grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), varied with location. Individuals at an isolated bank were 30% smaller than those at the main atolls, with size structure significantly biased towards the size range for young of year (YOY). The 18 individuals judged to be YOY represented the offspring of between four and six females, so, whilst inconclusive, these data suggest the possible use of a common pupping site by grey reef sharks. The importance of low trophic order fish biomass (i.e. potential prey) in predicting spatial variation in shark abundance is consistent with other studies both in marine and terrestrial systems which suggest that prey availability may be a more important predictor of predator distribution than habitat suitability. This result supports the need for ecosystem level rather than species-specific conservation measures to support shark recovery. The observed spatial partitioning amongst sites for species and life-stages also implies the need to include a diversity of habitats and reef types within a protected area for adequate protection of reef-associated shark assemblages.

AB  - Taman Hutan Raya (Tahura) Gunung Menumbing (TGM) is a protected area located in Muntok, West Bangka that has unique plants and animals that represent the low-land forest ecosystems of Bangka-Belitung Island. However, the biodiversity is threatened due to massive destructive activities from illegal tin mining, logging, hunting, and agriculture practices. This study aims to map the habitat threat of the western tarsier (Cephalopachus bancanus), locally called mentilin, which is one of the most threatened animals in Tahura Gunung Menumbing. To achieve the study objective, this study used the combination of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The AHP analysis was carried out to determine the weight and score of selected parameters that affect to habitat suitability of mentilin and its potential threats. The data were collected from in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and questionnaires sent by an electronic mail to experts. In total, there were fourteen experts representing NGO in Bangka Island, ex-poacher, researchers, and governments contributed to the research. The results showed that 62% of the area in the TGM was prone to mentilin habitat. This result indicated that mentilin in the TGM is facing serious threats and conservation actions are urgently needed.

AB  - Difficult terrain and inclement weather limit our knowledge of large predators, such as the tiger Panthera tigris, in the Himalayas. A lack of empirical data on large carnivores can lead to mismanagement of protected areas and population declines. We used non-invasive genetic and remote sensing data to inform the management of such high-altitude protected areas. We used the tiger as a focal species to investigate prey preference and habitat suitability in India's Buxa Tiger Reserve, which encompasses several eco-geographical regions in the Himalayan and subtropical zones. During 2010-2013, 909 faecal samples were collected, of which 372 were confirmed, using genetic analysis, to be of tiger origin. Fourteen prey species/groups were identified in 240 tiger faecal samples, largely dominated by goats Capra spp. (26.59%), rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta (22.22%) and cattle Bos spp. (20.63%). Considering only the wild prey species for which survey data are available, however, and frequency of occurrence of prey in faecal samples, hog deer Axis porcinus, sambar deer Rusa unicolor and spotted deer Axis axis were the most preferred prey species. Using faecal sample locations to examine the relationship between tiger presence and environmental features indicated that the niche for tigers is narrower than the available protected area: c. 62% of core protected area is suitable, of which only 17 % is highly suitable for tigers. Tigers prefer dense vegetation, open forests, riverine vegetation and areas close to water sources. Faecal sample-based studies have the potential to generate data that can help us understand the ecology of elusive carnivore species inhabiting high-altitude landscapes.

AB  - Hume's Pheasant, Syrmaticus humiae, is a poorly known species, currently classified as globally near-threatened. Population estimates are particularly difficult to obtain due to a low rate of detection in the field. In order to overcome these problems, we used a relatively simple quantitative habitat model to obtain an estimate of the Hume's Pheasant population in Thailand. Potential habitat of Hume's Pheasant was predicted based on a model derived from LANDSAT satellite images and field surveys. The predictive performance of the model was tested using historical records and field data collected from surveys and from local people. The models correctly identified all test areas where the pheasant was known to be present. In summary, total available habitat was estimated to be 2,667 km(2), of which only 23% fell inside either national parks or wildlife sanctuaries. The total population was estimated at 1,245 individuals, assuming national parks and sanctuaries offer at least moderate protection and are more likely to harbour populations compared to other sites. While larger than previous estimates, it suggests that there is an urgent need to conduct additional surveys outside the protected area system to assess the species status and perhaps develop additional conservation actions for these populations.

AB  - Invasive species are considered as one of the key threats to biodiversity and human livelihoods globally. The most effective strategy for handling invasion would be based on profiling invasive species and identifying areas at risk of invasion before they occur. The current study used a trait-environment modelling approach to identify alien species with high probability of invasiveness and combined this with the species distribution models (SDMs) to predict areas in the arid Saint Katherine Protectorate (SKP) in Egypt that were at highest risk of invasion by these species. The specific leaf area, number of leaves, soil nitrogen, and prevalence of disturbances were the most important biotic and abiotic indicators for predicting invasiveness in SKP. Of the investigated 33 alien plant species, three species were identified to have the highest probability of invasiveness, including Salvia rosmarinus, Eucalyptus globulus, and Acacia saligna. The outcome of the SDMs revealed that precipitation seasonality and temperature-related variables were the most important bioclimatic predictors determining the potential invasion risk of the studied alien species. Potential invasion is more likely in the eastern and northern parts of SKP, where biodiversity-rich common microhabitats are found and where there is a prevalence of disturbances such as tourism activities. The Etalaa, Shaq Mosa, and El-Mesirdi wadis microhabitats, in particular, were identified in the current study to be potentially highly suitable microhabitats for alien invasiveness and should be prioritized for monitoring and conservation actions. Moreover, the three identified species could be used as early indicators for microhabitats at risk of invasion along the environmental gradients of temperature and precipitation in arid ecosystems. This approach can be applied to other taxa and other ecosystems and can provide opportunities for formulating proactive management strategies against biological invasions.

AB  - The European wildcat Felis silvestris silvestris is one of the most endangered mammals in Poland. In 1954, when the Tatra National Park (TNP) was established in the highest part of the Polish Carpathians, the wildcat was considered a rare species but nevertheless present in this region. However, its occurrence was never properly recorded there. The aim of this study was to verify whether wildcats occur in the TNP using genetic methods to distinguish wildcats from domestic cats F.s. catus. Between March and May 2015, hair samples were collected from 40 lure sticks treated with valerian, a cat attractant, in a region of the park with presumed high habitat suitability for wildcats. Neither wildcats nor hybrids with domestic cats were identified using control region haplotype sequencing and analysis of different nuclear markers. However, thirteen samples indicating the presence of the domestic cat in the protected area were collected. The Bayesian clustering analyses of microsatellite and SNP genotypes revealed no evidence for any admixture with wildcats. While our study cannot prove the absence of wildcats in the study area, it strongly suggests that wildcats are at least very rare in the region and a continued rigorous monitoring is recommended.

AB  - Mineral licks are faunal attractors, whose distribution determines the structure and composition of Amazonian landscapes and the way they are used by wildlife and traditional communities. Research on the distribution of mineral licks is scarce, limiting the possibility of using them in conservation beyond local scales. Using the species distribution modeling framework, we predicted the distribution of suitable conditions for mineral licks in the Northwest Amazon, compiling localities from academic and traditional sources and using environmental variables associated with geology, geomorphology, edaphology, topography, and hydrology. Best models, selected according to evaluation metrics incorporated in the ENMeval "R" package, showed to be robust and predict sectors with different areas, but similar distributions. Suitable areas covered up to 14.6% of the study area and confirmed the association of mineral licks with the drainage system. The erosive capacities of the rivers and their roles in terms of sediment deposition allowed the generation of ideal conditions for the expression of mineral licks in past and present riparian zones. Closeness to salt deposits and the seacoast was also important, giving information about the underground and aboveground mineral availability, crucial aspects for mineral lick formation. Considering the extension and distribution of our predictions, we proposed its use as input for other spatial modeling exercises, for example, as part of a complex resistance matrix to evaluate ecological connectivity or as criteria to prioritize sectors for restoration in the Colombian Amazon, where it is imperative to consolidate functional networks to prevent isolation between the Amazon and Andes regions.

AB  - Knowledge of population dynamics of threatened species in the wild is key to effective conservation actions. However, at present, there are many examples of endangered animals for which their current situation is unknown, and not just in remote areas and less developed countries. We have explored this topic by studying the paradigmatic case of the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris), an endangered small carnivore whose status has been subjectively established on the basis of non-systematic approaches and opportunistic records. Little is known about its demographic situation, prompting the need for information to improve conservation measures. However, the secretive behaviour of felines along with its low density in natural conditions have prevented the gathering of sufficient data. We developed a field sampling strategy for one of the largest populations (Andalusia, South Spain, 87,268 km(2)), based on a logistically viable systematic non-intrusive survey by camera-trapping. This study offers the first large-scale estimation for any European wildcat population, based on analytical approaches applied on Species Distribution Models. A hierarchical approach based on a Maxent model for distribution estimation was used, along with Generalised Linear Models for density estimation from explicit spatial capture-recapture data. Our results show that the distribution range is smaller and more highly fragmented than previously assumed. The overall estimated density was very low (0.069 +/- 0.0019 wildcats/km(2)) and the protected areas network seems to be insufficient to cover a significant part of the population or a viable nucleus in demographic terms. Indeed, the most important areas remain unprotected. Our main recommendations are to improve the protected area network and/or vigilance programs in hunting estates, in addition to studying and improving connectivity between the main population patches.

AB  - In the recent history, climatic changes have taken place at a planetary scale and organisms needed to adapt to these changes. The last glaciation is one of most documented climatic events responsible for the current distribution of living organisms. In the last two decades, conservationists have intensively discussed how extant organisms, some of which witnessed the last glaciation, will be able to cope with the new challenge: global warming. In this matter, several recently developed statistical algorithms (e g, MaxEnt) and GIS techniques have been employed in species distribution modelling and identifying suitable conservation strategies. At the European level, the Natura 2000 network is one of the most extensive conservation strategies currently applied. But is this strategy always efficient? To respond to this main question we selected a typical glacial relict species (Ligularia sibirica (L.) Cass.) that is declining due to anthropogenic activities and which could also be influenced by global warming. We modelled the current and future distribution of the species in Romania using MaxEnt algorithm with bioclimatic data and investigated the efficiency of Natura 2000 in the long-term conservation of the target species. Our results showed that the niche of Ligularia sibirica has been conserved over time and is mostly influenced by cold and wet climate conditions. The projected climatic changes will not affect the future predicted distribution of the species' bioclimatic niche. We conclude that the efficiency of Natura 2000 in Romania for this species is less than optimal. In a broader conservation perspective, we recommend that information provided by species climatic distribution models (both present and future) should be taken into account to improve future protected area networks.

AB  - As threats to biodiversity from environmental change increase, assessing priorities for mitigation action becomes increasingly important. However, there have been few attempts to schedule actions across broad spatial extents that explicitly account for dynamic ecological processes and threats. We combined a dynamic occupancy model with a decision analysis framework to spatially allocate multiple recovery actions to maximize species' probability of occupancy under threats posed by climate and land-use change. We used the koala Phascolarctos cinereus across the Australian state of New South Wales (810000km(2)) to illustrate this approach. We considered four actions implemented on a 10x10km(2) grid: reduce domestic dog attacks through dog control, reduce vehicle collisions through fencing highways, protect habitat through land acquisitions and restore Eucalyptus forest. We used the occupancy model to predict ecological responses to recovery actions and simulated annealing to identify spatio-temporal priorities for each action. We contrasted the results against priorities generated using a traditional static distribution model. To maximize the probability of koala occupancy in 50years' time, with an annual budget of up to AU$20million, investment priorities were located in the eastern part of koala's range, focusing on dog control with some investment in habitat protection and restoration. With higher budgets, investment priorities shifted towards habitat protection and restoration in the western part of the range. However, priorities based on the static distribution model, which had a lower predictive accuracy than the dynamic model, were different. Regardless of budget, priorities derived from the static model were predominantly located in the western part of koala's range, focusing on highway fencing with some investment in dog control.Synthesis and applications. Our approach for integrating spatio-temporal dynamics into conservation prioritization across broad spatial extents provides a significant advance on existing approaches based on static distribution models. The finding that the inferior static model produced different priorities to the dynamic model cautions against the use of static models for conservation planning in dynamic landscapes. Additionally, the substantial changes in priorities with budget indicate that conservation planning under dynamic landscape and climate change must carefully consider priority actions and locations relative to the conservation resources available.

AB  - Ecological networks (ENs) are able to mitigate the negative effects of commercial forestry on terrestrial biodiversity, yet this remains untested for the aquatic fauna. Understanding the anthropogenic and natural variables that drive dragonfly diversity at the landscape and habitat scales, allows the design and implementation of ENs that minimise biodiversity loss across production landscapes. Here, we determine the relative contribution of anthropogenic disturbances and natural environmental variables to dragonfly assemblages within ENs. Sixty sites, of various freshwater body types, were sampled for adult dragonflies across ENs in a commercial forestry landscape. Overall, species richness was significantly influenced by river width, water turbidity, water depth and the presence of invasive plants. Nevertheless, overall species composition was influenced by water body type, flow rate and substrate type. Further differences were found when analyses were conducted separately for Anisoptera and Zygoptera. Counter-intuitively, anthropogenic disturbances had less effect on dragonfly species richness and composition than did natural environmental variables, emphasising the importance of conserving natural heterogeneity. Overall, dragonfly diversity can be successfully conserved in ENs provided that conservation planning incorporates appropriate local scale variables. These results also suggest that impacts on water quality and dragonfly diversity are minimised by well-designed ENs within this production landscape.

AB  - Biodiversity and ecosystem functions are highly threatened by global change. It has been proposed that geodiversity can be used as an easy-to-measure surrogate of biodiversity to guide conservation management. However, so far, there is mixed evidence to what extent geodiversity can predict biodiversity and ecosystem functions at the regional scale relevant for conservation planning. Here, we analyse how geodiversity computed as a compound index is suited to predict the diversity of four taxa and associated ecosystem functions in a tropical mountain hotspot of biodiversity and compare the results with the predictive power of environmental conditions and resources (climate, habitat, soil). We show that combinations of these environmental variables better explain species diversity and ecosystem functions than a geodiversity index and identified climate variables as more important predictors than habitat and soil variables, although the best predictors differ between taxa and functions. We conclude that a compound geodiversity index cannot be used as a single surrogate predictor for species diversity and ecosystem functions in tropical mountain rain forest ecosystems and is thus little suited to facilitate conservation management at the regional scale. Instead, both the selection and the combination of environmental variables are essential to guide conservation efforts to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem functions.

AB  - Epiphytic lichens are an important component of forest biodiversity. Many of them are threatened and conservation planning therefore requires comprehensive information about their distribution over space and time. However, besides topo-climatic predictors, the spatial pattern of epiphytic lichens is also closely related to the tree characteristics on which they grow. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that habitat specialist lichens restricted to specific habitat types and common species with a wide range of ecological preferences may respond differently to the topo-climatic and forest-structure predictors. We applied the generalized linear model (GLM) and maximum entropy (Maxent) for 20 epiphytic lichen species in Switzerland at different spatial scales (1 km and 100 m). To evaluate the influence of forest structure on the epiphytic lichen distribution, models with three sets of predictors (topo-climatic, forest-structure and combined predictor sets) were fitted for each species. Canopy height of forest stands and forest type were tested as a proxy of forest structure. Our results showed that both the techniques applied predicted well the occurrences of habitat specialists but the models of common lichens were overall less accurate. Forest-structure predictors significantly improved the models of rare and threatened species with specific microhabitat requirements, i.e. mainly forest lichens (Arthonia byssacea, Bactrospora dryina, Calicium viride, Gyalecta truncigena and Vulpicida pinastri), but they did not contribute considerably to the models of common species that grow equally well on the bark of different trees within or outside of forests (e.g. Caloplaca cerina, Phaeophyscia orbicularis, Physcia stellaris and Xanthoria parietina). We recommend using high-resolution forest-structure data for robust and reliable predictions of the distribution patterns of threatened epiphytic lichens, most of which are habitat specialists. The inclusion of these data will allow a hypothesis-driven sampling strategy, and will thus increase the effectiveness of the field sampling needed for searching large regions thoroughly to discover new sites where rare and threatened species occur.

AB  - Brazilian Amazonia faces one of the greatest threats and opportunities for tropical biodiversity conservation of our times. I consider several large-scale issues in biodiversity conservation planning (e.g., resource extraction, large areas needed for top predators, species migration, fire, and carbon sequestration) in light of our severely deficient understanding of basinwide patterns of species distribution and little-known Amazonian biota. The long-term persistence of this biota is best served by strictly protected and sustainable development forest reserves that are both embedded in a benign forest matrix and sufficiently large to support a full complement of species and landscape-scale ecological processes. Given rapidly accelerating trends in agricultural frontier expansion into previously unclaimed public lands, protection and controlled development of forests is urgent.

AB  - Insect conservation is often impeded by a lack of species-specific data leading to difficulties in assessment of conservation and threat status. Utilising specimens and records held within natural history museums may help to overcome such limitations. We used specimens and their associated data from the New Zealand Arthropod Collection to provide a comparative analysis of threatened species and their related non-threatened congeners. A range of insect groups were covered, including families from the five mega-diverse insect orders. Data on the locality, date, habitat, and morphological measurements, were recorded for nearly 25,000 specimens from 460 species, of which 31 are Threatened and 104 are At Risk. Results found the Protected Area Network provided significantly less coverage for insect species classified as Threatened or At Risk. Body size, geographical distribution, and environmental variables were not consistent predictors of the current threat classification system. There were a disproportionately large number of At Risk species found on offshore islands. The current New Zealand threat classification system, based on trends in geographical occurrence and population sizes, does not accurately reflect the conservation needs of most insect species. This has significant implications for the utility of threat assessments for insect conservation.

AB  - Transboundary conservation is playing an increasingly important role in maintaining ecosystem integrity and halting biodiversity loss caused by anthropogenic activities. However, lack of information on species distributions in transboundary regions and understanding of the threats in these areas impairs conservation. We developed a spatial conservation plan for the transboundary areas between Yunnan province, southwestern China, and neighboring Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. To identify priority areas for conservation and restoration, we determined species distribution patterns and recent land-use changes and examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of the connected natural forest, which supports most species. We assessed connectivity with equivalent connected area (ECA), which is the amount of reachable habitat for a species. An ECA incorporates the presence of habitat in a patch and the amount of habitat in other patches within dispersal distance. We analyzed 197,845 locality records from specimen collections and monographs for 21,004 plant and vertebrate species. The region of Yunnan immediately adjacent to the international borders had the highest species richness, with 61% of recorded species and 56% of threatened vertebrates, which suggests high conservation value. Satellite imagery showed the area of natural forest in the border zone declined by 5.2% (13,255 km(2)) from 1995 to 2018 and monoculture plantations increased 92.4%, shrubland 10.1%, and other cropland 6.2%. The resulting decline in connected natural forest reduced the amount of habitat, especially for forest specialists with limited dispersal abilities. The most severe decline in connectivity was along the Sino-Vietnamese border. Many priority areas straddle international boundaries, indicating demand and potential for establishing transboundary protected areas. Our results illustrate the importance of bi- and multilateral cooperation to protect biodiversity in this region and provide guidance for future conservation planning and practice.

AB  - Preliminary, large-scale assessments of global sea-level rise (SLR) have predicted significant impacts to coastal and island biodiversity. Region-specific estimates of SLR impacts that incorporate accurate species distributions and local rates of SLR are now required for effective conservation planning. Here we use a dataset of >13,000 occurrence records for lichens, obligate symbiotic fungi, in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain of eastern North America to model distributions of 193 species. The resulting models were used to quantify the amount of each species' distribution that is occupied by unsuitable land use types, along with the potential area that will be lost to SLR. We show that species have likely already lost an average of 32% of their distributional area to development and agriculture, and are predicted to lose an average of 12.4 and 33.7% of their distributional area with one foot (similar to 0.3 m) and six feet (similar to 1.8 m) of SLR, respectively. Functional and taxonomic groups were compared to identify specific effects of SLR. We show that species reproducing with symbiotic propagules have significantly larger distributions than species that reproduce sexually with fungal spores alone, and that the sexually reproducing species are predicted to lose greater distributional area to SLR. Cladonia species occupy significantly less area in the MACP than Parmotrema species and are predicted to lose more of their distributions to SLR. We further examined patterns of total species diversity and found that the area with the highest diversity is the Dare Peninsula in North Carolina, which is also predicted to lose the most land area to SLR. The workflow established here is flexible and applicable to estimating SLR impacts worldwide and can provide essential insights for local conservation planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we aim to investigate the problems and potentialities of species distribution modeling (SDM) as a tool for conservation planning and policy development and implementation in tropical regions. We reviewed 123 studies published between 1995 and 2007 in five of the leading journals in ecology and conservation, and examined two tropical case studies in which distribution modeling is currently being applied to support conservation planning. We also analyzed the characteristics of data typically used for fitting models within the specific context of modeling tree species distribution in Central America. The results showed that methodological papers outnumbered reports of SDMs being used in an applied context for setting conservation priorities, particularly in the tropics. Most applications of SDMs were in temperate regions and biased towards certain organisms such as mammals and birds. Studies from tropical regions were less likely to be validated than those from temperate regions. Unpublished data from two major tropical case studies showed that those species that are most in need of conservation actions, namely those that are the rarest or most threatened, are those for which SDM is least likely to be useful. We found that only 15% of the tree species of conservation concern in Central America could be reliably modelled using data from a substantial source (Missouri Botanical Garden VAST database). Lack of data limits model validation in tropical areas, further restricting the value of SDMs. We concluded that SDMs have a great potential to support biodiversity conservation in the tropics, by supporting the development of conservation strategies and plans, identifying knowledge gaps, and providing a tool to examine the potential impacts of environmental change. However, for this potential to be fully realized, problems of data quality and availability need to be overcome. Weaknesses in current biological datasets need to be systematically addressed, by increasing collection of field survey data, improving data sharing and increasing structural integration of data sources. This should include use of distributed databases with common standards, referential integrity, and rigorous quality control. Integration of data management with SDMs could significantly add value to existing data resources by improving data quality control and enabling knowledge gaps to be identified.

AB  - Transboundary protected areas may be important for the conservation of large African carnivores because these species require large tracts of habitat to maintain viable population numbers and gene flow. Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus Schreber, 1775), is a species that may benefit from transboundary conservation agreements. It occurs at naturally low population densities, makes use of large home ranges, and disperses over long distances, thus requiring large tracts of suitable habitat to maintain viable population numbers. Here we present the first scientific evidence of a breeding population of cheetah in Parque Nacional do Limpopo (PNL), Mozambique. We obtained data from camera-traps deployed during occupancy surveys conducted from 9 September 2011 to 31 August 2012 over a 3400 km(2) study area located within the central third of PNL. These results highlight the importance of the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTFP) to the overall conservation of cheetah in Africa, and the potential value of transboundary protected areas for the conservation of wide-roaming terrestrial mammals.

AB  - Choosing appropriate management strategies and effective conservation actions requires information about the future consequences of current conservation actions; however, this crucial information is rarely available to conservation planners. This study applies scenario planning and agent-based modelling (ABM) to assess the potential impact of alternative management strategies on future suitability and functional connectivity of Cross River gorilla (CRG) habitat in the Nigeria-Cameroon border region. The CRG population is small and fragmented, with many subpopulations and migration corridors located outside protected areas. This study used ABM to simulate human land use in the study area over a period of 15 years under different management scenarios and assessed the impact on future suitability and functional connectivity of CRG habitat. The simulations showed that a landscape approach with greater focus on interventions to change human behaviour towards conserving gorillas and sustainable forest use would result in greater improvement in habitat suitability and functional connectivity compared to focusing on improving law enforcement within existing protected areas. However, the best scenarios were when both law enforcement and behaviour change increased. The results highlight the importance of human behaviour change to conservation in human-dominated landscapes and can inform conservation planning and management of other species and in similar landscapes.

AB  - The viability of many species depends on functional connectivity of their populations through dispersal across broad landscapes. This is particularly the case for the endangered brown bear in north-western Spain, with a total population of about 200 individuals in two subpopulations that are separated by a wide gap with low permeability. Our goal in this paper is to use state-of-the-art connectivity modeling approaches to provide detailed and quantitative guidance for conservation planning efforts aimed at improving landscape permeability for brown bears in Spain, with a particular focus on alleviating the barrier effect of transportation infrastructure. We predicted a regional connectivity network for brown bear by combining a multiscale habitat suitability model with factorial least-cost path density analysis. We found that the current composition and configuration of the landscape considerably constrain brown bear movements, creating a narrow bottleneck that limits flow of individuals between the two subpopulations. We identified key locations along the predicted corridors where efforts to increase road and railway permeability should be prioritized. The results provide a foundation for the development of spatially optimal management strategies to enhance connectivity within and between the subpopulations and to mitigate the impact of potential barriers to movement.

AB  - Wetlands provide numerous ecosystem functions such as water purification, nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat. Avian populations are indicators of wetland health, and understanding their responses to extreme events can aid in targeting restoration efforts following disturbance. Here, we assessed the habitat selection of six coastal wetland bird species (American Bittern, Black-crowned Night Heron, Great Egret, Glossy Ibis, Snowy Egret, Yellow-crowned Night Heron) related to an extreme weather event, Hurricane Sandy. We used Discrete Choice Resource Selection Functions to estimate habitat selection. Results showed species probability of use increased with lower elevation and slope, and closer proximity to marsh, salt marsh, Phragmites, and protected areas. Estimates of marsh dieback from Hurricane Sandy occurred disproportionately in areas with higher probability of species use. Species were observed farther from the coast and at higher elevations in the four breeding seasons after (2013-2016) compared to before (2000-2012) Hurricane Sandy. Our results indicate that although high suitability areas were affected by the storm, these six wetland bird species may have responded by moving inland and to higher elevation. Understanding how coastal wetland birds respond to storm events is important for conservation planning, particularly as storm frequency is projected to increase in the future.

AB  - To ensure integrity of protected areas we need to understand how species respond to anthropogenic borders. We investigate, from a metacommunity perspective, the direct and indirect mechanisms by which transformed areas affect distribution patterns of ground-living arthropod assemblages inhabiting an extensive protected area adjacent to fruit orchards in an important biosphere reserve. Arthropods and environmental variables were sampled along transects perpendicular to natural-orchard edges. Influence of distance from orchard boundary, degree of impermeability of the boundary, orchard habitat quality (local scale land-use intensity), and edge-induced changes in local environmental variables on arthropod species richness and composition in non-crop habitats were assessed. Arthropod groups were assessed in terms of habitat fidelity: species associated with natural habitat (stenotopic species), those within crop habitat (cultural species), and those showing no preference for either habitat (ubiquitous species). Spillover resulted in higher cultural species richness near edges, but not higher overall species richness. Environmental filtering was important for stenotopic species composition, which was influenced by edge-induced changes in environmental variables. Ubiquitous species composition was determined by orchard impermeability. Increased orchard habitat quality was associated with higher cultural and ubiquitous species richness. The effects of orchards on assemblages in natural habitats can be variable, but predictable when using species habitat specificity in conjunction with a metacommunity framework. High intensity orchards may act as sink habitats, especially for species that readily disperse between crop and natural habitats. Here we recommend that local buffer strips are>85 m wide, which will reduce the influence of cultural species spillover on sensitive natural ecosystems.

AB  - Despite being increasingly threatened by human-induced disturbances, dry forests remain the least studied and protected forest types in the Caribbean region. In contrast to many other forest systems in the world, we have little knowledge of the site-specific variation in vegetation communities within these forests nor understand how plant species distribution is determined by environmental variables, including geological attributes. Here, we aimed to provide evidence of the relationship between biodiversity and geodiversity, by assessing the associations between plant communities and habitat types in a semi-deciduous forest of the Dominican Republic. We collected vegetation data from 23 sites within the Ocoa river basin, which we classified into six groups with a Random Forest algorithm, using lithology, geomorphology, topography, and last decade history of forest loss as predictor variables. We established three main clusters: one group, which encompassed sites with forest over a limestone substrate, four groups of sites with forests over a marlstone substrate with varying degrees of steepness and forest loss history, and one group that gathered all sites with forest over an alluvial substrate. In order to measure the associations of plant communities with groups of sites, we used the indicator value index (IndVal), which indicates whether a plant species is found in one or multiple-habitat types and the phi coefficient of association, which measures species preferences for habitats. We found that 16 species of woody plants are significantly associated with groups of sites by means of their indices. Our findings suggest that the detection of plant species associations with our selection of environmental variables is possible using a combination of indices. We show that there is considerable variation in plant community composition within the semi-deciduous forest studied and suggest that conservation planning should focus on protection of this variation, while considering the significance and variability of geodiversity as well. In addition, we propose that our indicator groups facilitate vegetation mapping in nearby dry forests, where it is difficult to conduct thorough vegetation or environmental surveys. In short, our analyses hold potential for the development of site-specific management and protection measures for threatened semi-deciduous forests in the Caribbean.

AB  - Conservation organisations and governments often use charismatic megafauna as surrogates to represent broader biodiversity. While these species are primarily selected as flagships for marketing campaigns, it is important to evaluate their surrogacy potential, i.e. the extent to which their protection benefits other biodiversity elements. Four charismatic megafauna species are used as surrogates in the megadiverse island of Sumatra: the Sumatran tiger Panthera tigris sumatrae, Sumatran elephant Elephas maximus sumatranus, Sumatran orangutan Pongo abelii and Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. We examined how well each of these species performed in representing the distribution of all co-occurring terrestrial mammal species on the island, and the priority areas for the conservation of three facets of mammalian biodiversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional). We used habitat suitability models to represent the distribution of 184 terrestrial mammal species, 160 phylogenetic groups and 74 functional trait groups. We then identified priority conservation areas using the spatial prioritisation software Zonation. We found that the habitat overlap between each of the four charismatic species and the other mammal species varied, ranging from a mean of 52% (SD=27%) for the tiger to 2% (SD=2%) for the rhino. Combining the four species together improved the representation levels only marginally compared to using the tiger only. Among the four charismatic megafauna species, the extent of suitable habitat of Sumatran tiger covered the highest proportion of priority conservation areas. The Sumatran tiger also outperformed most of other mammal species with similar range sizes. We found that some of the top-ranked conservation areas for taxonomic (28%), phylogenetic (8%) and functional diversity (19%) did not overlap with any of the charismatic species' suitable habitat.Synthesis and applications. Wide-ranging charismatic species can represent broader mammalian biodiversity, but they may miss some key areas with high biodiversity importance. We suggest that a combination of systematic spatial prioritisation and surrogacy analyses are important in order to determine the allocation of conservation resources in biodiversity-rich areas such as Sumatra, where an expansion of the protected area network is required.
   Foreign Language AbstractAbstrak
   Organisasi konservasi dan pemerintah seringkali menggunakan megafauna karismatik sebagai spesies pengganti untuk merepresentasikan biodiversitas yang lebih luas. Walaupun spesies pengganti biasanya memilik peran utama sebagai flagship untuk kampanye, penting juga untuk mengetahui apakah perlindungan spesies tersebut dapat memberikan keuntungan bagi aspek biodiversitas lainnya. Empat megafauna karismatik digunakan sebagai spesies pengganti di Pulau Sumatera, yaitu harimau sumatera Panthera tigris sumatrae, gajah sumatera Elephas maximus sumatranus, orangutan sumatera Pongo abelii dan badak sumatera Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. Kami mengevaluasi bagaimana keempat spesies tersebut merepresentasikan distribusi spesies mamalia terestrial lainnya di Sumatera dan area prioritas untuk konservasi tiga aspek keanekaragaman hayati (taksonomik, filogenetik, dan fungsional). Kami menggunakan pemodelan kesesuaian habitat untuk merepresentasikan distribusi 184 spesies mamalia terestrial, 160 kelompok filogenetik, dan 74 kelompok karakteristik fungsional. Kami kemudian mengidentifikasi area konservasi prioritas menggunakan perangkat lunak Zonation. Tumpang-tindih habitat di antara keempat spesies karismatik dan spesies mamalia lainnya bervariasi, berkisar dari rerata 52% (SD=27%) untuk harimau hingga 2% (SD=2%) untuk badak. Menggabungkan distribusi keempat spesies hanya sedikit meningkatkan tumpang-tindih habitat dibandingkan jika hanya menggunakan harimau. Di antara keempat spesies karismatik, habitat yang sesuai bagi harimau sumatera melingkupi area konservasi prioritas dengan proporsi tertinggi. Harimau sumatera juga mengungguli sebagian besar mamalia lain yang memiliki luas habitat yang serupa. Beberapa area konservasi prioritas untuk keanekaragaman taksonomik (28%), filogenetik (8%), dan fungsional (19%) tidak bertumpang-tindih dengan habitat spesies karismatik mana pun.Sintesis dan aplikasi. Spesies karismatik dengan distribusi yang luas dapat merepresentasikan keanekaragaman mamalia, tetapi dapat juga melewatkan beberapa area yang penting untuk konservasi biodiversitas. Kombinasi antara analisis spasial untuk menentukan prioritas konservasi dan analisis surogasi merupakan hal yang penting untuk menentukan alokasi sumber daya konservasi di area yang kaya akan biodiversitas, seperti Sumatera, di mana perluasan kawasan konservasi diperlukan.

AB  - The links between species-environment relations and species' responses to protection are unclear, but the objectives of marine protected areas (MPAs) are most likely to be achieved when those relations are known and inform MPA design. The components of a species' habitat vary with the spatial resolution of the area considered. We characterized areas at two resolutions: 250 m2 (transect) and approximately 30,000 m2 (seascape). We considered three categories of environmental variables: substrate type, bottom complexity, and depth. We sought to determine at which resolution habitat characteristics were a better predictor of abundance and species composition of fishes and whether the relations with environmental variables at either resolution affected species' responses to protection. Habitat features accounted for a larger proportion of spatial variation in species composition and abundances than differences in protection status. This spatial variation was explained best by habitat characteristics at the seascape level than at the transect level. Species' responses to protected areas were specific to particular seascape characteristics, primarily depth, and bottom complexity. Our method may be useful for prioritizing marine areas for protection, designing MPAs, and monitoring their effectiveness. It identified areas that provided natural shelter, areas acting as buffer zones, and areas where fish species were most responsive to protection. The identification of such areas is necessary for cost-effective establishment and monitoring of MPAs.

AB  - Indonesia harbours a high diversity of cetaceans, yet effective conservation is hampered by a lack of knowledge about cetacean spatial distribution and habitat preferences. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap at an adequate resolution to support national cetacean conservation and management planning. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) modelling was used to map the distribution of 15 selected cetacean species in seven areas within Indonesian waters using recent cetacean presence datasets as well as environmental predictors (topographic and oceanographic variables). We then combined the individual species suitable habitat maps and overlaid them with provincial marine spatial planning (MSP) jurisdictions, marine protected areas (MPAs), oil and gas contract areas, and marine traffic density. Our results reflect a great heterogeneity in distribution among species and within species among different locations. This heterogeneity reflects an interrelated influence of topographic variables and oceanographic processes on the distribution of cetacean species. Bathymetry, distance to- coast and the -200m isobaths, and chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature were important variables influencing distribution of most species in many regions. Areas rich in species were mainly related to coastal areas or insular-reef complexity, representing high productivity and upwelling-modified waters. Although some important suitable habitats currently fall within MPAs, other areas are not and overlap with oil and gas exploration activities and marine traffic, indicating potentially high risk areas for cetaceans. The results of this study can support national cetacean conservation and management planning, and be used to reduce or avoid adverse anthropogenic threats. We advise to consider currently unprotected suitable cetacean habitats in MPA and MSP development.

AB  - Lack of biodiversity data is a major impediment to prioritizing sites for species representation. Because comprehensive species data are not available in any planning area, planners often use surrogates (such as vegetation communities, or mapped occurrences of a well-inventoried taxon) to prioritize sites. We propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of predicted rarity-weighted richness (PRWR) as a surrogate in situations where species inventories may be available for a portion of the planning area. Use of PRWR as a surrogate involves several steps. First, rarity-weighted richness (RWR) is calculated from species inventories for a q% subset of sites. Then random forest models are used to model RWR as a function of freely available environmental variables for that q% subset. This function is then used to calculate PRWR for all sites (including those for which no species inventories are available), and PRWR is used to prioritize all sites. We tested PRWR on plant and bird datasets, using the species accumulation index to measure efficiency of PRWR. Sites with the highest PRWR represented species with median efficiency of 56% (range 32%-77% across six datasets) when q = 20%, and with median efficiency of 39% (range 20%-63%) when q = 10%. An efficiency of 56% means that selecting sites in order of PRWR rank was 56% as effective as having full knowledge of species distributions in PRWR's ability to improve on the number of species represented in the same number of randomly selected sites. Our results suggest that PRWR may be able to help prioritize sites to represent species if a planner has species inventories for 10%-20% of the sites in the planning area.

AB  - Conservation efforts should be directed to species and areas in particular need. Several concepts for conservation prioritization exist. Following appropriate measures, we determined the World Heritage Site (WHS) "Nimba Mountains" and its flagship-species, the Nimba toad (Nimbaphlynoides occidentalis), to be both "irreplaceable" and "vulnerable". The biodiversity hotspot, Nimba Mountains, is a WHS "in danger". Conservation efforts are needed to ascertain the long-term persistence of the globally unique viviparous toad and other endemic species. To set the baseline for conservation management, we focussed on the relationships between environmental variables and the current and past toad distribution. With linear, generalised linear, generalised additive and zero inflation models we analysed the toads' distribution and range limits. Our results show that weather conditions limit the toads to higher elevations. Water impermeable geologic layers seem to be inevitable for adequate dry season dormancy sites, thus being the main factor predicting the patchy aboveground wet season distribution. This emphasises the importance of temporally used (non-breeding) environments. For conservation planning, we thus advise distribution models to include all habitats used by focal species. Human activities may further impact a species' abundance and distribution. Herein, we hypothesised that increased fire frequency and anthropogenic habitat alteration in the recent past changed overall habitat characteristics and thus resulted in decreasing toad numbers and an altered range size. Our ecological models indeed better predicted the past compared to the current toad range. This emphasises the importance to consider recent historical developments, before drawing conclusions from current distribution pattern in a conservation context. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The random forests (RF) algorithm is a superb learner and classifier in machine learning applications. This ensemble model is also one of the most popular species distribution model algorithms (SDMs) available to date. RF by default can produce categorical and numerical species distribution maps based on its classification tree (CT) and regression tree (RT) algorithms, respectively. Statistically, CT can also produce numerical predictions (class probability). Many real-world applications (e.g. conservation planning) employ binary presence-absence outputs that use classification thresholds to make these conversions. However, there is little available information regarding the difference in model performance between CT and RT for inference settings. Here, under an ensemble modeling framework, 52 forest tree species with presence-only data for all of China were selected for comparison of the performance of CT and RT algorithms in projecting the distribution and potential range shifts of these species under current and future climates. Five climatic variables were used to develop CT and RT models. Eight threshold-setting approaches were employed to convert numerical predictions into binary predictions. With regard to probabilistic predictions, the relative performance of CT and RT depended on the choice of the evaluation criteria. For both RT and CT, threshold-setting methods significantly altered the determination of thresholds, model performance, and subsequently projections of species range shifts under climate change. The four threshold selection methods (MaxKappa, MaxOA, MaxTSS, and MinROCdist) based on the composite model accuracy measures most often achieved significantly higher model performance than CT default threshold method and other threshold methods. They consistently projected that species' geographical ranges changed in response to climate change with the same direction and magnitude. We argue for choosing RT rather than CT as the SDM if model discrimination capacity (the ability to differentiate between occurrences of presence and absence) is viewed as more important than model reliability (the agreement between predicted relative indexes of occurrence and observed proportions of occurrence), and vice versa. In line with gradient theory, we can recommend the use of numerical predictions for species distribution modeling since they help to convey more information than binary predictions. Binary conversion of model outputs should only be carried out when it is clearly justified by the application's objective. The four aforementioned threshold methods are promising objective methods for binary conversions of continuous predictions when presence-only data are available. This study proposes guidelines on how machine learning can be used for specific applied and theoretical applications in a SDM context.

AB  - Estimates of density and population size are fundamental in assessing population trends and ultimately in informing conservation management. Although the abundance of raptors is often expressed as indices of relative abundance, these can be poor correlates of absolute density. In 2008-2009, I calculated the absolute density and population size of Gray-backed Hawks (Pseudastur occidentalis), an endangered species and Tumbesian endemic, using line transect counts in four different habitat types in a protected area in northwestern Peru. The absolute density of Gray-backed Hawks in northwest Peru was estimated to be 0.65 individuals km(-2), and the most suitable habitat for the species was located in the provinces of Manabi, Guayas, and Santa Elena in Ecuador, and Tumbes and Piura departments in Peru. The population of Gray-backed Hawks in my study areas in Tumbes was estimated to be 136, with 94% occurring in dry deciduous and deciduous forest. Because approximate to 60% of all detections in my study were made outside strictly protected areas, including the recently created Angostura-Faical Regional Conservation Area, conservation of the remaining, non-protected forests patches in Peru and Ecuador should be a high priority. The current global population of Gray-backed Hawks has been estimated to be between 250 and 999 birds and declining due to ongoing habitat destruction and fragmentation. Small populations in small habitat fragments, like those in my study area, have high conservation potential, provided that populations are not isolated, and hence should be the focus of constant monitoring.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the major drivers of population declines and extinction, particularly in large carnivores. Connectivity models provide practical tools for assessing fragmentation effects and developing mitigation or conservation responses. To be useful to conservation practitioners, connectivity models need to incorporate multiple scales and include realistic scenarios based on potential changes to habitat and anthropogenic pressures. This will help to prioritize conservation efforts in a changing landscape.
   The goal of our paper was to evaluate differences in population connectivity for lions (Panthera leo) across the Kavango-Zambezi Trans-frontier Conservation Area (KAZA) under different landscape change scenarios and a range of dispersal distances.
   We used an empirically optimized resistance surface, based on analysis of movement pathways of dispersing lions in southern Africa to calculate resistant kernel connectivity. We assessed changes in connectivity across nine landscape change scenarios, under each of which we explored the behavior of lions with eight different dispersal abilities.
   Our results demonstrate that reductions in the extent of the protected area network and/or fencing protected areas will result in large declines in the extent of population connectivity, across all modeled dispersal abilities. Creation of corridors or erection of fences strategically placed to funnel dispersers between protected areas increased overall connectivity of the population.
   Our results strongly suggest that the most effective means of maintaining long-term population connectivity of lions in the KAZA region involves retaining the current protected area network, augmented with protected corridors or strategic fencing to direct dispersing individuals towards suitable habitat and away from potential conflict areas.

AB  - Conserving habitat is increasingly challenging as human populations grow. Remote-sensing technology has provided a means to delineate species' habitat on large spatial scales. However, by combining habitat delineations with predictions of species' occurrence, habitat models can provide additional utility applications for conservation by allowing us to forecast how changing environmental and landscape conditions affect species' occurrence and distribution. We demonstrate how a spatially explicit habitat occupancy model for the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) can be used as an impact assessment and conservation planning tool. We used predictions of patch-level occupancy rates and created several scenarios that simulated the removal or protection of warbler habitats. Resulting changes to habitat structure and availability were used to assess the resulting impacts of removal or protection on the occurrence probability for remaining habitat patches. By recalculating occupancy based on changes to habitat, our approach provides the ability to assess and compare impacts of location and orientation of development so that the least harmful option relative to predicted occurrence can be chosen. Potential applications of our modeling approach are many because our methods provide a useful tool for identifying potential impacts and assisting with mitigation efforts focused on the conservation and management of a species.

AB  - We submitted tree species occurrence and geoclimatic data from 59 sites in a river basin in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil to ordination, ANOVA, and cluster analyses with the goals of investigating the causes of phytogeographic patterns and determining whether the six recognized subregions represent distinct floristic units. We found that both climate and space were significantly (p <= 0.05) important in the explanation of phytogeographic patterns. Floristic variations follow thermal gradients linked to elevation in both coastal and inland subregions. A gradient of precipitation seasonality was found to be related to floristic variation up to 100 km inland from the ocean. The temperature of the warmest quarter and the precipitation during the coldest quarter were the main predictors. The subregions Sandy Coastal Plain, Coastal Lowland, Coastal Highland, and Central Depression were recognized as distinct floristic units. Significant differences were not found between the Inland Highland and the Espinhaco Range, indicating that these subregions should compose a single floristic unit encompassing all interior highlands. Because of their ecological peculiarities, the ferric outcrops within the Espinhaco Range may constitute a special unit. The floristic units proposed here will provide important information for wiser conservation planning in the Atlantic Forest hotspot.

AB  - The streaked homed lark (hereafter "lark"; Eremophila alpestris strigata) is a federally listed bird subspecies of the Pacific Northwest that occupies open landscapes with short vegetation and abundant bare ground. Across its breeding range, which has contracted dramatically, the lark relies primarily on human-modified habitats maintained in early successional states (e.g., agricultural fields, airfields, deposition islands). The focus of our study is the lower Columbia River where larks primarily occupy deposition islands created as a byproduct of shipping channel deepening (dredging) projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has proactively adopted a shifting-habitat-mosaic management approach when placing dredge (sand) materials to maintain lark habitat throughout the project area. To help achieve their goal, we created a geospatial tool capable of quantifying and tracking habitat suitability for larks throughout the project area with satellite imagery. We created spatial models of lark breeding habitat by incorporating lark survey data, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, dredge-deposition maps, and surface-elevation models. We built candidate predictive models of lark breeding habitat after combining survey data (years 2016 and 2017), predictor variables, and logistic regression. In addition, we created a novel seral-stage predictor variable to identify young, mature, old, and unsuitable locations; critical information for lark conservation planning and dredge-disposal operational planning. We challenged probability models the year they were constructed (2016) and the following year (2017) with set-aside survey data. The best model contained terrain ruggedness, deposition age, vegetation greenness (e.g., lushness and density of vegetation) inside a 10-m cell, and heterogeneity in greenness within a 100-m radius. Verification accuracy ranged from 75 to 83% depending on the model tested and year. Importantly, the seral-stage variable allowed us to quantify and locate early, optimal, and late habitats. Model results will facilitate conservation planning decisions by informing real-time management decisions. Furthermore, they provide a foundation for application in other human-modified habitats across the species' range.

AB  - Background: Conserving both biodiversity and ecosystem services is a major goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Hotspots for biodiversity in the Andes significantly overlap with areas with dense human populations that sustain their economy through agricultural production. Therefore, developing management forms that reconcile food provisioning services-such as agriculture-with biodiversity conservation must be addressed to avoid social conflicts and to improve conservation in areas where biodiversity co-occurs with other ecosystem services. Here, we present a high-resolution conservation plan for vascular plants and agriculture in the Ecuadorian Dry Inter-Andean Valleys (DIAV) hotspot. Trade-offs in conserving important areas for both biodiversity and agriculture were explored.
   Methods: We used a dataset containing 5,685 presence records for 95 plant species occurring in DIAVs, of which 14 species were endemic. We developed habitat suitability maps for the 95 species using Maxent. Prioritization analyses were carried out using a conservation planning framework. We developed three conservation scenarios that selected important areas for: biodiversity only, agriculture only, and for both biodiversity and agriculture combined.
   Results: Our conservation planning analyses, capture 33.5% of biodiversity and 11% of agriculture under a scenario solely focused on the conservation of biodiversity. On the other hand, the top 17% fraction of the agriculture only scenario captures 10% of biodiversity and 28% of agriculture. When biodiversity and agriculture were considered in combination, their representation varied according to the importance given to agriculture. The most balanced solution that gives a nearly equal representation of both biodiversity and agriculture, was obtained when agriculture was given a slightly higher importance over biodiversity during the selection process.
   Discussion: This is the first evaluation of trade-offs between important areas for biodiversity and agriculture in Ecuadorian DIAV. Our results showed that areas with high agricultural productivity and high biodiversity partly overlapped. Our study suggests that a land-sharing strategy would be appropriate for conserving plant diversity and agriculture in the DIAV. Overall, our study reinforces the idea that friendly practices in agriculture can contribute to biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Only limited research on conservation planning to mitigate the impacts of synergies between land use and climate change have been conducted in Asia. The objectives of this research were to determine shifts in habitats of 17 mammal species resulting from land-use and climate change scenarios in 2050 in northern Thailand and to assess the proposed expansion of protected areas to mitigate the predicted impacts. Qualitative vulnerability assessment of species was determined by using national conservation status, shifts in distribution and coping capacity of protected areas. The potential expansion areas were identified using gravity model. The results indicated that the existing protected areas cannot guarantee the long-term survival of many species. Most selected species would substantially shift their current distributions and will be upgraded from moderate to high-risk. The proposed expansion areas of 5,200 km(2)or 3% of the region would substantially minimize the risk level and increase the average coping capacity of the protection of suitable habitats from 82% as the current plan to 90%. Such patches adjoining existing protected areas should be included in the current system, while patches that are relatively far should be managed as stepping stones or habitat corridors to facilitate movements of wildlife in the landscape.

AB  - Intra-seasonal changes of the ecological needs and the distribution patterns of multi-brooded bird species are a poorly studied but potentially important topic in avian conservation planning. In this study of a passerine species of conservation concern, the woodlark Lullula arborea, we highlight the conservation implications of spatial shifts of breeding territories and changes of habitat requirements during the course of the breeding season. We described the factors affecting the distribution and habitat selection of this species in the Trebbia river valley (northern Apennines, Italy), where we mapped woodlark territories during the average time of first and second clutches. A strong shift of territories towards higher altitudes with the progression of the season was observed. The habitat models predicting woodlark occurrence varied between the early and the late period. Specifically, fodder cover positively predicted occurrence early in the season, whereas late in the season occurrence was positively influenced by shrub cover, length of woodland edge, alfalfa cover and rocky areas. Accordingly, territories that were occupied throughout the entire season had greater fodder, shrub and rocky cover compared with those that were occupied only early in the season, suggesting that these variables were important in determining territory quality for woodlarks. Therefore, changing ecological needs of multi-brooded bird species during the breeding season have to be taken into account for defining appropriate conservation strategies. This was demonstrated by showing that the habitat variables predicting woodlark occurrence early in the season poorly predicted occurrence late in the season and vice versa. In conclusion, this study provides the first detailed assessment of habitat factors affecting the occurrence of breeding woodlarks in an important portion of the species' range, and represents the first explicit attempt to model seasonally changing ecological requirements of bird species for conservation purposes. Our findings suggest that complex data and flexible habitat management strategies are required to account for temporal changes in habitat suitability in multi-brooded bird species.

AB  - We reassessed the extinction risk of the species Polianthes densiflora, P. howardii, P. longiflora, P. palustris and P. platyphylla by applying the MER (method of evaluation of extinction risk of wild species for Mexico). These species are listed as rare by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and are considered to be in the category of special protection according to Mexican regulation. MER criterion A (geographic distribution) was assessed with three methods: area of occupancy, extent of ocurrence, and species distribution models. Criteria B (habitat conditions) and D (impact of human activity) were examined by superimposing the human footprint map of Sanderson et al., where values range from 0 to 100. In this map, 0-10 denote pristine areas and 100 indicates that the habitat has been completely transformed. Criterion C (intrinsic biological vulnerability) was assigned based on the geophytic nature of the species. According to our findings, Polianthes densiflora and P. longiflora are in danger of extinction, while P. howardii and P. platyphylla are endangered and P. palustris is likely extinct. None of the five species concerned occur in any Natural Protected Area. We propose in situ and ex situ strategies to maintain these species as well as the development of programs of sustainable use for Polianthes longiflora and P. platyphylla. These species could be cultivated and domesticated by means of vegetative propagation.

AB  - Spatial prioritization in conservation is required to direct limited resources to where actions are most urgently needed and most likely to produce effective conservation outcomes. In an effort to advance the protection of a highly threatened hotspot of marine biodiversity, the Mediterranean Sea, multiple spatial conservation plans have been developed in recent years. Here, we review and integrate these different plans with the goal of identifying priority conservation areas that represent the current consensus among the different initiatives. A review of six existing and twelve proposed conservation initiatives highlights gaps in conservation and management planning, particularly within the southern and eastern regions of the Mediterranean and for offshore and deep sea habitats. The eighteen initiatives vary substantially in their extent (covering 0.1-58.5% of the Mediterranean Sea) and in the location of additional proposed conservation and management areas. Differences in the criteria, approaches and data used explain such variation. Despite the diversity among proposals, our analyses identified ten areas, encompassing 10% of the Mediterranean Sea, that are consistently identified among the existing proposals, with an additional 10% selected by at least five proposals. These areas represent top priorities for immediate conservation action. Despite the plethora of initiatives, major challenges face Mediterranean biodiversity and conservation. These include the need for spatial prioritization within a comprehensive framework for regional conservation planning, the acquisition of additional information from data-poor areas, species or habitats, and addressing the challenges of establishing transboundary governance and collaboration in socially, culturally and politically complex conditions. Collective prioritised action, not new conservation plans, is needed for the north, western, and high seas of the Mediterranean, while developing initial information-based plans for the south and eastern Mediterranean is an urgent requirement for true regional conservation planning.

AB  - Habitat destruction and overhunting are two major drivers of mammal population declines and extinctions in tropical forests. The construction of roads can be a catalyst for these two threats. In Southeast Asia, the impacts of roads on mammals have not been well-documented at a regional scale. Before evidence-based conservation strategies can be developed to minimize the threat of roads to endangered mammals within this region, we first need to locate where and how roads are contributing to the conversion of their habitats and illegal hunting in each country. We interviewed 36 experts involved in mammal research from seven Southeast Asian countries to identify roads that are contributing the most, in their opinion, to habitat conversion and illegal hunting. Our experts highlighted 16 existing and eight planned roads - these potentially threaten 21% of the 117 endangered terrestrial mammals in those countries. Apart from gathering qualitative evidence from the literature to assess their claims, we demonstrate how species-distribution models, satellite imagery and animal-sign surveys can be used to provide quantitative evidence of roads causing impacts by (1) cutting through habitats where endangered mammals are likely to occur, (2) intensifying forest conversion, and (3) contributing to illegal hunting and wildlife trade. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to identify specific roads threatening endangered mammals in Southeast Asia. Further through highlighting the impacts of roads, we propose 10 measures to limit road impacts in the region.

AB  - In Southeast Asia, the Annamite mountains and Central Vietnam lowlands are two of the most prioritized areas for preventing the extinction of large populations of phasianids. Ground-feeding birds in Southeast Asia may be going extinct, both inside and outside the protected areas, due to habitat loss and poaching, especially, snaring. Being endemic to the mainland of Southeast Asia, the crested argus is one of the largest and most threatened species of Phasianidae. Indeed, the crested argus has recently been upgraded to the "endangered" category from the "near-threatened" category in the IUCN RedList. Quantitative data on the occurrence of the crested argus for guiding conservation efforts is poor. Additionally, information on the species' ecology is limited. In this study, we used autonomous recorders to detect the presence of the crested argus and to estimate its occurrence probability in Song Thanh Nature Reserve, Vietnam. We also examined the effects of environmental variables on the species' distribution in space. We used four Song Meter SM3 recorders to record the calls of the crested argus at 38 recording posts from February to April 2019. We used RAVEN software to analyze the sound data. We used the Occupancy Estimation in MARK to estimate the detection probability and the occurrence probability. Elevation had a slight negative effect on occurrence probability. The occurrence probability of the crested argus was high (0.88; CI: 0.60 - 0.97). The high occurrence probability in the Song Thanh Nature Reserve reveals the importance of this protected area in galliform species conservation in general and for the crested argus in particular.

AB  - The distribution of mobile species in dynamic systems can vary greatly over time and space. Estimating their population size and geographic range can be problematic and affect the accuracy of conservation assessments. Scarce data on mobile species and the resources they need can also limit the type of analytical approaches available to derive such estimates. We quantified change in availability and use of key ecological resources required for breeding for a critically endangered nomadic habitat specialist, the Swift Parrot (Lathamus discolor). We compared estimates of occupied habitat derived from dynamic presence-background (i.e., presence-only data) climatic models with estimates derived from dynamic occupancy models that included a direct measure of food availability. We then compared estimates that incorporate fine-resolution spatial data on the availability of key ecological resources (i.e., functional habitats) with more common approaches that focus on broader climatic suitability or vegetation cover (due to the absence of fine-resolution data). The occupancy models produced significantly (P < 0.001) smaller (up to an order of magnitude) and more spatially discrete estimates of the total occupied area than climate-based models. The spatial location and extent of the total area occupied with the occupancy models was highly variable between years (131 and 1498 km(2)). Estimates accounting for the area of functional habitats were significantly smaller (2-58% [SD 16]) than estimates based only on the total area occupied. An increase or decrease in the area of one functional habitat (foraging or nesting) did not necessarily correspond to an increase or decrease in the other. Thus, an increase in the extent of occupied area may not equate to improved habitat quality or function. We argue these patterns are typical for mobile resource specialists but often go unnoticed because of limited data over relevant spatial and temporal scales and lack of spatial data on the availability of key resources. Understanding changes in the relative availability of functional habitats is crucial to informing conservation planning and accurately assessing extinction risk for mobile resource specialists.

AB  - Much of what is known about avian species-habitat relations has been derived from studies of birds at local scales. It is entirely unclear whether the relations observed at these scales translate to the larger landscape in a predictable linear fashion. We derived habitat models and mapped predicted abundances for three forest bird species of eastern North America using bird counts, environmental variables, and hierarchical models applied at three spatial scales. Our purpose was to understand habitat associations at multiple spatial scales and create predictive abundance maps for purposes of conservation planning at a landscape scale given the constraint that the variables used in this exercise were derived from local-level studies. Our models indicated a substantial influence of landscape context for all species, many of which were counter to reported associations at finer spatial extents. We found land cover composition provided the greatest contribution to the relative explained variance in counts for all three species; spatial structure was second in importance. No single spatial scale dominated any model, indicating that these species are responding to factors at multiple spatial scales. For purposes of conservation planning, areas of predicted high abundance should be investigated to evaluate the conservation potential of the landscape in their general vicinity. In addition, the models and spatial patterns of abundance among species suggest locations where conservation actions may benefit more than one species.

AB  - Surrogates are used in conservation planning to select sites to represent species when information about species' geographical distributions is insufficient. Many surrogates for biodiversity have used biotic (e.g., vegetation assemblages) or biogeographic distributions of a group of species (e.g., birds) that are easier to inventory than more cryptic species of interest. Because knowledge of species geographical distributions is mostly limited, environmental diversity (ED), an approach that uses environmental dissimilarity between sites to select areas for conservation, is a promising alternative surrogacy strategy. While studies in the terrestrial realms justify further investigations of the effectiveness of ED as a surrogate to determine conservation priority of sites, ours represents a significant expansion of this focus to consider the marine realm. In this study, we defined environmental space using nine variables and evaluated ED as a surrogate of global marine mammal species. We found that ED is an effective surrogacy strategy for marine mammals: sites selected to span environmental diversity represented 61% more marine mammals, on average, than a random subset of sites. Although the effectiveness of ED has been demonstrated in previous studies of terrestrial vertebrates, we believe this is the first time ED is assessed as a surrogate in marine systems at the global scale. Our findings suggest that ED may also be useful to prioritize sites for conservation of other marine taxa. (C) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

AB  - Throughout Africa, conservancies under community and private management are becoming increasingly important as a complement to the protection offered by the established core network of protected areas (PAs), which are largely under national management. However, opportunities for creating new conservation areas are restricted by increasing demand on land use by growing human populations, and it is unclear how effectively the current protected area network captures spatial priorities for conservation. Taking into account climate-induced range-shifts, we first identified spatial priorities for antelope conservation in Africa by gap analysis of the network of PAs listed with an IUCN category in the World Database for Protected Areas. For three countries from which information were available, we then assessed to what extent the gaps identified were covered by PAs not listed with an IUCN category, for the latter making a distinction between whether management was referred to as community-based or not. The results showed limited overlap, suggesting that the success of community-based and privately managed PAs in covering spatial priorities from a continent-wide perspective could be increased by more strategic land use planning at the national level.

AB  - The potential effects of global climate change on marine protected areas do not appear to have been addressed in the literature. This paper examines the literature on protected areas, conservation biology, marine ecology, oceanography, and climate change, and reviews some of the relevant differences between marine and terrestrial environments. Frameworks and classifications systems used in protected area design are discussed. Finally, a framework that summarizes some of the important oceanographic processes and their links to the food chain are reviewed. Species abundance and distribution are expected to change as a result of global climate change, potentially compromising the efficacy of marine protected areas as biodiversity conservation tools. This review suggests the need for: further interdisciplinary research and the use of linked models; an increase in marine protected areas for biodiversity conservation and as research sites for teasing apart fishing effects from climate effects; a temporally responsive approach to siting new marine protected areas, shifting their locations if necessary; and large-scale ecosystem/integrated management approaches to address the competing uses of the oceans and boundary-less threats such as global climate change and pollution.

AB  - Mountaintop rupestrian grasslands or campos rupestres are unique ecosystems with high plant biodiversity. The southern Espinhaco mountains in Brazil are particularly important because they currently harbor 255 threatened plant species at risk of extinction owing to overspread farming, mining and uncontrolled fire in the region. Using the best available data on the distribution of these threatened species, distribution of farming and mining activities, and up-to-date data on fire frequency, here we developed a systematic conservation plan for all these species and pinpointed priority regions for taking different conservation actions. We found that it is possible to protect, on average, more than 25% of the threatened species ranges, avoiding sites with extensive use for farming and mining and favoring areas with intensive fire frequency while constraining the management to a relatively small area of only 17% of the region. The analysis accounts for what is already protected within protected areas in the region and is, therefore, complementary to the work already held by the actors and environmental organizations of the region. We offer maps of priority areas with their respective level of protection and suggest conservation actions at different levels of engagement to be implemented in the priority areas. These priority areas are part of a national species recovery plan for the region in Brazil and will likely support stakeholders and decision makers in its application in the forthcoming years.

AB  - 1. Biogeographical models of species' distributions are essential tools for assessing impacts of changing environmental conditions on natural communities and ecosystems. Practitioners need more reliable predictions to integrate into conservation planning (e.g. reserve design and management).
   2. Most models still largely ignore or inappropriately take into account important features of species' distributions, such as spatial autocorrelation, dispersal and migration, biotic and environmental interactions. Whether distributions of natural communities or ecosystems are better modelled by assembling individual species' predictions in a bottom-up approach or modelled as collective entities is another important issue. An international workshop was organized to address these issues.
   3. We discuss more specifically six issues in a methodological framework for generalized regression: (i) links with ecological theory; (ii) optimal use of existing data and artificially generated data; (iii) incorporating spatial context; (iv) integrating ecological and environmental interactions; (v) assessing prediction errors and uncertainties; and (vi) predicting distributions of communities or collective properties of biodiversity.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Better predictions of the effects of impacts on biological communities and ecosystems can emerge only from more robust species' distribution models and better documentation of the uncertainty associated with these models. An improved understanding of causes of species' distributions, especially at their range limits, as well as of ecological assembly rules and ecosystem functioning, is necessary if further progress is to be made. A better collaborative effort between theoretical and functional ecologists, ecological modellers and statisticians is required to reach these goals.

AB  - Avian influenza A, a highly pathogenic avian influenza, is a lethal infection in certain species of wild birds, including some endangered species. Raptors are susceptible to avian influenza, and spatial risk assessment of such species may be valuable for conservation planning. We used the maximum entropy approach to generate potential distribution models of three raptor species from presence-only data for the mountain hawk-eagle Nisaetus nipalensis, northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis and peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus, surveyed during the winter from 1996 to 2001. These potential distribution maps for raptors were superimposed on avian influenza A risk maps of Japan, created from data on incidence of the virus in wild birds throughout Japan from October 2010 to March 2011. The avian influenza A risk map for the mountain hawk-eagle showed that most regions of Japan had a low risk for avian influenza A. In contrast, the maps for the northern goshawk and peregrine falcon showed that their high-risk areas were distributed on the plains along the Sea of Japan and Pacific coast. We recommend enhanced surveillance for each raptor species in high-risk areas and immediate establishment of inspection systems. At the same time, ecological risk assessments that determine factors, such as the composition of prey species, and differential sensitivity of avian influenza A virus between bird species should provide multifaceted insights into the total risk assessment of endangered species.

AB  - Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus) is a species of special concern and is currently considered a candidate species under Endangered Species Act. Careful management is therefore required to ensure that suitable habitat is maintained, particularly because much of the species' current distribution is faced with exurban development pressures. We assessed hierarchical nest site selection patterns of Gunnison sage-grouse inhabiting the western portion of the Gunnison Basin, Colorado, USA, at multiple spatial scales, using logistic regression-based resource selection functions. Models were selected using Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) and predictive surfaces were generated using model averaged relative probabilities. Landscape-scale factors that had the most influence on nest site selection included the proportion of sagebrush cover >5%, mean productivity, and density of 2 wheel-drive roads. The landscape-scale predictive surface captured 97% of known Gunnison sage-grouse nests within the top 5 of 10 prediction bins, implicating 57% of the basin as crucial nesting habitat. Crucial habitat identified by the landscape model was used to define the extent for patch-scale modeling efforts. Patch-scale variables that had the greatest influence on nest site selection were the proportion of big sagebrush cover >10%, distance to residential development, distance to high volume paved roads, and mean productivity. This model accurately predicted independent nest locations. The unique hierarchical structure of our models more accurately captures the nested nature of habitat selection, and allowed for increased discrimination within larger landscapes of suitable habitat. We extrapolated the landscape-scale model to the entire Gunnison Basin because of conservation concerns for this species. We believe this predictive surface is a valuable tool which can be incorporated into land use and conservation planning as well the assessment of future land-use scenarios.

AB  - Habitat corridors that facilitate functional connectivity are a fundamental component of wildlife conservation in fragmented landscapes. However, the landscape matrix separating suitable habitat is not uniformly impermeable to movement and management to increase matrix permeability could be an alternative means to maintain connectivity. Gliding mammals are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because their movements are constrained by glide distance thresholds. Populations of gliders in cities are at risk of being isolated by increasing habitat loss and urban development, yet little is known about how the urban matrix affects glider movement. Here we investigate how the level of urbanization and tree cover in the matrix influence matrix permeability to sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) within suburban forest reserves. Twenty-two sugar gliders were radio-tracked over winter and summer at four reserves. Boundary crossing behaviour was measured as the number of times each glider crossed into the matrix, and matrix permeability was determined as the maximum distance travelled by gliders into the matrix. The majority of gliders (81%) were located in the matrix at least once, and rates of boundary crossing were consistent across urbanization and tree cover levels. Matrix permeability was negatively affected by matrix urbanization, but not by matrix tree cover, and no interaction effects were found. Although distances travelled by gliders into the matrix did not exceed 180m, they were comparable with typical movement distances by gliders in reserves. Our results demonstrate that the urban matrix can provide suitable habitat for gliding mammals to move and forage, but that increased urbanization may inhibit glider use of the matrix irrespective of tree cover. This finding has implications for conservation planning and suggests that structurally connected areas may not be used if movement behaviour is inhibited. Conversely, management of matrix permeability could be used to maintain connectivity without needing to construct physical corridors.

AB  - Knowing the potential distribution of species helps to focus conservation efforts more effectively, mainly when dealing with endangered species. The aim of this study was to generate potential distribution models for four species of small wild felids in Mexico (Leopardus pardalis, Leopardus wiedii, Lynx rufus and Puma yagouaroundi). The models were generated based on felids presence records, and topographic, anthropic and vegetation drivers. We used 473 records (171 for L. pardalis, 140 for L. wiedii, 86 for L. rufus and 76 for P. yagouaroundi) to build eleven models per species to then select the three with the best performance and included them in ensemble models. These were based on the formula of the weighted average, which considers the performance of the algorithms evaluated with a subsample of testing records, from which the area under the curve is calculated. In this way, in the ensemble model the consistent zones between algorithms are included, but the one with the best performance predominates. The species with the largest potential distribution area was L. pardalis with 34.3% of the national territory, while L. rufus had the smallest area (14.3%). In the four species a unique set of variables was identified that influence the probability of presence, however the altitude, the arid vegetation and the population density were important variables for three of the four species. We verified our models with recently published presence records. The results of this study reflect a robust analysis of the current and potential distribution of four species of wild felids in Mexico. In addition to being the first step to develop effective conservation strategies at national and local levels. (C) 2019 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The availability of marine habitats maps remains limited due to difficulty and cost of working at sea. Reduced light penetration in the water hampers the use of optical imagery, and acoustic methods require extensive sea truth activities. Predictive spatial modelling may offer an alternative to produce benthic habitat maps based on complete acoustic coverage of the seafloor together with a comparatively low number of sea truths. This approach was applied to the coralligenous reefs of the Marine Protected Area of Tavolara - Punta Coda Cavallo (NE Sardinia, Italy). Fuzzy clustering, applied to a set of observations made by scuba diving and used as sea truth, allowed recognising five coralligenous habitats, all but one existing within EUNIS (European Nature Information System) types. Variable importance plots showed that the distribution of habitats was driven by distance from coast, depth, and lithotype, and allowed mapping their distribution over the MPA. Congruence between observed and predicted distributions and accuracy of the classification was high. Results allowed calculating the occurrence of the distinct coralligenous habitats in zones with different protection level. The five habitats are unequally protected since the protection regime was established when detailed marine habitat maps were not available. A SWOT (Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats) analysis was performed to identify critical points and potentialities of the method. The method developed proved to be reliable and the results obtained will be useful when modulating on-going and future management actions in the studied area and in other Mediterranean MPAs to develop conservation efforts at basin scale.

AB  - 1. Species distribution models (habitat models) relate the occurrence or abundance of a species to environmental and/or geographical predictors that then allow predictions to be mapped across an entire region. These models are used in a range of policy settings such as managing greenhouse gases, biosecurity threats and conservation planning. Prediction errors are almost ubiquitous in habitat models. An understanding of the source, magnitude and pattern of these errors is essential if the models are to be used transparently in decision making.
   2. This study considered the sources of errors in habitat models. It divided them into two main classes, error resulting from data deficiencies and error introduced by the specification of the model. Common and important data errors included missing covariates, and samples of species' occurrences that were small, biased or lack absences. These affected the types of models that could be developed and the probable errors that would occur. Almost all models had missing covariates, and this introduced significant spatial correlation in the errors of the analysis.
   3. A challenging aspect of modelling is that species' distributions are affected by processes operating in both environmental and geographical space. We differentiated between global (aspatial) and local (spatial) errors, and discussed how they arise and what can be done to alleviate their effects.
   4. Synthesis and applications. This study brings together statistical and ecological thinking to consider the appropriate techniques for habitat modelling. Ecological theory suggests models capable of defining optima, while allowing for interactions between variables. Statistical considerations, including impacts of data errors, suggest models that deal with multimodality and discontinuity in response surfaces. Models are typically simple approximations of the true probability surface. We suggest the use of flexible regression techniques, and explain what makes such methods superior for ecological modelling. The most robust modelling approaches are likely to be those in which care is taken to match the model with knowledge of ecology, and in which each is allowed to inform the other.

AB  - Climate change presents a potentially severe threat to biodiversity. Species will be required to disperse rapidly through fragmented landscapes in order to keep pace with the changing climate. An important challenge for conservation is therefore to manage landscapes so as to assist species in tracking the environmental conditions to which they are adapted. Here we develop a stochastic spatially explicit model to simulate plant dispersal across artificial fragmented landscapes. Based on certain assumptions as to the dispersal mechanism, we assess the impact that varying potential for rare long-distance dispersal (LDD) has on the ability to move over landscapes with differing spatial arrangements of suitable habitat (clumped versus fragmented). Simulations demonstrate how the relative importance of landscape structure in determining migration ability may decrease as the potential for LDD increases. Thus, if LDD is the principal mechanism by which rapid large-scale migrations are achieved, strategically planned networks of protected habitat may have a limited impact on rates of large-scale plant migrations. We relate our results to conventional principles for conservation planning and the geometric design of reserves, and demonstrate how reversal of these principles may maximise the potential for conservation under future climates. In particular, we caution against the justification of large-scale corridors on grounds of climate change since migration along corridors by standard dispersal mechanisms is unlikely to keep pace with projected change for many species. An improved understanding of the dispersal mechanisms by which species achieve rapid migrations, and the way that these processes are affected by patterns of landscape fragmentation, will be important to inform future conservation strategies.

AB  - Ecologically sensitive regions (ESRs) are the 'ecological units' with the exceptional biotic and abiotic elements. Identification of ESRs considering spatially both ecological and social dimensions of environmental variables helps in ecological and conservation planning as per Biodiversity Act, 2002, Government of India. The current research attempts to integrate ecological and environmental considerations into administration, and prioritizes regions at Panchayat levels (local administrative unit) in Uttara Kannada district, Central Western Ghats, Karnataka state considering attributes (biological, Geo-climatic, Social, etc.) as ESR (1-4) through weightage score metrics. The region has the distinction of having highest forest area (80.48%) in Karnataka State, India and has been undergoing severe anthropogenic pressures impacting biogeochemistry, hydrology, food security, climate and socio-economic systems. Prioritisation of ESRs helps in the implementation of the sustainable developmental framework with the appropriate conservation strategies through the involvement of local stakeholders.

AB  - Estimating habitat availability at large spatial scales is critical for identifying conservation and management priorities for birds. Given the effects of patch size on habitat selection and productivity of many bird species, large-scale approaches often focus on identifying and enumerating patches large enough to support sustainable populations. Declines in the availability of bottomland hardwood forests have made this approach imperative for species that depend on these forests. However, most remaining bottomland forests are relatively low-elevation sites that were difficult to convert to agriculture. For species that require densely vegetated understories or well-developed litter layers, such as Swainson's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii), these relatively flood-prone forests may not provide suitable habitat and, consequently, current prioritization methods may overestimate habitat availability. We examined the effect of elevation on estimates of habitat availability for Swainson's Warblers in a 65,000-ha bottomland hardwood forest (White River National Wildlife Refuge) in eastern Arkansas. We detected Swainson's Warblers at 88 of 2222 sampled points, and Swainson's Warblers only used relatively high elevations in the refuge. Based on our estimates, about 25% of the refuge is at a suitable elevation for Swainson's Warblers. Without considering elevation, this refuge would support an estimated 7000 to 7600 pairs, but, when elevation is considered, the estimated number of pairs drops to 1500-2000 pairs. In reality, because of a lack of suitable seral stages at high elevations in the refuge, this area likely supports only 75-100 pairs. For Swainson's Warblers and other understory-dependent bottomland species, elevation should be incorporated into conservation planning to obtain accurate estimates of habitat availability. In addition, management should be focused on these high-elevation areas to maximize habitat availability for these species of concern.

AB  - Greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus (Bonaparte) currently occupy approximately half of their historical distribution across western North America. Sage-grouse are a candidate for endangered species listing due to habitat and population fragmentation coupled with inadequate regulation to control development in critical areas. Conservation planning would benefit from accurate maps delineating required habitats and movement corridors. However, developing a species distribution model that incorporates the diversity of habitats used by sage-grouse across their widespread distribution has statistical and logistical challenges. We first identified the ecological minimums limiting sage-grouse, mapped similarity to the multivariate set of minimums, and delineated connectivity across a 920,000km2 region. We partitioned a Mahalanobis D2 model of habitat use into k separate additive components each representing independent combinations of species-habitat relationships to identify the ecological minimums required by sage-grouse. We constructed the model from abiotic, land cover, and anthropogenic variables measured at leks (breeding) and surrounding areas within 5km. We evaluated model partitions using a random subset of leks and historic locations and selected D2 (k=10) for mapping a habitat similarity index (HSI). Finally, we delineated connectivity by converting the mapped HSI to a resistance surface. Sage-grouse required sagebrush-dominated landscapes containing minimal levels of human land use. Sage-grouse used relatively arid regions characterized by shallow slopes, even terrain, and low amounts of forest, grassland, and agriculture in the surrounding landscape. Most populations were interconnected although several outlying populations were isolated because of distance or lack of habitat corridors for exchange. Land management agencies currently are revising land-use plans and designating critical habitat to conserve sage-grouse and avoid endangered species listing. Our results identifying attributes important for delineating habitats or modeling connectivity will facilitate conservation and management of landscapes important for supporting current and future sage-grouse populations.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change is affecting biodiversity. Reducing or stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions may slow global warming, but past emissions will continue to contribute to further unavoidable warming for more than a century. With obvious signs of difficulties in achieving effective mitigation worldwide in the short term at least, sound scientific predictions of future impacts on biodiversity will be required to guide conservation planning and adaptation. This is especially true in Mediterranean type ecosystems that are projected to be among the most significantly affected by anthropogenic climate change, and show the highest levels of confidence in rainfall projections. Multiple methods are available for projecting the consequences of climate change on the main unit of interest - the species - with each method having strengths and weaknesses. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied for forecasting climate change impacts on species geographic ranges. Aggregation of models for different species allows inferences of impacts on biodiversity, though excluding the effects of species interactions. The modelling approach is based on several further assumptions and projections and should be treated cautiously. In the absence of comparable approaches that address large numbers of species, SDMs remain valuable in estimating the vulnerability of species. In this review we discuss the application of SDMs in predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with special reference to the species-rich South West Australian Floristic Region and South African Cape Floristic Region. We discuss the advantages and challenges in applying SDMs in biodiverse regions with high levels of endemicity, and how a similar biogeographical history in both regions may assist us in understanding their vulnerability to climate change. We suggest how the process of predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with SDMs can be improved and emphasize the role of field monitoring and experiments in validating the predictions of SDMs.

AB  - The diversity of stream anurans in Southeast Asia is highly endangered by habitat loss and fragmentation. To optimise conservation planning, their distribution patterns and habitat requirements need to be better understood. In this study, we investigated the distribution and habitat requirements of stream-associated anurans across four sites in north-western Borneo. The sites showed differences in species richness and composition. At a local scale, only microhabitat parameters and stream dynamics had a significant explanatory power on species composition. At a regional scale, environmental variables and geographical distances were both correlated with species composition, with adjacent locations having more similar species assemblages than distant locations. In order to protect the diversity of riparian anurans of north-western Borneo, protected areas need to include distant sites within the same region in addition to a diversity of habitats.

AB  - Environmental policies and the objective of no net loss highlight the importance of preserving ecological networks to limit the fragmentation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss, especially due to urbanization. In the environmental impact assessment context, habitat connectivity and the spatio-temporal dynamics of biodiversity are crucial to obtaining reliable predictions that can support decision-making. We propose a methodological framework 1) to quantify the overall impact of a development project on the functioning of an ecological network, and 2) to select the best locations for implanting new habitat patches intended to enhance landscape connectivity. The amount of reachable habitat concept was applied to three representative terrestrial mammal species: the red squirrel, the Eurasian badger and the European hedgehog. All three species are recognized as vulnerable to human pressures and potentially affected by the construction of a new stadium in our study site, Lyon (Southern France). The method combines the species distribution model Maxent with the landscape functional connectivity model Graphab. The results showed that using any one of the avoidance and reduction measures on its own was unsuccessful in achieving the objective of no net loss when habitat connectivity is considered. However, the combination of new habitat patches and corridors offered a higher gain than distinct measures. This is especially important in the short term, when new hedgerow plantations have not yet developed enough to be used by the target species. Our findings indicate, first, the need to take the temporal scale into account in environmental impact assessment. We also show that applying the optimal scenario, constructed using a cumulative patch addition followed by a similar process testing a set of potential land-use changes, maximizes habitat connectivity. Our methodology provides a useful tool to increase target species' habitat connectivity within the mitigation hierarchy and to enhance development project design for increased environmental efficiency.

AB  - In biogeography the competitive exclusion principle (CEP) has been confirmed in some cases but not in others. This has fueled an unresolved debate between those advocating niche theory or the neutral theory in biodiversity and biogeography. We suggest that this situation mainly arises from the use of crisp logic, where the CEP is defined as either completely true or false. We propose the application of the fuzzy concepts of favorability (the degree to which environmental conditions are propitious for the occurrence of individual species) and favorableness (the degree to which environmental conditions are simultaneously favorable for competing species) to operationalize a fuzzy version of the CEP. Favorability was obtained by performing species distribution models applying favorability functions, while favorableness was derived from the application of the fuzzy intersection between the favorability for competing species. Then we plotted individual favorability values along the gradient of favorableness. Two potentially competing species would coexist in high-favorableness locations, as the demands of both species would be well fulfilled. In locations of low favorableness, the result would be either autecological exclusion of both species or autecological segregation, as abiotic conditions are unfavorable for at least one of the species. Competitive exclusion would occur at the intermediate stretch of the favorableness gradient, as the conditions would be good enough for persistence of each species separately but not enough for permanent coexistence. According to this theoretical framework, the observed probability that a location belongs to the intermediate favorableness area given that the two species co-occur in this location should be lower than expected according to the environmental probability models for the two species. We tested this prediction on published data about the distribution of pairs of native and introduced deer species in Great Britain, using a Bayesian approach. In two thirds of comparisons between a native and an introduced deer species the predictions of the fuzzy CEP were corroborated, which suggests that these are the pairs of species and the specific geographical areas affected by competitive exclusion. This is important both theoretically and for biodiversity conservation planning.

AB  - Two ecologically and economically important, and threatened Dipterocarp trees Sal (Shorea robusta) and Garjan (Dipterocarpus turbinatus) form mono-specific canopies in dry deciduous, moist deciduous, evergreen, and semievergreen forests across South Asia and continental parts of Southeast Asia. They provide valuable timber and play an important role in the economy of many Asian countries. However, both Dipterocarp trees are threatened by continuing forest clearing, habitat alteration, and global climate change. While climatic regimes in the Asian tropics are changing, research on climate change-driven shifts in the distribution of tropical Asian trees is limited. We applied a bioclimatic modeling approach to these two Dipterocarp trees Sal and Garjan. We used presence-only records for the tree species, five bioclimatic variables, and selected two climatic scenarios (RCP4.5: an optimistic scenario and RCP8.5: a pessimistic scenario) and three global climate models (GCMs) to encompass the full range of variation in the models. We modeled climate space suitability for both species, projected to 2070, using a climate envelope modeling tool "MaxEnt" (the maximum entropy algorithm). Annual precipitation was the key bioclimatic variable in all GCMs for explaining the current and future distributions of Sal and Garjan (Sal: 49.97 +/- 1.33; Garjan: 37.63 +/- 1.19). Our models predict that suitable climate space for Sal will decline by 24% and 34% (the mean of the three GCMs) by 2070 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. In contrast, the consequences of imminent climate change appear less severe for Garjan, with a decline of 17% and 27% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The findings of this study can be used to set conservation guidelines for Sal and Garjan by identifying vulnerable habitats in the region. In addition, the natural habitats of Sal and Garjan can be categorized as low to high risk under changing climates where artificial regeneration should be undertaken for forest restoration.

AB  - Spatial management of fish populations can potentially be optimised by incorporating responses to environmental variables, such as diel, tidal, lunar and seasonal factors, but individual variability in habitat use and behaviour may complicate such efforts. Acoustic tagging and tracking of 84 Lethrinus nebulosus in the Ningaloo Marine Park indicated that sizes of individual habitat utilisation kernels were similar across diel and tidal cycles, but varied greatly among individuals. Clearly differentiated diel and tidal habitat use patterns were evident in significant proportions of individuals, particularly in relation to tidal phase. For the majority of residents, home-range sizes were reasonably stable over periods of 2-4 years, but in some cases core areas did shift over time. At seasonal time scales, peaks of seasonal activity and home range area were recorded during spawning season (October-December). Long-distance return migrations to spawning locations were observed that were among the longest observed for any reef fish (over 130km). Suspected spawning-related movements were recorded almost exclusively in fish >500-mm fork length, and were semilunar, following quarter moons in October-December. Significant individual-level variability in movement and habitat use patterns, evident across multiple temporal scales, has important implications for the management of L. nebulosus populations.

AB  - Questions: Does the plant species composition of Thandiani sub Forests Division (TsFD) correlate with edaphic, topographic and climatic variables? Is it possible to identify different plant communities in relation to environmental gradients with special emphasis on indicator species? Can this approach to vegetation classification support conservation planning?
   Location: Thandiani sub Forests Division, Western Himalayas.
   Methods: Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of species along with environmental variables were measured using a randomly stratified design to identify the major plant communities and indicator species of the Thandiani sub Forests Division. Species composition was recorded in 10 x 2.5 x 2 and 0.5 x 0.5 m square plots for trees, shrubs and herbs, respectively. GPS, edaphic and topographic data were also recorded for each sample plot. A total of 1500 quadrats were established in 50 sampling stations along eight altitudinal transects encompassing eastern, western, northern and southern aspects (slopes). The altitudinal range of the study area was 1290 m to 2626 m above sea level using. The relationships between species composition and environmental variables were analyzed using Two Way Cluster Analysis (TWCA) and Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) via PCORD version 5.
   Results: A total of 252 plant species belonging to 97 families were identified. TWCA and ISA recognized five plant communities. ISA additionally revealed that mountain slope aspect, soil pH and soil electrical conductivity were the strongest environmental factors (p <= 0.05) determining plant community composition and indicator species in each habitat. The results also show the strength of the environment-species relationship using Monte Carlo procedures.
   Conclusions: An analysis of vegetation along an environmental gradient in the Thandiani sub Forests Division using the Braun-Blanquet approach confirmed by robust tools of multivariate statistics identified indicators of each sort of microclimatic zones/vegetation communities which could further be used in conservation planning and management not only in the area studied but in the adjacent regions exhibit similar sort of environmental conditions.

AB  - Conservation planning relies on integrating existing knowledge, social-environmental contexts, and potential threats to identify gaps and opportunities for action. Here we present a case study on how priority areas for conservation can be determined using existing information on biodiversity occurrence and threats. Specifically, our goals are: (1) to model the ecological niche of twelve endemic snake species in the Dry Chaco Forest, (2) to quantify the impact of the deforestation rates on their distributions, (3) to propose high priority areas for conservation in order to improve the actual protected area system, and (4) to evaluate the influence of the human footprint on the optimization of selected priority areas. Our results demonstrate that Argentinian Dry Chaco represent, on average, similar to 74% of the distribution of endemic snake species and deforestation has reduced suitable areas of all snake species in the region. Further, the current protected areas are likely insufficient to conserve these species as only very low percentages (3.27%) of snakes' ranges occur within existing protected areas. Our models identified high priority areas in the north of the Chaco forest where continuous, well-conserved forest still exists. These high priority areas include transition zones within the foothill forest and areas that could connect patches of forest between the western and eastern Chaco forest. Our findings identify spatial priorities that minimize conflicts with human activities, a key issue for this biodiversity hotspot area. We argue that consultation with stakeholders and decision-makers are urgently needed in order to take concrete actions to protect the habitat, or we risk losing the best conservation opportunities to protect endemic snakes that inhabit the Argentinian Dry Chaco.

AB  - Capsule: Habitat structure and composition explained spatial variation in breeding distribution and nesting success in a declining upland Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata population in North Wales.
   Aims: To identify environmental correlates of Curlew breeding distribution, nesting success and change in distribution.
   Methods: Thirty random 1 km squares stratified by historical population trend were surveyed for Curlew density and nesting success, and habitat-and predation-related variables in a landscape containing agriculturally improved farmland, and moorland that was partly protected and subject to grazing reductions for nature conservation. Analyses tested for associations between Curlew measures and environmental variables.
   Results: Curlew breeding density declined by 29% between 1994 and 2008, and was highest in squares comprising a mixture of moorland and agriculturally improved farmland, and in squares with lower vegetation density and higher cover of Nardus stricta (characteristic of rough grazing). Nesting success was positively associated with cover of Trichophorum germanicum (characteristic of mire). Vegetation density was lower than average in squares with the highest Curlew densities, while in the protected area vegetation density was higher than average.
   Conclusion: Habitat and vegetation variables influenced Curlew distribution and nesting success in North Wales, largely in line with previous results but with no evidence for predator-related influences. Habitat condition for Curlew in the protected area could probably be increased through targeted increases in grazing alongside the protection of priority habitats.

AB  - Saline lakes, among the most seriously endangered ecosystems, are threatened due to climate change and human activities. One valuable feature of these environments is that they constitute areas of high biodiversity. Ecologists are, therefore, under great pressure to improve their understanding of the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on the biodiversity of saline lakes. In this study, a total of 257 samples from 32 soda pans in Central Europe between 2006 and 2015 were examined. The effects of environmental variables and of geographical and limnoecological factors on functional diversity were analyzed. Furthermore, the explanatory power of the trait-based approach was assessed, and the applicability of the indices for biomonitoring purposes was determined. It was found that low habitat heterogeneity and harsh environments lead to the selection of a small number of suitable traits, and consequently, to a naturally low level of functional diversity. Anthropogenic activities enhance diversity at functional level due to the shift toward freshwater characteristics. On the regional scale, the effects of the region and status (natural, degraded, reconstructed) on diatom functional diversity were significant and more pronounced than that of the environmental and other limnoecological factors. The degree of variance found in functional diversity ascribed to environmental variables is five times greater in the case of the application of a trait-based approach, than when a taxonomic one is employed in the literature. Each of the tested functional diversity indices was sensitive to the most important environmental variables. Furthermore, these were type-specific and proved to be more complex indicators than taxonomic metrics. It is possible to suggest four functional diversity indices (FGR, FRic, FDis, and FDiv) which emphasize their independence from substrate and seasonal variations for ecological status assessment and conservation planning.

AB  - Poyang Lake is China's largest freshwater lake in summer and provides important habitat for an internationally significant assemblage of waterbirds in winter. Human-caused alterations to this system threaten to compromise the long-term viability of these bird populations due to the role of water in driving habitat suitability. Little is known, however, about the patch-scale habitat selection strategies of waterbirds within Poyang. Consequently, there is potential for spatial incongruence between protected area boundaries and key habitats given the system's high variability. This study used scan and focal sampling techniques to investigate patch selection by a wintering population of the Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia) within the Sha Hu sub-lake basin of Poyang Lake. Eurasian Spoonbills averaged higher foraging success rates in areas with water depth of 28.1-36.6 cm compared to other areas and preferred to forage in this depth class, as indicated by usage disproportionate to availability (Manly's standardized selection index = 0.817). Defining the patch-scale habitat selection of this indicator species both quantifies the impact of hydrological changes on resource availability and spatially predicts suitable areas for wintering birdlife within a dynamic environment.

AB  - Sabellida are widespread, diverse and abundant in marine benthic habitats. Their distribution patterns on hard-bottom substrates are poorly studied so far. Little is known about the factors influencing their distribution, including the protection regimes that are known to affect assemblage diversity. We analyzed hard-bottom Sabellida at 1.5 and 5 m depths at the Torre Guaceto Marine Protected Area (MPA) (SE Italy) to describe diversity and distribution patterns, and to identify potential factors influencing their distribution. The Sabellida diversity varied significantly among stations and was higher at 5 m depth. No relation with the protection regime was found. Among environmental variables, only sedimentation appeared related, suggesting that local trophic features might have influenced the observed pattern. Among habitat formers, only the macroalga Halimeda tuna significantly explained part of the observed variation, probably due to its role as a basibiont for some Sabellida taxa. Other predictor variables of Sabellida distribution were the abundances of some invertebrate taxa, especially Syllidae and some filter feeders such as Sabellariida and Cirripedia, probably due to shared ecological requirements, rather than a direct effect on Sabellida distribution. The relation with the Syllidae remains obscure so far, albeit some kind of interaction (including predator/prey interactions) between these two taxa cannot be excluded. Sabellida should be taken into account when analyzing patterns of biodiversity of hard-bottom environments.

AB  - Four van Veen grab replicates where collected to sample macrofauna (organism retained on a 500 A mesh sieve) at four stations in the Gulf of Nicoya, during October 24, 1997, January 16 and April 30, 1998. This information was used to search for any effects of trawling on the benthic fauna. Two stations where located in a trawled area, and two stations where in a protected area. Diversity (H') varied from 2.01 to 3.52 in the trawled area and from 2.13 to 2.78 in the protected area. Diversity was generally higher in the trawled area, and this was in contradiction to what we would have expected from other studies where the trend has been that trawling reduces diversity. Brittlestars and lancelets seemed to be the groups mostly harmed by the trawling, while amphipods where more abundant in trawled areas. The multivariate analyses did not reveal the patterns of faunal change as well as we hoped. This is surely because of our lack of more replicate samples. The multivariate analyses are easily confounded when few sites are analyzed. We have found differences in the type of fauna found in trawled and protected areas and, considering the differences in environmental variables in our stations and our lack of replication, this indicates that there are differences and a larger investigation is in order to reveal its magnitude.

AB  - Wildlife management in rapid changing landscapes requires critical planning through cross cutting networks, and understanding of landscape features, often affected by the anthropogenic activities. The present study demonstrates fine-scale spatial patterns of genetic variation and contemporary gene flow of red panda (Ailurus fulgens) populations with respect to landscape connectivity in Kangchenjunga Landscape (KL), India. The study found about 1,309.54 km(2) area suitable for red panda in KL-India, of which 62.21% area fell under the Protected Area network. We identified 24 unique individuals from 234 feces collected at nine microsatellite loci. The spatially explicit and non-explicit Bayesian clustering algorithms evident to exhibit population structuring and supported red panda populations to exist in meta-population frame work. In concurrence to the habitat suitability and landscape connectivity models, gene flow results supported a contemporary asymmetric movement of red panda by connecting KL-India in a crescent arc. We demonstrate the structural-operational connectivity of corridors in KL-India that facilitated red panda movement in the past. We also seek for cooperation in Nepal, Bhutan and China to aid in preparing for a comprehensive monitoring plan for the long-term conservation and management of red panda in trans-boundary landscapes.

AB  - Grazing by large mammals alters vegetation physiognomy, consequently changing habitat suitability for small mammal communities. We investigated the response of terrestrial small mammals to grazing by wild and domesticated ungulates at the boundary of a protected area (Telperion Nature Reserve) and surrounding cattle ranches in Mpumalanga. South Africa over two seasons. Fifteen paired grids were set on either side of the boundary fence at which small mammals were trapped in Sherman live traps placed flat on the ground. A total of 11 760 trap nights resulted in the capture of 187 animals belonging to 14 species (11 rodents, two shrews and one elephant shrew). The small mammal communities in grasslands grazed by domesticated or wild ungulates were similar in abundance, species richness, diversity and demographic parameters, likely due to the fact that vegetation structure of the two grazing systems was also similar. We used generalised linear models to show that rock and grass cover were plausible predictors of small mammal abundance in this system. Rock cover showed a positive relationship with small mammal abundance whilst grass cover showed a negative relationship. Our observations suggest that at the scale of our study and with the current stocking densities, wild and domesticated ungulates have similar impacts on the small mammal community.

AB  - Sustainable management strategies for tropical forest ecosystems require a detailed understanding of the distribution of tropical forest species, limitations on distribution, as well as occurrence patterns in the absence of limitations. In the Americas, many tropical palms (Arecaceae) are locally abundant keystone species that provide a number of non-timber forest products. Here we focus on 10 such species (Aphandra natalia, Attalea phalerata, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartea deltoidea, Mauritia flexousa, Oenocarpus bataua, Phytelephas aequatorialis, Phytelephas macrocarpa, and Phytelephas seemannii) found in western South America. This study aimed to determine: (i) what variables control potential species distribution, (ii) whether their distribution is spatially constrained and if so, (iii) how their potential ranges compare to their actual ranges. We built species distribution models using Maxent software with three groups of predictor variables: C (climatic), N (non-climatic environmental), S (spatial), and combinations thereof: C, CN and CNS. The CNS predictor variable combination gave superior predictive ability based on median Area Under the Curve (AUC) values and was consistent with available range maps. In contrast, individual C and CN predictor variables gave inferior AUC values and showed less similarity to range maps. We concluded that the CNS model that combined climatic, non-climatic, and spatial variables best represented the actual distribution of the 10 palm species, whereas C and CN models approached their potential distribution. Precipitation during the driest quarter and annual precipitation were the most important predictors of the potential distribution, whereas temperature of the coldest month, soil, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were less important. We found that the actual distributions of palm species were spatially constrained, and that the spatial variables largely coincided with the dispersal barriers of the Andean Cordillera and past climatic fluctuations. The estimated potential range varied from nearly equal to the actual range, to up to 0.55 x 10(6) km(2) (55.1 x 10(6) ha) larger than the actual range, depending on model, threshold settings, and species. We thus concluded that current palm resources in the forests of western South America have major potential for ecological expansion. These results are relevant to current palm management and resource conservation planning, as well as future strategies that will have to address climate change and increasing human disturbance.

AB  - With the extirpation of tigers from the Indonesian island of Java in the 1980s, the endemic and Critically Endangered Javan leopard is the island's last remaining large carnivore. Yet despite this, it has received little conservation attention and its population status and distribution remains poorly known. Using Maxent modeling, we predicted the locations of suitable leopard landscapes throughout the island of Java based on 228 verified Javan leopard samples and as a function of seven environmental variables. The identified landscapes covered over 1 million hectares, representing less than 9% of the island. Direct evidence of Javan leopard was confirmed from 22 of the 29 identified landscapes and included all national parks, which our analysis revealed as the single most important land type. Our study also emphasized the importance of maintaining connectivity between protected areas and human-modified landscapes because adjacent production forests and secondary forests were found to provide vital extensions for several Javan leopard subpopulations. Our predictive map greatly improves those previously produced by the Government of Indonesia's Javan Leopard Action Plan and the IUCN global leopard distribution assessment. It shares only a 32% overlap with the IUCN range predictions, adds six new priority landscapes, all with confirmed presence of Javan leopard, and reveals an island-wide leopard population that occurs in several highly fragmented landscapes, which are far more isolated than previously thought. Our study provides reliable information on where conservation efforts must be prioritized both inside and outside of the protected area network to safeguard Java's last remaining large carnivore.

AB  - The use of species occurrence as a proxy for habitat type is widespread, probably because it allows the use of species distribution modeling (SDM) to cost-effectively map the distribution of e.g., vulnerable marine ecosystems. We have modeled the distribution of epibenthic megafaunal taxa typical of soft-bottom, Deep-Sea Sponge Aggregations (DSSAs), i.e., "indicators," to discover where in the Barents Sea region this habitat is likely to occur. The following taxa were collectively modeled: Hexadella cf. dedritifera, Geodia spp., Steletta sp., Stryphnus sp. The data were extracted from MarVid, the video database for the Marine AREAI database for NOrwegian waters (MAREANO). We ask whether modeling density data may be more beneficial than presence/absence data, and whether using this list of indicator species is enough to locate the target habitat. We use conditional inference forests to make predictions of probability of presence of any of the target sponges, and total density of all target sponges, for an area covering a large portion of the Norwegian Barents Sea and well beyond the data's spatial range. The density models explain <31% of the variance, and the probability models have high classificatory power (AUC > 0.88), depending on the variables/samples used to train the model. The predicted surfaces were then classified on the basis of a probability threshold (0.75) and a density threshold (13 n/100 m(2)) to obtain polygons of "core area" and "hotspots" respectively (zones). The DSSA core area comprises two main regions: the Egga shelf break/Tromsoflaket area, and the shelf break southwest of Rost bank in the Traena trench. Four hotspots are detected within this core area. Zones are evaluated in the light of whole-community data which have been summarized as taxon richness and density of all megafauna. Total megafaunal density was significantly higher inside the hotspots relative to the background. Richness was not different between zones. Hotspots appeared different to one another in their richness and species composition although no tests were possible. We make the case that the effectiveness of the indicator species approach for conservation planning rests on the availability of density data on the target species, and data on co-occurring species.

AB  - Aim: Landscape management and conservation planning require maps of vegetation composition and structure over large regions. Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used for individual species, but projects mapping multiple species are rarer. We compare maps of plant community composition assembled by stacking results from many SDMs with multivariate maps constructed using nearest-neighbor imputation.
   Location: Western Cascades ecoregion, Oregon and California, USA.
   Methods: We mapped distributions and abundances of 28 tree species over 4,007,110 ha at 30-m resolution using three approaches: SDMs using machine learning (random forest) to yield: (1) binary (RF_Bin); (2) basal area (abundance; RF_Abund) predictions; and (3) multi-species basal area predictions using a nearest-neighbor imputation variant based on random forest (RF_NN). We evaluated accuracy of binary predictions for all models, compared area mapped with plot-based areal estimates, assessed species abundance at two spatial scales and evaluated communities for species richness, problematic compositional errors and overall community composition.
   Results: RF_Bin yielded the strongest binary predictions (median True Skill Statistics; RF_Bin: 0.57, RF_NN: 0.38, RF_Abund: 0.27). Plot-scale predictions of abundance were poor for RF_Abund and RF_NN (median Agreement Coefficient (AC): -1.77 and -2.28), but strong when summarized over 50-km radius tessellated hexagons (median AC for both: 0.79). RF_Abund's strength with abundance and weakness with binary predictions stems from predicting small values instead of zeros. The number of zero value predictions from RF_NN was closest to counts of zeros in the plot data. Correspondingly, RF_NN's map-based species area estimates closely matched plot-based area estimates. RF_NN also performed best for community-level accuracy metrics.
   Conclusions: RF_NN was the best technique for building a broad-scale map of diversity and composition because the modelling framework maintained inter-species relationships from the input plot data. Re-assembling communities from single variable maps often yielded unrealistic communities. Although RF_NN rarely excelled at single species predictions of presence or abundance, it was often adequate to many (but not all) applications in both dimensions. We discuss our results in the context of map utility for applications in the fields of ecology, conservation and natural resource management planning. We highlight how RF_NN is well-suited for mapping current but not future vegetation.

AB  - Context. The impacts of climate change on the climate envelopes, and hence, distributions of species, are of ongoing concern for biodiversity worldwide. Knowing where climate refuge habitats will occur in the future is essential to conservation planning. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a species highly vulnerable to climate change. However, the impact of climate change on its distribution is poorly understood.
   Aims. We aimed to predict the likely shifts in the climate envelope of the koala throughout its natural distribution under various climate change scenarios and identify potential future climate refugia.
   Methods. To predict possible future koala climate envelopes we developed bioclimatic models using Maxent, based on a substantial database of locality records and several climate change scenarios.
   Key results. The predicted current koala climate envelope was concentrated in south-east Queensland, eastern New South Wales and eastern Victoria, which generally showed congruency with their current known distribution. Under realistic projected future climate change, with the climate becoming increasingly drier and warmer, the models showed a significant progressive eastward and southward contraction in the koala's climate envelope limit in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The models also indicated novel potentially suitable climate habitat in Tasmania and south-western Australia.
   Conclusions. Under a future hotter and drier climate, current koala distributions, based on their climate envelope, will likely contract eastwards and southwards to many regions where koala populations are declining due to additional threats of high human population densities and ongoing pressures from habitat loss, dog attacks and vehicle collisions. In arid and semi-arid regions such as the Mulgalands of south-western Queensland, climate change is likely to compound the impacts of habitat loss, resulting in significant contractions in the distribution of this species.
   Implications. Climate change pressures will likely change priorities for allocating conservation efforts for many species. Conservation planning needs to identify areas that will provide climatically suitable habitat for a species in a changing climate. In the case of the koala, inland habitats are likely to become climatically unsuitable, increasing the need to protect and restore the more mesic habitats, which are under threat from urbanisation. National and regional koala conservation policies need to anticipate these changes and synergistic threats. Therefore, a proactive approach to conservation planning is necessary to protect the koala and other species that depend on eucalypt forests.

AB  - Aim: A fundamental challenge to protected area-based conservation is that protected areas are typically established under assumptions of environmental stationarity. With a rapidly changing climate, this assumption of stationarity is violated, and climate change could push some species beyond the bounds of currently protected areas. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of protected areas in conserving threatened plant biodiversity under future climate projections.
   Location: South Africa.
   Methods: We use ensemble species distribution modelling to map the projected distribution of South Africa's similar to 1200 threatened endemic plant species under present-day and projected climate scenarios for 2050. We quantify the performance of the existing protected area network by examining changes in the relative proportion of species' projected geographic extents within protected areas. We then examine whether current IUCN Red List status is a good predictor of climate 'winners' and 'losers.'
   Results: We find that 56%-66% of species may have a greater proportion of their projected range extent falling within protected areas in 2050 under climate scenarios of mitigated and upsurge greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concertation Pathways 4.5 and 8.5). However, this increase in the proportion of range protected is frequently associated with range contraction outside of protected areas. We also show that current threat intensity is not a good indicator of which species will lose versus gain increased protection.
   Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the existing reserve network is surprisingly robust to projected range shifts; however, we also identify regions where species protection needs to be improved. In addition, we suggest that there is an urgent need to better incorporate future climate threats into the assessment of species extinction risks.

AB  - The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is an apex predator on the Tibetan Plateau and in the surrounding mountain ranges. It is listed as Vulnerable in the IUCN's Red List. The large home range and low population densities of this species mandate range-wide conservation prioritization. Two efforts for range-wide snow leopard conservation planning have been conducted based on expert opinion, but both were constrained by limited knowledge and the difficulty of evaluating complex processes, such as connectivity across large landscapes. Here, we compile > 6000 snow leopard occurrence records from across its range and corresponding environmental covariates to build a model of global snow leopard habitat suitability. Using spatial prioritization tools, we identified seven large continuous habitat patches as global snow leopard Landscape Conservation Units (LCUs). Each LCU faces differing threat levels from poaching, anthropogenic development, and climate change. We identified ten potential inter-LCU linkages, and centrality analysis indicated that Tianshan-Pamir-Hindu Kush-Karakorum, Altai, and the linkage between them play a critical role in maintaining the global snow leopard habitat connectivity. However, international border fences, railways and major roads can fragment LCUs and potentially obstruct linkages. We propose LCU-specific conservation strategies and transboundary cooperation that should be highlighted in future snow leopard conservation. This effort represents the first range-wide, systematic landscape conservation plan for snow leopards, and provides a rigorous and analytically sound basis for further survey and evaluation.

AB  - The Fasciated Tiger-heron (Tigrisoma fasciatum) is considered endangered in Brazil and Argentina. Although this species has a large range in Central and South America, its records are scattered and scarce. We used a combination of searches in the scientific literature and new field records to provide an updated distributional range of this species. Searches for records and photos of T. fasciatum were conducted using online databases. We also conducted field surveys along the margins of the Araguari and Falsino rivers, in the National Forest of Amapa, a sustainable protected area in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Our literature review provided a total of 25 new distributional records of T. fasciatum. During our river based surveys we recorded one individual of T. fasciatum, which represents an extension of 499 km from the nearest previously documented occurrence. We present these findings in an up to date distributional map of T. fasciatum and highlight the need of further studies in order to better understand the species distribution and ecology.

AB  - An important goal of conservation biology is the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Incorporating quantitative measurements of ecosystem functions into conservation practice is important given that it provides not only proxies for biodiversity patterns, but also new tools and criteria for management. In the satellite era, the translation of spectral information into ecosystem functional variables expands and complements the more traditional use of satellite imagery in conservation biology. Remote sensing scientists have generated accurate techniques to quantify ecosystem processes and properties of key importance for conservation planning such as primary production, ecosystem carbon gains, surface temperature, albedo, evapotranspiration, and precipitation use efficiency; however, these techniques are still unfamiliar to conservation biologists. In this article, we identify specific fields where a remotely-sensed characterization of ecosystem functioning may aid conservation science and practice. Such fields include the management and monitoring of species and populations of conservation concern; the assessment of ecosystem representativeness and singularity; the use of protected areas as reference sites to assess global change effects; the implementation of monitoring and warning systems to guide adaptive management; the direct evaluation of supporting ecosystem services; and the planning and monitoring of ecological restorations. The approaches presented here illustrate feasible ways to incorporate the ecosystem functioning dimension into conservation through the use of satellite-derived information.

AB  - Modeling of the spatial distribution of tree species based on survey data has recently been applied to conservation planning. Numerous methods have been developed for building species habitat suitability models. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of Pleiades satellite data for modeling tree species diversity of Hyrcanian forests in northern Iran (Mazandaran Province). One-hundred sample plots were established over an area of 2,600 ha and surveyed for tree diversity, and the Simpson's index (D), Shannon's index (H') and the reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D) were calculated for each plot. Spectral variables and several parameters derived by texture analysis were obtained from multispectral images of the study area and used as predictors of tree diversity of sample plots. Two different methods, including generalized additive models (GAMs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), were used for modeling. The results revealed a fairly good prediction of plot tree diversity obtained using the developed models (adj-R-2 = 0.542-0.731). Shannon's H' and Simpson's 1/D indices were more accurately predicted using GAM-based methods, while MARS models were more suitable for predicting Simpson's D. We concluded that Pleiades satellite data can be conveniently used for estimating, assessing and monitoring tree species diversity in the mixed hardwood Hyrcanian forest of northern Iran.

AB  - Ephemeral wetland vegetation in shallow depressions in gaps of woody vegetation is less prominent than vernal pool vegetation and thus often disregarded despite its protection by EU habitat directive. Depending on the variability of precipitation in the Mediterranean zone, ephemeral species vary considerably from year to year. My study examined whether the occurrence of ephemeral wetland vegetation in Mediterranean heathland and maquis (shrubland) communities is associated with certain scrub types. I also investigated whether the cover of dwarf rush communities can be quantified by dependence on topographic parameters on a landscape scale. The study area, chosen as a typical heath-maquis example, lies in Southern Spain. I analyzed the vegetation complexes using classification by floristic similarity and indirect and direct ordination techniques. Habitat suitability modelling was made using generalized linear models. The results show that ephemeral wetland vegetation was associated with maquis communities dominated by Pistacia lentiscus. Atlantic heathlands did not co-occur with ephemeral wetlands. Ephemeral wetland species were rare in scrub communities on clayey soils. The cover of ephemeral wetland vegetation in shallow depressions could be well predicted with topographic variables at a 10 m x 10 m resolution. The inclusion of soil moisture, a variable only available for the sampling sites, enhanced model predictions remarkably. Modelling of the cover of ephemeral wetlands is crucial for the consideration of these communities in conservation planning.

AB  - The region recognized as the Rondnia area of endemism is one of the most threatened in the Brazilian Amazon. In addition to rampant deforestation that took place during the 1980s and 1990s, it is now the locus of infrastructure development and economic expansion. However, the patterns of species distribution and diversity in this region are much more complex than previously recognized. Patterns of distribution of birds, primates, and butterflies strongly suggest that the Rondnia area of endemism is not biogeographically homogenous. On opposite banks of the Madeira tributaries, in particular the Aripuan and Jiparana rivers, there are genetically, morphologically, and vocally distinct bird populations with restricted distributions and geographic substitution. These areas are relatively small and already highly threatened by deforestation and economic development. Up to 70 % of the Jiparana basin has been deprived of its original forest cover. Thus, their unique populations deserve to be recognized as conservation priorities and urgently included in conservation planning blueprints. Many restricted taxa, including many yet to be described, may already be highly endangered or locally extinct. Conservation planning in the Brazilian Amazon directed at specifying areas to be protected has focused on the larger proposed areas of endemism. If fine-scale endemism in threatened areas does exist in other Amazonian regions, then conservation policies that do not recognize these patterns will not adequately protect regional diversity.

AB  - Population viability of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is threatened by small population sizes in scattered isolated habitat areas. Designing a conservation plan for protecting and connecting the fragmented habitat will improve the chances for survival of this endangered species. For such a plan, this study assessed the overall habitat suitability for the species in the Qionglai mountain range (Sichuan, China) using Landsat TM imagery acquired in 2001, geographical data, field surveys, and information acquired in previous researches. Results show that the habitat is separated by roads and rivers, as well as by human settlements and cropland areas, into four main habitat blocks. Overlapping these four habitat blocks with the current nature reserve network reveals that only 36% of the total habitat is protected within nature reserves. Thus, the current nature reserve network is failing to preserve essential habitat for dispersal and genetic exchange. In this study, five key areas and four linkage areas were identified and suggested as nature reserves and/or corridors. These areas, together with the six currently established nature reserves in the mountain range, will form a conservation unit for facilitating the exchange of giant panda individuals among previously isolated habitat blocks. Policies recently implemented by the Chinese government, including the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP), could aid in the formation of such a conservation unit.

AB  - The Hangang River and Imjingang River estuaries in Korea are part of the main transit route for many migratory birds that use the East Asia-Pacific flyway. Despite the global importance of this area as a seasonal bird stopover site and resting area, conservation areas have not been established in this area based on ecological properties. This study aimed to examine the umbrella effect of the white-naped crane (Antigone vipio), which is one of the best-known flagship species in East Asia, and to determine the effectiveness of establishing a conservation plan in the western DMZ based on the distribution of white-naped cranes. Species distribution modeling was performed for the white-naped crane; other threatened waterbirds wintering in the western DMZ; Group 1, including species with ecological traits similar to those of the white-naped crane; and Group 2, including species with ecological traits different from those of the white-naped crane. The modeling was based on field survey data from a citizen science project, and a systematic conservation planning approach was adopted for each species group. The results showed no significant differences between the plan for the target species and the plans for the other species groups, indicating that protecting white-naped cranes habitat can also protect the habitat of other threatened waterbirds.

AB  - Aim Species distribution models and geographical information system (GIS) technologies are becoming increasingly important tools in conservation planning and decision-making. Often the rich data bases of museums and herbaria serve as the primary data for predicting species distributions. Yet key assumptions about the primary data often are untested, and violation of such assumptions may have consequences for model predictions. For example, users of primary data assume that sampling has been random with respect to geography and environmental gradients. Here we evaluate the assumption that plant voucher specimens adequately sample the climatic gradient and test whether violation of this assumption influences model predictions.
   Location Bolivia and Ecuador.
   Methods Using 323,711 georeferenced herbarium collections and nine climatic variables, we predicted the distribution of 76 plant species using maximum entropy models (MAXENT) with training points that sampled the climate environments randomly and training points that reflected the climate bias in the herbarium collections. To estimate the distribution of species, MAXENT finds the distribution of maximum entropy (i.e. closest to uniform) subject to the constraint that the expected value for each environmental variable under the estimated distribution matches its empirical average. The experimental design included species that differed in geographical range and elevation; all species were modelled with 20 and 100 training points. We examined the influence of the number of training points and climate bias in training points, elevation and range size on model performance using analysis of variance models.
   Results We found that significant parts of the climatic gradient were poorly represented in herbarium collections for both countries. For the most part, existing climatic bias in collections did not greatly affect distribution predictions when compared with an unbiased data set. Although the effects of climate bias on prediction accuracy were found to be greater where geographical ranges were characterized by high spatial variation in the degree of climate bias (i.e. ranges where the bias of the various climates sampled by collections deviated considerably from the mean bias), the greatest influence on model performance was the number of presence points used to train the model.
   Main conclusions These results demonstrate that predictions of species distributions can be quite good despite existing climatic biases in primary data found in natural history collections, if a sufficiently large number of training points is available. Because of consistent overprediction of models, these results also confirm the importance of validating models with independent data or expert opinion. Failure to include independent model validation, especially in cases where training points are limited, may potentially lead to grave errors in conservation decision-making and planning.

AB  - We studied the distribution and habitat use of Sharpe's Longclaw, Macronyx sharpei, a Kenyan montane grassland endemic, in a fragmented agricultural landscape at two spatial scales. Monthly counts in a fixed number of plots selected in contrasting habitat types provided insight in the species' distribution in relation to the available habitat. Simultaneously, focused ecological work in a smaller area provided information on its behaviour, movements and habitat choice, and allowed us to interpret the wider distribution patterns in a biologically meaningful way. Sharpe's Longclaw occurs only in grasslands, not in cultivated fields or plantations of exotic trees. It prefers short grassland with a well-developed tussock structure, apparently because tussocks provide good cover while foraging and nesting. However, as tussock grass is unpalatable to livestock, this grassland type is being ploughed up, re-seeded and converted to cultivation at an alarming rate, and the remaining patches are becoming ever more isolated from each other. Although only limited information on the species' population dynamics and dispersal ability is available, there is a clear need to conserve and manage the remaining natural grassland habitat. Since most of the land within the species' distribution range is privately owned, keeping viable populations of Sharpe's Longclaw may be extremely difficult.

AB  - There is increased evidence that incorporating evolutionary history directly in conservation actions is beneficial, particularly given the likelihood that extinction is not random and that phylogenetic diversity (PD) is lost at higher rates than species diversity. This evidence is even more compelling in biodiversity hotspots, such as Madagascar, where less than 10% of the original vegetation remains. Here, we use the Leguminosae, an ecologically and economically important plant family, and a combination of phylogenetics and species distribution modelling, to assess biodiversity patterns and identify regions, coevolutionary processes and ecological factors that are important in shaping this diversity, especially during the Quaternary. We show evidence that species distribution and community PD are predicted by watershed boundaries, which enable the identification of a network of refugia and dispersal corridors that were perhaps important for maintaining community integrity during past climate change. Phylogenetically clustered communities are found in the southwest of the island at low elevation and share a suite of morphological characters (especially fruit morphology) indicative of coevolution with their main dispersers, the extinct and extant lemurs. Phylogenetically over-dispersed communities are found along the eastern coast at sea level and may have resulted from many independent dispersal events from the drier and more seasonal regions of Madagascar.

AB  - To protect Tapanuli orangutan it is essential to understand the actual situation. It has been studied 15% of its population live outside the protected area facing a density disruption due to forest conversion. Several best management practices have been created and tested for different natural concession types. Yet, the main objective to reduce the impact and increase wildlife survival is far away from the goal. To improve our understanding of the species survival within ongoing project construction, we conducted population density monitoring prior- to post-construction time frames within the hydroelectric dam project. Also, we carried out spatial analysis to understand the land cover change and orangutan's suitable habitat distribution. This study found that during high construction activities, orangutans were avoiding the threat sources, and returned when the disturbances reduced. These findings indicated orangutans are ecology flexible and have the capability to increase its survival, although the company's involvement is crucial to facilitate the successes. Our study is based on indirect observation, and spatial modeling, which may lead to an uncertain conclusion. Further research on orangutan ecology and behavior is prioritized.

AB  - The Chinese grouse Tetrastes sewerzowi is restricted to small mountain areas on the southeastern edge of Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Recent evidence indicates that the global climate has undergone rapid change. To assess the potential effects of climate change on Chinese grouse, we applied a maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt) method to predict the current and future distributions of this species for three time periods: 2020, 2050 and 2080 in two greenhouse-gas emissions scenarios (A2a and B2a), which assume a medium and a lower increase in CO2 emissions, respectively. Our modeling revealed that: 1) the size of suitable areas for grouse will decline over time, especially in emissions scenario A2a; 2) range shifts will happen at both latitudinal (northward shift) and elevational direction (upward). In addition, habitat expansion will be limited relative to loss, especially in the more distant future. Although the size of suitable area will not change greatly in the near future (e.g. 2020 and 2050), as predicted in the emissions scenario A2a in 2020, habitat will become more fragmented. Therefore, we suggest that the habitat fragmentation be considered with range shifts calculation while assessing the climate change threats. To cope with the ongoing climate change, either the protected area of the existing reserves should be expanded or new reserves should be established to accommodate range shifts. Reforestation and gouse population monitoring should also be conducted in the reserves to track response of grouse to climate change.

AB  - Scorpions have high levels of endemism and their distributions are typically narrow, making them particularly vulnerable to changes in their environment. Unfortunately, little is known about the status of scorpion conservation worldwide. Here, we compiled information on scorpion diversity across the world and highlighted Mexican scorpion diversity. We created and overlapped scorpions' hotspots with the Mexican system of protected areas. We also modeled the potential distribution area of 24 wide distributed scorpion species under current and future scenarios to evaluate their vulnerability to climate change considering full and null dispersal models, and calculated the percentage of their distribution that will be protected by the natural protected areas in the future. Our results indicate that while Mexico has the greatest diversity of scorpion species compared to any other country in the world, these animals are not sufficiently protected by the system of natural protected areas under neither current nor under future climatic conditions. In terms of climate change vulnerability, we assessed the impact to these species if their migration to future more climatically suitable areas is not feasible. However, if full migration is feasible for species with broad ecological habitats, nine species might have a more widespread distribution, including three species with medical importance (Centruroides spp.).

AB  - Knowledge of the habitat characteristics that influence the distribution of raptors in the neotropics is vital for their conservation. I used logistic regressions (General Linear Models; GLM) to model habitat distribution for eleven raptor species occurring in the Cerros de Amotape National Park, the Tumbes National Reserve, and surrounding areas in northwestern Peru. Between May and December 2008 and 2009, raptors were surveyed along transects, and associated habitat data collected in 70 randomly allocated 1-km(2) plots. Ten habitat variables were selected for modelling. Spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of species was measured through Moran's I and later habitat models were ranked using Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc). The most important variables that influenced the presence of species included the percentage of vegetation cover at different strata and elevation. The presence of the tree species, ceibo (Ceiba trichistrandra) and guasima (Guazuma ulmifolia), were also important. The percentage of vegetation cover from 5-15 m appeared in all models for Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura), Crane Hawk (Geranospiza caerulescens), Great Black Hawk (Buteogallus urubitinga), and Harris's Hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus). These findings suggest that vertical structure of forested areas is of particular importance for raptors at the study site, including those of conservation concern. I recommend that forested areas north of the Cerros de Amotape National Park and close to Ecuador should be protected.

AB  - Characterizing zone fragility is a significant challenge when managing natural areas, but it must be prioritized in conservation efforts. The most commonly employed methodology is to rely on criteria established by experts, which can introduce subjectivity. However, more objective approaches should be used when developing conservation plans. This study follows one methodology focusing on classifying zone vulnerability within a protected natural area, taking as a study case a temporal pond network located in SW Spain; threatened aquatic plants were used as a bioindicators. Spatial data were analyzed using geographic information systems (GIS), and potentially vulnerable zones were identified using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and, more specifically, the weighted overlay method. Criteria weights were determined by variables contribution obtained through species distribution models (SDM), via the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). The purpose was to avoid artificial bias in decision-making. The analysis indicated that 42.04% of the study area was highly vulnerable. In contrast, only the 14.34% of the study area was at very low risk, meaning it can help maintain pond network biodiversity. These results indicate that potentially vulnerable and crucial zones can be identified using GIS, facilitating the establishment of conservation priorities in a complex system. This methodology could be useful for prioritizing and implementing management and conservation efforts focused on unique species and habitats in protected natural areas.

AB  - The Minimum Area Requirements (MAR) of species is a concept that explicitly addresses area and therefore can be highly relevant for conservation planning and policy. This study compiled a comprehensive database of MAR estimates from the literature, covering 216 terrestrial animal species from 80 studies. We obtained estimates from (a) Population Viability Analyses (PVAs) which explored a range of area-related scenarios, (b) PVAs that provided a fixed value - either MAR or the minimum viable population size (MVP) alongside other area-relevant information, and (c) empirical studies of occupancy patterns in islands or isolated habitat patches across area. We assessed the explanatory power of life-history traits (body mass, feeding guild, generation length and offspring size), environmental variables (average precipitation and temperature), research approach and phylogenetic group on MAR estimates. PVAs exploring area showed strong correlation between MAR and body mass. One to two additional variables further improved the predictive power. PVA reporting fixed MAR, and occupancy-based studies, were better explained by the combination of feeding guild, climatic variables and additional life history traits. Phylogeny had a consistent but usually small contribution to the predictive power of models. Our work demonstrates that estimating the MAR across species and taxa is achievable but requires cautious interpretation. We further suggest that occupancy patterns are likely sensitive to transient dynamics and are therefore risky to use for estimating MAR. PVA-based evaluations enable considering time horizon and extinction probability, two aspects that are critical for future implementation of the MAR concept into policy and management.

AB  - AimWe applied a multicomponent approach based on the decomposition of taxonomic (both presence-absence and abundance) and functional beta diversity to determine the influence of ecological factors in shaping spatial distribution diversity of coral reef fishes, and the implications for conservation decisions.
   LocationLagoons of ten atolls characterized by low human pressure but with contrasted geomorphology in the Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia.
   MethodsWe computed beta diversities and their partitioning components, both at local (inter-transect, from 200m to 10km) and large (among atolls, from 22 to 350km) spatial scales. Null models were applied to test whether the observed beta diversity differed from random expectation. Multiple generalized dissimilarity models were run to test which environmental factors were the best predictors of observed beta diversities.
   ResultsBeta diversity was indistinguishable from randomness at both spatial scales. Species remained generally interchangeable among transects within an atoll and to some extent among atolls. However, strong deviance explained by models showed that the number of species, the number of individuals and functional traits present in transects and atolls were determined by deterministic factors (i.e. environmental factors). Modelling each beta diversity component separately also revealed partial mismatch among atolls and among species and functional dissimilarities. The influence of environmental variables strongly varied among atolls, species and functional dissimilarities.
   Main conclusionsBy revealing the spatial scaling of ecological factors and partial congruence among species and functional diversity, assessment of beta diversity provides insight into conservation planning. Our results support the idea that conservation planning applied to protect taxonomic diversity cannot be fully extended to functional diversity. We have addressed the dilemma of which diversity component should be favoured in conservation strategies.

AB  - We examined factors possibly, responsible for a nested distributional pattern of resident butterflies in the Toquima Range, a mountain range in the Great Basin of western North America. In related analyses, Poisson-based modeling indicated that species richness is better explained as a function of elevation and local topographic heterogeneity, than by, area per se. Therefore, we explored whether area, elevation, and topographic heterogeneity, affected relative degree of nestedness. Elevation and topographic heterogeneity, not only explained a significant percentage of the total deviance in species richness but also may be responsible for generating nested species distributions. The species-presence matrix ordered by, the elevation-heterogeneity model was significantly, more nested than the matrix ordered by, area. The matrix ordered by the elevation-heterogeneity, model also was significantly, more nested than matrices ordered by, three other environmental variables that did not explain significant variance in species richness, indicating that the model is unlikely, to be an artifact The influence of area on distribution patterns may be relatively slight because it was not significantly, correlated with species richness or topographic heterogeneity, in this system. Elevation covaried with both species richness and area, but the former correlation was positive and the latter was negative. Our results suggest that faunal richness and compositional patterns are related to independent variables that can be measured extensively-through satellite or airborne telemetry-thus reducing dependence on labor-intensive measurements of habitat. Because nestedness analyses may help reveal causes, or at least correlates, of species composition, we believe they, are a promising tool for conservation planning.

AB  - To avoid unnecessary waste of limited resources and to help prioritize areas for conservation efforts, this study aimed to provide information on habitat use by elephants between the wet and dry seasons in the Mole National Park (MNP) of Ghana. We compiled coordinates of 516 locations of elephants' encounters, 256 for dry season and 260 for wet season. Using nine predictor variables, we modeled the probability of elephant's distribution in MNP. We threshold the models to suitable and nonsuitable regions of habitat use using the equal training sensitivity and specificity values of 0.177 and 0.181 for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Accuracy assessment of our models revealed a sensitivity score of 0.909 and 0.974, and a specificity of 0.579 and 0.753 for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. A TSS of 0.488 was also recorded for the dry season and 0.727 for the wet season indicating a good model agreement. Our model predicts habitat use to be confined to the southern portion of MNP due to elevation difference and a relatively steep slope that separates the northern regions of the park from the south. Regions of habitat use for the wet season were 856km(2) and reduced significantly to 547.68km(2) in the dry season. We observed significant overlap (327.24km(2)) in habitat use regions between the wet and dry seasons (Schoener's D=0.922 and Hellinger's-based I=0.991). DEM, proximity to waterholes, and saltlicks were identified as the key variables that contributed to the prediction. We recommend construction of temporal camps in regions of habitat use that are far from the headquarters area for effective management of elephants. Also, an increase in water point's density around the headquarters areas and selected dry areas of the park will further decrease elephant's range and hence a relatively less resource use in monitoring and patrols.

AB  - Ordination methods are used in ecological multivariate statistics in order to reduce the number of dimensions and arrange individual variables along environmental variables. Geoheritage designation is a new challenge for conservation planning. Quantification of geoheritage to date is used explicitly for site selection, however, it also carries significant potential to be one of the indicators of sustainable development that is delivered through geosystem services. In order to achieve such a dominant position, geoheritage needs to be included in the business as usual model of conservation planning. Questions about the quantification process that have typically been addressed in geoheritage studies can be answered more directly by their relationships to world development indicators. We aim to relate the major informative geoheritage practices to underlying trends of successful geoheritage implementation through statistical analysis of countries with the highest trackable geoheritage interest. Correspondence analysis (CA) was used to obtain information on how certain indicators bundle together. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was used to detect sets of factors to determine positive geoheritage conservation outcomes. The analysis resulted in ordination diagrams that visualize correlations among determinant variables translated to links between socio-economic background and geoheritage conservation outcomes. Indicators derived from geoheritage-related academic activity and world development metrics show a shift from significant Earth science output toward disciplines of strong international agreement such as tourism, sustainability and biodiversity. Identifying contributing factors to conservation-related decisions helps experts to tailor their proposals for required evidence-based quantification reports and reinforce the scientific significance of geoheritage.

AB  - Estuaries are among the most productive coastal ecosystems, supporting a wide variety of marine fishes and their early stages. High spatial and temporal variability in estuaries implies that management strategies must incorporate dynamic features to be efficient. In our study, we analysed 13 years of data on ichthyoplankton from the Patos Lagoon estuary (Brazil) to assess whether temporal variability can show distinct spatial patterns of fish eggs and larval distribution and to discuss how these results can be helpful to conservation planning. Spatial patterns of fish egg and larval assemblages were evaluated using cluster analysis. Indicator taxa for each group were also calculated as a product of the relative frequency and relative average abundance in each group. In addition, we used generalized linear models to analyse fish egg and larval abundance in relation to environmental variables. Results showed that fish eggs and larvae exhibit high variability among months, years and sampling stations in the time series. Temporal occurrence and spatial distribution were mainly associated with salinity. We found distinct spatial patterns for fish eggs and larvae in the Patos Lagoon estuary. Groups identified were different among years and indicated by a distinct genus. Our results can be considered as a first exploratory step to help managers to decide which species and temporal scale should be studied in detail and incorporated in management plans. Spatial conservation planning incorporating fluctuations in abundance and assemblage structure over time may help to ensure conservation for biodiversity persistence in highly dynamic ecosystems such as the Patos Lagoon estuary.

AB  - Aim: When modelling the distribution of animals under current and future conditions, both their response to environmental constraints and their resources' response to these environmental constraints need to be taken into account. Here, we develop a framework to predict the distribution of large herbivores under global change, while accounting for changes in their main resources. We applied it to Rupicapra rupicapra, the chamois of the European Alps.
   Location: The Bauges Regional Park (French Alps).
   Methods: We built sixteen plant functional groups (PFGs) that account for the chamois' diet (estimated from sequenced environmental DNA found in the faeces), climatic requirements, dispersal limitations, successional stage and interaction for light. These PFGs were then simulated using a dynamic vegetation model, under current and future climatic conditions up to 2100. Finally, we modelled the spatial distribution of the chamois under both current and future conditions using a point-process model applied to either climate-only variables or climate and simulated vegetation structure variables.
   Results: Both the climate-only and the climate and vegetation models successfully predicted the current distribution of the chamois species. However, when applied into the future, the predictions differed widely. While the climate-only models predicted an 80% decrease in total species occupancy, including vegetation structure and plant resources for chamois in the model provided more optimistic predictions because they account for the transient dynamics of the vegetation (-20% in species occupancy).
   Main conclusions: Applying our framework to the chamois shows that the inclusion of ecological mechanisms (i.e., plant resources) produces more realistic predictions under current conditions and should prove useful for anticipating future impacts. We have shown that discounting the pure effects of vegetation on chamois might lead to over-pessimistic predictions under climate change. Our approach paves the way for improved synergies between different fields to produce biodiversity scenarios.

AB  - Large mammals that occur in low densities, particularly in the high-altitude areas, are globally threatened due to fragile climatic and ecological envelopes. Among bear species, the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) has a distribution that is restricted to Himalayan highlands with relatively small and fragmented populations. To date, very little scientific information on the Himalayan brown bear, which is vital for the conservation of the species and the management of its habitats, especially in protected areas of the landscape, is available. The present study aims to understand the effectiveness of existing Himalayan Protected Areas in terms of representativeness for the conservation of Himalayan brown bear (HBB), an umbrella species in high-altitude habitats of the Himalayan region. We used the ensemble approach of the species distribution model and then assessed biological connectivity to predict the current and future distribution and movement of HBB in climate change scenarios for the year 2050. Approximately 33 protected areas (PAs) currently possess suitable habitats. Our model suggests a massive decline of approximately 73.38% and 72.87% under 4.5 and 8.5 representative concentration pathway (RCP) respectively in the year 2050 compared with the current distribution. The predicted change in suitability will result in loss of habitats from thirteen PAs; eight will become completely uninhabitable by the year 2050, followed by loss of connectivity in the majority of PAs. Habitat configuration analysis suggested a 40% decline in the number of suitable patches, a reduction in large habitat patches (up to 50%) and aggregation of suitable areas (9%) by 2050, indicating fragmentation. The predicted change in geographic isotherm will result in loss of habitats from thirteen PAs, eight of them will become completely inhabitable. Hence, these PAs may lose their effectiveness and representativeness in achieving the very objective of their existence or conservation goals. Therefore, we recommend adaptive spatial planning for protecting suitable habitats distributed outside the PA for climate change adaptation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coral reef-based tourism has risen sharply across the globe, coupled with an increase in fish feeding by visitors. Studies indicate that fish feeding is one of the leading causes of changes in distribution patterns, abundance, the structure of marine fish communities, and fish behavior. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of human presence and fish feeding on the behavior of reef fish by conducting in situ experiments in tide pools in a Marine Protected Area located at the northern limit of the Abrolhos Bank in the South Atlantic Ocean. Eight feeding sessions were conducted and filmed, resulting in a total of 160 minutes of video footage. Each filming session recorded four different experimental conditions alternating between human presence, human absence, and fish feeding. Our findings suggest that fish feeding may cause changes in fish behavior, such as habituation to human presence, conditioning to fish feeding, increased aggressiveness, attacks on humans, and short-term changes in species distribution. The continuation of fish feeding over time can cause an increase in the size of the populations of species that consume food provided during feeding and consequently trigger changes in the structure of communities.

AB  - Central America is exceptionally rich in biodiversity, but varies widely in the attention its countries devote to conservation. Protected areas, widely considered the cornerstone of conservation, were not always created with the intent of conserving that biodiversity. We assessed how well the protected-area system of Central America includes the region's mammal diversity. This first required a refinement of existing range maps to reduce their extensive errors of commission (i.e., predicted presences in places where species do not occur). For this refinement, we used the ecological limits of each species to identify and remove unsuitable areas from the range. We then compared these maps with the locations of protected areas to measure the habitat protected for each of the region's 250 endemic mammals. The species most vulnerable to extinction-those with small ranges-were largely outside protected areas. Nevertheless, the most strictly protected areas tended toward areas with many small-ranged species. To improve the protection coverage of mammal diversity in the region, we identified a set of priority sites that would best complement the existing protected areas. Protecting these new sites would require a relatively small increase in the total area protected, but could greatly enhance mammal conservation.

AB  - We propose and test a method to determine the proportion of specific animal national populations included in a network of protected areas. The proposed method further allows identifying the best potential new sites to be included in the network, to reach target population sizes and so to test whether a network extension is realistic or not. We used data from the French Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and spatial interpolation models known as kriging to predict the relative abundance of species at a national scale. We applied the proposed methodology to Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and a sample of 20 bird species concerned by the Directive of the Council of the European Community on the Conservation of Wild Birds. We estimated which relative part of the national population is included within the boundaries of all national SPAs. Our results suggest that the current SPA network is probably not efficient to ensure favorable national conservation status for the most widespread species, but allows reaching a 5% target value for more localized ones. Consequently, we discuss the limit of such a protected area network to ensure the global conservation of widespread species, and therefore the need for other large-scale conservation measures.

AB  - Climate change is significantly affecting ecosystem services and leading to strong impacts on the extent and distribution of glaciers and vegetation. In this context, species distribution models represent a suitable instrument for studying ecosystem development and response to climate warming. This study applies the maximum entropy model, MaxEnt, to evaluate trends and effects of climate change for three environmental indicators in the area of the Alpi Marittime Natural Park under the Municipality of Entracque (Italy). Specifically, this study focuses on the magnitude of the retreat of six glaciers and on the distribution of two different plant communities, Alnus viridis scrub and Fagus sylvatica forest associated with Acer pseudoplatanus and tall herbs (megaforbie), in relation to predicted increases in mean temperatures. MaxEnt software was used to model and observe changes over a thirty-year period, developing three scenarios: a present (2019), a past (1980) and a future (2050) using 24 "environmental layers". This study showed the delicate climate balances of these six small glaciers that, in the next 30 years, are likely to undergo an important retreat (approximate to-33%) despite the high altitude and important snowfall that still characterize the area. At the same time, it is predicted that the two plant communities will invade those higher altitude territories that, not so long ago, were inhospitable, expanding their habitat by 50%. The MaxEnt application to glaciers has shown to be an effective tool that offers a new perspective in the climate change field as well as in biodiversity conservation planning.

AB  - Modeling the niches and distributions of the species using machine learning technique has become one of the effective tools of conservation planning today. Analyzing how the main species of our country will be affected by climate change is of great importance for planning about these species. Quercus coccifera which is one of the important evergreen oak species in Turkey, is easily selected by goats and constitutes a high proportion of their diets.
   In this study, it is aimed to determine the potential distribution area of Quercus coccifera and how it will be affected by climate change. Bioclimate layers with a resolution of approximately 1 km(2) (30 arc seconds) obtained from the WorldClim database with the presence data of the species were cut within the specified limits and processed with the Maximum Entropy algorithm to determine the potential distribution area of the species in today's conditions.
   In addition, the potential distribution area in 2050 and 2070 was modeled according to the climate scenarios in RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 in order to determine how the distribution area of the species will be affected by climate change. According to the CCSM4 climate change scenario, it is seen that there are losses in potential distribution areas of the species in the future. The result of the study shows that the current and future spread areas of Quercus coccifera, which is spread in a very limited area, will gradually narrow.

AB  - Forests of the Midwest and Northeast significantly define the character, culture, and economy of this large region but face an uncertain future as the climate continues to change. Forests vary widely across the region, and vulnerabilities are strongly influenced by regional differences in climate impacts and adaptive capacity. Not all forests are vulnerable; longer growing seasons and warmer temperatures will increase suitable habitat and biomass for many temperate species. Upland systems dominated by oak species generally have low vulnerability due to greater tolerance of hot and dry conditions, and some oak, hickory, and pine species are expected to become more competitive under hotter and physiologically drier conditions. However, changes in precipitation patterns, disturbance regimes, soil moisture, pest and disease outbreaks, and nonnative invasive species are expected to contribute forest vulnerability across the region. Northern, boreal, and montane forests have the greatest assessed vulnerability as many of their dominant tree species are projected to decline under warmer conditions. Coastal forests have high vulnerability, as sea level rise along the Atlantic coast increases damage from inundation, greater coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion. Considering these potential forest vulnerabilities and opportunities is a critical step in making climate-informed decisions in long-term conservation planning.

AB  - Neotropical dry forests (NDF) are widely distributed and possess important levels of species richness and endemism; however, they are considered a highly endangered ecosystem. Today, the protected areas network (PM) located within NDF covers < 10% of the total forests' extent; and it's still unknown if PM adequately represent its biodiversity. Thus, we selected 695 bird species associated to NDF and used ZONATION software to assess the species distribution's representativeness within the PM network. Additionally, we defined priority conservation areas to strategically expand the current PM considering the most important human pressures. Current PM cover only 8.4% of NDF and represent on average similar to 10% of the total distribution of avifauna inhabiting these forests. Approximately 19% of NDF's birds possess < 5% of their distribution represented in PM, from which similar to 13% have < 1% of their ranges protected. Further, similar to 77% of the most-priority species (i.e. with restricted range and categorized as threatened) possess < 10% of their distribution protected. However, our results pointed out great possibilities to improve the picture. By considering our prioritization, the protection coverage would increase to 17% to match the Aichi targets and would substantially increase the representativeness values, covering on average > 36% the ranges of all species and, particularly, 62% for the most-priority species. Priority conservation areas identified are mainly distributed in Peru (23.1%), Brazil (21.3%), Ecuador (18.8%), and Bolivia (11.4%). Our novel results represent an important step to guide future establishment of new and efficient conservation areas across the NDF.

AB  - In Europe, land use changes follow public policies, and particularly the Common Agricultural Policy. To predict the effect of policies on agricultural practices, landscape, and ultimately biodiversity, requires understanding of the interactions between social, economic and ecological dynamics at regional scale. We studied by means of prospective scenarios the possible effects of agricultural changes on biodiversity in a Mediterranean upland. This area is characterised by extensive grasslands that have been maintained for centuries by agriculture and are now threatened by tree and shrub encroachment. We built four scenarios that describe possible changes in agricultural EU policies by 2030. We selected 15 bird species on the basis of a high natural heritage responsibility of the study area for these species and 45 plant species on the same basis plus local rarity and habitat vulnerability. We analysed how these species were affected by the four scenarios by considering changes in their habitats. For each scenario, we analysed the driving forces that determine land use changes. Landscape dynamics was modelled with a Generalised Linear Model combining environmental and land use factors. Most of the 60 selected species depend on open habitats. Only the scenario where public support was only granted if it provided environmental services had a positive impact on open habitats and their associated biodiversity. This 'natural heritage' scenario was also rated positively by local stakeholders. This approach sheds light on the interest of inter/transdisciplinary studies, scenarios, and stakeholder involvement in the definition of public policies for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - This study combines niche modeling and systematic area prioritization using distribution data for 131 species of amphibians and reptiles from Northeast India and Burma, with two objectives: (i) to evaluate the performance of the current conservation area network in Northeast India with respect to the representation of amphibians and reptiles, and (ii) to identify potential areas for expanding the current conservation area network. In a two-step protocol, maximum entropy niche modeling was used to project species' potential geographic occurrences, and the resulting probabilistic distribution data were used to prioritize areas with algorithms that maximize the representation of all species in minimal total area. The results provided a critical assessment of conservation priorities in this data-deficient region, and indicate the utility of combining niche modeling with systematic area prioritization in such situations. Many areas that had been overlooked in previous assessments were identified. Although the existing protected areas were found to be inadequate for representation of amphibian and reptile diversity, the prioritization results show that by targeting a minimal representation of 5% of the current total area suitable for each species, the gaps can be filled with a relatively modest (0.41%) increase in the current total area covered by the network. Extended analyses were also performed to assess the effects of putatively rare species on reserve selection, which showed that the inclusion of these taxa can change the prioritization solutions significantly. The prioritization results also highlight areas of Northeast India that warrant attention from future surveys. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to predict species occurrence and to seek insight into the factors behind observed spatial patterns in occurrence, and thus can be a valuable tool in species conservation. In this study, we used MaxEnt software to explain the occurrence of a protected forest-dwelling species, the Siberian flying squirrel. We produce occurrence maps covering the main distribution area for the species in the European Union. Using an exceptionally extensive presence-absence dataset collected with a standardized method, we evaluated the relative role of predation pressure, climate, and amount of habitat affecting flying squirrel occurrence. We found that regional variation in mean winter temperature had relatively large predictive power for flying squirrel occurrence. In addition, the regional abundance of flying squirrels was partly explained by differences in predation pressure. The results also support the conclusion that areas with older forests and nearby agricultural areas are optimal for the species. Our study shows that multiple factors affect the species' occurrence in large spatial scales. We also conclude that climate is having a large effect on species occurrence, and thus the changing climate has to be taken into account in conservation planning. Our results help conservation managers in targeting surveys and protection measures on various spatial scales, and decision makers in focusing on the factors that drive the species' occurrence. Our results also indicate that we would need additional tools and measures in the EU for achieving a favourable conservation status of those species that occur in commercial forests.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change ( CC) is affecting a wide range of ecosystems and species, modifying current biodiversity patterns, and increasing the risk of extinction for many species. To address this threat, identifying, managing and protecting climate refugia has been suggested as an approach to incorporate CC into systematic conservation planning. In this study, we applied a detailed Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) approach with the Maximum Entropy Algorithm to assess the potential effects of CC on the distribution of climatic suitability for Saguinus leucopus and Saguinus oedipus. These two species were investigated to identify climate refugia, and to assess the effectiveness of Protected Areas (PAs). Correlative models were generated with presence records, and bioclimatic variables describing recent (similar to 2000) and future (similar to 2050) climates, with data from two Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), describing moderate (RCP 4.5) and extreme (RCP 8.5) climate change scenarios. For both species, moderate and extreme CC scenarios resulted in expansion of climatic suitability. Refugia models, through the overlapping of GCMs, indicated that 88% and 82% of the recent climate suitability may act as refugia for S. leucopus and S. oedipus. Greater variation was found coming from GCM selection than from RCPs. Regions of exposure to climatic novelties were identified for both species. Results suggest that climate refugia for these species are critically under-protected, as only 5.7% and 9.9% respectively, coincide with current PAs. Finally, PAs that are playing an important role in preserving climate refugia for these species are mentioned.

AB  - There has been a growing pressure of human activities, especially road network, on natural habitats of the world, which has led to habitat degradation and loss of ecosystem services. To mitigate the impacts of human activities, appropriate studies quantifying ecosystem services and assessing ecological impacts of road network are essential. The main goal of this study was modeling habitat quality and habitat degradation of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province in the southwestern part of Iran, which is among the most important habitats for wild sheep (Ovis orientalis) classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In this study, we used the habitat quality module of the InVEST software (IntegratedValuation ofEnvironmentalServices andTradeoffs), which was driven from land use/cover data, information on anthropogenic threats, and expert knowledge. We tested the reliability of the habitat quality values by comparing them with the distribution map of wild sheep obtained from the Department of the Environment. Then, to have a more comprehensive assessment of the roads' effects on the natural habitats of this province, considering ecosystem services model, the Spatial Road Disturbance Index (SPROADI) was applied as a landscape index. The results of this study revealed that the east and north eastern parts of the study area which were among the most suitable habitats for wild sheep were highly affected by road network. Overall, findings of our study provided useful information on the spatially explicit distribution of habitat quality and degradation which were a valuable input for conservation planning and enhancing ecosystem services.

AB  - Reliable abundance estimates for species are fundamental in ecology, fisheries, and conservation. Consequently, predictive models able to provide reliable estimates for un- or poorly-surveyed locations would prove a valuable tool for management. Based on commonly used environmental and physical predictors, we developed predictive models of total fish abundance and of abundance by fish family for ten representative taxonomic families for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) using multiple temporal scenarios. We then tested if models developed for the GBR (reference system) could predict fish abundances at Ningaloo Reef (NR; target system), i.e., if these GBR models could be successfully transferred to NR. Models of abundance by fish family resulted in improved performance (e.g., 44.1 % < R-2 < 50.6% for Acanthuridae) compared to total fish abundance (9% < R-2 < 18.6%). However, in contrast with previous transferability obtained for similar models for fish species richness from the GBR to NR, transferability for these fish abundance models was poor. When compared with observations of fish abundance collected in NR, our transferability results had low validation scores (R-2 < 6%, p > 0.05). High spatio-temporal variability of patterns in fish abundance at the family and population levels in both reef systems likely affected the transferability of these models. Inclusion of additional predictors with potential direct effects on abundance, such as local fishing effort or topographic complexity, may improve transferability of fist local-scale predictors are often not abundance models.

AB  - Climate change is likely to shift the distributions of ecosystems worldwide. Most assessments of climate change are primarily species-focused and do not directly estimate how entire ecosystems may change. Using an ecosystem-based modelling approach, we provide a region-wide climate change vulnerability assessment of the seven major ecosystems across Africa's Albertine Rift. The Albertine Rift is a global biodiversity hotspot, containing more endemic vertebrates than anywhere else in Africa. We used Maxent to estimate each ecosystem's extent using current climate data, then we projected the potential distribution of each ecosystem for 2050 and 2070. We found that suitable conditions for most ecosystems are predicted to contract rapidly in extent and shift upwards in altitude. High-altitude ecosystems and the endemic species they support are at immediate risk, owing to rapid predicted shrinkage in their suitable extent. Only the Combretum-grasslands savannah ecosystem is predicted to expand, with suitable conditions increasing by 32% in area by 2050. The extent and structure of boundary zones between the Rift's ecosystems may change significantly through time, due to the contractions and shifts of the environmental conditions for existing ecosystem distributions. By 2070, 44% of the region could be climatically unsuitable for the current ecosystems. Conservation planning across the Rift will need to account for these ecosystem shifts and rapidly changing boundary zones to ensure the long-term persistence of the many endemic species. Beyond the Albertine Rift, this ecosystem-based modelling technique can be adapted to any terrestrial region, providing critical information for conservation vulnerability assessments.

AB  - Background Pleistocene climate fluctuations have strongly modified species genetic diversity and distributions. The Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) has been recognized as a critically endangered animal due to heavy poaching and trafficking. However, the effect of Pleistocene climate fluctuations on the genetic diversity and spatial distribution of the Chinese pangolin remains largely unknown. Here, we combined whole genome sequencing data, analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes, and a large amount of occurrence data from field surveys to infer the ancestral demographic history and predict the past spatial dynamics of the Chinese pangolin in Guangdong Province, China. Results Our results indicated that there were two subpopulations, which showed similar trends of population size change in response to past climatic changes. We estimated a peak effective population size (N-e) during the last interglacial (LIG), followed by a marked decrease (similar to 0.5 to fivefold change) until the last glacial maximum (LGM) and a rebound to a small peak population size during the Mid-Holocene (MH). The estimated time of the separation event between two subpopulations was approximately 3,000-2,500 years ago (ka). We estimated that the distribution of suitable areas shrank by 14.4% from the LIG to LGM, followed by an expansion of 31.4% from the LGM to MH and has been stable since then. In addition, we identified an elevational shift and suitable area decreased significantly during the LGM, but that the geographic extent of suitable areas in the western region increased from the LIG to present. The eastern region of Guangdong Province had the highest habitat suitability across all the climate scenarios. Conclusions Our results suggested that Pleistocene climate fluctuations played an important role in shaping patterns of genetic diversity and spatial distribution, and that human stressors likely contributed to the recent divergence of two Chinese pangolin subpopulations sampled here. We argue that a key protected area should be established in the eastern region of Guangdong Province. As such, this study provides a more thorough understanding of the impacts of Pleistocene climate fluctuations impacts on a mammalian species in southern China and suggests more robust management and conservation plans for this Critically Endangered species of special interest.

AB  - This study presents the results of the first broad-scale, spatial cumulative impact analysis (SCIA) conducted for colonial-nesting seabirds at-sea in eastern Canada. Species distribution models, based on at-sea tracking data for thirteen species/groups of seabirds (n = 520 individuals), were applied to over 5000 species-specific colonies to map relative abundance patterns across the entire region. This information was combined with distributional data for a number of key anthmpogenic threats to quantify exposure to fisheries, light and ship-source oil pollution, and marine traffic. As a final step, information about species-specific sensitivity to each threat was integrated to compute region-wide cumulative risk.
   The data products permit the visualization of the interaction between species and threats, and confirm that large portions of the coastal zones of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, as well as the Grand Banks shelf break, constitute areas where breeding seabirds experience the highest potential impact. The cumulative risk maps revealed that species which were either widespread throughout coastal areas (e.g., gulls), or capable of foraging long distance (Leach's Storm-Petrel), were most at risk. Cumulative risk maps help identify appropriate and potentially effective management and conservation actions, and are of value to federal regulators responsible for managing cumulative effects as part of the new Canadian Impact Assessment Act. They also can assist marine planners achieve the Aichi marine conservation targets as specified by the Convention on Biodiversity. By filling a knowledge gap for a large potion of the northwest Atlantic, these results help to counter the "shifting baselines syndrome".

AB  - Context Grasslands of the North American Great Plains are among the world's most imperiled ecosystems. Determining landscapes at risk of grassland loss will benefit grassland conservation programs by enabling prioritization of parcels for acquisition.
   Objectives We hypothesized that gradients in the amount of grass in local landscapes resulting from past conversion would be a useful predictor of future conversion. We developed simple, intuitive models predicting grassland conversion across the United States northern Great Plains.
   Methods We used the grassland/herbaceous, pasture/hay, and emergent herbaceous wetland classes from the National Land Cover Database to evaluate grassland loss from 2001 to 2016. We classified the amount of grass in 13.2-km(2) landscapes in 2001 into percentage bins and used generalized additive models to relate these values to the total and proportion of grassland lost, by percentage bin. We applied models to landcover data to create spatial surfaces predicting conversion.
   Results Area of grass lost was highest in 40-60% grass bins, except for heavily cropped states, where highest losses occurred in 10-20% grass bins. Percentage of grass in local landscapes was generally a strong predictor of state-level total grassland loss and proportion of grassland lost. Predicted conversion for remaining grasslands varied within and among states.
   Conclusion The amount of grass in local landscapes can be a useful indicator of grassland conversion. Our simple models complement species distribution models used to guide conservation in the region. Mechanistic models of conversion can be improved by including amount of grass in local landscapes.

AB  - The utility of habitat models for species conservation relies on the integration of ecological knowledge into the modeling process. However, this practice is often limited by incomplete information on the study species requirements and insufficient efforts to adopt robust inference modeling approaches. We developed occurrence and breeding habitat models for the European brown bear Ursus arctos in the Northern range of the poorly-known Carpathian population, focusing on the evaluation of a restricted set of hypotheses based on prevailing insights on the species constrains. Hypotheses were confronted using a dataset of 3151 bear observations in Poland for the period 1985-2005. Forest availability was the most important limiting factor, whereas anthropic factors (human density and urban areas) separated between suitable and non-suitable forest-rich areas. Forest composition contributed poorly to predict bear occurrence but was important to differentiate between breeding and non-breeding habitats: breeding females required a larger amount of forest cover, lower human influence and the interspersion of grassland/shrubland patches. Model transfer to the western Carpathian population in Slovakia supported the accuracy of habitat predictions and the robustness of the approach. Results highlight the need to control unplanned urban sprawl to preserve the species habitat and the connectivity between the Western and Eastern segments of the Carpathian population. Predicted but unoccupied habitats in other regions also require consideration, particularly some favorable areas of confluence with other large carnivore habitats. We encourage adopting robust hypothesis testing approaches in habitat modeling in order to support better model transferability and conservation planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim An important consideration when planning to conserve a species under climate change is to understand how the distribution of its food resources may also contract or shift under those same climatic conditions. Here, we use a case study to demonstrate a spatial conservation planning approach to inform decisions about where, under climate change, to protect and restore critical food and habitat resources for highly specialized species. Location Eastern Australia. Methods We developed fitted models for the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and five of its key eucalypt food trees using the maximum entropy algorithm available in Maxent. We then projected these models using a range of IPCC A1FI climate change scenarios and identified areas with a higher probability of occurrence. We calculated where the koala and its food trees may co-occur under future climate change. Results The koala and its food trees experienced significant range contractions as climate change progressed, sometimes to regions outside their current distributions. The inland species Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus coolabah contracted from the more arid interior, which is outside the koala range, but persisted in the eastern regions of the koalas range, while Eucalyptus viminalis, Eucalyptus populnea and Eucalyptus tereticornis contracted eastwards and southwards, with a fragmented distribution. The highest probabilities of overlap between koalas and their food trees were identified in fragmented coastal and southern regions of the koalas current range. Main conclusions The application of a robust species distribution modelling decision support tool identified important changes, under climate change, in the distribution of a specialist species and its key food trees. These distributions did not change in complete synergy and therefore areas of overlap varied, depending on the food tree species modelled. This is of particular importance in a conservation planning context, when considering targeted protection and restoration of species-specific habitat resources.

AB  - Three granite inselbergs and six dolerite dykes and their surroundings were investigated in the Central Namib, at the interface between the Namib Desert and Nama Karoo biomes. The main objectives of this study included a phytosociological interpretation of the described plant communities, explanation of the correlation of the communities with environmental variables and quantification of the relative contribution of different types of variables to structuring plant communities. Nine grassland and shrubland plant communities were recognized, largely organized according to general habitat, elevation, size of inselberg and geology. Soil properties, often thought to play an important role in and environments, showed no clear patterns in the level of analyses used in this study. Other environmental parameters of importance in arid mountain habitats, such as slope aspect and angle, also played a minor role. The main implications of the study are: 1. Central Namib inselbergs, particularly granite domes, harbour diverse plant communities, often with species from neighbouring higher rainfall areas, and are thus of high conservation value. 2. The poor contribution of environmental variables in this study, which are conventionally used in field studies of plant community - environment relationships, may demand a critical review of additional parameters to be included when analysing plant community - environment relations in and environments. In particular between-season variation, phytogeographic aspects and the heterogeneity of microhabitats, often contained within a plant community, need to be taken into account.

AB  - Considering genetic relatedness among species has long been argued as an important step toward measuring biological diversity more accurately, rather than relying solely on species richness. Some researchers have correlated measures of phylogenetic diversity and species richness across a series of sites and suggest that values of phylogenetic diversity do not differ enough from those of species richness to justify their inclusion in conservation planning. We compared predictions of species richness and 10 measures of phylogenetic diversity by creating distribution models for 168 individual species of a species-rich plant family, the Cape Proteaceae. When we used average amounts of land set aside for conservation to compare areas selected on the basis of species richness with areas selected on the basis of phylogenetic diversity, correlations between species richness and different measures of phylogenetic diversity varied considerably. Correlations between species richness and measures that were based on the length of phylogenetic tree branches and tree shape were weaker than those that were based on tree shape alone. Elevation explained up to 31% of the segregation of species rich versus phylogenetically rich areas. Given these results, the increased availability of molecular data, and the known ecological effect of phylogenetically rich communities, consideration of phylogenetic diversity in conservation decision making may be feasible and informative.

AB  - Studying contemporary and subfossil Cladocera (Crustacea) communities, we explored the effect of top-down stressors on the cladoceran communities; we are also interested in the coherence of the contemporary and subfossil communities. The studied Cibakhaza oxbow lake is in E Hungary, on the left-floodplain of the River Tisza; it is a large, long, and shallow oxbow lake. Three areas of the oxbow lake were distinguished based on the strength of top-down stress: protected area with low top-down stress, biomanipulated area with high top-down stress, and recreational area with moderate top-down stress. Altogether, we identified 28 taxa in the contemporary and subfossil communities in the oxbow lake. We found that the species number of the contemporary Cladocera communities was lower (protected area: 13; biomanipulated area: 9, and recreational area: 14) than in the subfossil communities (protected area: 20; biomanipulated area: 16, and recreational area: 14). Among the environmental variables, we observed differences between the protected and biomanipulated area, while the recreational area showed a transition. Species number, abundances, and Simpson diversity also showed the effect of the fish introduction. There were no differences in beta-diversity among the contemporary and subfossil Cladocera community. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination showed that the biomanipulated area in the case of the contemporary communities was separated from the other areas, while in the case of the subfossil communities, there was no separation according to top-down stress. Our results showed that the number of species of contemporary Cladocera communities was lower in each area (3-10; 3-9; 5-9) compared to the subfossil communities (6-17; 7-12; 8-12). However, the highest abundances were found in the biomanipulated area due to the appearance of small-sized Cladocera species. Our findings suggest that the effect of a short-time fish introduction is restorable when the oxbow lake has a protected part.

AB  - Monitoring and assessing marine biodiversity relies upon adequate and accurate knowledge of population and distribution patterns of ecologically important species. Cetaceans are recognised both as functionally important and as flagship species and have been the target of monitoring and conservation programs. The habitat specialist Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) is the second most common cetacean in the Persian Gulf. Mousa Bay in the northwestern Persian Gulf is an important, but highly industrialised habitat for this species. We developed a systematic and comprehensive distance sampling survey carried out from 2014 to 2016 to estimate abundance and population density of humpback dolphin in this bay. To evaluate distribution pattern of the species, eight environmental variables were measured and employed in a zero-inflated generalised additive model (ZINB GAM). With an estimated abundance of 92 animals (64-131, 95% CI) and density of 0.123 animal/km(2) (0.086-0.176, 95% CI), our results revealed Mousa Bay as one of the largest population of humpback dolphin in northern latitudes of its global range. Based on ZINB GAM findings, distance to coastlines, depth, EC, and chlorophyll a concentration significantly influence the distribution of the species. Our results highlighted that physiographic parameters and resource availability are the most important motivators of the species distribution in shallow nearshore waters. Biotic (e.g. water quality) factors due to strongly being affected by the variability of time and space ranked after physiographic variables. The high tendency of humpback dolphins to enter in highly developed foreshore of Mousa Bay raise the need for conservation-oriented studies to inform conservation planning. This study provides a basis for monitoring humpback dolphin and assessing ecosystem health of northern Persian Gulf.

AB  - Ecological niche models (ENMs) are often used to predict species distribution patterns from datasets that describe abiotic and biotic factors at coarse spatial scales. Ground-truthing ENMs provide important information about how these factors relate to species-specific requirements at a scale that is biologically relevant for the species. Chimpanzees are territorial and have a predominantly frugivorous diet. The spatial and temporal variation in fruit availability for different chimpanzee populations is thus crucial, but rarely depicted in ENMs. The genetic and geographic distinction within Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) populations represents a unique opportunity to understand fine scale species-relevant ecological variation in relation to ENMs. In Cameroon, P.t.ellioti is composed of two genetically distinct populations that occupy different niches: rainforests in western Cameroon and forest-woodland-savanna mosaic (ecotone) in central Cameroon. We investigated habitat variation at three representative sites using chimpanzee-relevant environmental variables, including fruit availability, to assess how these variables distinguish these niches from one another. Contrary to the assumption of most ENM studies that intact forest is essential for the survival of chimpanzees, we hypothesized that the ecotone and human-modified habitats in Cameroon have sufficient resources to sustain large chimpanzee populations. Rainfall, and the diversity, density, and size of trees were higher at the rainforest. The ecotone had a higher density of terrestrial herbs and lianas. Fruit availability was higher at Ganga (ecotone) than at Bekob and Njuma. Seasonal variation in fruit availability was highest at Ganga, and periods of fruit scarcity were longer than at the rainforest sites. Introduced and secondary forest species linked with anthropogenic modification were common at Bekob, which reduced seasonality in fruit availability. Our findings highlight the value of incorporating fine scale species-relevant ecological data to create more realistic models, which have implications for local conservation planning efforts.

AB  - Key message
   Under an outbreak scenario in a buffer zone of a protected area, bark beetle-caused tree mortality was modulated by earlier natural disturbances (wind and bark beetles), sanitary management and seasonal temperature. In buffer zones, the effects of sanitary management on tree mortality remained limited due to the migration of bark beetles from unmanaged areas.
   Context
   The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) is regarded as an economically significant pest of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst). However, in protected areas, it is regarded as a keystone species for biodiversity. This results in two contrasting management strategies that meet in buffer zones of protected areas.
   Aims
   To assess which environmental and management variables are most important for tree mortality in an ongoing bark beetle outbreak and to gain a better understanding of the challenges and recommendations for buffer zone management under the influence of nearby unmanaged stands in a protected area.
   Methods
   Norway spruce tree mortality was assessed in 419 forest stands in the High Tatra Mountains. To account for spatial and temporal autocorrelations, generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) were used, and an information-theory (IT) approach was adopted for model selection to test the influence of environmental variables, natural disturbances and the previous year's sanitary cutting on bark beetle-caused tree mortality.
   Results
   In buffer zones, P. abies tree mortality caused by I. typographus was positively correlated to natural disturbances and sanitary cutting in the previous year.
   Conclusion
   The previous year's sanitary cutting, maximum temperature sums, wind disturbance and trees left in no-intervention stands contributed to tree mortality in buffer zones. In these zones, the decrease of tree mortality in response to sanitary management remained limited due to the migration of bark beetles from unmanaged areas. However, sanitary management in buffer zones remains necessary for the isolation of bark beetle outbreaks in unmanaged areas.

AB  - Statistical predictions of the impact of climate change on biodiversity assume that the environmental and spatial characteristics of contemporary species' distributions reflect the conditions needed for their continued and prolonged existence. Here we explore this assumption by testing whether a species' threatened status is associated with the amount of variation in its distribution range attributable to environmental and spatial patterns. Using a variation partitioning approach, we decomposed variation in the distribution ranges of 4423 vertebrate species in sub-Saharan Africa into components attributable exclusively to environmental variables (E|S), exclusively to spatial variables (S|E) or to the collinearity between environmental and spatial variables (Ea (c) S). We found that species' threatened status was unrelated to E|S, S|E or Ea (c) S variation components, but that unexplained variation was higher for species threatened with extinction. This suggests that spatio-environmental patterns in species' ranges likely underestimate the overall extinction threat caused by climate change. We also found clear geographic patterns in the strength of E|S, S|E or Ea (c) S that differed amongst biogeographical regions, but no component was over- or underrepresented in the present-day protected area network. While there may be benefits to tailoring protected area expansion to differences between biogeographical regions, this should aim to incorporate species-specific information wherever possible.

AB  - Effective marine resource management requires knowledge of the distribution of critical habitats that support resource populations and the processes that maintain them. Reefs that host diverse macrobenthic communities are important habitats for fish. However, detailed information on macrobenthic communities is rarely available and is usually limited to SCUBA diving depths. To establish depth-related distribution patterns and drivers that structure reef communities, the macrobenthos situated in a warm-temperate marine protected area (MPA; 34 degrees 01'24S; 23 degrees 54'09E) was sampled between 2009 and 2012. Comparison of shallow (11-25 m) and deep (45-75 m) sites revealed significantly different communities, sharing only 27.9 % of species. LINKTREE analysis revealed a changeover of species along the depth gradient, resulting in four significantly different assemblage clusters, each associated with particular environmental variables. High light intensity supported benthic algae at shallow depths, and as light availability decreased with depth, algal cover diminished and was eventually absent from the deep reef. Upright growth forms and settled particulate matter were positively related to depth and dominated the deep reef. Reduced wave action and currents on the deep reef can explain the increased settling of suspended particles. Under such conditions, clogging of feeding parts of the encrusting species is expected, and upright growth would be favoured. Considering that most MPAs are restricted to shallow coastal habitats and that macrobenthic communities change significantly with depth, it is probable that many unique deep reef habitats are currently afforded no protection.

AB  - Understanding regional environmental heterogeneity (EH) and biodiversity relationships (heterogeneity-diversity relationships: HDRs) is the first step toward coupling environmental variables with biodiversity surrogates into regional systematic conservation planning. However, there is no universal method for determining regional HDRs that considers various environmental variables and biodiversity in different regions. This study selected 32 nature reserves as natural areas in Yunnan, China, to examine regional HDRs in Yunnan. We calculated 17 EH parameters (of soil, topography, and climate) and three (ecosystem, plant, and animal) biodiversity indices in the nature reserves. By examining the explanatory power of each EH parameter and area of the nature reserve, we identified the primary parameters and constructed an optimal model for each biodiversity index. The explanatory powers of these parameters varied for each biodiversity index, and those of climatic parameters were generally higher than soil and topographic heterogeneity ones. Heterogeneity of the temperature annual range, followed by area and heterogeneity of soil type, were important parameters for ecosystem diversity of Yunnan and the optimal model explained 56.9%. Plant diversity was explained 54.5% by its optimal model, consisting of heterogeneity of precipitation of the coldest quarter and annual precipitation. Heterogeneity of temperature annual range was important for animal diversity in Yunnan and explained 29.6% of its optimal model. This study suggests that EH parameters can be an effective surrogate for biodiversity, therefore, we suggested that the significance and role of climatically heterogeneous regions for the conservation of biodiversity in Yunnan should be further studied in the future.

AB  - New Guinea is the most biologically and linguistically diverse tropical island on Earth, yet the potential impacts of climate change on its biocultural heritage remain unknown. Analyzing 2353 endemic plant species distributions, we find that 63% of species are expected to have smaller geographic ranges by 2070. As a result, ecoregions may have an average of -70 +/- 40 fewer species by 2070. Species with future geographic range contractions include 720 endemic plant species that are used by indigenous people, and we find that these will decrease in 80% of New Guinea's 1030 language areas, with losses of up to 94 species per language area. To mitigate the threats of climate change on the flora, we identify priority sites for protected area expansion that can jointly maximize biodiversity and useful plant conservation.

AB  - The marine habitats surrounding Cap des Trois Fourches (Mediterranean coast of Morocco) was explored in the framework of the MedMPAnet Project. Ten different communities were identified in the studied area, among which it is remarkable the presence of some key conservational habitats: seagrass meadows, dark and semidark cave communities, maA << rl beds and corraligenous assemblages. All the data was included in a GIS program (Geographic Information System) to elaborate a cartographic map of marine communities and species distribution. All the scientific data obtained support the proposal of Cap des Trois Fourches as a marine protected area. We also provided a map of management, suggesting the stricter protection of the areas with higher conservational interest.

AB  - Coastal marine environment is a complex system and its management requires adequate information. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are considered pilot sites useful to define innovative tools for the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). Their management however requires acquaintance with the relationships between the protected site and the status of the coastal neighbouring areas in order to assess mutual effects and influences. There is the need of monitoring systems capable of highlighting physical and biological phenomena, and possible oceanographic anomalies at local scale, to assess possible existing differences between MPAs and their neighbouring unprotected zones. The present study proposes an integrated analysis of data sets coming from in situ and remote-sensing data to evaluate the reliability of satellite sensors for coastal zone monitoring and to better understand the short-term environmental dynamics on a coastal area centred on the Portofino MPA (Ligurian Sea).

AB  - Quantitative studies of the relationships between river water quality and environmental variables are needed to improve understanding of the impacts of natural and human factors on aquatic environments. However, multicollinearity between environmental variables can hinder the identification of key factors when water qualityenvironment relationship is studied using traditional regression methods. This study utilized two alternative statistical methods, variation and hierarchical partitioning, to address these difficulties in studies of river water quality. Using these methods, we explored the effects of catchment physiography, climate and land use variables on total phosphorus and nitrogen, pH, water colour and dissolved oxygen during the years 19952005 in 32 boreal rivers in Finland. Catchment physiography and land use explained most of the variation in water quality, especially in phosphorus, nitrogen and water colour data. The strong correlations (rs?>?0.8) between agricultural land use and phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations indicate that water quality is highly affected by agriculture in boreal regions. By determining the environmental drivers of different water quality variables, we can estimate the water quality of different catchments in response to environmental changes and identify areas that are sensitive to global changes. Our study shows that novel statistical methods integrated with geographic information system data and techniques provide deeper insights into water qualityenvironment relationships than traditional regression, and these should be considered when developing, for example, conservation planning for rivers.

AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of elephant carcasses in relation to ecological characteristics and human activities is critical to developing targeted management strategies for reducing poaching. We employ a spatial modelling approach to quantify the relative contribution of multiple climatic, ecological, human and protected area management predictors of the number of elephant carcasses in a recognized poaching hotspot: the Ruvuma landscape of northern Mozambique and southern Tanzania. This includes the Niassa Reserve in the south and the Selous Game Reserve in the north. In Mozambique, the number of elephant carcasses is positively associated with State-managed protected areas such as Niassa Reserve, but particularly with environmental variables including low rainfall and high temperatures. In Tanzania, elephant carcasses are positively associated with community-managed sites. A strong focus on effective management of protected areas in the Ruvuma landscape is crucial to reducing the killing of elephants.

AB  - Background Habitat fragmentation is a primary driver of wildlife loss, and the establishment of biological corridors is a conservation strategy to mitigate this problem. Identifying areas with high potential functional connectivity typically relies on the assessment of landscape resistance to movement. Many modeling approaches exist to estimate resistance surfaces but to date only a handful of studies compared the outputs resulting from different methods. Moreover, as many species are threatened by fragmentation, effective biodiversity conservation requires that corridors simultaneously meet the needs of multiple species. While many corridor planning initiatives focus on single species, we here used a combination of data types and analytical approaches to identify and compare corridors for several large mammal species within the Panama portion of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Methods We divided a large mammal assemblage into two groups depending on the species sensitivity to habitat disturbance. We subsequently used cost-distance methods to produce multi-species corridors which were modeled on the basis of (i) occupancy of nine species derived from camera trapping data collected across Panama, and (ii) step selection functions based on GPS telemetry data from white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari, puma Puma concolor, and ocelot Leopardus pardalis. In addition to different data sources and species groups, we also used different transformation curves to convert occupancy and step-selection results into landscape resistance values. Results Corridors modeled differed between sensitive and tolerant species, between the data sets, and between the transformation curves. There were more corridors identified for tolerant species than for sensitive species. For tolerant species, several corridors developed with occupancy data overlapped with corridors produced with step selection functions, but this was not the case for sensitive species. Conclusion Our study represents the first comparison of multispecies corridors parametrized with step selection functions versus occupancy models. Given the wide variability in output corridors, our findings underscore the need to consider the ecological requirements of several species. Our results also suggest that occupancy models can be used for estimating connectivity of generalist species. Finally, this effort allowed to identify important corridors within the MBC (i) at a country scale and (ii) for several species simultaneously to accurately inform the local authorities in conservation planning. The approach we present is reproducible in other sites and/or for other species.

AB  - Axis deer (Axis axis), an introduced invasive species of growing concern around the globe, have rapidly expanded through the southern cone countries in South America. Despite increasing culling efforts over 14 years, axis deer remained abundant at El Palmar National Park in north-eastern Argentina. We tested whether this continued abundance possibly reflected control failures as a result of adjacent plantation forests providing a safe-haven refuge for deer. We carried out a cross-sectional survey of deer faecal pellet groups and tracks in 77 matched pairs of 25 m(2) plots deployed at random over the park-plantation interface and assessed the presence of deer trails along the 14.2-km wire fence between both land-use types. The relative odds of having at least one pellet group (occupancy) were 4.5 (95% CI 1.5 to 18.3) times higher among park plots than plantation plots. Using generalized linear mixed models, the relative odds of occupancy decreased significantly with increasing distance to the main permanent water course, but it was 83% lower in plantation plots than in the park plots. Principal component analysis of shrub cover, plant structure and plant height revealed greater shelter within the park. Deer trails were spatially aggregated up to 2300 m and were directly associated with deer occupancy. These results indicate that, in El Palmar National Park interface, plantation forests do not provide a refuge or selected habitat, and suggest instead that the environmental characteristics and diversity of habitats within the protected area are relevant for the effectiveness of the exotic ungulate management program.

AB  - The small red brocket deer Mazama bororo is endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a biome that has been greatly fragmented and altered by human activities. This elusive species is morphologically similar to the red brocket deer Mazama americana and the Brazilian dwarf brocket deer Mazama nana, and genetic typing is necessary for reliable identification. To determine the geographical range of M. bororo more accurately, we conducted non-invasive genetic sampling using scat detection dogs trained to locate deer faeces. We surveyed 46 protected areas located within the species' potential distribution and collected a total of 555 scat samples in 30 of the protected areas. Using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism approach, we genotyped 497 scat samples (89%) and detected M. bororo in seven localities in three Brazilian states. The results support a range extension of the small red brocket deer to latitudes 23 and 28 degrees S and longitudes 47 and 49 degrees W. We show that the species' distribution is associated with 37,517 km(2) of the Ombrophilous Dense Forest in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and this conclusion is supported by species distribution modelling. The small red brocket deer is the largest endemic species in Brazil and may have the smallest geographical distribution of any Neotropical deer species. This species occupies fragmented landscapes and is threatened by human encroachment, poaching, and predation by dogs, and based on our findings we recommend policy intervention for conservation planning of the Ombrophilous Dense Forest.

AB  - Simple Summary Cacyreus marshalli is strictly dependent on its host plant (Pelargonium spp.), which is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant in mountain areas. An experiment demonstrated that the butterfly is able to develop on some wild geraniums, too, making mountain areas highly at risk for a potential expansion to natural habitats. We therefore decided to carry out research in a protected mountain area (Gran Paradiso National Park), focusing on the drivers which determine the distribution of C. marshalli using data provided by either an opportunistic approach or a rigorous survey protocol. The data collected via the planned survey were more informative than the opportunistic observations, which were few and narrow. We suggest investing more in citizen science projects and combining them with a designed protocol according to an integrated approach. We observed that C. marshalli distribution is strictly linked to host plant availability but is constrained by cold temperatures, although Pelargonium spp. are abundant. The temperature increase scenario showed an increase of butterfly abundance, but halving of the host plant population could drive the rate of infestation to return to what it was previously, excluding a countertrend in some high-altitude sites. It is therefore important to test management actions designed to control alien species before implementing them. Cacyreus marshalli is the only alien butterfly in Europe. It has recently spread in the Gran Paradiso National Park (GPNP), where it could potentially compete with native geranium-consuming butterflies. Our study aimed to (1) assess the main drivers of its distribution, (2) evaluate the potential species distribution in GPNP and (3) predict different scenarios to understand the impact of climate warming and the effect of possible mitigations. Considering different sampling designs (opportunistic and standardised) and different statistical approaches (MaxEnt and N-mixture models), we built up models predicting habitat suitability and egg abundance for the alien species, testing covariates as bioclimatic variables, food plant (Pelargonium spp.) distribution and land cover. A standardised approach resulted in more informative data collection due to the survey design adopted. Opportunistic data could be potentially informative but a major investment in citizen science projects would be needed. Both approaches showed that C. marshalli is associated with its host plant distribution and therefore confined in urban areas. Its expansion is controlled by cold temperatures which, even if the host plant is abundant, constrain the number of eggs. Rising temperatures could lead to an increase in the number of eggs laid, but the halving of Pelargonium spp. populations would mostly mitigate the trend, with a slight countertrend at high elevations.

AB  - Activity patterns social behaviour and reproductive success of Arabian oryx were monitored in a reintroduced population in Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area Saudi Arabia During the first year of the study precipitation was 38% lower than the long-term average where as rainfall in the following year resulted in precipitation that was 92 8% of the long-term average These dramatically different rainfall conditions corresponded with distinct patterns in various environmental parameters (air and soil temperature humidity wind speed solar radiation air pressure) Daily activity patterns the frequency of social behaviours and foraging activity were significantly reduced during the drought period The frequency of reproductive behaviour was significantly related to daytime air temperature and radiation with a pronounced reduction of reproductive activities during the drought Monthly rates of conceptions were considerably lower during the drought Our results substantiate the idea that extended dry periods affect the population development of Oryx but also raise questions about habitat suitability and carrying capacity Future management of Arabian oryx should consider extreme climatic events as factors influencing various aspects of the ecology and behaviour of this species This aspect may become even more important in the face of climate change including a future increase of extreme climatic events (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - Background. Just as for most other tortoise species, the once common Chaco tortoise, Chelonoidis chilensis (Testudinidae), is under constant threat across it distribution in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. Despite initial qualitative description of the species distribution and further individual reports of new locations for the species, there is no description of the species distribution in probabilistic terms. With this work we aim to produce an updated predictive distribution map for C. chilensis to serve as a baseline management tool for directed strategic conservation planning.
   Methods. We fitted a spatially expanded logistic regression model within the Bayesian framework that accounts for uncertainty on presence-only and generated pseudo-absence data into the parameter estimates. We contrast the results with reported data for the national networks of protected areas to assess the inclusion of the species in area-based conservation strategies.
   Results. We obtained maps with predictions of the occurrence of the species and reported the model's uncertainty spatially. The model suggests that potential suitable habitats for the species are continuous across Argentina, West Paraguay and South Bolivia, considering the variables, the scale and the resolution used. The main limiting variables were temperature-related variables, and precipitation in the reproductive period.
   Discussion. Given the alarming low density and coverage of protected areas over the distribution area of C. chilensis, the map produced provides a baseline to identify areas where directed strategic conservation management actions would be more efficient for this and other associated species.

AB  - Conservation planning of threatened taxa relies upon accurate data on systematics, ecological traits and suitable habitats. The genus Gazella includes taxa with distinct morphologies and ecological traits, but close phylogenetic relationships. The North African Gazella cuvieri and Gazella leptoceros loderi share morphological and physiological characters but the former is darker and found in mountain areas, while the latter is lighter and associated with sand dunes. Here we aim to assess the genetic distinctiveness of these taxa, to characterize their ecological niches and to identify potential occurrence areas, by analysing 327 samples across North-West Africa. Phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial (CYTB) and five nuclear gene fragments (KCAS, LAC, SPTBN1, PRKCI and THYR) show that both taxa comprise a single monophyletic group. However, ecological niche-based modelling suggests that populations of these taxa occupy distinct geographic areas and specific environments. Predicted areas of sympatry were restricted, as a consequence of local sharp transitions in climatic traits. The lack of genetic differentiation between these taxa suggests they should be lumped into G. cuvieri, while ecological and morphological differences indicate they correspond to distinct ecotypes. Conservation planning of G. cuvieri should consider the preservation of both mountain and lowland ecotypes to maintain the overall adaptive potential of the species. This integrative approach provides valuable insights in identifying evolutionary units and should be extended to other gazelles.

AB  - Ecological niche modeling (ENM) has become an important tool in conservation biology. Despite its recent success, several basic issues related to algorithm performance are still being debated. We assess the ability of two of the most popular algorithms, GARP and Maxent, to predict distributions when sampling is geographically biased. We use an extensive data set collected in the Brazilian Cerrado, a biodiversity hotspot in South America. We found that both algorithms give richness predictions that are very similar to other traditionally used richness estimators. Also, both algorithms correctly predicted the presence of most species collected during fieldwork, and failed to predict species collected only in very few cases (usually species with very few known localities, i.e., < 5). We also found that Maxent tends to be more sensitive to sampling bias than GARP. However, Maxent performs better when sampling is poor (e.g., low number of data points). Our results indicates that ENM, even when provided with limited and geographically biased localities, is a very useful technique to estimate richness and composition of unsampled areas. We conclude that data generated by ENM maximize the utility of existing biodiversity data, providing a very useful first evaluation. However, for reliable conservation decisions ENM data must be followed by well-designed field inventories, especially for the detection of restricted range, rare species.

AB  - Dispersal is fundamental in determining biodiversity responses to rapid climate change, but recently acquired ecological and evolutionary knowledge is seldom accounted for in either predictive methods or conservation planning. We emphasise the accumulating evidence for direct and indirect impacts of climate change on dispersal. Additionally, evolutionary theory predicts increases in dispersal at expanding range margins, and this has been observed in a number of species. This multitude of ecological and evolutionary processes is likely to lead to complex responses of dispersal to climate change. As a result, improvement of models of species' range changes will require greater realism in the representation of dispersal. Placing dispersal at the heart of our thinking will facilitate development of conservation strategies that are resilient to climate change, including landscape management and assisted colonisation.

AB  - For conservation decision making, species' geographic distributions are mapped using various approaches. Some such efforts have downscaled versions of coarse-resolution extent-of-occurrence maps to fine resolutions for conservation planning. We examined the quality of the extent-of-occurrence maps as range summaries and the utility of refining those maps into fine-resolution distributional hypotheses. Extent-of-occurrence maps tend to be overly simple, omit many known and well-documented populations, and likely frequently include many areas not holding populations. Refinement steps involve typological assumptions about habitat preferences and elevational ranges of species, which can introduce substantial error in estimates of species' true areas of distribution. However, no model-evaluation steps are taken to assess the predictive ability of these models, so model inaccuracies are not noticed. Whereas range summaries derived by these methods may be useful in coarse-grained, global-extent studies, their continued use in on-the-ground conservation applications at fine spatial resolutions is not advisable in light of reliance on assumptions, lack of real spatial resolution, and lack of testing. In contrast, data-driven techniques that integrate primary data on biodiversity occurrence with remotely sensed data that summarize environmental dimensions (i.e., ecological niche modeling or species distribution modeling) offer data-driven solutions based on a minimum of assumptions that can be evaluated and validated quantitatively to offer a well-founded, widely accepted method for summarizing species' distributional patterns for conservation applications.

AB  - Quantifications of spatial distribution and abundance of animals are essential to identifying key landscape characteristics and targeting locations for conservation action. Since conservation decisions often focus on multiple species aggregated in groups, e. g., guild-level, rather than individual species, predictions of species group abundance are of central importance. However, areas chosen for conservation action may differ if results from various modeling strategies also differ. Therefore, we compared three different strategies for modeling species group distribution and abundance: predict first, assemble later (PA); assemble first, predict later (AP); and the combined assemble, predict, then assemble (APA). All strategies were performed using Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs), which were fit to individual species data and then grouped after modeling, or fit to datasets that were grouped before modeling. Modeling strategies produced very similar results in terms of statistical performance assessed through four evaluation metrics and in spatial patterns in predicted abundance. To further assess potential functional implications of any numeric differences to conservation planning, we examined the relative proportion of the predicted population within existing Canadian protected areas. This metric further confirmed similarity in predictions from the three modeling strategies. Our results suggest that locations targeted for conservation action would be highly consistent among modeling strategies. Slight differences we observed in spatial predictions may be due to data coverage across species ranges, data quality, and the flexibility of the BRTs.

AB  - The interdisciplinary nature of conservation problems is increasingly being incorporated into research, raising fundamental questions about the relative importance of the different types of knowledge and data. Although there has been extensive research on the development of methods and tools for conservation planning, especially spatial planning, comparatively little is known about the relative importance of ecological versus non-ecological data for prioritization, or the likely return on investment of incorporating better data. We demonstrate a simple approach for (1) quantifying the sensitivity of spatial planning results to different ecological and non-ecological data layers, and (2) estimating the potential gains in efficiency from incorporating additional data. Our case study involves spatial planning for coastal squeeze, a process by which development blocks coastal ecosystems from moving landward in response to sea-level rise. We show that incorporating spatial data on landowners' likelihood of selling had little effect on identifying relative priorities but drastically changed the outlook for whether conservation goals could be achieved. Better data on the costs of conservation actions had the greatest potential to improve the efficiency of spatial planning, in some cases generating more than an order of magnitude greater cost savings compared to ecological data. Our framework could be applied to other systems to guide the development of spatial planning and to identify general rules of thumb for the importance of alternative data sources for conservation problems in different socio-ecological contexts.

AB  - The thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health and composition of aquatic ecosystems, and together with flow, is recognised as one of the most influential abiotic drivers of aquatic ecosystem processes affecting species distribution. Changes in thermal conditions in aquatic systems are driven by on-going human-induced climate change, hydrological, regional and structural factors. Here, we quantified the impact of instream impoundments on the natural longitudinal connectivity and estimated thermal vulnerability of catchments based on the functional relationship between changing temperature and the profile gradient of rivers in the eastern portion of South Africa. We identified catchments that are most vulnerable to thermal stress based on cold-water adapted species' tolerance to thermal changes. More than half of all studied catchments include rivers that are relatively intact longitudinally, with notable exceptions being rivers in the central portion of the study area. Thermal condition of high elevation sites is more heavily impacted by impoundments and consequently thermal vulnerability of these sites are higher. Blephariceridae and Notonemouridae, the most thermophobic families, are likely to become locally threatened or extinct, in the absence of connectivity. The quantification of stream connectivity and vulnerability of organisms to thermal changes in river systems are important decision making tools for effective adaptive and holistic conservation planning strategies.

AB  - Evaluation of spatial and non-spatial distribution is of great importance for protection of plant's genetic resources. Prunus scoparia, a wild almond species, is an important economically and ecologically food resource plant in Iran with specific characteristics such as self-compatibility, resistant to drought and fungus, bitterness as well as small nuts. This wild species can provide an enlarged gene pool and may be considered as a valuable germplasm source for breeding the cultivated almond. In this study, the conservation planning and genetic variation of 158 Prunus scoparia accessions was investigated with the aid of 36 SSR markers to reveal genetic distinctness and structure. The molecular markers studied showed quite high level of genetic diversity on the basis of N-a = 6.47, H-o = 0.603 and H-e = 0.737. The result of Neighbor net analysis was not in parallel with STRUCTURE data as classified samples into two and 12 main groups, respectively. On the other hand, the results of GENELAND analysis ensured the population classification and the genetic relatedness between populations from STRUCTURE analysis due to use of geographical data. All samples were grouped based on their geographical location. Moreover, utilization of GIS data accompanied by appropriate number of SSR markers could provide the possibility of prioritizing of distribution regions in natural and unnatural environments. The species distribution modeling would also help gain comprehensive information on conservation strategies of this wild almond species.

AB  - Bioregional classifications are used extensively for conservation management and monitoring programs. This study used generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) to test the ability of different regional classifications of four groups of aquatic biota to be used as surrogates for each other. Classifications were derived for aquatic macrophytes, macroinvertebrates, freshwater fish and frogs using community-level modelling, or GDM, which relates the biotic assemblage structure with environmental variables. Six regions were defined for each biotic group for the State of New South Wales. Regional classifications differed markedly between the different biotic groups because the environmental drivers that were related to species turnover throughout the region differed among groups. Altitude and rainfall were the strongest drivers of species turnover among the groups. Results suggest that physiographic variables should be incorporated in reserve design and monitoring programs to explicitly address differences in classifications between similar biotic groups.

AB  - We used the results of the Spanish Otter Survey of 1994-1996, a Geographic Information System and stepwise multiple logistic regression to model otter presence/absence data in the continental Spanish UTM 10 x 10-km squares. Geographic situation, indicators of human activity such as highways and major urban centers, and environmental variables related with productivity, water availability, altitude, and environmental energy were included in a logistic model that correctly classified about 73% of otter presences and absences. We extrapolated the model to the adjacent territory of Portugal, and increased the model's spatial resolution by extrapolating it to I x 1-km squares in the whole Iberian Peninsula. The model turned out to be rather flexible, predicting, for instance, the species to be very restricted to the courses of rivers in some areas, and more widespread in others. This allowed us to determine areas where otter populations may be more vulnerable to habitat changes or harmful human interventions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of predictive habitat distribution models by land managers in the conservation management of threatened species is increasing. Few models, however, are subsequently field-checked and evaluated. This study evaluates the statistical strength and usefulness for conservation purposes of three predictive habitat models developed for a threatened stag beetle, Hoplogonus simsoni, found in the wet eucalypt forests and mixed/rain forests of north-east Tasmania. The relationship between various environmental variables for which spatial (GIs) information was available and the density, frequency of occurrence and presence/absence of the species was investigated using generalised linear modelling. Models developed were coupled with the GIs data to develop maps of predicted occurrence within the species' range, grouped into categories of habitat quality. The models found that altitude, aspect, slope, distance to nearest stream and overstorey tree height were significantly associated with the occurrence of the species. Evaluation of the statistical strength of the models with independent data of species' occurrence collected at 95 sites found that the density model performed poorly with little correlation between predicted and observed densities of the species. The frequency of occurrence model, however, showed a moderate ability to predict both species' abundance and presence/absence. The presence/absence model had a similar discriminatory ability in predicting presence or absence of H. simsoni, but also showed some potential as an indirect predictor of species' abundance. Assuming a correlation between relative abundance and habitat quality, the frequency of occurrence predictive model appeared to be the better and more direct discriminator of high quality habitat relative to the other models. The value of species' habitat models and the need to evaluate their utility in the development of conservation strategies are discussed. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many factors such as human activities threat brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Southern Asia, and limit it to small populations in remote and rocky mountainous regions. Brown bears are generally studied in North America and Europe, but there is little information about its conditions and requirements for survival in Asia. During the recent years, brown bear populations in Iran have decreased sharply. Therefore, they are now officially listed as a threatened species in local scale. Therefore, we tried to recognize brown bear habitat relationships in northern Iran using species distribution model (SDM). Maxent method was applied using multiscale approach to predict suitable habitats and habitat relationships of the species. Our results revealed that the predictive ability of environment variables and species distribution maps varied across scales strongly. Also, our findings showed that identifying a proper scale is important issue to improve habitat modeling accuracy. Only 17% of the protected areas was found suitable for brown bear and divided to 5.1% poor, 8.8% suitable, and 3.1% high-quality habitat. Consequently, it is suggested that the protected area of northern Iran reconsiders with interventions aimed at maintaining suitable habitats of brown bear.

AB  - Dolichophis caspius is present in Romania only in the southern regions, which partially represent its northern distribution limit. In recent years, new data on the distribution of D. caspius in the country have been collected, with many of these records being road-killed individuals. Conducted during 2013-2019, this survey further completes the information on this species' distribution in southern Romania, recording 55 (mostly new) distribution localities. Dolichophis caspius is a constant presence in the Danube meadow, and it also advances northwards along the Jiu, Olt, and Arges River meadows. Dolichophis caspius was mostly found to inhabit areas with loess walls, but it was also present in flat areas with agricultural terrains. Most of these records were road-killed individuals. The high number of new distribution records could be driven by the last year's weather conditions, which were unusually warm and dry in the region. Also, the high number of road-killed snakes clearly reflects the increasing level of the human pressure on D. caspius in a region where natural habitats are becoming increasingly rare.

AB  - In Chinese and South-east Asian waters, the coastal and estuarine environments are important habitats for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis). Coastal and estuarine maritime engineering (CEME), including land reclamation, embankment or shoreline armouring, harbour construction and marine farming, permanently changes coastal environments and threatens the long-term persistence of marine biota and ecosystems. Such impacts on humpback dolphin viability, however, are rarely discussed. Likely core habitat of the humpback dolphin was extrapolated based on present understanding of habitat characteristics, which is much narrower than present data describing the species' range. Some uninvestigated habitats near densely populated landscapes may be prone to intense CEME impacts. CEME impacts compromise humpback dolphin survival through habitat loss, population fragmentation, alteration of ecological regimes and deterioration of ecosystem functionality. A 30% loss of core habitat can catastrophically reduce the population viability of this species. The best strategy to avoid CEME impacts on humpback dolphin viability is to adopt a conservative planning regime from the outset. To inform habitat protection planning, current and past habitat configuration and habitat characteristics of the humpback dolphin can be clarified by systematically designed surveys, local ecological knowledge investigation, long-term satellite remote-sensing data and species distribution modelling exercises. Sound habitat protection planning includes mapping hierarchical marine protected area (MPA) networks using spatial planning algorithms and carefully examining CEME impacts from an ecosystem perspective. To prevent inappropriate CEME planning, the inclusion of citizen science, local community participation, marine environmental education and effective information delivery is proposed. Questions relating to the proposed areas of habitat loss, the extent of environmental change and the status of population-habitat viability under the scenario of CEME impacts are proposed in order to examine and re-examine the environmental impacts of any CEME project.

AB  - The effects of climate change on species can influence the delicate balance in ecosystems. For this reason, conservation planning needs to take account of connectivity and the related ecological processes within the framework of climate change. In this study, we focus on the change in the ecological connectivity of the Lebanon cedar (Cedrus libani A. Rich.), which is widely distributed in the Mediterranean, particularly in the Amanus and Taurus Mountains. To this end, we evaluated the changes in spatial units providing connectivity in the potential and future distributions of the species through ecological niche modelling, morphological spatial pattern analysis, and landscape metrics. The results suggest that the species is moving to the northeast. According to the future projections, we predict that the potential habitat suitability of the species will shrink significantly and that, in the case of pessimistic scenarios, the extent of the suitable habitats will decrease, particularly in the western and central Taurus Mountain chains. A comparison of potential and future cores indicates that there will be a slight increase under the RCP 4.5 2050 scenario, whereas core areas will decrease in the RCP 4.5 2070, RCP 8.5 2050, and RCP 8.5 2070 scenarios. In addition, it is predicted that bridges would increase in the RCP 4.5 2070 and RCP 8.5 2050 scenarios but decrease in other scenarios.

AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for the survival of species that occupy habitat patches too small to sustain an isolated population. A prominent example of such a species is the European bison (Bison bonasus), occurring only in small, isolated herds, and whose survival will depend on establishing larger, well-connected populations. Our goal here was to assess habitat connectivity of European bison in the Carpathians. We used an existing bison habitat suitability map and data on dispersal barriers to derive cost surfaces, representing the ability of bison to move across the landscape, and to delineate potential connections (as least-cost paths) between currently occupied and potential habitat patches. Graph theory tools were then employed to evaluate the connectivity of all potential habitat patches and their relative importance in the network. Our analysis showed that existing bison herds in Ukraine are isolated. However, we identified several groups of well-connected habitat patches in the Carpathians which could host a large population of European bison. Our analysis also located important dispersal corridors connecting existing herds, and several promising locations for future reintroductions (especially in the Eastern Carpathians) that should have a high priority for conservation efforts. In general, our approach indicates the most important elements within a landscape mosaic for providing and maintaining the overall connectivity of different habitat networks and thus offers a robust and powerful tool for conservation planning.

AB  - The evolutionary and ecological importance of neutral and adaptive genetic diversity is widely recognized. Nevertheless, genetic diversity is rarely assessed for conservation planning, which often implicitly assumes a positive correlation between species and genetic diversity. Multiple drivers can cause the co-variation between the genetic diversity of one species and the richness of the whole communities, and explicit tests are needed to identify the processes that can determine species-genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs). Here, we tested whether intrapopulation genetic diversity (at neutral loci) and species richness co-vary in the amphibian communities of a southern Alpine region (Trentino, Italy), using the common frog (Rana temporaria) as focal species for the study of genetic diversity. We also analysed ecological similarity, niche overlap and interspecific interactions between the species, to unravel the processes determining SGDC. The neutral genetic diversity of common frogs was negatively related to species richness. The negative SGDC was probably due to an opposite influence of environmental gradients on the two levels of biodiversity, since the focal species and the other amphibians differ in ecological preferences, particularly in terms of thermal optimum. Conversely, we did not find evidence for a role of interspecific interactions in the negative SGDC. Our findings stress that species richness cannot be used as a universal proxy for genetic diversity, and only combining SGDC with analyses on the determinants of biodiversity can allow to identify the processes determining the relationships between genetic and species diversity.

AB  - We studied 140 freshwater ponds in eastern Spain spanning a wide range of water source, hydroperiod and regional heterogeneity attributable to orographic and climatic differences. Our aim was to provide a typology for Mediterranean ponds using crustacean assemblages and to find key environmental thresholds that define these pond types. To search for the environmental variables that define these communities, two complementary analyses were used: correspondence analyses (CA) and multivariate regression trees (MRT). We found a high level of specificity of crustaceans defining the different pond types. Three ponds, which were not associated with any of the large set of environmental variables used, were clearly separated from the rest in the CA. These held a very specific and probably relict community, characterised by the large calanoid Hemidiaptomus: we refer to these as Hemidiaptomus' ponds. Taxonomic information suggests a fundamental influence of historical events. The MRT analysis applied to the rest of the ponds allowed us to create a hierarchical order of several current environmental factors that account for their crustacean community composition. Thus, we defined four further pond types. The most important factor structuring communities was hydroperiod, separating temporary ponds, mainly fed by rain, from permanent ponds, fed from more stable sources. Climate-related factors subsequently separated two groups of temporary ponds: (i) temporary ponds in semi-arid areas (mean rainfall <600mmyear1, spring rainfall <150mm), which contained Neolovenula alluaudi and (ii) temporary ponds in semi-humid areas, which contained Mixodiaptomus incrassatus. Amongst the permanent ponds, (iii) lowland coastal spring-fed ponds with quite constant temperatures hosted a singular crustacean community that was well separated from that found in (iv) inland mountain ponds consisting of more ubiquitous crustaceans. These results provide a typology of ponds useful for conservation planning and freshwater biodiversity maintenance. Moreover, the identified ecological thresholds should be helpful in predicting the communities to be expected as a result of changes to land use or climate.

AB  - An important issue in conservation planning is to study the distribution and abundance patterns of species in natural landscapes. Information of concordant and clumped species distribution patterns can enhance attempts to focus conservation efforts in sites/areas preferred by various species. We compared bird species abundance, community composition and species distribution patterns in three large old-growth forest areas (size 40-120 km(2)) in northern boreal Finland on the basis of quantitative bird censuses. Total bird density and species composition, and mean density and variances of the most abundant species were highly similar between the three areas. Most of the bird species were distributed randomly within the areas and species preferring old-growth forests showed compensatory density variation without preference for any sub-area. Mean density of species preferring old-growth forests was significantly higher in the studied large old-growth forests than in smaller old-growth forests and was about threefold higher than regional density of species in a predominantly managed landscape matrix. Bird species preferring old-growth forests are probably not dependent on a certain specific part of a virgin boreal forest landscape but rather on the overall size of the high-quality and diverse old-growth forest area.

AB  - Since the last glacial-interglacial cycles, Mediterranean mountains in Southern Europe have constituted the southern refuge of numerous species of Eurosiberian and Boreal origin. Some vestiges of European Tertiary flora have also remained in this area. These mountains present one of the continent's highest plant diversity indices deriving from their geographic and historical circumstances throughout the Quaternary. Throughout this century, a change in the biogeographic characteristics of these mountains is to be expected as a result of climate change.
   Based on four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios, we developed a multivariate analysis model for mountain ranges in Central Spain (Southern Europe), enabling us to adjust data on vegetation, climate, lithology and availability of soil water. With high-resolution data on species occurrences and abiotic characteristics for better accounting of micro-refugia and topographic complexity in mountain regions, we assess the future potential distribution of tree species and changes in plant communities under climate change. Our model provides the climate descriptors that most influence changes in species distribution and which lead us to consider the parameters of these changes as indicators for management.
   We project for this century a significant spread of Mediterranean tree communities in detriment to temperate or cold-adapted tree communities. In mountain forests in northern Europe. limitations on plant growth are mainly thermic, and the boreal and subalpine species in high- and mid-mountain regions are therefore the ones most threatened by the predicted global warming. To the contrary, our results show that in mountains in southern Europe, the formations that will undergo the greatest changes will be at piedmonts and low-mountain levels, due to increased hydric deficit. These results suggest that nature conservation strategies currently call for new approaches that take into account the fact that climate change is a driving force of species distribution. The results can be used at the landscape scale for management of forest species and for the design of protected areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Many species are susceptible to climatic extremes, yet few fine-scale studies consider the factors that determine the distribution of extreme temperatures at landscape and regional scales. These factors include cold air drainage, canopy cover and topographical exposure to winds and radiation. We used the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) to test whether innovative topoclimatic grids of extreme temperatures are an important predictor of regional-scale species distributions. Location Hunter Valley region, New South Wales, Australia (31.2-33.4 degrees S, 148.6-153.0 degrees E). Methods We modelled the regional distributions of rock-wallaby observations and colonies using topoclimatic, macroclimatic, topographical and habitat factors. We employed a randomization procedure to reduce spatial clustering of records and divide the data into 10 different training and testing datasets. Models were assessed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) on the training datasets, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on the test datasets, and the consistency of the response curves. We compared multiple univariate and multivariate models, rather than producing one true' model, to examine the evidence that different environmental factors consistently influenced the distribution of rock-wallabies. Results The environmental factors that were consistently strongest at explaining the distribution of rock-wallabies were the topoclimatic estimate of extreme cold, the macroclimatic estimate of annual precipitation, and the amount of cleared land within 1600m. Rock-wallaby colonies were in areas where minimum temperatures were high, rainfall was low, and there was a low proportion of cleared land. Topographical surrogates performed well in univariate models but poorly in multivariate models. Main conclusions We have shown that topoclimatic maps of extreme conditions have the potential to model the regional distributions of at least some species better than indirect surrogates based on topography or macroclimate. Topoclimatic grids are an important tool for regional conservation planning, but practitioners need to place more emphasis on the derivation and accuracy of the climate grids, not just the spatial resolution.

AB  - Nature-based tourism has potential to sustain biodiversity and economic development, yet the degree to which biodiversity drives tourism patterns, especially relative to infrastructure, is poorly understood. Here, we examine relationships between different types of biodiversity and different types of tourism in Costa Rica to address three questions. First, what is the contribution of species richness in explaining patterns of tourism in protected areas and country-wide in Costa Rica? Second, how similar are the patterns for birdwatching tourism compared to those of overall tourism? Third, where in the country is biodiversity contributing more than other factors to birdwatching tourism and to overall tourism? We integrated environmental data and species occurrence records to build species distribution models for 66 species of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, and for 699 bird species. We used built infrastructure variables (hotel density and distance to roads), protected area size, distance to protected areas, and distance to water as covariates to evaluate the relative importance of biodiversity in predicting birdwatching tourism (via eBird checklists) and overall tourism (via Flickr photographs) within Costa Rica. We found that while the role of infrastructure is larger than any other variable, it alone is not sufficient to explain birdwatching and tourism patterns. Including biodiversity adds predictive power and alters spatial patterns of predicted tourism. Our results suggest that investments in infrastructure must be paired with successful biodiversity conservation for tourism to generate the economic revenue that countries like Costa Rica derive from it, now and into the future.

AB  - Protected areas play a key role in the preservation of biodiversity, but their implementation at sea is lagged behind terrestrial environments, especially in offshore areas. Here we describe the identification of foraging hotspots off the Mediterranean Iberian coast using three Procellariiform species as examples, and assess the stability of these sites. Then, we show how these foraging hotspots contributed to the delimitation of marine Important Bird Areas (IBAs). The whole process consisted of: (1) seabird data collection (extensive boat-based surveys and seabird tracking, conducted in 1999-2010) and compilation of relevant spatial descriptors of the marine environment; (2) species distribution modeling (SDM) aimed at identifying areas with high habitat quality for the different seabird species (3); identification and delineation of the main seabird hotspots, based on models, supported by direct seabird data, and mediated by expert opinion; (4) application of BirdLife International IBA criteria for hotspot validation; and (5) combination of hotspots from different species to set the final limits of the marine IBAs. This approach allowed to identify a series of hotspots for pelagic species in the study area, and provided nice examples of stability assessment, which slightly differed in performance between seabird species. They contributed to the Spanish marine IBA inventory, which is in the process of receiving legal protection. Future work should be directed at confirming the stability of the marine IBAs in the long term, and to address the development of management plans to make effective the protection of these sites.

AB  - Conservation interventions in developing countries are frequently thwarted by socio-economic agendas, severely limiting the scope and rigor of biodiversity and habitat conservation. Very few ecological assessments incorporate human interests in conservation prioritization, creating asynchrony between planning and implementation. For conservation actions to be logistically feasible, multiple criteria including ecological, social, economic and administrative aspects must be considered. Understanding how these different dimensions interact spatially is also important for gauging the potential for conservation success. Here, we use a guild of select mammalian carnivores (wild canids and hyenas) in India to (i) generate distribution maps at the spatial scale of administrative sub-districts, that are relevant to management, (ii) examine ecological, social and biogeographic factors associated with their distribution, assess key threats, and identify areas important for their conservation, (iii) use prioritization tools for balancing habitat conservation, human needs and economic growth, and (iv) evaluate the spatial congruence between areas with high conservation potential, and areas currently in focus for protection efforts, conservation investments, and infrastructure development. We find that the current Protected Area system does not adequately cover or represent diverse habitats, that there is immense potential for States to increase financial investments towards alternative conservation strategies, and, most infrastructure projects may be potentially jeopardizing important carnivore habitats where the two overlap. Our framework allowed for identifying locations where conservation investments would lead to the highest benefits for carnivores as flagships, which also benefit other species across habitats. We make a case for re-evaluating how large-scale prioritization assessments are made, and for broadening the purview of conservation policies in India and other developing countries.

AB  - Ecological connectivity depends on key elements within the landscape, which can support ecological fluxes, species richness and long-term viability of a biological community. Landscape planning requires clear aims and quantitative approaches to identify which key elements can reinforce the spatial coherence of protected areas design. We aim to explore the probability of the ecological connectivity of forest remnants and amphibian species distributions for current and future climate scenarios across the Central Corridor of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Integrating amphibian conservation, climate change and ecological corridors, we design a landscape ranking based on graph and circuit theories. To identify the sensitivity of connected areas to climate-dependent changes, we use the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate by means of simulations for 2080-2100, representing a moderated emission scenario within an optimistic context. Our findings indicate that more than 70% of forest connectivity loss by climate change may drastically reduce amphibian dispersal in this region. We show that high amphibian turnover rates tend to be greater in the north-eastern edges of the corridor across ensembles of forecasts. Our spatial analysis reveals a general pattern of low-conductance areas in landscape surface, yet with some well-connected patches suggesting potential ecological corridors. Atlantic Forest reserves are expected to be less effective in a near future. For improved conservation outcomes, we recommend some landscape paths with low resistance values across space and time. We highlight the importance of maintaining forest remnants in the southern Bahia region by drafting a blueprint for functional biodiversity corridors.

AB  - Aim Climate change is predicted to alter the distribution and abundance of marine species, including canopy-forming seaweeds which provide important ecosystem functions and services. We asked whether continued warming will affect the distribution of six common canopy-forming species: mid-intertidal fucoids (Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus vesiculosus), low-intertidal Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), subtidal laminarian kelps (Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata) and the invasive Codium fragile. Location Northwest Atlantic. Methods We used occurrence records and the correlative presence-only species distribution model Maxent to determine present-day distribution. This distribution was compared to each species' warm-water physiological thresholds indicating areas of stable or reduced growth and mortality. Present-day models were then projected to mid-century (2040-2050) and end-century (2090-2100) using two contrasting carbon emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and 8.5) and two global climate models from CMIP5 based on changes in ocean temperatures. Results Projected range shifts were minimal under low emissions (RCP2.6), but substantial species-specific range shifts were projected under high emissions (RCP8.5), with all species except C. fragile predicted to experience a northward shift in their southern (warm) edge of <= 406 km by the year 2100. Northward expansions outweighed southern extirpations for fucoids and C. crispus leading to overall range expansions, while range contractions were projected for kelps and C. fragile. Model projections generally agreed with physiological thresholds but were more conservative suggesting that range shifts for kelps may be underpredicted. Main conclusions Our results highlight the benefits to be gained from strong climate change mitigation (RCP2.6), which would limit changes in rocky shore community distribution and composition. The business-as-usual RCP8.5 scenario projected major range shifts, seaweed community reorganization and transitions in dominant species south of Newfoundland by 2100 (similar to 47 degrees N). As canopy-forming seaweeds provide essential habitat, carbon storage, nutrient cycling and commercial value, understanding their response to continued climate warming is critical to inform coastal management and conservation planning.

AB  - Species distribution models, linked to climate projections, are widely used in extinction-risk assessment and conservation planning. However, the degree of confidence that we can place on future climate-change projections depends on global climate-model performance and involves uncertainties that need to be assessed rigorously via climate-model evaluation. Performance assessments are important because the choice of climate model influences projections of species' range movement and extinction risk. A consensus view from the climate modeling community is that no single climate model is superior in its ability to forecast key climatic features. Despite this, the advantages of using multi-model ensemble-averaged climate forecasts to account for climate-model uncertainties have not been recognized by ecologists. Here we propose a method to use a range of skill and convergence metrics to rank commonly used atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) according to their skill in reproducing 20-year observed patterns of regional and global climates of interest, and to assess their consistency with other AOGCMs. By eliminating poorly performing models and averaging the remainder with equal weights, we show how downscaled annual multi-climate-model ensemble-averaged forecasts, which have a strong regional focus, can be generated. We demonstrate that: (1) model ranking (match of simulated to observed conditions) differs according to the skill metric used, as well as the climate variable and season considered; (2) although the multi-model averaged result tends to outperform single models at a global scale, at the continental scale at least some models can perform better than the multi-model average; and (3) forecasts for the Australian region, which are often based on a single AOGCM (CSIRO-3.0), show spatial patterns of change that differ noticeably from ensemble-average projections based on a subset of better-performing AOGCMs. Our suggested approach-novel in the ecology discipline-provides a straightforward, consistent, and defensible method for conservation practitioners and natural-resource managers to generate estimates of future climate change at a spatial resolution suitable for biodiversity impact studies.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures in human-dominated landscapes often contribute to wildlife mortality. Carnivores are especially vulnerable to human-induced mortality due to the perceived threat to livestock and humans. Despite having widespread conservation implications, carnivore mortality data have been largely underutilized within Nepal. This study utilized Maxent to identify high-risk areas and explore the contribution of habitat attributes associated with carnivore mortality using the casualty database within the Gandaki province of central Nepal. We categorized the risk to carnivore species in three taxonomic groups, Felid, Viverridae, and Herpestidae, and identified a 3704-km(2) area within the province at high risk for carnivore casualty. The middle mountains were the riskiest physiographic zone, and the Annapurna Conservation Area represented the largest risk zone among the four protected areas. Agricultural land was the most problematic area in terms of carnivore casualty. The human population was positively associated with high-risk areas and the number of casualties, whereas protected area cover had a negative association. This study identified that the common leopard was at the highest risk of mortality and therefore would benefit from the implementation of an action plan and species-specific conservation strategies, especially within identified high-risk zones. An expansion of protected areas in the middle mountain region would serve to greatly reduce carnivore casualty. Species distribution modeling can be further used with national-level spatial and temporal mortality data to identify the most prominent casualty times and pinpoint potential casualty locations throughout the country.

AB  - We estimated the potential impact of Global Warming on the species richness of Iberian butterflies. First, we determined the grid size that maximized the balance between geographic resolution, area coverage and environmental representativeness. Contemporary richness was modelled in several alternative ways that differed in how sampling effort was controlled for, and in whether the non-climatic variables (physiography, lithology, position) were incorporated. The results were extrapolated to four WorldClim scenarios. Richness loss is to be expected for at least 70% of the area, with forecasts from the combined models being only slightly more optimistic than those from the purely climatic ones. Overall, the most intense losses are predicted for areas of highest contemporary species richness, while the potential slightly positive or nearly neutral changes would most often concentrate in cells of low to moderate present richness. The environmental determinants of richness might not be uniform across the geographical range of sampling effort, suggesting the need of additional data from the least intensively surveyed areas. Implications for insect conservation Re-assessing richness and its environmental determinants in the area proves necessary for more detailed forecasts of the climate-driven changes in butterfly species richness. The expected future conditions imply widespread losses of regional richness, even under the less severe scenarios. Since the negative impact of warming is expected to be extensive, long term conservation plans should concentrate in the present protected areas of highest richness as these are most likely to represent the last refuges for mountain species.

AB  - Global changes require conservation planners to integrate environmental dynamics into their strategies. Forward-looking species-based conservation plans typically use data for a few time periods (ten to thirty years apart) to pinpoint the adaptive areas providing the conditions for species to follow their suitable climates and persist. With such gaps in time, species' responses to environmental conditions between the evaluated periods are not addressed. Here we test whether choices on the temporal resolution in analysis (length of time in between time slices) impact the location and perceived effectiveness of the resulting climate-adaptive areas and the value of established protected areas in providing ground for the spatial responses of species. We address these issues using a conservation exercise set up in Western France, where ten vertebrate species are targeted for persistence in the long term (i.e., 2050). For each species, the area prioritization solutions obtained by using three settings of temporal resolution (annual, decadal and tri-decadal) were largely dissimilar. The climate adaptive areas obtained with annual data defined convoluted adaptive trajectories, largely distinct from the trajectories achieved with decadal and tri-decadal data. This has reflections on the perceived effectiveness of established protected areas in encompassing those adaptive trajectories. In the final stages of planning, conservation planers need to provide rigorous proposals for the establishment of effective conservation actions. This study pinpoints the need for fine-resolute temporal data to reach such effectiveness in the design of climate-proof protected area networks.

AB  - The study aims at evaluating how land-use modifies the link between the observed distribution of species and the climatic variability and at detecting species involved in that modification. The area studied covers the phytogeographical transition between the South-Sudanian sector and the North-Sudanian sector in western Burkina Faso. It lies along an aridity gradient, of which the aridity index (UNESCO-MAB) ranges from 0.363 to 0.533. The data studied were derived from observations performed on 192 woody species in 603 vegetation survey plots inside and outside protected areas. The species turn-over (beta diversity) and the mutual information were assessed along the aridity gradient inside protected areas on one hand and outside protected areas on the other. Our study shows that the statistical links between the geographical distributions of species and the aridity gradient differ according to whether the observations are performed inside or outside the protected areas. Anthropogenic disturbances, mainly agricultural in the region of study, result in a decrease in the beta diversity and in the average mutual information between the distribution of all the woody species and the climatic gradient. Moreover, the variation in mutual information differs according to the species: it diversely decreases with agricultural land-use for most of them, but increases for some. Thus, land-use leads to species-specific changes in the realised climatic niches.

AB  - Knowledge on spatial and seasonal distribution of species is crucial when designing protected areas and implementing management actions. The Baltic Proper harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) population is critically endangered, and its distribution is virtually unknown. Here, we used passive acoustic monitoring and species distribution models to describe the spatial and seasonal distribution of harbour porpoises in the Baltic Proper. Porpoise click detectors were deployed over a systematic grid of 297 stations in eight countries from April 2011 through July 2013. Generalized additive models were used to describe the monthly probability of detecting porpoise clicks as a function of spatially-referenced covariates and time. During the reproductive season, two main areas of high probability of porpoise detection were identified. One of those areas, situated on and around the offshore banks in the Baltic Proper, is clearly separated from the known distribution range of the Belt Sea population during breeding season, suggesting this is an important breeding ground for the Baltic Proper population. We commend the designation of this area as a marine protected area and recommend Baltic Sea countries to also protect areas in the southern Baltic Sea and the Hand Bight where additional important harbour porpoise habitats were identified. Further conservation measures should be carried out based on analyses of overlap between harbour porpoise distribution and potentially harmful anthropogenic activities. Our study shows that large-scale systematic monitoring using novel techniques can give important insights on the distribution of low-density populations, and that international cooperation is pivotal when studying transnationally migratory species.

AB  - Illegal activity within protected forests, such as illegal logging, slash-and-burn farming, and agricultural expansion, has brought many plant and animal species to the brink of extinction and threatens various conservation efforts. The Philippine government has introduced a number of actions to combat environmental degradation, including the use of mobile platforms such as the SMARTLawin system to collect patrol data from the field, which represents a remarkable step towards data-driven conservation management. However, it remains difficult to control illegal forest activity within protected landscapes due to limited patrol and law enforcement resources. A better understanding of the spatial distribution of illegal activity is crucial to strengthening and efficiently implementing forest protection practices. In the present study, we predicted the spatial distribution of illegal activity and identified the associated environmental factors using maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt). Patrol data collected using the SMART-Lawin system from the Baliuag Conservation Area for the period 2017-2019 were used to train and validate the MaxEnt models. We tuned the MaxEnt parameter setting using the ENMeval package in R to overcome sampling bias, avoid overfitting, and balance model complexity. The resulting MaxEnt models provided a clear understanding of the overall risk of illegal activity and its spatial distribution within the conservation area. This study demonstrated the potential utility of data-driven models developed from patrol observation records. The output of this research is beneficial for conservation managers who are required to allocate limited resources and make informed management decisions.

AB  - Over the course of the past decade, in response to United Nations General Assembly resolutions calling for the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization has closed 14 areas around the high-seas portion of Grand Bank and Flemish Cap to protect deep-sea coral and sponge habitats from impacts by bottom-contact fishing gears. Structural and functional connectivity for those areas were not explicitly considered in the area-selection process. We applied a particle-tracking model in each of four seasons to produce dispersal trajectories at the surface and 100 m from start points within the closed areas. These were run in forecast and hindcast modes to identify dispersal kernels. Currents at the surface, 100 m, 1000 m and "on bottom" were examined under an independent model (NEMO) to infer structural connectivity among the areas at relevant depths not available in the particle-tracking model. Spawning times and planktonic larval duration of the dominant sponges, sea pens and gorgonian corals were then considered to evaluate the trajectories as biophysical models, while species distribution models identified potential source populations from hindcast projections. Five of the 14 areas, including the three largest closures, showed particle retention, with three others showing retention within 10 km of their boundaries. The regional pattern of currents and their topographic forcing emerged as a strong structuring agent. A system of weakly-connected closed areas to protect sea pen VMEs on Flemish Cap was identified. The conducted approach illustrates the added value of assessing/modelling networking properties when designing MPAs.

AB  - Designing connected landscapes is among the most widespread strategies for achieving biodiversity conservation targets. The challenge lies in simultaneously satisfying the connectivity needs of multiple species at multiple spatial scales under uncertain climate and land-use change. To evaluate the contribution of remnant habitat fragments to the connectivity of regional habitat networks, we developed a method to integrate uncertainty in climate and land-use change projections with the latest developments in network-connectivity research and spatial, multipurpose conservation prioritization. We used land-use change simulations to explore robustness of species' habitat networks to alternative development scenarios. We applied our method to 14 vertebrate focal species of periurban Montreal, Canada. Accounting for connectivity in spatial prioritization strongly modified conservation priorities and the modified priorities were robust to uncertain climate change. Setting conservation priorities based on habitat quality and connectivity maintained a large proportion of the region's connectivity, despite anticipated habitat loss due to climate and land-use change. The application of connectivity criteria alongside habitat-quality criteria for protected-area design was efficient with respect to the amount of area that needs protection and did not necessarily amplify trade-offs among conservation criteria. Our approach and results are being applied in and around Montreal and are well suited to the design of ecological networks and green infrastructure for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in other regions, in particular regions around large cities, where connectivity is critically low.

AB  - Aim To quantify the impact of the 2019-2020 megafires on Australian plant diversity by assessing burnt area across 26,062 species ranges and the effects of fire history on recovery potential. Further, to exemplify a strategic approach to prioritizing plant species affected by fire for recovery actions and conservation planning at a national scale.
   Location Australia.
   Methods We combine data on geographic range, fire extent, response traits and fire history to assess the proportion of species ranges burnt in both the 2019-2020 fires and the past.
   Results Across Australia, suitable habitat for 69% of all plant species was burnt (17,197 species) by the 2019-2020 fires and herbarium specimens confirm the presence of 9,092 of these species across the fire extent since 1950. Burnt ranges include those of 587 plants listed as threatened under national legislation (44% of Australia's threatened plants). A total of 3,998 of the 17,197 fire-affected species are known to resprout after fire, but at least 2,928 must complete their entire life cycle-from germinant to reproducing adult-prior to subsequent fires, as they are killed by fire. Data on previous fires show that, for 257 species, the historical intervals between fire events across their range are likely too short to allow regeneration. For a further 411 species, future fires during recovery will increase extinction risk as current populations are dominated by immature individuals.
   Main conclusion Many Australian plant species have strategies to persist under certain fire regimes, and will recover given time, suitable conditions and low exposure to threats. However, short fire intervals both before and after the 2019-2020 fire season pose a serious risk to the recovery of at least 595 species. Persistent knowledge gaps about species fire response and post-fire population persistence threaten the effective long-term management of Australian vegetation in an increasingly pyric world.

AB  - Two of the major limitations to effective management of coral reef ecosystems are a lack of information on the spatial distribution of marine species and a paucity of data on the interacting environmental variables that drive distributional patterns. Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = > 0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92% map accuracy) than BRT (68% map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management.

AB  - Climate change is ranked as one of the most severe threats to global biodiversity. This global phenomenon is particularly true for reptiles whose biology and ecology are closely linked to climate. In this study, we used over 1,300 independent occurrence points and different climate change emission scenarios to evaluate the potential risk of changing climatic conditions on the current and future potential distribution of a rock-dwelling lizard; the velvet gecko. Furthermore, we investigated if the current extent of protected area networks in Australia captures the full range distribution of this species currently and in the future. Our results show that climate change projections for the year 2075 have the potential to alter the distribution of the velvet gecko in southeastern Australia. Specifically, climate change may favor the range expansion of this species to encompass more suitable habitats. The trend of range expansion was qualitatively similar across the different climate change scenarios used. Additionally, we observed that the current network of protected areas in southeast Australia does not fully account for the full range distribution of this species currently and in the future. Ongoing climate change may profoundly affect the potential range distribution of the velvet gecko population. Therefore, the restricted habitat of the velvet geckos should be the focus of intensive pre-emptive management efforts. This management prioritization should be extended to encompass the increases in suitable habitats observed in this study in order to maximize the microhabitats available for the survival of this species.

AB  - Any conservation strategy must deal with the uncertainty caused by anthropogenic climate change. In order to forecast such changes, the climate change velocity approach has been used to measure ecosystem exposure to this phenomenon. The Tropical Andes and the Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests (Central Chile) hotspots are priority for conservation due to their high species richness and threats, where climate change is one of the serious pressures to their ecosystems. Even though previous studies have forecasted future climate velocity patterns across the globe, these biodiversity hotspots lack a regional evaluation of the vulnerability to climate change to inform conservation decisions. In this study, we evaluated the vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change velocity at the Southern South America ecoregional system, by using regional climatic data that improves the accuracy of predictions. We estimated forward and backward velocities for temperature and precipitation, and we performed a protected area-level analysis of climate change vulnerability. Also, we compared our results with previous evaluations. We found that forward velocity was higher in the Tropical Andes hotspot for both climatic variables analyzed, whereas backward velocity was higher in the Central Chile hotspot considering just the temperature variable. Finally, we found that in the Central Chile hotspot, smaller protected areas are more vulnerable to climate change as measured by climate change velocity, whereas in the Tropical Andes hotspot, larger protected areas are more vulnerable. Several rapid change areas are expected along the two hotspots. These findings have important conservation implications in the region, especially for the protected areas.

AB  - We developed a multi-scale conservation planning framework for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinails) within the Chesapeake Bay watershed that incorporates both land use and climate stressors. Our specific objectives were to (1) construct a continuous spatial model of brook trout distribution and habitat quality at the stream reach scale; (2) characterize brook trout vulnerability to climate change under a range of future climate scenarios; and (3) identify multi-scale restoration and protection priorities for brook trout across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Boosted regression tree analysis predicted brook trout occurrence at the stream reach scale with a high degree of accuracy (CV AUC = 0.92) as a function of both natural (e.g., water temperature and precipitation) and anthropogenic (e.g., agriculture and urban development) landscape and climatic attributes. Current land use activities result in a predicted loss of occurrence in over 11,000 stream segments (40% of suitable habitat) and account for over 15,000 km (45% of current value) of lost functional brook trout fishery value (i.e., length-weighted occurrence probability) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Climate change (increased ambient temperatures and altered precipitation) is projected to result in a loss of occurrence in at least 3000 additional segments (19% of current value) and at least 3000 km of functional fishery value (9% of current value) by 2062. Model outcomes were used to identify low- and high-quality stream segments within relatively intact and degraded sub-watersheds as restoration and protection priorities, respectively, and conservation priorities were targeted in watersheds with high projected resilience to climate change. Our results suggest that traditional restoration activities, such as habitat enhancement, riparian management, and barrier removal, may be able to recover a substantial amount of brook trout habitat lost to historic landscape change. However, restoration efforts must be designed within the context of expected impacts from climate change or those efforts may not produce long-term benefits to brook trout in this region.

AB  - During summer, the Eastern Beaufort Sea beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas (Pallas, 1776)) population aggregates in the waters of the Mackenzie Estuary and Tarium Niryutait Marine Protected Area (TNMPA). Guided by local communities' priorities, this study aimed to better understand beluga summer habitat selection and to examine whether shifts in beluga distribution are expected under a changing climate. We used a resource selection function (RSF) based on aerial survey data and satellite remote sensing images to estimate the likelihood of beluga presence as a function of environmental conditions. The RSF revealed that belugas selected warm and turbid waters, with suspended particulate matter concentrations and sea surface temperatures ranging above average estuarine values. These specific conditions support hypotheses on the ecological roles of estuaries for belugas such as providing a thermal advantage for their calves or for beluga epidermal moulting. Using a diachronic analysis, we found a distribution shift towards coastal and inshore waters, areas already experiencing effects of climate change. Thus, the current distribution may reflect beluga responses to a changing climate, selecting warmer and more turbid areas. Our finding provides insight into current and evolving beluga habitat and habitat selection under a changing climate, which may help inform beluga management in the TNMPA.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are a conservation mainstay and arguably the most effective conservation strategy for species protection. As a 'megadiverse' country, Peru is a priority for conservation actions. Peruvian legislation allows for the creation of state PM and private/communal PAs. Using publicly available species distribution and protected area data sets we evaluated the coverage of Threatened terrestrial vertebrate species distributions and ecoregions provided by both kinds of PA in Peru. Peru's state PA system covers 217,879 km(2) and private/communal PAs cover 16,588 km2. Of the 462 species of Threatened and Data Deficient species we evaluated, 75% had distributions that overlapped with at least one PA but only 53% had >= 10% of their distributions within PM, with inclusion much reduced at higher coverage targets. Of the species we evaluated, 118 species are only found in national PAs and 29 species only found in private/communal PAs. Of the 17 terrestrial ecoregions found in Peru all are represented in PAs; the national PA system included coverage of 16 and private/communal PAs protect 13. One ecoregion is only protected in private/communal PM, whereas four are only covered in national PM. Our results show the important role private/communal PAs can play in the protection of ecological diversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Few studies have addressed patterns and causes of species endangerment at different resolutions and geographical extents. Using newly developed remote sensing and species distribution data sets, we examined the influence of both natural and anthropogenic factors on the density of terrestrial endangered species in Canada at two spatial scales. The first was at a national extent and the second was within a region of Canada (the mixed wood plains) where there are particularly large numbers of endangered species. We also examined the distribution of protected areas throughout Canada to determine their capacity to shelter endangered species. Land use, which is measured by 1-km resolution satellite data, is a strong predictor of endangered species densities at both scales of analysis. Land use integrates information on habitat loss to agriculture and land use intensity, an index of agricultural pollution. The amount of protected area in a region is unrelated to endangered species numbers except to the extent that areas with the most endangered species are, at best, nearly devoid of protected area. Newly legislated protections for endangered species are unlikely to bring much improvement to this conservation dilemma. Canada's endangered species legislation promotes cooperative conservation activities in areas where species endangerment is most pronounced but does little to protect remaining habitat.

AB  - The Yellow Rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) is a secretive marsh bird of conservation concern in Canada. However, the status of this species in northern boreal regions remains largely unknown given uncertainty about population abundance and distribution. This knowledge gap is mainly due to limitations of traditional survey methods to detect this species. In this study, avian point count data collected from autonomous recording units and augmented by detections from a machine-learning recognizer were used to generate a species distribution model to provide habitat-specific density estimates and population size estimates for Yellow Rail breeding in the Edehzhie Dehcho Protected Area, Northwest Territories. This protected area is similar to 150 km beyond the currently established northern range limit. A large population estimated at 906 (+/- 146) pairs was discovered. Yellow Rail were found at high densities in marshes (0.063 +/- 0.004 males/ha), but were also observed in fens and bogs, albeit at much lower densities (0.003 +/- 0.002 males/ha and < 0.001 +/- 0.002 males/ha). Our results suggest both the range and the population size of Yellow Rail are much larger than currently reported. Further studies are required to provide better population size and distribution estimates to conserve this species at risk in Canada. Received 18 June 2020, accepted 19 January 2021.

AB  - Much of conservation biology has focused on developing approaches for selecting high value sites for protecting biodiversity; what has been lacking are objective criteria for delineating conservation boundaries. Defining protected area boundaries based on occupied species' habitat offers no guarantee that those reserves will continue to provide suitable habitat over time. Focusing on ecosystem protection rather than just species' populations offers a mechanism to protect those species, and does so in a dynamic context. It is the multiple temporal and spatial scales of ecosystem processes that drive habitat dynamics, foster biodiversity, and facilitate adaptations to changing conditions. Embracing the dynamics of ecosystems and their boundaries as criteria for reserve designs also forces a conceptual shift in how to assess populations within conservation areas. Monitoring programs must focus on understanding drivers of change rather than how much change has occurred relative to an arbitrary baseline. The conceptual shift to an ecosystem focus broadens the levels of biodiversity encompassed in a conservation design, and gives greater resilience to the stressors of fragmentation, invasive species, and climate change. California's Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan is highlighted as a conservation design that has adopted an ecosystem focus.

AB  - The 1,080 km(2) Batang Gadis National Park in the North Sumatra province of Indonesia was established in December 2004 by the regional government of Mandailing Natal district. The Park has the potential to make an important contribution to tiger conservation but lacks scientific data on the occurrence of the species. This study aimed to assess the tiger population of the Park, using camera trapping conducted between December 2005 and July 2006. We recorded a mean tiger density of 1.8 tigers per 100 km(2) (95% CI 1.8-6.4) and, based on this, estimated the tiger population in and adjacent to the Park to be 29103 adults. We found that tiger presence was negatively correlated with altitude and positively correlated with distance from forest edge to the interior, and < 18% of the total suitable habitat occupied by tigers was of high quality. This study indicates that Batang Gadis National Park potentially serves as a natural corridor betwen the Angkola and Barumun-Rokan ecosystems, areas totalling c. 6,500 km(2), and that this landscape could serve as a stronghold for tiger populations in northern Sumatra.

AB  - Keibul Lamjao National Park, only home of Brow-Antler Deer, (Rucervus eldii eldii) is the unique floating park of the world. It is a part of the Loktak Lake, Manipur (Ramsar site). The lake gets major share of water from seven feeder rivers. In this paper an attempt has been made to study aquatic insect diversity of the five sites of the national park area which will indicate the health of the unique but deteriorating ecosystem and at the same time reduce aquatic insect data deficiency of the area. The study recorded 3 orders, 12 families and 23 species of aquatic insects. Besides inventorying the aquatic insect taxa, their relationships with several environmental variables including heavy metals were also investigated. The low Shannon Weiner Diversity Index values of aquatic insects (Shannon H' less than 1 in all the sites) indicated perturbed condition of the water of the National Park area. The study revealed very low dissolved oxygen (DO) in all the sites. All the three heavy metals in most of the sites were found beyond the desirable level of BIS (IS 10500:1991). Different biological monitoring scores. and Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) have been used for discussion and interpretation. This study found that although protected areas are meant for protecting biodiversity, management of outside protected area particularly catchment area should be given priority for minimizing land use disturbance, altered hydrology and other related factors.

   Climate change is one of the most significant drivers of habitat loss and species extinction, particularly montane endemic species such as Juniper trees, which are restricted to unique habitats. Therefore, assessing the impact of climate change on the extinction risk of species is a promising tool or guide for species conservation planning. The loss in species habitat due to global warming indicates the level of extinction or endangerment. Predictions of suitable habitats are outputs from assessment analysis. This will help conservationists discover new populations of endemic species and help raise the awareness of local people to save and rescue these endangered species.
   Climate change is an important driver of biodiversity loss and extinction of endemic montane species. In China, three endemic Juniperus spp. (Juniperus pingii var. pingii, J. tibetica, and J. komarovii) are threatened and subjected to the risk of extinction. This study aimed to predict the potential distribution of these three Juniperus species under climate change and dispersal scenarios, to identify critical drivers explaining their potential distributions, to assess the extinction risk by estimating the loss percentage in their area of occupancy (AOO), and to identify priority areas for their conservation in China. We used ensemble modeling to evaluate the impact of climate change and project AOO. Our results revealed that the projected AOOs followed a similar trend in the three Juniperus species, which predicted an entire loss of their suitable habitats under both climate and dispersal scenarios. Temperature annual range and isothermality were the most critical key variables explaining the potential distribution of these three Juniperus species; they contribute by 16-56.1% and 20.4-38.3%, respectively. Accounting for the use of different thresholds provides a balanced approach for species distribution models' applications in conservation assessment when the goal is to assess potential climatic suitability in new geographical areas. Therefore, south Sichuan and north Yunnan could be considered important priority conservation areas for in situ conservation and search for unknown populations of these three Juniperus species.

AB  - To evaluate spatial variations in aquatic beetle assemblages, 26 Patagonian ponds were sampled during late spring (Dec.). The hydroperiod, hydrology, abiotic features, precipitation, aridity, and aquatic plant richness of the study sites differed. Fifteen physicochemical features were measured, and aquatic plants were collected to determine taxonomic richness. Sampling of the 26 ponds produced 21 aquatic beetle taxa in 6 families. All aquatic beetles (adults and larvae) were assigned to functional feeding groups. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was run to assess relationships between aquatic beetle assemblages and environmental variables. Of the variance in aquatic beetle taxa abundances, 23% was accounted for by the 1st 3 ordination axes. Moreover, the 1st 2 canonical axes respectively accounted for 38.2% and 28.4% of the variations attributable to environmental variables (i.e., annual precipitation, elevation, pond area, aquatic plant richness, pH, and conductivity), with conductivity and elevation being the most important. A parsimony analysis was performed to establish which species could define and/or group some of the communities (with sampling sites treated as taxa and species treated as characters). Results of the parsimony analysis suggested that some taxa (Haliplus subseriatus, Gymnochthebius sp., Enochrus darwini, Cyphon sp., Luchoelmis sp., and Rhantus validus) were useful in defining some ponds or groups of ponds. These species can be used as indicators since beetle distributions are not considered to randomly occur. Our findings show that aquatic beetle assemblages can be utilized for wetland conservation planning since in arid and semiarid Patagonia, they are important as water reservoirs and for cattle rearing.

AB  - Tropical forests are highly threatened by human activities, even within the protected areas that have been established to conserve biodiversity. Human activities may have different degrees of impact on vegetation structure, composition and diversity. Some studies have measured direct evidence of human activities in forming disturbance gradients, while others have quantified canopy cover as a proxy for disturbance. When measurement is confined to human activities, disturbance may be underestimated in areas of poor canopy cover where forest degrading activities have ceased. Where measurements are restricted to canopy cover, disturbance may be underestimated in areas of extensive canopy cover that may have been subject to past disturbances, and overestimated for areas where canopy cover is naturally sparse. Combining indicators of past and present disturbances is therefore necessary to examine the full spectrum of human disturbances. Forest vegetation in Popa Mountain Park, Myanmar was surveyed and classified into three levels of disturbance-undisturbed, medium disturbed and highly disturbed-derived from evidence of cutting and canopy cover. The forests are second or third growth after clearing for agriculture in the early 20th century. All trees with >= 10 cm diameter at breast height in 168 sample plots (10 m x 10 m) were identified and measured. Density, basal area and diversity decreased and dominance rose when disturbance increased. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) clearly discriminated three forest stands and CCA axes were significantly correlated to soil moisture, soil nitrogen, elevation, slope, aspect, distance from park boundary and distance from villages.

AB  - The abundance, distribution and diet of the short-beaked common dolphin were investigated as part of the first detailed study on cetacean populations in the North Aegean Sea. Since 2004, the area has been proposed by national and international entities as a marine protected area for common dolphins and other cetacean species owing to its high biodiversity. Abundance and distribution were investigated between 2005 and 2013 through dedicated scientific marine transect surveys, covering 14,701 km, in sea conditions of Beaufort sea state 3 and below. The line-transect sampling method was used to estimate relative abundance, using Distance 6.0 software. Encounter rate for this species in the study area was estimated to be 0.24 groups/100 km (1.5 dolphins/100 km), with a mean group size of 6.88 (SE = 1.90). Common dolphin sightings were analysed for correlations with eight environmental variables (distance from the coast, depth, slope, median salinity, gradient of salinity, median temperature, gradient of temperature and mean current) using generalized additive modelling. Common dolphin sightings were significantly correlated to depth, temperature and salinity. Stomach-content analyses were performed on eight suitable samples from common dolphins stranded in the study area. The trophic level of the species was calculated, indicating that this species is a top predator. This research provides the first estimates for abundance and distribution and the first diet analysis for this Mediterranean Endangered dolphin species in the study area based on a year-round long-term study.

AB  - Red panda Ailurus fulgens, an endangered habitat specialist, inhabits a narrow distribution range in bamboo abundance forests along mountain slopes in the Himalaya and Hengduan Mountains. However, their habitat use may be different in places with different longitudinal environmental gradients, climatic regimes, and microclimate. This study aimed to determine the habitat variables affecting red panda distribution across different longitudinal gradients through a multivariate analysis. We studied habitat selection patterns along the longitudinal gradient in Nepal's Himalaya which is grouped into the eastern, central, and western complexes. We collected data on red panda presence and habitat variables (e.g., tree richness, canopy cover, bamboo abundance, water availability, tree diameter, tree height) by surveys along transects throughout the species' potential range. We used a multimodal inference approach with a generalized linear model to test the relative importance of environmental variables. Although the study showed that bamboo abundance had a major influence, habitat selection was different across longitudinal zones. Both canopy cover and species richness were unimportant in eastern Nepal, but their influence increased progressively toward the west. Conversely, tree height showed a decreasing influence on habitat selection from Eastern to Western Nepal. Red panda's habitat selection revealed in this study corresponds to the uneven distribution of vegetation assemblages and the dry climatic gradient along the eastern-western Himalayas which could be related to a need to conserve energy and thermoregulate. This study has further highlighted the need of importance of bamboo conservation and site-specific conservation planning to ensure long-term red panda conservation.

AB  - Understanding how communities respond to environmental gradients is critical to predict responses of species to changing habitat conditions such as in regenerating secondary habitats after human land use. In this study, ground-living ants were sampled with pitfall traps in 27 plots in a heterogeneous and diverse subtropical forest to test if and how a broad set of environmental variables including elevation, successional age, and tree species richness influence ant diversity and community composition. In total, 13,441 ant individuals belonging to 71 species were found. Ant abundance was unrelated to all environmental variables. Rarefied ant species richness was negatively related to elevation, and Shannon diversity decreased with shrub cover. There was considerable variation in ant species amongst plots, associated with elevation, successional age, and variables related to succession such as shrub cover. It is shown that younger secondary forests may support a species-rich and diverse community of ants in subtropical forests even though the species composition between younger and older forests is markedly different. These findings confirm the conservation value of secondary subtropical forests, which is critical because subtropical forests have been heavily exploited by human activities globally. However, the findings also confirm that old-growth forest should have priority in conservation as it supports a distinct ant community. Our study identifies a set of ant species which are associated with successional age and may thus potentially assist local conservation planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - In fragmented temperate landscapes, species responses to patch and landscape structures are likely to vary across seasons. However, few studies have examined the dynamic effects on biodiversity across seasons. We examined the effects of patch attributes and connectivity and seasonal variation in the effects of these environmental variables on forest bird communities at woodland fragments surrounded by agricultural land across three seasons (breeding, dispersal, and wintering seasons). We surveyed birds in woodland remnants and examined the effects of patch area, woodland connectivity, woodland type, and three interaction terms between these environmental variables and season (patch area x season, connectivity x season, and woodland type x season) on forest bird communities. In the results, species richness, abundance and composition of forest bird communities were associated with patch attributes and connectivity, and some of these associations varied depending on the season. Specifically, there were significantly higher abundances of specialist birds in riparian woodlands compared to conifer woodlands during the breeding season, whereas this pattern was reversed during the winter. In addition, we found the negative effects of patch area during the dispersal and wintering seasons and the positive effect of connectivity during the dispersal season on generalist bird abundances. These results suggest that woodland patches with high conservation values differ among three seasons. The conservation planning for a fragmented landscape therefore needs to consider the role of patch attributes and connectivity during multiple seasons rather than just the breeding season.

AB  - Unsustainable urbanization in the Indo-Pacific continues to threaten terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to habitat disturbances driven by human pressures. The Marikina Watershed, one of the most critical watersheds in the Philippines, has been exposed to economic and population growth resulting in landscape modification and water quality degradation. This led to establishment of the Upper Marikina River Basin Protected Landscape (UMRBPL) to rehabilitate the watershed ecosystem. To strengthen this conservation initiative, we aimed to assess whether the establishment of UMRBPL has been effective in conservation of benthic macroinvertebrate diversity in streams of the Marikina Watershed. Sixteen streams, eight from UMRBPL and eight from adjoining unprotected areas, were monitored for benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and their habitat environments, such as pH, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, conductivity, salinity, and canopy openness. Principal component analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling based on the environmental variables and biological metrics, respectively, revealed that habitat quality and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages significantly differed between the protected and unprotected streams, with the former having better environment and higher biodiversity. More precisely, protected streams have significantly higher dissolved oxygen and lower canopy openness and material loadings as compared to unprotected streams. Consequently, taxon richness was four-fold higher in protected streams while stream quality indices based on abundance of key invertebrate groups (EPT and EPTC) were ten-fold higher in protected streams, as compared to unprotected streams. This study demonstrates that freshwater protected areas play crucial roles in the conservation of stream ecosystems and biodiversity under rapid urbanization in developing countries, like the Philippines.

AB  - Melolonthidae beetles have been proposed as bioindicators because of their important role in the ecosystem and sensitivity to disturbance processes. However, the assemblage structure of these species in Argentina is unknown. In this study, the first attempt at determining Melolonthidae diversity, we analysed the abundance and diversity of the Melolonthidae assemblage and the species richness turnover over a period of three years. We collected samples in a gallery forest relict of a small protected area in which two light traps were installed. We collected a total of 474 specimens belonging to 38 species, two of which are new records for Argentina. The assemblage was characterised by numerous rare species, and the richness and diversity as well as the distribution of species abundance varied over the three years of the study. Replacement values varied based on the similarity indices that were used. Selected environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature and rainfall) were correlated with the richness and the abundance of the beetles. Our results suggest that the community of Melolonthidae could be considered dynamic, even over relatively short periods of time. Rare species play a major role in analyses of the similarity between assemblages and could suggest exaggerated turnover values. The high richness of the study area may be due to its good state of preservation or to its small area, which allows the entry of species from surrounding environments, showing how complex and fluid the Melolonthidae community can be in small patches of forest.

AB  - Determining how widespread human-induced changes such as habitat loss, landscape fragmentation, and climate instability affect populations, communities, and ecosystems is one of the most pressing environmental challenges. Critical to this challenge is understanding how these changes are affecting the movement abilities and dispersal trajectories of organisms and what role conservation planning can play in promoting movement among remaining fragments of suitable habitat. Whereas evidence is mounting for how conservation strategies such as corridors impact animal movement, virtually nothing is known for species dispersed by wind, which are often mistakenly assumed to not be limited by dispersal. Here, we combine mechanistic dispersal models, wind measurements, and seed releases in a large-scale experimental landscape to show that habitat corridors affect wind dynamics and seed dispersal by redirecting and bellowing airflow and by increasing the likelihood of seed uplift. Wind direction interacts with landscape orientation to determine when corridors provide connectivity. Our results predict positive impacts of connectivity and patch shape on species richness of wind-dispersed plants, which we empirically illustrate using 12 y of data from our experimental landscapes. We conclude that habitat fragmentation and corridors strongly impact the movement of wind-dispersed species, which has community-level consequences.

AB  - Nature conservation can be considered a social movement that proposes itself to develop or reaffirm in the society some values concerning the relationship between man and nature [1]. Conservation biology is driven by the same motivations but is distinguished from the nature conservation movement; it is a scientific discipline the aim of which is to supply a knowledge support for the decisions in the field of the biodiversity conservation management. In fact, one of the fundamental aspects in approaching the safeguarding plans is to identify the characteristics for which an area has to be object of a conservation program [2]. Nowadays biogeography stands out as a discipline of central importance for the conservation planning. They use the term 'conservation biogeography' to indicate the application of biogeography principles, theories and analyses on taxa distribution to biodiversity defense problems. Present work concerns the development of a knowledge based system for the endemic species distribution pattern identification.

AB  - Despite the recognized joint impact of climate and land cover change on facets of biodiversity and their associated functions, risk assessments have primarily evaluated impacts on species ranges and richness. Here we quantify the sensitivity of the functional structure of European avian assemblages to changes in both regional climate and land cover. We combine species range forecasts with functional-trait information. We show that species sensitivity to environmental change is randomly distributed across the functional tree of the European avifauna and that functionally unique species are not disproportionately threatened by 2080. However, projected species range changes will modify the mean species richness and functional diversity of bird diets and feeding behaviours. This will unequally affect the spatial structure of functional diversity, leading to homogenization across Europe. Therefore, global changes may alter the functional structure of species assemblages in the future in ways that need to be accounted for in conservation planning.

AB  - In this review I focus on what we need to know to make decisions relevant to land-use planning. I discuss four questions: What information about the distribution of biodiversity is available to decision makers? What sort of information is required at a local scale? Can we use species-distribution modeling to compensate for the lack of empirical information at larger scales? Can we use surrogates based on remote sensing for all our decisions? To be effective, biodiversity information needs to be based on standardized sampling with data made available during the initial planning phases of infrastructure projects, which are now based only on engineering or social considerations and occur several decades before construction starts. The RAPELD method is now being used in many environmental-impact studies to generate standardized data, but there is presently no mechanism to include biodiversity information in the initial phases of decision making, and this has unfavorable consequences for economic development and the environment.

AB  - Smart growth land use planning seeks to balance the infrastructure needs of a growing human population and protection for the environment. Unfortunately, the data required to adequately incorporate biodiversity objectives into land use plans is often not available to planners. One problem is that there are few documented methods that detail how biodiversity data held by resource management agencies can be converted to a format useful for inclusion into smart growth plans. Here we demonstrate an approach that allows for state, provincial, or federal resource management agencies to disseminate data on (1) biodiversity conservation, and (2) conservation of wildlife of recreational value for incorporation into local land use plans. Our approach uses modeled threats and species richness data to identify high priority conservation areas and areas more suitable for future development. This approach provides a transparent mechanism to facilitate inclusion of biodiversity objectives into smart growth planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - China has implemented forest policies and expanded protected areas to halt deforestation and protect giant panda habitats. These policies simultaneously encouraged local communities to raise livestock that then freely range in forests. This grazing had unintended consequences. As an alternative livelihood, it has become the most prevalent human disturbance across the panda's range. How do free-ranging livestock impact giant panda habitats and what are the implications for future conservation and policy on a larger scale? We use Wanglang National Nature Reserve as a case study. It has seen a nine-fold livestock increase during past 15 years. We combined bamboo survey plots, GPS collar tracking, long-term monitoring, and species distribution modelling incorporating species interaction to understand the impacts across spatial and temporal scales. Our results showed that livestock, especially horses, lead to a significant reduction of bamboo biomass and regeneration. The most intensively used areas by livestock are in the valleys, which are also the areas that pandas prefer. Adding livestock presence to predictive models of the giant panda's distribution yielded a higher accuracy and suggested livestock reduce panda habitat by 34%. Pandas were driven out of the areas intensively used by livestock. We recommend the nature reserve carefully implement a livestock ban and prioritise removing horses because they cause the greater harm. To give up livestock, local communities prefer long-term subsidies or jobs to a one-time payment. Thus, we recommend the government provide payments for ecosystem services that create jobs in forest stewardship or tourism while reducing the number of domestic animals.

AB  - This paper studies the factors affecting passerine (Order Passeriformes) species richness in the Western Maghreb, a region at the southwestern border of the Palearctic reputed as a primary wintering ground for many common European birds. The effect of productivity, temperature, landscape structure and geographical location on bird richness was explored at 220 localities across Morocco. The models resulting from multivariate analyses supported the effects of productivity, temperature and landscape cover on bird richness, with higher numbers of species occurring in warm farmlands of the northwest. The most suitable areas for birds avoided the cold and arid expanses of the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara and overlapped with the most human-impacted sectors. Within these areas, we detected an interspersed distribution of sectors of high bird richness and low human incidence. These sectors can be used as priority targets for conservation programmes of common birds during the winter.

AB  - Abundance and other aspects of population ecology have long been known to contribute to shaping the geography of species' distributions. In particular, abundance patterns have recently been shown to negatively correlate with environmental distance from conditions in the center of a species' abiotic niche, rather than vary with distance from the geographic center of a species' distribution. We tested for such associations across 8 species of endangered or threatened bird species in North America using population trend data derived from >4 decades of North American Breeding Bird Surveys. Although we found no consistent overall pattern, we did observe negative population trends at conditions that were the most extreme within species' niches. This suggests that niche peripherality is a relevant factor to consider in conservation planning. Specifically, environmentally peripheral sites may be poor places in which to protect populations of endangered and threatened species, irrespective of how centrally they may occur within species' geographic distributions.

AB  - Species distribution modeling using museum and herbarium collections has been greatly facilitated by analytical algorithms such as MaxEnt. The ability to use herbarium and museum collections to inform conservation decision-making can greatly enhance conservation efforts in biodiversity rich countries when human capacity and in-country data are limited. Guyana is used as a case study for landscape scale biodiversity assessment under such constraints. I compiled specimen records for seven taxon-groups (invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, ferns and non-seed plants, and seed plants), across the Guiana Shield, South America, to assess landscape scale biodiversity richness. Collector and taxonomic bias were addressed a priori in MaxEnt by generating a bias surface layer to down-weight areas of high collection intensity by smoothing the sampling distribution. I summed modeled output for each taxon-group to generate taxon-group specific floral, faunal, and all-taxa biodiversity density surfaces. These surfaces were used to (1) identify areas of relative high biodiversity density; (2) assess possible conservation areas; and (3) compare modeled areas of conservation interest with those proposed by the Government of Guyana. In addition, I compared proposed conservation sites with the location of indigenous (Amerindian) and non-indigenous settlements, and lands used for natural resource extraction. I present three conservation scenarios based on the all-taxa biodiversity surface: (i) biodiversity-only, (ii) biodiversity and available lands; and (iii) collaboration with indigenous peoples. The conservation assessment used here provides an objective basis for selecting conservation sites. Model output can also be used to focus biodiversity assessments on poorly modeled and sampled locations.

AB  - 1. Spatial prioritization, based on the biogeographical identification of priority areas for conservation actions, is an important aspect of conservation planning. Although the influence of factors such as costs, threats or use of surrogates on the resulting priorities has been studied extensively, relatively little is known about how the spatial characteristics of species distributions drive the spatial pattern of priorities in multi-species conservation plans.
   2. Using datasets from Australia and Finland, we explore how excluding or including a given species changes spatial priorities in a multi-species prioritization. We develop three metrics to quantify changes in priorities, and explore how these changes depend on the total number of species used in the prioritization, the spatial characteristics of the given species distribution, and how species share their space with other species used in the prioritization. We randomly selected 12 set of 10 species from each dataset, and explore the influence of each of these species in prioritizations done for a total of 10, 20, 50 or 100 species.
   3. We show that spatial priorities become increasingly stable as the number of species is increased, and that the stability of highest and lowest priority areas behave differently. When less than 50 species were used in a prioritization, intermediately rare species that occupy mostly species-poor habitats tend to have the greatest influence on priorities, whereas very rare and common species that co-occur with many other species tend to have a small influence.
   4. Our results present a systematic method to explore the stability of spatial priorities to changes in the species pool used for a conservation plan. Although the analysed two datasets differed in data type, location, scale and species composition, they both showed how using a small number of species leads to unstable spatial solutions, where the choice to include or exclude an individual species can strongly influence the conservation outcome. Our results also show that conservation planners should carefully assess the use of spatial prioritizations for identifying least important areas (e.g. for development) as these can be particularly unstable when the prioritization is based on a small number of species.

TI  - The role of a global protected areas system in conserving biodiversity in the face of climate change
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE AND PROTECTED AREAS
LA  - English
CP  - Meeting on Global Change and Protected Areas
KW  - biodiversity
KW  - global modeling
AB  - Impending global change requires levels of coordination, long-range planning and funding never before required of protected areas. To meet this need a truly global system of protected areas is required. This system will require major funding and must ensure the persistence of biodiversity over decades and centuries. It will need to include corridors of semi-natural areas, as well as core parks and reserves. It must be able to ensure the persistence of biodiversity across international boundaries and in spite of international differences in scientific expertise and financing ability. Conservation of species and habitat types has been traditionally framed in a static, two dimensional view, in which reserves are intended to protect these in their present locations. Yet overwhelming evidence exists for major shifts in vegetation in the recent, mid-term and log-term past. The interplay of climate changes and habitat destruction threatens the existing system of isolated reserves. Climate change will create new ranges for many species. Large areas converted to human use, such as agriculture and housing will cut off existing populations from these new ranges. A truly global protected area system does not yet exist. Currently there is a global group of national systems, some of which are connected through information network. Cross border protected areas have existed to protect shared wildlife resources, particularly in Africa, for decades. IUCN regional reviews have provided information to improve protected area network coverage based on regional needs. None of these efforts fully incorporates climate change considerations nor promotes connectivity in the log-term on a global scale. Only a global protected area system which creates corridors between reserves and protects historic locales of habitat suitability can minimize biodiversity loss in the face of climate change and habitat destruction. Currently more than half the habitable surface of the planet is dedicated to human uses. Climate change will be driving vegetation shifts across this landscape. Species with strong dispersal ability will fill new ranges, while slower dispersing species will be unable to STS jump the gap CCH to a new habitat Species with less dispersal ability will become locally extinct, and eventually large-scale loss of biodiversity will occur. A global system will require a global modelling effort, prioritisation, and novel finance mechanisms. A coordinates global modelling system will be required to determine likely biological changes in response to climate change. Base don model results. priority areas for international investment can be selected. Since biodiversity hotspots are predominantly in the temperate countries. a new international protocol and new mechanisms of finance will be required. Finally. because available land for protected areas is nearly exhausted. global financing will have to buy back land and convert it from human use to natural or semi-natural cover in key corridor areas. This paper present a preliminary proposal for such a system.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the impact of climate change on keystone subalpine conifers, Tsuga diversifolia and Abies veitchii, incorporating the uncertainties of general circulation models (GCMs) for spatial conservation planning in Japan. Potential habitats for T. diversifolia and A. veitchii under current and 20 GCMs in 2080-2100 were predicted using generalized additive models. We counted the number of GCMs under which current potential habitat was predicted to lose by a spatial unit and used them as indices of vulnerability and prediction uncertainty. Gaps between protected areas and potential habitats under the future climates were identified. Reasonably accurate models revealed that T. diversifolia and A. veitchii require cool and wet summers with low winter precipitation. Only less than 1 % of current potential habitats for the species were predicted to be sustainable with low GCMs-related uncertainties. Most of these certainly sustainable habitats were designated as protected areas. Of current potential habitats for T. diversifolia and A. veitchii, 88 and 97 % were predicted to be non-habitats under future climates with low GCMs-related uncertainties. These certainly vulnerable habitats included the southern and low elevated northern range limits of the species, of which 70 % were designated as protected areas. These results suggest that subalpine conifers are vulnerable to the climate change irrespective of GCMs variation. Strengthening of monitoring may be necessary, especially at unprotected and certainly vulnerable habitats in lower subalpine areas where influences of the climate change will appear first. Active management including assisted regeneration may be necessary for preserving the vulnerable and genetically endemic populations.

AB  - Many threats to biodiversity can be predicted and are well mapped but others are uncertain in their extent, impact on biodiversity, and ability for conservation efforts to address, making them more difficult to account for in spatial conservation planning efforts, and as a result, they are often ignored. Here, we use a spatial prioritisation analysis to evaluate the consequences of considering only relatively well-mapped threats to biodiversity and compare this with planning scenarios that also account for more uncertain threats (in this case mining and armed conflict) under different management strategies. We evaluate three management strategies to address these more uncertain threats: 1. to ignore them; 2. avoid them; or 3. specifically target actions towards them, first individually and then simultaneously to assess the impact of their inclusion in spatial prioritisations. We apply our approach to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and identify priority areas for conserving biodiversity and carbon sequestration services. We found that a strategy that avoids addressing threats of mining and armed conflict more often misses important opportunities for biodiversity conservation, compared to a strategy that targets action towards areas under threat (assuming a biodiversity benefit is possible). We found that considering mining and armed conflict threats to biodiversity independently rather than simultaneously results in 13 800-14 800 km(2) and 15 700-25 100 km(2) of potential missed conservation opportunities when undertaking threat-avoiding and threat-targeting management strategies, respectively. Our analysis emphasises the importance of considering all threats that can be mapped in spatial conservation prioritisation.

AB  - Species distribution maps are widely used in predicting areas of conservation concern, particularly where species distributions are poorly known. However, the accuracy of range maps for regional/local planning is questionable. We compared published putative geographic range polygons of ten primate species to their actual occupancy at 23 survey sites in southeastern Peru to assess the fine-scale accuracy of these polygons for regional conservation planning. We analyzed the proportion of sites at which each species was detected, both inside and outside of its published NatureServe [Patterson et al., Digital distribution maps of the mammals of the western hemisphere. Version 1.0. Arlington, VA, 2003] and IUCN [2008; Red List, 2008] range polygons. There were mismatches between our line-transect survey data and range polygon boundaries for nine of the ten species (from 15 to 80% cases), including both false presences and false absences. Each published dataset overestimated the presence of seven primate species and the absence of four species, though errors varied among species. Occupancy patterns of species with larger geographic ranges were no more accurately predicted than those of more narrow-range species. Regional barriers to dispersal, such as rivers, and finer-scale ecological specialization may limit the applicability of range map polygons to regional-scale conservation priority setting, even for relatively well-studied taxa. Despite the risk of errors, range polygons are still used as baseline data in conservation planning. We suggest some measures that could reduce the error risk. Am. J. Primatol. 73:53-61, 2011.

AB  - Current and expected shifts in climate are threatening global biodiversity and are forcing managers to re-evaluate how they plan for the protection of species and ecosystems. We propose and illustrate a methodology for identifying geographic locations where climate is expected to remain within the tolerances of conservation targets despite a generally warming climate. Using Generation 3 of the Canadian General Circulation Model and ClimateBC (a climate interpolation and downscaling tool). bioclimatic envelopes were developed for three examples of forest conservation targets. The geographic distribution of the resulting envelopes was projected for four timeslices, and then overlaid using ArcMap GIS software. The resultant intersection of points is presumed to indicate locations of persistent climate over the study's timeframe. Next, a target's current mapped distribution was overlaid with the distribution of climate expected to remain within its bioclimatic envelope; the intersection of these points is considered the target's "temporal corridor." Current locations with persistent climate are thus expected to provide climatic continuity over time, sufficient to sustain the conservation target. Whereas landscape corridors can provide connectivity in geographic space, temporal corridors are projected to provide continuity in climatic space and over time. The identification of such locations facilitates prioritization of sites for the acquisition or designation of protected areas, and provides guidance on where other current management policies and practices can persist. The projection and mapping of temporal corridors is conceptually simple, yet this can be a powerful tool with many potential applications to assist natural resources planners and managers in a rapidly changing environment.

AB  - There is an increasing demand for fisheries resources worldwide. For example, the Asian markets have traditionally consumed sea cucumber as a delicacy and their buoyant economies have promoted demand for it in recent years. The brown sea cucumber Isostichopus fuscus is the most valuable species from the Eastern Pacific and it has been almost depleted due to overfishing. In this work, we analyzed data of sea cucumber abundance collected monthly (October 2014 December 2016) along the west coast of the Gulf of California (29.95 degrees N similar to 28.05 degrees N) in 1,107 swath (25 x 2 m) quadrats performed at 118 sites with the goal of determining if current fishing quotas are sustainable. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach with integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to this data to account for spatial structure in the data when calculating densities. The observed density ranged from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 0.58 ind/m(2), with an average of 0.03 ind/m(2) in suitable habitat, defined as the habitat less than 30 m deep and with hard substrate. There are large spatial variations in abundance, but the overall mean suitable habitat is 15.7% (min = 7.8%, max = 28.8%) of the total fishing area. Current quotas are usually higher than 5% of the lower bounds of population density estimates. We propose, among other management measures, that quotas should be granted taking into account the spatial structure of sea cucumber densities as well as the proportion of suitable area within each estate. Given the high levels of illegal fishing within the Gulf of California, it is imperative that quotas are based on the lower bounds of spatially explicit density estimates - along with increased surveillance and enforcement if the long-term commercial sustainability of the fishery is to be maintained.

AB  - Aim The dimensions of species vulnerability to climate change are complex, and this impedes efforts to provide clear advice for conservation planning. In this study, we used a formal framework to assess species vulnerability to climate change quantifying exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and then used this information to target areas for reducing vulnerability at a regional scale.
   Location The 6500-km(2) Mount Lofty Ranges region in South Australia.
   Methods We quantified the vulnerability of 171 plant species in a fragmented yet biologically important agro-ecological landscape, typical of many temperate zones globally. We specified exposure, using three climate change scenarios; sensitivity, as the adverse impact of climate change on species' spatial distribution; and adaptive capacity, as the ability of species to migrate calculated using dispersal kernels. Priority areas for reducing vulnerability were then identified by incorporating these various components into a single priority index.
   Results Climate change had a variable impact on species distributions. Those species whose range decreased or shifted geographically were attributed higher sensitivity than those species that increased geographic range or remained unchanged. The ability to adapt to range changes in response to shifting climates varies both spatially and between species. Areas of highest priority for reducing vulnerability were found at higher altitudes and lower latitudes with increasing severity of climate change.
   Main conclusions Our study demonstrates the use of a single spatially explicit index that identifies areas in the landscape for targeting specific conservation and restoration actions to reduce species vulnerability to climate change. Our index can be transferred to other regions around the world in which climate change poses an increasing threat to native species.

AB  - Data on species distribution and management requirements are increasingly being used in urban landscape and conservation planning. Prairie crocus (Anemone patens L.) is a perennial herb whose populations have disappeared from the vicinity of most European cities. However, it can still be found within some urban areas in North America. This allows the study of the factors affecting urban populations of this species, which can be effectively utilized in land-use planning and habitat management.
   The aim of this research was to identify the type of management of native remnants of grasslands that would preserve A. patens populations within an urban and semi-urban landscape, as well as the relationship of this species to surrounding land use and human population. A total of 187 locations of A. patens were mapped along the urban-rural gradient within the city of Saskatoon and its vicinity in Saskatchewan, Canada. The degree of disturbance associated with management practices was recorded. Land use and human population was calculated within a 500 m radius of each location. These parameters were compared with the number of individuals of A. patens.
   It was revealed that urban populations of A. patens are positively correlated with grazing and burning. Proportion of urbanized land was negatively correlated with A. patens population size while natural habitat had a positive-effect. It is argued that preservation of sufficiently large natural remnants, appropriate management and restoration projects are necessary for the conservation of populations of A. patens in urban landscapes.

AB  - Several of the most important conservation prioritization approaches select markedly different areas at global and regional scales. They are designed to maximize a certain biodiversity dimension such as coverage of species in the case of hotspots and complementarity, or composite properties of ecosystems in the case of wilderness. Most comparisons between approaches have ignored the multidimensionality of biodiversity. We analyze here the results of two species-based methodologies-hotspots and complementarity-and an ecosystem-based methodology-wilderness-at local scale. As zoning of protected areas can increase the effectiveness of conservation, we use the data employed for the management plan of the Peneda-Gers National Park in Portugal. We compare the approaches against four criteria: species representativeness, wilderness coverage, coverage of important areas for megafauna, and for regulating ecosystem services. Our results suggest that species- and ecosystem-based approaches select significantly different areas at local scale. Our results also show that no approach covers well all biodiversity dimensions. Species-based approaches cover species distribution better, while the ecosystem-based approach favors wilderness, areas important for megafauna, and for ecosystem services. Management actions addressing different dimensions of biodiversity have a potential for contradictory effects, social conflict, and ecosystem services trade-offs, especially in the context of current European biodiversity policies. However, biodiversity is multidimensional, and management and zoning at local level should reflect this aspect. The consideration of both species- and ecosystem-based approaches at local scale is necessary to achieve a wider range of conservation goals.

AB  - To mitigate the ongoing biodiversity crisis in Tropical Asia, caused by extensive deforestation and wildlife poaching, we will need to take more strategic approaches towards identifying and prioritizing meaningful conservation interventions. This, however, can prove difficult for data-limited species. Focusing on the little-studied mainland clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), a potential umbrella species in the region, we demonstrate an accessible, flexible, and scalable approach applicable to any species. First, we model the species' range-wide local extirpation threat using a Bayesian Belief Network, taking into account the distribution of remaining suitable habitat and major anthropogenic threats (habitat loss and poaching). We then identify remaining habitat strongholds (defined as large contiguous areas of high quality habitat where the species could survive over the mid-to-long term) and grouped them into stronghold complexes, which we categorized based on local extirpation threat and recent camera-trap survey status. Our results show a 34% decline in the range-wide area categorized as a stronghold due to forest cover changes between 2000 and 2018, with 80% of remaining strongholds identified as having a high or very high average threat of local extirpation. Based on published records, only 60% of remaining strongholds had at least one site surveyed by camera-traps in the last 10 years, highlighting an important knowledge gap concerning the species' current distribution and population status. Combined, the results of our survey review and threat analysis suggest the species is likely extirpated from all of Vietnam, most of China, and large parts of Cambodia and Laos. Finally, we synthesize our findings, highlight tangible conservation needs, and propose actions for each stronghold complex based on the area's specific threats, protection level, and survey status, paving the way for the detailed local investigations needed to implement meaningful interventions on the ground.

AB  - Seabirds are among the most threatened birds as a result of acute exposure to many anthropogenic threats. Their effective conservation requires a detailed understanding of how seabirds use marine habitats. Recently, one of the largest no-take marine reserves in the Atlantic was designated in tropical waters surrounding Ascension Island, on which the largest Atlantic population of sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus) breeds. Although they are the most abundant tropical seabird, they appear to have suffered marked population declines on Ascension Island as they have elsewhere. Here, we describe year-round movements and habitat use of male and female sooty terns between 2011 and 2015. On average, birds traveled 47,000 km during their 8 months of migration, during which they remained within 2,900 km of the island. They spent most of the day and night in flight, only touching down briefly on the ocean most likely to feed. Habitat suitability models successfully predicted foraging ranges of birds and their at-sea distributions varied considerably between seasons, years and sexes. Considerable variation in range overlap between birds and the new marine protected area (MPA) suggests that similar such studies of other marine taxa are urgently needed. The range of sooty terns mainly falls in the high seas outside of the new MPA, highlighting the very large areas that many oceanic seabirds forage across and the challenges their conservation present.

AB  - Because of time and resource limitations, extensive studies of distributions at fine resolutions over entire landscapes are not viable, and distribution maps must be delineated using static habitat models. In cases where short life cycles and time limitations prevent the collection of detailed abundance and distributional data to generate habitat models for target species, one potential alternative is to use models of the abundance or occurrence of closely associated Species (e.g., prey, host plant, mutualist) to predict the abundance or occurrence of the target species. We present a predictive model for the habitat of the butterfly Plebejus argus in scrubland in a protected area in southern Spain (Donana National Park), based on the distribution of its mutualist ant Lasius niger, field habitat data, and. topographical variables from a digital elevation model. The frequency of nests of L. niger was by far the major predictor of P. argus abundance and presence-absence. In turn, high L. niger frequency was associated with low elevations presence of heathland vegetation, and intermediate latitudes within the site, reflecting the depth of the water table. L. niger frequency predicted by models from 50 calibration 100-m grid squares was significantly correlated with observed frequencies in 30 independent evaluation squares. Observed P. argus abundance in the same evaluation sites was more closely correlated with predicted L. niger frequency alone than with predicted P. argus abundances from a model including L. niger and additional topographical variables. In contrast, P. argus presence absence was better predicted by models containing topographic variables as well as L. niger frequency, although it was also closely related with predicted L. niger frequency alone. Thus, our study shows how to use modeled species distributions to predict those of their associates. We further suggest that the models could be used to assess the potential effects of the declining water table depth and the resulting habitat changes on P. argus distribution and abundance in Donana.

AB  - The costs of monitoring species of concern in data-limited regions can hinder effective management. However, careful biological survey design can improve monitoring of critical areas, and help develop ecosystem-based approaches, including spatial management frameworks. The current study aims to reduce the cost of environmental monitoring of sea turtles, river dolphins and manatees within the Soure Marine Extractive Reserve (MER), a multiuse MPA adjacent to Marajo Island, Brazil by creating a data-driven monitoring prioritization framework. Here we present a novel and adaptable approach for designing surveys and prioritizing monitoring areas within the coastal and marine habitats of MER. We mapped all the anthropogenic activities occurring in the area and used the fuzzy logic framework to identify high priority locations. Fuzzy logic models go beyond binary categorization, allowing elements to belong to one or more categories. This framework also incorporates spatial uncertainty of reporting data. Our results indicate that approximately 30% of the Soure MER core area has a high monitoring priority, with some spillover into the buffer zone. The model defined the southeast portion of the core area as the largest single patch available for monitoring a species of concern, due to the higher concentration of fixed fishing gear operations. For the future, this model could be adapted to inform habitat suitability and test the effectiveness of the different use zones delimitated in the Soure MER management plan.

AB  - We assessed the density of argali (Ovis ammon) and ibex (Capra sibirica) in Sarychat-Ertash Nature Reserve and its neighbouring Koiluu valley. Sarychat is a protected area, while Koiluu is a human-use landscape which is a partly licenced hunting concession for mountain ungulates and has several livestock herders and their permanent residential structures. Population monitoring of mountain ungulates can help in setting measurable conservation targets such as appropriate trophy hunting quotas and to assess habitat suitability for predators like snow leopards (Panthera uncia). We employed the double-observer method to survey 573 km(2) of mountain ungulate habitat inside Sarychat and 407 km(2) inside Koiluu. The estimated densities of ibex and argali in Sarychat were 2.26 (95% CI 1.47-3.52) individuals km(-2) and 1.54 (95% CI 1.01-2.20) individuals km(-2), respectively. Total ungulate density in Sarychat was 3.80 (95% CI 2.47-5.72) individuals km(-2). We did not record argali in Koiluu, whereas the density of ibex was 0.75 (95% CI 0.50-1.27) individuals km(-2). While strictly protected areas can achieve high densities of mountain ungulates, multi-use areas can harbour meaningful though suppressed populations. Conservation of mountain ungulates and their predators can be enhanced by maintaining Sarychat-like "pristine" areas interspersed within a matrix of multi-use areas like Koiluu.Y

AB  - Wide-ranging marine birds rely on multiple habitats for wintering, breeding, and migrating, and their conservation may be dependent on protecting networks of key areas. Urbanized estuaries are critical wintering and stopover areas for many declining sea ducks in North America; however, conservation measures within estuaries are difficult to establish given lack of knowledge about habitat use by these species and the variety of competing human interests. We applied hierarchical modeling to evaluate resource selection of sea ducks (surf scoters, Melanitta perspicillata) wintering in San Francisco Bay, California, USA, a large and highly urbanized estuary. We also examined their distribution, home range, and movements with respect to key habitat features and regions within the estuary. Herring roe was the strongest predictor of bird locations; however, eelgrass, water depth and salinity were also highly-ranked, with sea ducks using deeper areas of higher salinity associated with herring roe and eelgrass presence during mid-winter. Sea ducks were also strongly associated with ferry routes, suggesting these areas may contain resources that are too important to avoid and emphasizing the need to better understand water traffic effects. Movements and home range size differed between males and females in early winter but became more similar in late winter. Birds traveled farther and used several sub-bays in early winter compared to mid-winter when herring roe availability peaked in the Central Bay. Our findings identified key environmental variables, highlighted core use areas, and documented critical periods for consideration when developing conservation plans for sea ducks in urbanized estuaries.

AB  - Geographic ranges of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and Gunnison Sage-Grouse (C. minimus) have contracted across large areas in response to habitat loss and detrimental land uses. However, quantitative analyses of the environmental factors most closely associated with range contraction have been lacking, results of which could be highly relevant to conservation planning. Consequently, we analyzed differences in 22 environmental variables between areas of former range (extirpated range), and areas still occupied by the two species (occupied range). Fifteen of the 22 variables, representing a broad spectrum of biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic conditions, had mean values that were significantly different between extirpated and occupied ranges. Best discrimination between extirpated and occupied ranges, using discriminant function analysis (DFA), was provided by five of these variables: sagebrush area (Artemisia spp.); elevation; distance to transmission lines; distance to cellular towers; and land ownership. A DFA model containing these five variables correctly classified >80% of sage-grouse historical locations to extirpated and occupied ranges. We used this model to estimate the similarity between areas of occupied range with areas where extirpation has occurred. Areas currently occupied by sage-grouse, but with high similarity to extirpated range, may not support persistent populations. Model estimates showed that areas of highest similarity were concentrated in the smallest, disjunct portions of occupied range and along range peripheries. Large areas in the eastern portion of occupied range also had high similarity with extirpated range. By contrast, areas of lowest similarity with extirpated range were concentrated in the largest, most contiguous portions of occupied range that dominate Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, and western Wyoming. Our results have direct relevance to conservation planning. We describe how results can be used to identify strongholds and spatial priorities for effective landscape management of sage-grouse.

AB  - Identification of refugia is an increasingly important adaptation strategy in conservation planning under rapid anthropogenic climate change. Granite outcrops (GOs) provide extraordinary diversity, including a wide range of taxa, vegetation types and habitats in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). However, poor characterization of GOs limits the capacity of conservation planning for refugia under climate change. A novel means for the rapid identification of potential refugia is presented, based on the assessment of local-scale environment and vegetation structure in a wider region. This approach was tested on GOs across the SWAFR. Airborne discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and Red Green and Blue (RGB) imagery were acquired. Vertical vegetation profiles were used to derive 54 structural classes. Structural vegetation types were described in three areas for supervised classification of a further 13 GOs across the region. Habitat descriptions based on 494 vegetation plots on and around these GOs were used to quantify relationships between environmental variables, ground cover and canopy height. The vegetation surrounding GOs is strongly related to structural vegetation types (Kappa = 0.8) and to its spatial context. Water gaining sites around GOs are characterized by taller and denser vegetation in all areas. The strong relationship between rainfall, soil-depth, and vegetation structure (R 2 of 0.8-0.9) allowed comparisons of vegetation structure between current and future climate. Significant shifts in vegetation structural types were predicted and mapped for future climates. Water gaining areas below granite outcrops were identified as important putative refugia. A reduction in rainfall may be offset by the occurrence of deeper soil elsewhere on the outcrop. However, climate change interactions with fire and water table declines may render our conclusions conservative. The LiDAR-based mapping approach presented enables the integration of site-based biotic assessment with structural vegetation types for the rapid delineation and prioritization of key refugia.

AB  - Chronic overfishing has depleted numerous elasmobranch stocks in the North East Atlantic, but addressing this issue has been hampered by management complications and lacking data. Spatial management approaches have thus been advocated. This work presents a novel application and further development of an advanced spatial modeling technique to identify candidate nursery grounds and spawning areas for conservation, by subsetting already limited data. Boosted Regression Tree models are used to predict abundance of juvenile and mature female cuckoo (Leucoraja naevus), thornback (Raja clavata), blonde (Raja brachyura), and spotted (Raja montagui) rays in the Irish Sea using fish survey data and data describing fishing pressure, predation and environmental variables. Model-predicted spatial abundance maps of these subsets reveal distinct nuances in species distributions with greater predictive power than maps of the whole stock. These resulting maps are then integrated into a single easily understood map using a novel approach, standardizing and facilitating the spatial management of data-limited fish stocks.

AB  - The 400-500 wolves currently living in the Apennine range of peninsular Italy are slowly recolonizing the Alps and are expected to move northward. A nationwide management plan for the Italian wolf population is being prepared, and a zoning system with connecting corridors has been suggested. We developed a large-scale probabilistic model of wolf distribution as a contribution to the planning process. Thirteen environmental variables related to wolf needs and human Presence were analyzed in 12 well-studied wolf territories and in 100 areas where the species has been absent for the Past 25 years. These two areas were used as a training set in a discriminant analysis to evaluate Potential wolf presence throughout the entire country. We used the Mahalanobis distance statistic ns an index of environmental quality, calculated as the distance from the arrange environmental conditions of the wolf territories. Based on the Mahalanobis distance statistics, we constructed an actual and potential spatial distribution of the wolf for all of peninsula Italy. The jackknife procedure trans used to assess the stability of the distance model and showed good confidence in our model (coefficient of variation less than or equal to 13%). Distance from the wolf territories' centroid ns an index of environmental quality for the wolf was tested using 287 locations where wolves have been found dead in the past 25 years as a consequence of human action (poison, shotgun car accidents). A useful contribution to conservation Planning resulted from comparing the frequency distribution of the Mahalanobis distance of the dead wolf locations with the percentage? of study area within each distance class. This showed how the number of wolf casualties would greatly decrease with Protection of only a minor part of the study area and indicated the usefulness of our approach for evaluation of other conservation options, such as core areas and corridor identification.

AB  - The acid frogs of eastern Australia are a highly specialized group of threatened species endemic to acidic coastal wetlands of southern Queensland and New South Wales. The distribution of these species overlaps with areas of increasing development where land-use intensification poses a significant threat. Successful conservation of these species requires that areas of high conservation value for acid frogs are properly identified and protected, particularly in south-east Queensland which supports important populations of all four acid frog species: Litoria olongburensis, Litoria freycineti, Crinia tinnula, and the Queensland-endemic Litoria cooloolensis. Species distribution modeling using rigorously vetted species occurrence data was used to identify areas of potential acid frog habitat with >89% predictive power for all species. Key predictor variables for acid frog species occurrence included: soil sandiness, vegetation, presence and/or type of wetland, and soil clay content. All species' predicted distributions occurred primarily in coastal regions, overlapping with densely human-populated areas. Our modeling and analysis of species' distributions highlight local government areas where protection of wallum habitat is most important for the conservation of acid frogs, as well as areas of higher conservation value providing habitat for multiple acid frog species.

AB  - The analysis of individual movement choices can be used to better understand population-level resource selection and inform management.
   We investigated movements and habitat selection of 13 bobcats in Vermont, USA, under the assumption individuals makes choices based upon their current location. Results were used to identify "movement-defined" corridors.
   We used GPS-collars and GIS to estimate bobcat movement paths, and extracted statistics on land cover proportions, topography, fine-scale vegetation, roads, and streams within "used" and "available" space surrounding each movement path. Compositional analyses were used to determine habitat preferences with respect to landcover and topography; ratio tests were used to determine if used versus available ratios for vegetation, roads, and streams differed from 1. Results were used to create travel cost maps, a primary input for corridor analysis.
   Forested and scrub-rock land cover were most preferred for movement, while developed land cover was least preferred. Preference depended on the composition of the "available" landscape: Bobcats moved > 3 times more quickly through forest and scrub-rock habitat when these habitats were surrounded by agriculture or development than when the available buffer was similarly composed. Overall, forest edge, wetland edge and higher stream densities were selected, while deep forest core and high road densities were not selected. Landscape-scale connectivity maps differed depending on whether habitat suitability, preference, or selection informed the travel cost map.
   Both local and landscape scale land cover characteristics affect habitat preferences and travel speed of bobcats, which in turn can inform management and conservation activities.

AB  - The Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is a threatened alcid that nests almost exclusively in old-growth forests along the Pacific coast of North America. Nesting habitat has significant economic importance. Murrelet nests are extremely difficult and costly to find, which adds uncertainty to management and conservation planning. Models based on air photo interpretation of forest cover maps or assessments by low-level helicopter flights are currently used to rank presumed Marbled Murrelet nesting habitat quality in British Columbia. These rankings are assumed to correlate with nest usage and murrelet breeding productivity. Our goal was to find the models that best predict Marbled Murrelet nesting habitat in the ground-accessible portion of the two regions studied. We generated Resource Selection Functions (RSF) using logistic regression models of ground-based forest stand variables gathered at plots around 64 nests, located using radio-telemetry, versus 82 random habitat plots. The RSF scores are proportional to the probability of nests occurring in a forest patch. The best models differed somewhat between the two regions, but include both ground variables at the patch scale (0.2-2.0 ha), such as platform tree density, height and trunk diameter of canopy trees and canopy complexity, and landscape scale variables such as elevation, aspect, and slope. Collecting ground-based habitat selection data would not be cost-effective for widespread use in forestry management; air photo interpretation and low-level aerial surveys are much more efficient methods for ranking habitat suitability on a landscape scale. This study provides one method for ground-truthing the remote methods, an essential step made possible using the numerical RSF scores generated herein.

AB  - Habitat selection models for woodland species usually consider forest attributes derived from land cover maps, such as an area covered by forests or distance to forest edge, but canopy cover is less frequently used as a predictor. We evaluated the effect of including forest canopy cover data in habitat selection models for woodland species using the endangered Iberian lynx as a case study. We considered four canopy cover classes for both conifer and broadleaved forests, together with other land cover predictors, and analyzed a large telemetry (GPS-GSM collars) dataset. The model that included forest canopy cover outperformed, both in predictive power and in conservation management insights, the model that only used forest area. The effect of forest canopy cover on lynx habitat selection was especially strong for broadleaved forests; an increased tree cover in these forests consistently translated into significantly lower selection probabilities. Open broadleaved forests were found to clearly be the most preferred habitat. By contrast, the habitat model without canopy cover data indicated that broadleaved forests were significantly less preferred than shrublands and mountain olive groves, which may mislead conservation management actions. We conclude that habitat selection models for woodland species should consider forest canopy cover as a relevant candidate predictor as it can capture important factors influencing habitat use, such as understory vegetation abundance or prey availability. Recent developments on remote sensing technologies will increase the availability of spatially continuous information on canopy cover, facilitating a more widespread use of vegetation structural variables in habitat modeling and hence improving the conservation planning value of these models.

AB  - Understanding habitat selection is important for effective habitat management and recovery of species. However, many habitat selection studies are based on presence and absence data and do not differentiate the intensity of use and its association with fine-scale habitat characteristics. Such information is critical for improving our understanding of habitat suitability to inform conservation planning and practices, particularly for vulnerable species such as the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in China. We integrated Global Positioning Systems (GPS) tracking data of 5 giant pandas in Wolong Nature Reserve, China with detailed vegetation surveys to understand habitat selection by giant pandas. We compared microhabitat characteristics between the core and secondary home range areas of giant pandas and determined their relative importance using a resource selection function (RSF). We found that giant panda core areas had higher elevations, shorter distance to animal paths, shorter trees, and higher density of bamboo than the secondary area. Our findings shed new light on the importance of microhabitat characteristics that are generally overlooked in coarse-scale models in influencing giant panda habitat selection within the home range, such as bamboo density and accessibility to habitat that play important roles in the determination of core areas. We suggest prioritizing dense bamboo forests and areas with animal paths to improve giant pandas' habitat management, restoration, and corridor construction. The methods we used here regarding combining GPS-tracking derived intensity of use data and detailed habitat surveys could also be applied to better understand habitat selection strategies of a variety of other wildlife species.

AB  - Context Habitat connectivity is essential for the long-term persistence of species, but is commonly disregarded in climate change impact studies. The Tibetan Plateau contains a biome rich in endemic ungulates, which are highly sensitive to climatic variations and deserve particular attention in conservation planning against climate change. Objectives We evaluated the response and vulnerability of habitat connectivity to climate change for four ungulate species endemic to the Tibetan Plateau, and examined the robustness of protected areas (PAs) for the conservation of these species under climate change. Methods For each focal species, we developed ecological niche models to predict the spatial variations in habitat under climate change and conducted a network-theoretical analysis to estimate the consequent changes in habitat connectivity. Moreover, we used the circuit theory to characterize dispersal patterns of these species and conducted gap analyses to estimate the contribution of existing PAs to the conservation of these species. Results The four focal species will experience a remarkable connectivity loss that outpaced their habitat loss in response to climate change. Currently, 53.39 and 46.64% of the areas that could contribute to the habitat suitability and connectivity, respectively, of these species are unprotected. These values could further increase under future climate conditions. Conclusions Climate-driven habitat variations may lead to the loss of key connectivity areas between the habitats of ungulates, causing disproportionate decrease in habitat connectivity. The existing PAs on the Tibetan Plateau are not robust for the conservation of the four ungulates. Adjustment of certain key PAs may help to address the conservation gaps.

AB  - We conducted a systematic conservation assessment of the 10.8-million-ha Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), integrating three basic approaches to conservation planning: protecting special elements, representing environmental variation, and securing habitat for focal species (grizzly bear [Ursus arctos], wolf [Canis lupus], and wolverine [Gulo gulo]). Existing protected areas encompass 27% of the GYE but fail to capture many biological hotspots of the region or to represent all natural communities. Using a simulated annealing site-selection algorithm, combined with biological and environmental data based on a geographic information system and static (habitat suitability) and dynamic (population viability) modeling of focal species, we identified unprotected sites within the GYE that are biologically irreplaceable and vulnerable to degradation. Irreplaceability scores were assigned to 43 megasites (aggregations of planning units) on the basis of nine criteria corresponding to quantitative conservation goals. Expert opinion supplemented quantitative data in determining vulnerability scores. If all megasites were protected, the reserved area of the GYE would expand by 43% (to 70%) and increase protection of known occurrences of highly imperiled species by 71% (to 100%) and of all special elements by 62% (to 92%). These new reserves would also significantly increase representation of environmental variation and capture critical areas for focal species. The greatest gains would be achieved by protecting megasites scoring highest in irreplaceability and vulnerability. Protection of 15 high-priority megasites would expand reserved area by 22% and increase the overall achievement of goals by 30%. Protection of highly imperiled species and representation of geoclimatic classes would increase by 46% and 49%, respectively. Although conservation action must be somewhat opportunistic, our method aids decision-making by identifying areas that will contribute the most to explicit conservation goals.

AB  - For over a century the foundation of biological conservation has been the development of open space networks either through outright public land acquisition or appropriate management of private lands. Because both approaches come with significant trade-offs, it is critical to understand which species are found across various land ownership types so that policy tools and management actions can efficiently be targeted to do the most good. In this paper, presence-only biological data were used to create species distribution maps for 18 imperilled forest bird species that breed within the deciduous forests of New Jersey (USA). These maps, combined with publicly available, spatially explicit information on land ownership, document who owns the habitat relied on by each of these 18 species. There were significant variations in both species-and guild-specific reliance on public versus private lands, with the latter preferentially supporting nearly twice as many species as the former. Subcategories of land ownership provided support for the role of both state-owned forests and privately-owned agricultural lands in forest bird conservation; however, each landownership type supports a distinct set of species. While explicitly recognizing the need to employ diverse conservation strategies, the approach provides a solid framework for structuring forest conservation planning and policy at regional scales.

AB  - The invasion of alien species can have serious economic and ecological impacts. Ecologically, invasions often lead to an increased rate of native species replacement and decreased biodiversity. A critical step in the dominance of alien species is their successful co-occurrence with native species. In this study, we assessed the occurrence of alien molluscs and their co-occurrence with native molluscs and identified the determining physical-chemical variables. We expected that a combination of some key variables of water quality could provide suitable conditions promoting alien molluscs to occur and to co-occur with native molluscs. The analyses were based on 20-year data, collected from river systems across Flanders (Belgium). Classification Trees (CTs) were used to perform the analyses and to develop the predictive models. Based on CT models, the co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs could be reliably predicted based on physical-chemical variables. However, there was insufficient data to determine the environmental conditions in which alien taxa dominate. From the past to the present, spatial co-occurrence significantly increased. Sinuosity, ammonium and nitrate concentrations, chemical oxygen demand, pH and conductivity were the key determining variables. Our findings suggest that the co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs mainly occurs in straight rivers with good chemical water quality. These results provide insights into the ecology and behaviour of alien species which could support management practices and priority setting for conservation planning in surface waters of Flanders and Europe.

AB  - Lepidoptera play an important role in terrestrial ecosystems as pollinators, as components of the food chain and as indicators for healthy ecosystems due to their sensitivity to change. Heterogeneous landscapes with variability of topographical features, vegetation structure combined with food sources for all life stages are the basis for successful lepidopteran oviposition. A multiple-scale analysis is proposed to understand the hierarchical relationships between selected site to plant characteristics and oviposition preferences for the dingy skipper (Erynnis tages). To achieve this goal, factors driving oviposition at the plant and patch scale were identified and scale dependencies at the site scale were assessed. At the plant scale, tallest host plants were used for oviposition; however relative egg height upon each plant was similar in both host plant species [bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) and horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa)]. The main factors preferred by E. tages in L. corniculatus patches were sward height and percent of bare ground, and in H. comosa host plant density patches. Selected patches had slopes of greater gradients (mostly facing south) than patches with no selected host plants. At the site scale, oviposition patches were clustered at small scales and oviposition sites were dispersed at larger scales. Our study suggests that oviposition selection in E. tages is a hierarchical process varying from the site to the plant scale. Our study provides empirical evidence useful to inform landscape management strategies. These can be expanded to assess larger scale vegetation and habitat suitability beyond individual sites for systematic conservation planning.

AB  - Ecological niche modeling (and the related species distribution modeling) has been used as a tool with which to assess potential impacts of climate change processes on geographic distributions of species. However, the factors introducing variation into niche modeling outcomes are not well understood: To this end, we used seven algorithms to develop models (Maxent, GARP, BIOCLIM, artificial neural networks, support-vector machines, climate envelope, and environmental distance) to estimate the potential geographic distribution of olives (Olea europaea sensu lato, including Olea ferruginea) under two climatic data sets (current 2000 and future 2050). Five general circulation models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios were used as predictor variables in future projections of the geographic potential of this species; models were fit at global extents (100 spatial resolution) but transferred and interpreted for a region of particular interest in Central Asia, which largely avoids problems with truncation of niche estimates. We found marked differences among approaches in predicted distributions and model performance, as well as in the future distributional pattern reconstructed, from one algorithm to another. These general approaches, when model-to-model variation is managed appropriately, appear promising in predicting the potential geographic distribution of O. europaea sensu lato and thus can be an effective tool in restoration and conservation planning for wild populations, as well as possible commercial plantations of this species.

AB  - Environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation influence tree species distribution, but their relative contributions change with the spatial scale of analysis. We analyzed tree species turnover using twenty 1-ha permanent plots to quantify variation in floristic similarity explained by environmental factors and geographical distance at regional (among plots) and local (within plots) scales in seasonal premontane forests of northwestern Argentina. We related floristic similarity (Bray-Curtis) with environmental variation and geographical distance using specific regression models (regression of distance matrix and mixed-effects models at regional and local scales, respectively). Floristic similarity decreased with distance at both spatial scales but its relative contribution was significant only at the regional scale (18 and < 1 % at regional and local scale, respectively). Dispersal limitation may be a relevant process at biogeographical scale where dispersion at large distances become infrequent for some species. In addition, we identified that regional climatic and topographic gradients and local edaphic variation contribute to explain floristic similarity across scales in seasonal premontane forests. Environmental heterogeneity explained about the same variance in floristic similarity at regional and local scales (7 and 8 %, respectively). We conclude that quantitative aspects of floristic patterns, such as the relative contribution of niche and neutral processes to explain species distribution, can strengthen conservation strategies at different spatial scales, and therefore could be a useful tool in conservation planning.

AB  - Predation on livestock is one of the main factors that cause the felids hunting, in particular for puma and jaguar this conflict with humans is severe. Most studies have assessed the predation impacts on livestock production; however there is a spatial pattern in attacks occurrence that is feasible to analyze from ecological niche modeling. The objective of this research was to generate a risk model of livestock predation by puma and jaguar in Mexico based on environmental and livestock management variables, which allows identification of zones of risk in order to define mitigation strategies at national level. We produced a geographic ensemble model of risk of predation from three algorithms for jaguar and five for puma. The variables most positively related with predation risk by jaguar were vegetative cover percentage, percentage of free grazing animals, and altitude, whereas arid vegetation has a negative influence on predation risk. In the case of puma the variables with highest contribution were livestock density, which negatively influences on the predation risk, in addition to forest and altitude, both with a positive relation. The ensemble models are an accurate approach to delineating the zones of predation risk by felids; however at a regional scale the environmental characteristics that favor predation may be different. It is recommended that researchers carry out studies for each biogeographic province that facilitate the identification of specific patterns and the definition of mitigation strategies most suitable for each one.

AB  - The distribution and abundance of macroalgal communities in a Marine Protected Area (MPA) along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast were mapped and quantified, with particular focus on the previously unstudied P. crispa lower-infralittoral communities on Ostrea edulis biogenic reefs. Data from high resolution geophysical substrate mapping were combined with benthic community observations from georeferenced benthic photographic surveys and sampling. Multivariate analysis identified four distinct assemblages of lower-infralittoral macroalgal communities at depths between 10 and 17 m, dominated by Phyllophora crispa, Apoglossum ruscifoluim, Zanardinia typus and Gelidium spp. Maxent software analysis showed distinct preferences of the identified communities to areas with specific ranges of depth, inclination and curvature, with P. crispa more frequently occurring on vertical oyster biogenic reef structures. By combining production rates from literature, biomass measurements and the produced habitat maps, the highest proportion of primary production and DOC release was shown for the upper infralittoral Cystoseira barbata and Cystoseira bosphorica, followed by the production of the lower-infralittoral macroalgae. The observed distribution of P. crispa within the studied MPA was related to the network of Natura 2000 maritime MPAs along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, which indicated that the connectivity of the populations of the species within the established network is insufficient within this cell of ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Conservation planning and biodiversity monitoring rely exclusively on the use of surrogate groups. However, the effectiveness of these groups in representing unknown biodiversity is rarely tested. These tests can be based on cross-taxon concordance (or congruence) analysis. In a second step, the main mechanisms underlying concordance can be investigated. Here, we evaluated the relative influence of local environmental factors and spatial processes on the patterns of beta-diversity exhibited by phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates and the strength of assemblage concordance among these assemblages in 38 upland Amazonian lakes (northern Brazil) over four years. Zooplankton and benthic invertebrates responded exclusively to environmental variables. These results are in accordance with the expected under the species sorting model, where local factors are the main mechanisms shaping assemblage structure. In general, patterns of concordance between the assemblages were weak and varied through time, indicating that the use of surrogates in freshwater ecosystems may be a flawed approach.

AB  - Paradactylodon persicus gorganensis is a critically endangered salamander found in northeastern Iran which faces increasing major anthropogenic threats such as agriculture, industry and mining. The aim of the current study is to identify key environmental variables associated with the species' presence. Also, measuring and comparing the water quality parameters in habitats where P. p. gorganensis is present and absent are the other aims of the study. The results indicate that high pH and dissolved oxygen values have a negative effect on the species' presence, while its presence was strongly correlated with low mean water temperatures. The species' range in response to the climate change will shift to the south and east, where areas of high elevation occur, because the species favors cold habitats. This study indicates that it will be particularly important to evaluate the whole range where P. p. gorganensis exists when preparing conservation action plans. It is recommended that ex-situ conservation programs are incorporated into conservation planning for the species, because the number of individuals in the wild is so low and their future viability is fragile.

AB  - The genus Bursera is a characteristic component of the tropical dry forest (TDF) of Mexico, however, despite being relevant for the conservation and management of the species, its biology is little known, among them, their phenological patterns and their associations with seasonal factors. The aim of this research was to characterize the phenology of Bursera simaruba Jacq. ex L and Bursera tomentosa (Jacq.) Triana & Planch and to evaluate their relationship with environmental variables. The phenological study was realized in a protected area with tropical dry forest of the Central Depresion from Chiapas. Fifty adult trees of each specie were selected and the intensity of four reproductive phenophases (flower bud, open flower, fruit development and permanence of fruits) and three vegetative ones (leaf bud, mature leaves, senescence) were recorded using the Fournier method. Seasonality and synchrony in each phase were estimated by circular statistics calculating the mean vector (r) and the Rayleight test (Z). Also, the functional types of vegetative phenology were categorized and that of reproductive phenology. All the phenological stages were seasonal (r> 0.5), in both species, the flowering and leaf bud phenophases occurred in a short period while the vegetative and fruit production phenophases are the more extended stages. The reproductive and vegetative phenology of Bursera simaruba and B. tomentosa were very similar, and the most correlated environmental variables with them (r(s) >= 0.6) were temperature and humidity. These results allow to know the phenological dynamic of Bursera species in the TDF, and with this, to promote management and conservation strategies of these important species.

AB  - Knowledge about the effects of fire on tree communities of Araucaria forests (AF) is scarce, although this physiognomy is among the most threatened ones in the entire Brazilian hotspot Atlantic Forest. With this study, we sought to answer the following questions: After three years of the fire, how has the soil of this forest remnant been recovering? Are fires in the AF able to change the structure, composition and species richness of tree community? The survey was carried out in a remnant of AF in an integral protected area in Brazil. Two areas were selected, one that has no fire history in the last 30 years (unburned) and another that burned recently. In each area 25 permanent plots of 20 x 10 m were allocated and all shrub-tree vegetation with DBH >= 4.8 cm was sampled. Our initial expectations were largely refuted, since we found no differences between the two areas in composition and richness of tree species and in most soil environmental variables, but only in the community structure. The majority of the dead individuals were concentrated in the smallest diameter classes (DBH < 9.8 cm). The only soil environmental variables that presented differences were pH and organic matter. Our study shows that the AF presents a significant resistance against forest fires, probably due to the evolutionary history of this physiognomy with fire. Nevertheless, several individuals died, so it is also important to highlight that preventive measures against fires are always relevant for conservation of this endangered physiognomy.

AB  - There is a need to develop methods and a decision support system to establish marine protected areas that harbour coral reefs that are resilient to climate change. This requires understanding patterns of coral's susceptibility to thermal stress and how coral communities will change with the environmental variables associated with climate change. This study combined surface currents, wind velocity; sea surface temperature (SST), UV radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and chlorophyll-a concentration for the western Indian ocean and known relationships with coral bleaching and mortality to derive predictor variables that correlate with thermal stress. SST variability, W maximum temperature and wind speed had the highest influence on susceptibility estimates. Two susceptibility models were developed using Spatial Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) and cosine amplitude-AHP methods and a fuzzy logic technique for integrating environmental variables into a measure of susceptibility. Susceptibility models identified regional gradients in environmental stress, with the north-western Indian Ocean and some central Indian Ocean islands as high and the southern African coastline and islands east of Madagascar as low vulnerability regions. Half of the strictly no take zones in the region are situated in locations with medium to high susceptibility. Future studies using high-resolution data can better estimate the vulnerability of specific locations and the establishment of marine protected areas where coral reef diversity is more likely to persist through climate change.

AB  - The cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is capable of producing toxins including saxitoxin (STX). Few studies have verified the influence of environmental variables on the production of STX and most have only been studied in the laboratory. The goal of this work was to identify the abiotic variables related to STX concentration in situ. The relationship among STX concentration and the physical variables, nutrients and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration was examined in a meso-oligotrophic subtropical coastal lake dominated by C. raciborskii. A generalized linear model was developed, incorporating all variables measured monthly over a 45-month monitoring period. Conductivity and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration provided the greatest explanatory power for SIX concentration in situ. Previous studies suggested that C raciborskii cells exposed to stress associated with higher ionic concentrations appear to activate the biosynthesis of STX suggesting that SIX can elicit changes cell permeability and may contribute to the homeostasis of this organism. An increase of DIN concentration results in a higher concentration of STX which may be related to a reduced metabolic demand, since the uptake of inorganic nitrogen requires less energy than N-2-fixation. Thus, increased DIN can favor the growth of C. raciborskii population or improve cellular homeostasis, both potentially increasing STX concentration in the aquatic system, which was observed through a delayed response pattern. The developed model, while providing only a moderate predictive power, can assist in the understanding of the environmental variables associated with increases in STX concentration, and in monitoring and minimizing the risks of toxic blooms.

AB  - Tertiary-relict Hyrcanian (Caspian) forest along the shores of the southern Caspian Sea is a center of biodiversity. Still, there is little information on plant diversity patterns in this area. This study evaluated plant diversity, variation in life forms, and geographical distribution of the zonal vegetation types and their relationships with environmental variables, in the educational and experimental forest of Kheyrudkenar, an important protected area in the central Hyrcanian forest of northern Iran. For this purpose, 226 vegetation plots of 400 m(2) were laid out along two altitudinal transects from the lowlands (100 m a.s.l.) to the timberline (2000 m a.s.l.). Four vegetation types were identified using modified TWINSPAN, indirect and direct gradient analyses. Species-related (species diversity indices, life form and phytogeographical elements) and environmental variables (climate, topographic and soil variables) were calculated and subjected to one-way ANOVA among the vegetation types. Both constrained (CCA) and unconstrained (DCA) ordination analyses showed an almost identical variation of the floristic composition along their axes and demonstrated that there are two main gradients in the Hyrcanian forest. Elevation together with annual precipitation and mean annual temperature were the most important factors controlling the floristic composition in the area. Topographic features such as slope inclination and heat index were found to be important within an elevation zone/vegetation type. Soil physical and chemical properties were of secondary importance for the separation of the vegetation types. This knowledge will be useful for forest management and conservation practices in the Hyrcanian area with its distinct and unique flora and vegetation.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. Argentinian-protected areas have been established mainly to protect vertebrates and plants in terrestrial ecosystems. In order to create a comprehensive biodiverse conservation plan, it is crucial to integrate both aquatic and terrestrial systems and to include macroinvertebrates. Here, we address this topic by proposing priority areas of conservation including invertebrates, aquatic ecosystems, and their connectivity and land uses. Location: Northwest of Argentina. We modeled the ecological niches of different taxa of macroinvertebrates such as Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Megaloptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Acari, and Mollusca. Based on these models, we analyzed the contribution of currently established protected areas in the conservation of the aquatic biodiversity and we propose a spatial prioritization taking into account possible conflict regarding different land uses. Our analysis units were the real watersheds, to which were added longitudinal connectivity up and down the rivers. A total of 132 species were modeled in the priority area analyses. The analysis 1 showed that only an insignificant percentage of the macroinvertebrates distribution is within the protected areas in the North West of Argentina. The analyses 2 and 3 recovered similar values of protection for the macroinvertebrate species. The upper part of Bermejo, Sali-Dulce, San Francisco, and the Upper part of Juramento basins were identified as priority areas of conservation. The aquatic ecosystems need special protection and 10% or even as much as 17% of land conservation is insufficient for species of macroinvertebrates. In turn the protected areas need to combine the aquatic and terrestrial systems and need to include macroinvertebrates as a key group to sustain the biodiversity. In many cases, the land uses are in conflict with the conservation of biodiversity; however, it is possible to apply the connectivity of the watersheds and create multiple-use modules.

AB  - Safeguarding biodiversity has been one of the most important issues on the environmental and forest policies agenda since the 1990s. The problem remains in terms of decisions and knowledge on where to set appropriate conservation targets. Hence, we need detailed and reliable information about habitat structure and composition and methods for estimating this information over the whole spatial domain. In answer to this target, in France, the Ministry of Ecology launched an ambitious project to map the terrestrial vegetation at a scale of 1:25,000 known as CarHAB. This project initiated in 2011, will be used as a strategic spatial planning tool in answer to key issues in relation to biodiversity, conservation, green infrastructures and to report on the conservation status of habitats and species of community interest.
   We use species-distribution models (SDMs) to identify areas that are ecologically suitable for the presence of species based on specific habitat characteristics. Available techniques using graph theory enable identification of groups of species (assemblages) based on ecological affinities. Species co-occurrences (present within the same assessment plot), revealing a shared ecological niche, are analysed using algorithms-derived from graph theory in order to define different nodes of species affinities. Thus, the resulting assemblages are based on ecological similarities. Hence, these assemblages are used to develop models of the potential distribution of alpine vegetation communities. The BIOMOD platform is used to facilitate the simultaneous implementation of different modelling approaches that can be compared in order to choose the most suitable and accurate for each species assemblage obtained from graph theory. Using the different relevant spatially explicit results provides a more comprehensive vision of the communities' spatial distributions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sites where edaphic endemic plants have evolved exist in isolated, often small patches throughout the Great Basin. Gypsophytes, plants that live on gypsum soil outcrops, are one group of edaphic endemic plants about which information on localities and habitat requirements is needed. An opportunity to provide some protection to gypsophyte species in White River Valley, Nevada, arose with the revision of Ely BLM's Resource Management Plan. Field surveys to gather locality data were performed in 2005 and 2007, and 1840 new localities were identified. Species distribution modeling can be a useful tool for delineating areas for special management to benefit species of concern. Species distribution model inputs included gypsophyte localities, elevation, slope, aspect, and remotely sensed data on probability of gypsum springmound occurrence. Model outputs were refined using field surveys, and four sites with gypsum springmounds with BLM sensitive-status gypsophytes for Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) status were proposed. These four sites have since been designated, and provide some degree of protection to gypsophytes, though the scattered, isolated nature of gypsum springmounds and other edaphic endemic plant habitats highlights the importance of the use of rare plant locality point data, as well as remotely sensed data and field surveys by land management agency staff in carrying out National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning for projects that have the potential to harm rare plant populations.
   "On the alkaline flats by the lower waters of the White River, where the deep, somewhat sandy, alluvial soil is overlaid with a dazzling rime of mineral salts, [F. gypsicola] occurs in abundance over a small area, and the heavy, depressed tufts of pale, grass-like foliage, which erupt towards midsummer into innumerable slender panicles of blossom, form a striking feature of the sparse but highly interesting saline flora."

AB  - Accurate information on the distribution of existing species is crucial to assess regional biodiversity. However, data inventories are insufficient in many areas. We examine the ability of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) multi-response species distribution model to overcome species' data limitations and portray plant species distribution patterns for 199 South Korean plant species. The study models species with two or more observations, examines their contribution to national patterns of species richness, provides a sensitivity analysis of different range threshold cutoff approaches for modeling species' ranges, and presents considerations for species modeling at fine spatial resolution. We ran MARS models for each species and tested four threshold methods to transform occurrence probabilities into presence or absence range maps. Modeled occurrence probabilities were extracted at each species' presence points, and the mean, median, and one standard deviation (SD) calculated to define data-driven thresholds. A maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity threshold was also calculated, and the range maps from the four cutoffs were tested using independent plant survey data. The single SD values were the best threshold tested for minimizing omission errors and limiting species ranges to areas where the associated occurrence data were correctly classed. Eight individual species range maps for rare plant species were identified that are potentially affected by resampling predictor variables to fine spatial scales. We portray spatial patterns of high species richness by assessing the combined range maps from three classes of species: all species, endangered and endemic species, and range-size rarity of all species, which could be used in conservation planning for South Korea. The MARS model is promising for addressing the common problem of few species occurrence records. However, projected species ranges are highly dependent on the threshold and scale criteria, which should be assessed on a per-project basis.

AB  - In Canadian boreal forests, bryophytes represent an essential component of biodiversity and play a significant role in ecosystem functioning. Despite their ecological importance and sensitivity to disturbances, bryophytes are overlooked in conservation strategies due to knowledge gaps on their distribution, which is known as the Wallacean shortfall. Rare species deserve priority attention in conservation as they are at a high risk of extinction. This study aims to elaborate predictive models of rare bryophyte species in Canadian boreal forests using remote sensing-derived predictors in an Ensemble of Small Models (ESMs) framework. We hypothesize that high ESMs-based prediction accuracy can be achieved for rare bryophyte species despite their low number of occurrences. We also assess if there is a spatial correspondence between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns. The study area is located in western Quebec and covers 72,292 km(2). We selected 52 bryophyte species with <30 occurrences from a presence-only database (214 species, 389 plots in total). ESMs were built from Random Forest and Maxent techniques using remote sensing-derived predictors related to topography and vegetation. Lee's L statistic was used to assess and map the spatial relationship between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns. ESMs yielded poor to excellent prediction accuracy (AUC > 0.5) for 73% of the modeled species, with AUC values > 0.8 for 19 species, which confirmed our hypothesis. In fact, ESMs provided better predictions for the rarest bryophytes. Likewise, our study revealed a spatial concordance between rare and overall bryophyte richness patterns in different regions of the study area, which have important implications for conservation planning. This study demon-strates the potential of remote sensing for assessing and making predictions on inconspicuous and rare species across the landscape and lays the basis for the eventual inclusion of bryophytes into sustainable development planning.

AB  - Mountain regions are centers of biodiversity endemism at a global scale but the role of arid-zone mountain ranges in shaping biodiversity patterns is poorly understood. Focusing on three guilds of taxa from a desert upland refugium in Australia, we sought to determine: (a) the relative extent to which climate, terrain or geological substrate predict endemism, and (b) whether patterns of endemism are complimentary across broad taxonomic guilds. We mapped regional endemism for plants, land snails, and vertebrates using combined Species Distribution Models (SDMs) for all endemic taxa (n = 82). We then modelled predictors of endemism using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) and geology, terrain, and climate variables. We tested for the presence of inter- and intraguild hotspots of endemism. Many individual plant and land snail taxa were tightly linked with geology, corresponding to small distributions. Conversely, most vertebrate taxa were not constrained to specific geological substrates and occurred over larger areas. However, across all three guilds climate was the strongest predictor of regional endemism, particularly for plants wherein discrete hotspots of endemism were buffered from extreme summer temperatures. Land snail and vertebrate endemism peaked in areas with highest precipitation in the driest times of the year. Hotspots of endemism within each guild poorly predicted endemism in other guilds. We found an overarching signal that climatic gradients play a dominant role in the persistence of endemic taxa in an arid-zone mountain range system. An association with higher rainfall and cooler temperatures indicates that continuing trends toward hotter and drier climates may lead to range contractions in this, and potentially other, arid-zone mountain biotas. Contrasting patterns of endemism across guilds highlight the need to couple comprehensive regional planning for the protection of climate refugia, with targeted management of more localized and habitat specialist taxa.

AB  - Climate refugia, or places where habitats are expected to remain relatively buffered from regional climate extremes, provide an important focus for science and conservation planning. Within high-priority, multi-jurisdictional landscapes like the Madrean sky islands of the United States and Mexico, efforts to identify and manage climate refugia are hindered by the lack of high-quality and consistent transboundary datasets. To fill these data gaps, we assembled a bi-national field dataset (n = 1416) for five pine species (Pinus spp.) and used generalized boosted regression to model pine habitats in relation to topographic variability as a basis for identifying potential microrefugia at local scales in the context of current species' distribution patterns. We developed additional models to quantify climatic refugial attributes using coarse scale bioclimatic variables and finer scale seasonal remote sensing indices. Terrain metrics including ruggedness, slope position, and aspect defined microrefugia for pines within elevation ranges preferred by each species. Response to bioclimatic variables indicated that small shifts in climate were important to some species (e.g., P. chihuahuana, P. strobiformis), but others exhibited a broader tolerance (e.g., P. arizonica). Response to seasonal climate was particularly important in modeling microrefugia for species with open canopy structure and where regular fires occur (e.g., P. engelmannii and P. chihuahuana). Hotspots of microrefugia differed among species and were either limited to northern islands or occurred across central or southern latitudes. Mapping and validation of refugia and their ecological functions are necessary steps in developing regional conservation strategies that cross jurisdictional boundaries. A salient application will be incorporation of climate refugia in management of fire to restore and maintain pine ecology. Una version en espanol de este articulo esta disponible como descarga.

AB  - Cities are human ecosystems. Understanding human ecology is important for designing and planning the built environment. The ability to respond to changes and adapt actions in a positive way helps determine the health of cities. Recently, many studies have highlighted the great potential of photographic data shared on the Flickr platform for the analysis of environmental perceptions in landscape and urban planning. Other research works used panoramic images from the Google Street View (GSV) web service to extract urban quality data. Although other researches have used social media to characterize human habitat from an emotional point of view, there is still a lack of knowledge of the correlation between environmental and physical variables of the city and visual perception, especially at a scale suitable for urban planning and design. In ecology, the environmental suitability of a territory for a given biological community is studied through species distribution models (SDM). In this work we have adopted the state of the art of SDM (the ensemble approach) to develop a methodology transferable to cities with different sizes and characteristics that uses data deriving from many sources available on a global scale: social media platform, Google internet services, shared geographical information, remote sensing and geomorphological data. The result of our application in the city of Livorno offers important information on the most significant variables for the conservation, planning and design of urban public spaces at the project scale. However, further research developments will be needed to test the model in cities of different sizes and geographic locations, integrate the model with other social media, other databases and with traditional surveys and improve the quality of indicators that can be derived from information shared on the Internet.

AB  - Understanding seabird habitat preferences is critical to future wildlife conservation and threat mitigation in California. The objective of this study was to investigate drivers of seabird habitat selection within the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries to identify areas for targeted conservation planning. We used seabird abundance data collected by the Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies Program (ACCESS) from 2004-2011. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to model species abundance and distribution as a function of near surface ocean water properties, distances to geographic features and oceanographic climate indices to identify patterns in foraging habitat selection. We evaluated seasonal, inter-annual and species-specific variability of at-sea distributions for the five most abundant seabirds nesting on the Farallon Islands: western gull (Larus occidentalis), common murre (Uria aalge), Cassin's auklet (Ptychorampus aleuticus), rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) and Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus). The waters in the vicinity of Cordell Bank and the continental shelf east of the Farallon Islands emerged as persistent and highly selected foraging areas across all species. Further, we conducted a spatial prioritization exercise to optimize seabird conservation areas with and without considering impacts of current human activities. We explored three conservation scenarios where 10, 30 and 50 percent of highly selected, species-specific foraging areas would be conserved. We compared and contrasted results in relation to existing marine protected areas (MPAs) and the future alternative energy footprint identified by the California Ocean Uses Atlas. Our results show that the majority of highly selected seabird habitat lies outside of state MPAs where threats from shipping, oil spills, and offshore energy development remain. This analysis accentuates the need for innovative marine spatial planning efforts and provides a foundation on which to build more comprehensive zoning and management in California's National Marine Sanctuaries.

AB  - Aim To analyze impacts of habitat loss on evolutionary diversity and to test widely used biodiversity metrics as surrogates for phylogenetic diversity, we study spatial and taxonomic patterns of phylogenetic diversity in a wide-ranging endemic Neotropical snake lineage.
   Location South America and the Antilles.
   Methods We updated distribution maps for 41 taxa, using species distribution models and a revised presence-records database. We estimated evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) for each taxon using recent molecular and morphological phylogenies and weighted these values with two measures of extinction risk: percentages of habitat loss and IUCN threat status. We mapped phylogenetic diversity and richness levels and compared phylogenetic distances in pitviper subsets selected via endemism, richness, threat, habitat loss, biome type and the presence in biodiversity hotspots to values obtained in randomized assemblages.
   Results Evolutionary distinctiveness differed according to the phylogeny used, and conservation assessment ranks varied according to the chosen proxy of extinction risk. Two of the three main areas of high phylogenetic diversity were coincident with areas of high species richness. A third area was identified only by one phylogeny and was not a richness hotspot. Faunal assemblages identified by level of endemism, habitat loss, biome type or the presence in biodiversity hotspots captured phylogenetic diversity levels no better than random assemblages. Pitvipers found in the richest areas or included in the IUCN Red List showed significant phylogenetic clustering.
   Main conclusions Usual biodiversity metrics were unable to adequately represent spatial patterns of evolutionary diversity in pitvipers. Current Red List status fails to properly represent evolutionary distinctiveness in the group. Phylogenetic diversity is unevenly distributed even within biodiversity hotspots, and species-poor areas may harbour high phylogenetic diversity. This reinforces the need for targeted and spatially accurate approaches for adequately representing evolutionary processes in conservation planning.

AB  - The introduction of alien species is one of the main threat to native biodiversity worldwide. The spreading of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus and Paysandisia archon across the Mediterranean basin caused enormous damages to cultivated palms, representing a paradigmatic case of uncontrolled diffusion of invasive alien pests. The infestation of natural populations of Chamaerops humilis, which has a particular conservation relevance being the only native palm species in Western Europe, by the two pests can be a serious threat. Nevertheless, no clear evaluation of this risk is available. I provided a first estimation of the potential geographic extent of this threat, comparing the specific climatic niches of the three species and identifying high-conflict areas and potential refuges for C. humilis through a spatial explicit approach based on niche modeling. I evidenced that the climatic niche of the palm is similar to those of the two pests. This produces frequent co-occurrence of host and pests causing potential high levels of pressure on palm populations. More specifically, R. ferrugineus represents a very widespread threat to palms, with conflict areas in most of the coasts and islands included in the C. humilis distribution. On the contrary, P. archon represents a threat only in the northeastern part of the palm range, and large potential refuges occur in southwestern Iberia, North Africa, and several islands. However, the threat by P. archon can be locally stronger than by R. ferrugineus. Programs of assessment, monitoring, and containment in host-pest conflict areas and measures of protection, prevention, and monitoring in refuge areas could mitigate the threat to C. humilis, avoiding the impact that the same pests have on cultivated palms across Europe.

AB  - Changes in climate projected for the 21st century are expected to trigger widespread and pervasive biotic impacts. Forecasting these changes and their implications for ecosystem services is a major research goal. Much of the research on biotic responses to climate change has focused on either projected shifts in individual species distributions or changes in biome distributions. Here, we introduce a novel application of multinomial logistic regression as a powerful approach to model vegetation distributions and potential responses to 21st century climate change. We modeled the distribution of 22 major vegetation types, most defined by a single dominant woody species, across the San Francisco Bay Area. Predictor variables included climate and topographic variables. The novel aspect of our model is the output: a vector of relative probabilities for each vegetation type in each location within the study domain. The model was then projected for 54 future climate scenarios, spanning a representative range of temperature and precipitation projections from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles. We found that sensitivity of vegetation to climate change is highly heterogeneous across the region. Surprisingly, sensitivity to climate change is higher closer to the coast, on lower insolation, north-facing slopes and in areas of higher precipitation. While such sites may provide refugia for mesic and cool-adapted vegetation in the face of a warming climate, the model suggests they will still be highly dynamic and relatively sensitive to climate-driven vegetation transitions. The greater sensitivity of moist and low insolation sites is an unexpected outcome that challenges views on the location and stability of climate refugia. Projections provide a foundation for conservation planning and land management, and highlight the need for a greater understanding of the mechanisms and time scales of potential climate-driven vegetation transitions.

AB  - Sicily hosts the largest European population of the endangered lanner falcon, a poorly known species which needs conservation planning based on habitat preferences. A distribution model on 10 x 10 km cells of Sicily was described using Generalized Linear Models and variation partitioning methods. This modelling approach extracted explanatory factors, pure and joint effects of greatest influence from subsets of variables controlled for multi-collinearity and spatial autocorrelation. Analytical cartography used the environmental favourability function to assess habitat preferences, and the insecurity index estimated the degree to which lanner falcon occupancy is represented in the Natura2000 networks of Sicily. The lanner population is not randomly distributed across the geographical space as the significant latitudinal effect revealed. The most parsimonious explanatory model suggested traditional agro-ecosystems (i.e. arable lowlands and grasslands, with rugged terrains and cliffs) as the best predictors of lanner occupancy, and gave strong support to the negative effects of land abandonment and intensification (i.e. increase of heterogeneous areas and shrubby vegetation). The variation partitioning method suggested how an alteration of traditional agro-ecosystems might enhance interference competition with the peregrine falcon and limit lanner falcon occupancy. Most of the lanner falcon favourable habitats fall outside the Natura2000 networks, thus the main challenge for its conservation is represented by agri-environmental measures to be taken within the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. Conservation of traditional agro-ecosystems devoted to top-predators, like the lanner falcon, requires single environmental management agreements for multiple farm units, deployed at landscape scale on a network of favourable areas.

AB  - Aim Species distribution maps are essential for assessing extinction risk and guiding conservation efforts. However, most come sourced as expert-drawn range maps with known issues of accuracy or are developed with overly complex modelling procedures. Thus, data-driven alternatives that are accessible and reliable are a welcome addition to the spatial conservation toolkit. Here, we developed a geospatial workflow to refine the distribution of a species from its extent of occurrence (EOO) to area of habitat (AOH) within the species range map. The range maps are produced with an inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation procedure using presence and absence points derived from primary biodiversity data. Location The Americas (North, South, Central America and the Caribbean). Methods As a case study, we mapped the distribution of 723 resident forest birds in the Americas and assessed their performance in comparison with expert-drawn range maps. We evaluated differences in accuracy, spatial overlap, range map size and derived AOH. Results The geospatial workflow generated IDW range maps with a higher overall accuracy (87% versus 62%) and fewer errors of omission (<1%) and commission (14%) than the expert range maps (28% both errors). The spatial overlap between both datasets was low (35%), but the agreement increased in areas of high probability of occurrence (68%). We did not find significant differences in range size, but the AOH derived from the expert-drawn range maps was consistently smaller than the estimates from the IDW range maps. Main Conclusions Our geospatial workflow provides a straightforward approach to accurately map species ranges and the estimation of area of habitat (AOH) for conservation planning and decision-making. Conversely, procedures that refine expert-drawn range maps to obtain AOH risk producing biased estimates for local-scale applications.

AB  - Conservation-planning approaches must be supported by a good understanding of the geographical distribution of species. Despite the efforts conducted so far to compile data on aquatic insects, the information on the distribution of water beetles in Morocco is scarce. In this study, we assess for the first time the degree of inventory quality of aquatic insects in Africa. Using an exhaustive database of Moroccan water beetles, likely the most complete database for any group of aquatic insects in Africa (with 11,229 records for 305 species), we specifically aim to explore the patterns of species richness, sampling effort and inventory completeness at four different spatial resolutions, identifying those spatial units that can be considered as sufficiently surveyed, and locating areas in need of further sampling effort. Our results showed a lack of complete and extensive inventory data; as less than 12% of Moroccan cells at the coarsest resolution assessed (45 ') can be considered as well surveyed (slope < 0.1 and survey completeness > 70%), while at the finest resolution (7 '), only 1% of Moroccan cells could be identified as being well prospected. Finally, we highlight the importance of these procedures to improve monitoring planning of aquatic fauna and to improve their effective conservation and management. Implications for insect conservation Considerable information is still required to provide an accurate picture of the richness patterns of aquatic insects in North-Western Africa. Thus, results on the pattern of species richness must be used cautiously, as they could be just mirroring the pattern of sampling effort carried out. We recommend the use of modelling procedures as a shortcut to improve our knowledge on the biodiversity patterns of aquatic insects in North-Western Africa and to establish efficient conservation strategies for their protection.

AB  - The global redistribution of biodiversity will intensify in the coming decades of climate change, making projections of species range shifts and of associated genetic losses important components of conservation planning. Highly-structured marine species, notably brown seaweeds, often harbor unique genetic variation at warmer low-latitude rear edges and thus are of particular concern. Here, a combination of Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) and molecular data is used to forecast the potential near-future impacts of climate change for a warm-temperate, canopy forming seaweed, Bifurcaria bifurcata. ENMs for B. bifurcata were developed using marine and terrestrial climatic variables, and its range projected for 2040-50 and 2090-2100 under two greenhouse emission scenarios. Geographical patterns of genetic diversity were assessed by screening 18 populations spawning the entire distribution for two organelle genes and 6 microsatellite markers. The southern limit of B. bifurcata was predicted to shift northwards to central Morocco by the mid-century. By 2090-2100, depending on the emission scenario, it could either retreat further north to western Iberia or be relocated back to Western Sahara. At the opposing margin, B. bifurcata was predicted to expand its range to Scotland or even Norway. Microsatellite diversity and endemism were highest in Morocco, where a unique and very restricted lineage was also identified. Our results imply that B. bifurcata will maintain a relatively broad latitudinal distribution. Although its persistence is not threatened, the predicted extirpation of a unique southern lineage or even the entire Moroccan diversity hotspot will erase a rich evolutionary legacy and shrink global diversity to current (low) European levels. NW Africa and similarly understudied southern regions should receive added attention if expected range changes and diversity loss of warm-temperate species is not to occur unnoticed.

AB  - Due to their secretive habits, predicting the pattern of spatial distribution of small carnivores has been typically challenging, yet for conservation management it is essential to understand the association between this group of animals and environmental factors. We applied maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt) to build distribution models and identify environmental predictors including bioclimatic variables, forest and land cover type, topography, vegetation index and anthropogenic variables for six small carnivore species in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. Species occurrence records were collated from camera-traps and vehicle transects during the years 2010 and 2011. We used the average training gain from forty model runs for each species to select the best set of predictors. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic plot (ROC) ranged from 0.81 to 0.93 for the training data and 0.72 to 0.87 for the test data. In habitat models for F. chaus, P. hermaphroditus, and H. smithii "distance to village'' and precipitation of the warmest quarter emerged as some of the most important variables. "Distance to village'' and aspect were important for V. indica while "distance to village'' and precipitation of the coldest quarter were significant for H. vitticollis. "Distance to village'', precipitation of the warmest quarter and land cover were influential variables in the distribution of H. edwardsii. The map of predicted probabilities of occurrence showed potentially suitable habitats accounting for 46 km(2) of the reserve for F. chaus, 62 km(2) for V. indica, 30 km(2) for P. hermaphroditus, 63 km(2) for H. vitticollis, 45 km(2) for H. smithii and 28 km(2) for H. edwardsii. Habitat heterogeneity driven by the east-west climatic gradient was correlated with the spatial distribution of small carnivores. This study exemplifies the usefulness of modeling small carnivore distribution to prioritize and direct conservation planning for habitat specialists in southern India.

AB  - Reefs and subtidal rocky habitats are sites of high biodiversity and productivity which harbour commercially important species of fish and invertebrates. Although the conservation management of reef associated species has been informed using species distribution models (SDM) and community based approaches, to date their use has been constrained to specific regions where the locality and spatial extent of reefs is well known. Much of the world's subtidal habitats remain either undiscovered or unmapped, including coasts of intense human use. Consequently, to facilitate a stronger understanding of species-environmental relationships there is an urgent need for a cost and time effective standard method to map reefs at fine spatial resolutions across broad geographical extents. We used bathymetric data (similar to 250 m resolution) to calculate the local slope and curvature of the seabed. We then constructed artificial neural networks (ANNs) to forecast the probability of reef occurrence within grid cells as a function of bathymetric and slope variables. Testing over an independent data set not used in training showed that ANNs were able to accurately predict the location of reefs for 86% of all grid cells (Kappa = 0.63) without over fitting. The ANN with greatest support, combining bathymetric values of the target grid cell with the slope of adjacent grid cells, was used to map inshore reef locations around the Southern Australian coastline (similar to 250 m resolution). Broadly, our results show that reefs are identifiable from coarse-scale bathymetry data of the seabed. We anticipate that our research technique will strengthen systematic conservation planning tools in many regions of the world, by enabling the identification of rocky substratum and mapping in localities that remain poorly surveyed due to logistics or monetary constraints.

AB  - We conducted a GIS spatial analysis with the aim of providing the first quantitative large-scale overview of the distribution patterns of 1536 type localities (loci classici) of 1216 Italian endemic vascular plants and their relationship with a set of descriptive variables. Whereas some variables were used to model the presence-absence distribution patterns of the type localities for the whole set of endemics as well as for the subset of narrow endemics, others (e.g., presence inside or outside protected areas and Italian Important Plant Areas) were considered with the purpose of assessing potential assets or risks for conservation.
   The largest number of type localities was found within the Mediterranean biogeographic region (1134), followed by the Alpine region (306) and Continental region (96). A total of 670 locations are located on islands, whereas 866 are located on the Italian mainland (139 and 124 in the case of narrow endemics, respectively). A large number of type localities are located in mountainous areas and along the coastline, which can be seen as a potential risk for conservation. On the contrary, we detected a positive correlation with the distance from roads, which might be considered to be an asset. Importantly, 1030 type localities fall inside protected areas, whereas 506 localities fall outside protected areas, with 259 of these unprotected localities on islands.
   We propose considering the results of the analysis of the distribution of type localities of Italian endemics to be a strategic tool for conservation planning and resource management. Application of plant micro-reserves and integration of diverse legislation tools are suggested to strengthen efforts and increase conservation success.

AB  - Foraging behaviour of marine top predators is increasingly being used to identify areas of ecological importance. This is largely enabled by the ability of many such species to forage extensively in search of prey that is often concentrated in oceanographically productive areas. To identify important habitat in the Southern Indian Ocean within and around South Africa's Prince Edward Islands' Marine Protected Area (MPA), satellite transmitters were deployed on 12 lactating Subantarctic fur seals Arctocephalus tropicalis at Prince Edward Island (PEI) itself. Switching state space models were employed to correct ARGOS tracks and estimate behavioural states for locations along predicted tracks, namely travelling or area restricted search (ARS). A random forest model showed that distance from the study colony, longitude and distance from the Subantarctic Front were the most important predictors of suitable foraging habitat (inferred from ARS). Model-predicted suitable habitat occurred within the MPA in relatively close access to the colony during summer and autumn, but shifted northwards concurrently with frontal movements in winter and spring. The association of ARS with the MPA during summer-autumn was highly significant, highlighting the effectiveness of the recently declared reserve's design for capturing suitable foraging habitat for this and probably other marine top predator species.

AB  - The extreme variability in the topography, altitude and climatic conditions in the temperate Grassland Mountains of Southern Africa is associated with the complex mosaic of grassland communities with pockets of woodland patches. Understanding the relationships between plant communities and environmental parameters is essential in biodiversity conservation, especially for current and future climate change predictions. This article focused on the spatial distribution of woodland communities and their associated environmental drivers in the Golden Gate Highlands (GGHNP) National Park in South Africa. A generalized linear model (GLM) assuming a binomial distribution, was used to determine the optimal environmental variables influencing the spatial distribution of the woodland communities. The Coefficient of Variation (CV) was relatively higher for the topographic ruggedness index (68.78%), topographic roughness index (68.03), aspect (60.04%), coarse fragments (37.46%) and the topographic wetness index (31.33) whereas soil pH, bulk density, sandy and clay contents had relatively less variation (2.39%, 3.23%, 7.56% and 8.46% respectively). In determining the optimal number of environmental variables influencing the spatial distribution of woodland communities, roughness index, topographic wetness index, soil coarse fragments, soil organic carbon, soil cation exchange capacity and remote-sensing based vegetation condition index were significant (p < 0.05) and positively correlated with the woodland communities. Soil nitrogen, clay content, soil pH, fire and elevation were also significant but negatively correlated with the woodland communities. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was 0.81. This was indicative of a Parsimonious Model with explanatory predictive power for determination of optimal environmental variables in vegetation ecology.
   Conservation implications: The isolated woodland communities are sources of floristic diversity and important biogeographical links between larger forest areas in the wider Drakensberg region. They provide suitable habitats for a larger number of forest species and harbour some of the endemic tree species of South Africa. They also provide watershed protection and other important ecosystem services. Understanding the drivers influencing the spatial distribution and persistence of these woodland communities is therefore key to conservation planning in the area.

AB  - The Monti Sibillini National Park is a recently borne protected area in the central Apennines that has become an important tourist destination. Mountain grasslands and woods have made it also a suitable habitat for sheep and bovine cattle, as well as for wild animals such as the wild bore and the roe deer. Therefore, a preliminary investigation was conducted to assess the risk of transmission of tick-borne zoonoses, such as Lyme disease and Babesiosis, by actively looking for both the arthropod vector and the causative agent. For two consecutive years, ambushing ticks were collected in four distinct geographical areas, comprehensive of many highly frequented tourist places. The tick fauna, tick habitats and the seasonal distribution of the different tick life stages collected with the method of "flagging and dragging" have been reported. Almost all the collected specimens belonged to the species Haemaphysalis punctata (Canestrini and Fanzago) (Acari: Ixodidae), which was found moderately infected with Babesia spp. Only a few Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus) ticks, the most competent vector of Lyme disease, were found and on PCR examination all of them resulted negative as far as the infectious agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Johnson) is concerned.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems appear to be sensitive to even minor climatic shifts, and the dendritic nature of rivers as well as patchy distribution of habitats within the terrestrial landscape could limit the ability of species to track suitable climate conditions. Although the importance of dispersal is recognised in theory, there is great uncertainty when quantifying the capacity of species to shift their distributions in response to climate change. The influence of dispersal capacity on species' vulnerability to climate change was assessed, using the modelled projections of 527 freshwater species in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Species' future ranges were calculated by iteratively identifying colonisation of accessible habitats and loss of suitable habitats within network models. The accessibility of new habitats was based on a given dispersal mode (aquatic, semi-terrestrial and aerial). The relative impact of dispersal parameters on projected range were evaluated alongside other known sources of uncertainty (climate and emissions scenarios, modelling algorithm and biological group), analysed collectively in a generalised additive mixed-model, and spatially to locate regions of NSW where projections are associated with the most uncertainty. Our simulations (1.4million scenario combinations) suggest at least a third of species will lose more than half their range under climate change. Nevertheless, we emphasise the broad uncertainty that any average encapsulates. Dispersal capacity only had a minor impact on projected range shifts relative to other modelling assumptions but the network-pathways and maps of uncertainty have value for conservation planning at large scales. Projected range losses initially decreased rapidly as dispersal rates increased but the benefits are reduced above 2-3kmyear(-1). Taxa restricted to dispersal within the stream network (aquatic) were more vulnerable to climate change than taxa with semi-terrestrial or aerial dispersal and maps of variation due to dispersal mode and rate indicate where habitat connectivity would be most beneficial. This study demonstrates the breadth of uncertainties that challenge plans for improving ecosystem adaptation under climate change and highlights where in the landscape those differences were consistent. We emphasise the need for freshwater conservation studies to be ecologically representative, to focus on broad-scale connectivity for taxa that can move between catchments, and an accessible network of refugia for taxa with more limited dispersal.

AB  - The application of the Dennis et al. (Ecol. Monogr., 61, 1991) model to data from 12 herbivore populations from the Kruger National Park, South Africa, introduces 'risk assessment' procedures into the conservation management of free-ranging species. The model enables one to predict the probability of reaching an arbitrarily defined threshold population size using census figures from censused and unmanaged populations. It also provides an objective evaluation of population persistence based on past performance. Of the 12 species investigated, five (impala Aepyceros melampus, blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, zebra Equus burchelli, white rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum, giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis) appear to be secure, four (kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros, waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus, warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus, sable antelope Hippotragus niger) are vulnerable and three species (tsessebe Damaliscus lunatus, eland Taurotragus oryx, roan antelope Hippotragus equinus) are at risk of declining by an order of magnitude within 100 years. Therefore, within data limitations, the KNP appears not to offer sufficient suitable habitat for a number of herbivore species despite its considerable size, and a metapopulation approach may be required for the effective conservation of some species. The model also allows the principle of 'complementarity' to be extended beyond that of species composition. Objective evaluations of population persistence, of censused and unmanaged populations, as demonstrated here, mean that the principle of 'population viability' can help the design of efficient regional reserve networks.

AB  - Effective biodiversity conservation planning starts with genetic characterization within and among focal populations, in order to understand the likely impact of threats for ensuring the long-term viability of a species. The Wonder Gecko, Teratoscincus keyserlingii, is one of nine members of the genus. This species is distributed in Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with a small isolated population in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where it is classified nationally as Critically Endangered. Within its Arabian range, anthropogenic activity is directly linked to the species' decline, with highly localised and severely fragmented populations. Here we describe the evolutionary history of Teratoscincus, by reconstructing its phylogenetic relationships and estimating its divergence times and ancestral biogeography. For conservation implications of T. keyserlingii we evaluate the genetic structure of the Arabian population using genomic data. This study supports the monophyly of most species and reveals considerable intraspecific variability in T. microlepis and T. keyserlingii, which necessitate broad systematic revisions. The UAE population of T. keyserlingii likely arrived from southern Iran during the Pleistocene and no internal structure was recovered within, implying a single population status. Regional conservation of T. keyserlingii requires improved land management and natural habitat restoration in the species' present distribution, and expansion of current protected areas, or establishment of new areas with suitable habitat for the species, mostly in northern Abu Dhabi Emirate.

AB  - Rapids and waterfalls, and their associated fauna and flora are in peril. With the construction of each new hydroelectric dam, more rapids and waterfalls are destroyed, leading to the disappearance of associated fauna and flora. Areas of rapids harbor distinct, highly endemic rheophilic fauna and flora adapted to an extreme environment. Rheophilic habitats also have disjunct distribution both within and across rivers. Rheophilic habitats thus represent islands of suitable habitat separated by stretches of unsuitable habitat. In this study, we investigated to what extent, if any, species of cichlid and anostomid fishes associated with rheophilic habitats were structured among the rapids of Araguaia River in the Brazilian Amazon. We tested both for population structuring as well as non-random distribution of lineages among rapids. Eight of the nine species had multiple lineages, five of these nine species were structured, and three of the eight species with multiple lineages showed non-random distribution of lineages among rapids. These results demonstrate that in addition to high levels of endemicism of rheophilic fishes, different rapids even within the same river are occupied by different lineages. Rheophilic species and communities occupying different rapids are, therefore, not interchangeable, and this realization must be taken into account when proposing mitigatory/compensatory measures in hydroelectric projects, and in conservation planning.

AB  - Potential fishery benefits of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are widely acknowledged, yet seldom demonstrated, as fishery data series that straddle MPA establishment are seldom available. Here we postulate, based on a 15-year time series of nation-wide, spatially referenced catch and effort data, that the establishment of the Goukamma MPA (18 km alongshore; 40 km(2)) benefited the adjacent fishery for roman (Chrysoblephus laticeps), a South African endemic seabream. Roman-directed catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the vicinity of the new MPA immediately increased, contradicting trends across this species' distribution. The increase continued after 5 years, the time lag expected for larval export, effectively doubling the pre-MPA CPUE after 10 years. We find no indication that establishing the MPA caused a systematic drop in total catch or increased travel distances for the fleet. Our results provide rare empirical evidence of rapidly increasing catch rates after MPA implementation without measurable disadvantages for fishers.

AB  - The present study analyzes the richness, floristic composition and ecological aspects of bryophytes of the park. The bryophytes were collected following the usual techniques for this group, with sampling carried out in two plot of a hectare each. Richness, sampling sufficiency, floristic composition, frequency, tolerance guilds and geographic distribution were analyzed. One thousand and fifty seven bryophyte occurrences were recorded (mosses 486 and 571 hepatics) for the park, totaling 103 species, distributed in 44 genera and 18 families. The liverworts had a higher species richness (59) in relation to mosses (44) and the most representative family was Lejeuneaceae (42). In terms of abundance, rare species were the highest with 62 (61%) and in relation to the guilds of tolerance, the generalist species stood out with 47 (46%). The species distribution is predominantly Neotropical (57%) and five species are new records for the state of Para.

AB  - Background
   The forest of Son Tra Peninsula was designated as a nature reserve in 1977 and serves as a green lung for Da Nang City. Due to the economic development scheme of Da Nang City, the forest of the peninsula has been disturbed by human activities and by invasive plant species. Moreover, the management board of the nature reserve lacked sufficient data of the species distribution of its biodiversity for developing future management and conservation plans. To provide and enhance knowledge for the distribution of wildlife species in Son Tra Peninsula, we conducted field surveys over two years to collect data on species richness and distribution and then build a biodiversity database for the protected area.
   New information
   The project collected the occurrence data of 145 species of terrestrial vertebrates, accounting for 51.6% of vertebrate species known from the peninsula with total of 900 observations. In addition, distribution data of six threatened species were recorded on the peninsula.

AB  - Tropical dry forests are some of the world's most endangered ecosystems, but are the least studied habitats. The lack of information on their ecology and distribution is a constraint for restoration and conservation of these forests. The last study to describe dry forest communities in Myanmar was conducted in the 1960s, and was based on their physiognomy and the dominant tree species. We investigated the species composition of the dry forest communities in the central dry zone of Myanmar, and developed environmental distribution models. Based on presence/absence vegetation surveys, we classified the community types using TWINSPAN. We obtained 14 statistically significant basic community types, which we combined into five alliances and two orders. Community types were generally divided into two groups at the order level: woody communities in the forest landscapes and in the anthropogenic (agricultural and residential) landscapes. Tectona hamiltoniana and Terminalia oliveri were abundant in the forest landscapes, whereas Prosopis juliflora and Borassus flabellifer were common in the anthropogenic landscapes. Acacia catechu and Waltheria indica were distributed in communities with intermediate characteristics between the forest and anthropogenic landscapes. Communities in the anthropogenic landscapes lacked species from the forest landscapes. Forest landscape communities were endemic to Myanmar's dry zone, and T. hamiltoniana was dominant. A novel community of alien P. juliflora which is common to the world's dry forests, was detected in the anthropogenic landscapes. We predicted the distribution of dry forest communities across the study area using a logistic regression model based on landscape types and mesoscale environmental variables. Landscape was the most significant factor that explained the distribution of the communities, followed by elevation. The forest landscape communities, especially the Shorea siamensis-T. hamiltoniana and T. hamiltoniana-T. oliveri forest alliances were rare in the study area. The limited area of these communities suggested their importance for conservation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary Charismatic Sumatran mammals (i.e., the elephant, orangutan, and tiger) play a pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem balance. Nevertheless, these species have encountered multifaceted threats due to habitat disturbances, leading to their potential extinction. Thus, understanding current species ranges, together with investigating the most essential factors for the species, are crucial for developing conservation strategies. We predicted the potential range of three charismatic mammals in Sumatra Island using anthropogenic, biophysical, topographic, and climatic parameters based on ensemble machine learning algorithms. This study also comprehensively describes how land ownerships can shape the existence of these three species. Finally, we provide recommendations based on our findings for species conservation planning and management options. Tropical Rainforest Heritage sites of Sumatra are some of the most irreplaceable landscapes in the world for biodiversity conservation. These landscapes harbor many endangered Asiatic mammals all suffering multifaceted threats due to anthropogenic activities. Three charismatic mammals in Sumatra: Elephas maximus sumatranus, Pongo abelii, and Panthera tigris sumatrae are protected and listed as Critically Endangered (CR) within the IUCN Red List. Nevertheless, their current geographic distribution remains unclear, and the impact of environmental factors on these species are mostly unknown. This study predicts the potential range of those species on the island of Sumatra using anthropogenic, biophysical, topographic, and climatic parameters based on the ensemble machine learning algorithms. We also investigated the effects of habitat loss from current land use, ecosystem availability, and importance of Indonesian protected areas. Our predictive model had relatively excellent performance (Sorensen: 0.81-0.94) and can enhance knowledge on the current species distributions. The most critical environmental predictors for the distribution of the three species are conservation status and temperature seasonality. This study revealed that more than half of the species distributions occurred in non-protected areas, with proportional coverage being 83%, 72%, and 54% for E.m. sumatranus, P. abelii, and P.t. sumatrae, respectively. Our study further provides reliable information on places where conservation efforts must be prioritized, both inside and outside of the protected area networks, to safeguard the ongoing survival of these Indonesian large charismatic mammals.

AB  - Point Pelee National Park, located at the southern-most tip of Canada's mainland, historically supported a large number of herpetofauna species; however, despite nearly a century of protection, six snake and five amphibian species have disappeared, and remaining species- at-risk populations are thought to be in decline. We hypothesized that long-term changes in availability and distribution of critical habitat types may have contributed to the disappearance of herpetofauna. To track habitat changes we used aerial image data spanning 85 years (1931 +/- 2015) and manually digitized and classified image data using a standardized framework. Change-detection analyses were used to evaluate the relative importance of proportionate loss and fragmentation of 17 habitat types. Marsh habitat diversity and aquatic connectivity has declined since 1931. The marsh matrix transitioned from a graminoid and forb shallow marsh interspersed with water to a cattail dominated marsh, altering critical breeding, foraging, and overwintering habitat. Reduced diversity of marsh habitats appears to be linked to the expansion of invasive Phragmites australis, which invaded prior to 2000. Loss of open habitats such as savanna and meadow has reduced availability of high quality thermoregulation habitat for reptiles. Restoration of the northwestern region and tip of Point Pelee National Park to a mixed landscape of shallow wetlands (cattail, graminoid, forb, open water) and eradication of dense Phragmites stands should improve habitat diversity. Our results suggest that long-term landscape changes resulting from habitat succession and invasive species can negatively affect habitat suitability for herpetofauna and protection of land alone does not necessarily equate to protection of sensitive herpetofauna.

AB  - Introduction: Ecological scales include plant species, which are responsive to changes in habitat conditions. Such plants act as phytoindicators that integrate many environmental factors.
   Objective: To identify suitable habitats for searched-for plant species based on phytoindication data.
   Materials and methods: Altogether, 47 square plots (100 m(2)) were established within a selected forest area of the Mordovia State Nature Reserve. In each plot, species composition was recorded for further analysis, and the mean values of four environmental factors (shading, soil moisture, soil nitrogen, and soil pH) were calculated using the Tsyganov ecological scale. To visualize changes in factor values, contour maps were created for each factor. To reveal differences between species composition in study plots, Jaccard's similarity index was calculated.
   Results and discussion: All study plots have been arranged mainly along gradients of three soil parameters, namely pH, nitrogen availability and moisture, while habitat shading has not acted as strongly. Gradient maps obtained of four selected environmental factors demonstrated remarkable similarity. This suggestion is confirmed by the distinguishing of three areas because of overlapping of these maps. Similarity between values of environmental factors and plant distribution was determined. The use of phytoindication methods allows showing changes in the values of environmental factors in a forest area, and being combined with a species similarity index, it is possible to predict habitat suitability for threatened plants.
   Conclusions: The possibility of indicating and finding an area suitable for inhabitation of plants based on the phytoindication ecological scale approach was determined. As threatened plants have a narrower range of environmental conditions, this method is especially suitable for these investigations.

AB  - The small Cape mountain zebra population in Gamka Mountain Nature Reserve represents a third of the entire gene pool of this endangered species and is thus vital for it's conservation. Presently, management of this population is largely hands off, with the belief that it will grow to levels which will allow it to form a source for the mixing of mountain zebra stocks in the future. The growth of this population however, has been slow and we investigated the influence of habitat and fire on this growth. Firstly, we used a diffusion model to perform a population viability analysis. This analysis indicated that the population had a low probability of attaining quasi-extinction in the next 50 years (G = 0.0032). However, our findings indicated that less than 30% of the reserve was suitable for mountain zebra and that the preferred habitat would have to be burnt at unnaturally short intervals to sustain the present growth. We therefore argue that the risk of quasi-extinction to this population is greater than predicted and suggest that management options need to be implemented to reduce this risk. These options include; translocation to another protected area; acquisition of adjacent land; burning preferred habitat at unnaturally short intervals; forming a conservancy with adjacent landowners; leasing cultivated land for pasture. We suggest that only the latter two options are likely to stimulate mountain zebra population growth in the short term and that these should receive immediate attention. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although field-collected recordings typically contain multiple simultaneously vocalizing birds of different species, acoustic species classification in this setting has received little study so far. This work formulates the problem of classifying the set of species present in an audio recording using the multi-instance multi-label (MIML) framework for machine learning, and proposes a MIML bag generator for audio, i.e., an algorithm which transforms an input audio signal into a bag-of-instances representation suitable for use with MIML classifiers. The proposed representation uses a 2D time-frequency segmentation of the audio signal, which can separate bird sounds that overlap in time. Experiments using audio data containing 13 species collected with unattended omnidirectional microphones in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve high accuracy (96.1% true positives/negatives). Automated detection of bird species occurrence using MIML has many potential applications, particularly in long-term monitoring of remote sites, species distribution modeling, and conservation planning.

AB  - In landscapes where natural habitat is highly fragmented, any method for assessment of population persistence or potential for biodiversity should be based upon metapopulation theory, taking into account the spatial and temporal dynamics of species. We argue that methods based upon species distribution data, population viability analyses (PVA), or landscape indices alone all have severe flaws. We introduce an approach based upon a combination of the three methods, in which ecologically scaled landscape indices (ESLI) are compared to spatial standards derived from both analysis of distribution data and PVA-type simulations. We derive spatial standards, introducing the key patch approach. Key patches are large patches with a stabilizing role in habitat networks. Key patch standards were developed using spatial analysis of presence-absence data and calibrated metapopulation models for marshland bird species. We show examples of the application of this approach in land use management at both regional and national planning scales. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) warrants listing as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Central to any conservation planning for the black-tailed prairie dog is an appropriate detection and monitoring technique. Because coarse-resolution satellite imagery is not adequate to detect black-tailed prairie dog colonies, we examined the usefulness of recently available high-resolution (1-m) satellite imagery. In 6 purchased scenes of national grasslands, we were easily able to visually detect small and large colonies without using image-processing algorithms. The Ikonos (Space Imaging(TM)) satellite imagery was as adequate as large-scale aerial photography to delineate colonies. Based on the high quality of imagery, we discuss a possible monitoring program for black-tailed prairie dog colonies throughout the Great Plains, using the species' distribution in North Dakota as an example. Monitoring plots could be established and imagery acquired periodically to track the expansion and contraction of colonies.

AB  - The population of the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) in the Russian Far East is currently being restored; young individuals are being spread within the historical range, including territory in China. Here, the assessment of the suitability for the territories that exist in Northeastern China as the Amur tiger habitat and its food supply-prey base (three species of ungulates, namely wild boar, red deer and roe deer) are shown. A specially protected area-the Taipingou Natural Reserve, located on the border of the People's Republic of China and Russia-was examined. The modelling of habitat suitability for ungulates was performed on the basis of Earth remote sensing data by using two different approaches: expert geo-information assessment of the territory and discriminant analysis modelling. Based on discriminant analysis, the modelling of the suitability of ungulate habitats (without the variability of plant communities) showed a small difference between the model results for wild boar and roe deer. Nevertheless, the connection with the morphometric characteristics of the relief was more important for the wild boar than the roe deer. Furthermore, the variability of vegetation types was more important for the roe deer. The analysis of the biotopes showed that wild boars prefer the central and northern parts of Taipingou National Reserve, while the main roe deer distribution is in the western part of the Reserve; red deer are more common in the southern part of the Reserve.

AB  - Ichthyoplankton assemblages in the south central Tyrrhenian Sea are not known in spite of this being an intensely fished area. There are two large canyons in this region: Dohrn, in the Gulf of Naples, and Cuma, at the south end of the Gulf of Gaeta. In this study, we provide the first description of summer ichthyoplankton assemblages in the vicinity of the two canyons and present the physical features and Lagrangian particle tracking analyses at the time of the sampling. We identified fish larvae of 19 families and fish eggs of 8 families. The most abundant species was Engraulis encrasicolus, which was found at densities comparable to other known spawning grounds of the western Mediterranean. Mesopelagic species, such as Gonostomatidae and Myctophidae, were also abundant, especially at the Cuma Canyon. The notochord and standard length of the E. encrasicolus larvae ranged from 2.06 to 10.47 mm and was significantly smaller at the Cuma stations than at the Dohrn stations, suggesting the presence of sub-populations with different spawning phenologies. The passive particle tracking analyses and the examination of currents confirmed distinct circulation features between the two sampled regions and in relation to depth and proximity to the canyon heads. These results uncover previously unknown rich assemblages of fish eggs and larvae and have conservation and management implications given the proximity of these canyons to a marine protected area and to an intensely fished continental shelf.

AB  - Capsule: One of the southernmost populations of the Black Guillemot Cepphus grylle is currently endangered, and the risk may be exacerbated by climate change.
   Aims: We evaluated the future vulnerability of the Black Guillemot by predicting the impact of climate change on the geographic distribution of its breeding and foraging range in the Baltic Sea.
   Methods: We used MaxEnt, a species distribution modelling technique, to predict the current and future breeding grounds and foraging sites.
   Results: We found that although the foraging range is expected to increase in the southern Baltic Sea in future, these areas will no longer be suitable as breeding grounds due to a changing climate, creating a spatial mismatch.
   Conclusion: Our predictions indicate where threats to the species may be most severe and can be used to guide conservation planning. We advocate conservation measures which integrate potential future threats and focus on breeding sites across the current and future potential geographic range of the Black Guillemot.

AB  - The Comoros archipelago is a biodiversity hotspot by virtue of its high level of endemism. However, it suffers one of the highest rates of forest loss worldwide, mainly due to strong anthropogenic pressures. As Comorian populations depend on forest resources for subsistence, establishing relevant conservation strategies for their sustainable management requires the consideration of multiple stakeholders' perspectives toward biodiversity and habitat conservation. To better understand the relationships between humans and nature; how comorian people use natural resource and the relevance of a protected area for long-term biodiversity conservation, we used Q-methodology to assess local people's perceptions regarding biodiversity and conservation actions. Three discourses are identified during analysis: "Pro-environment discourse", "Keeping things as usual" and "Social and environmental concerns". According to the results, employed respondents, were favorable to long-term forest and biodiversity conservation. In contrast, unemployed respondents were in favor of more immediate benefits while unemployed but educated respondents were in favor to both long-term forest conservation and immediate benefits from forests. This suggests that poverty and a lack of access to basic services is associated with overharvesting of natural resources by rural people. These results suggest that biodiversity conservation of the Comoros archipelagos may benefit for plan aiming at (1) developing tourism and maintaining sustainable production of crops and livestock that could allow enhancing livelihoods and well-being of all social groups, (2) developing projects such as local markets that could allow villagers to sell agricultural productions, (3) setting up awareness campaign for tree-planting and reforestation. Reforestation could allow re-establishing natural plants and make large trees available for long-term purposes.

AB  - The decline and isolation of wild megafauna populations are increasingly recognised in Africa. In Cote d'Ivoire where elephants are a national symbol, the Tai National Park (TNP) is a key remaining habitat for Loxodonta cyclotis. However, the interactions between L. cyclotis and its current environmental conditions are less known. This study aims at determining the factors that affect the occupancy patterns of the species at TNP for guiding conservation decision-making. We assessed the species occupancy probability and factors that affect its distribution based on habitat variables and observations from 87 camera traps installed for 120 days within TNP. We used an occupancy model to determine the variables that significantly affect L. cyclotis distribution and to estimate their occupancy probability by site of camera traps installation. We also produced a predictive species distribution map by interpolating occupancy probability values at trapping sites. The key factors that drive the L. cyclotis distribution in the TNP were the distance to the nearest research or ecotourism areas, the distance to the periphery and the rate of poaching index of the installation site. Occupancy probability decreased with closer distance to the TNP periphery and increasing poaching pressures, while it increased with the proximity of research or ecotourism areas. The predictive distribution map indicated that the northwestern and southwestern areas of the TNP had a higher probability (p > 0.6) of L. cyclotis occurrence, compared to other parts of the Protected Area. These results confirm the positive effect of scientific research and ecotourism activities that favour L. cyclotis (and thus other wildlife) conservation. So those activities have to be promoted along with antipoaching strategies.

AB  - Conservation decision-making often relies on species' distribution changes in response to anthropogenic disturbances but overlook their temporal responses. Filling the knowledge gap on the temporal shifts as elusive responses of wild animals to human activity is important because this may provide information for more proactive conservation planning. In this study, we used camera traps in a field survey technique to investigate the trade-offs between spatial and temporal responses of a mammal community to major human activities in Qinling Mountains, China. We focused on five most abundant mammalian species including giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), takin (Budorcas taxicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus), and Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus), and examined the drivers of, and the trade-offs between the change of their spatial distributions and daily activity patterns in response to anthropogenic disturbances. We found that in response to human interferences, giant panda and takin mainly changed their distributions, while wild boar, tufted deer and Chinese goral altered their daily activity patterns, indicating the elusive responses of the latter species under anthropogenic stressors. In addition, anthropogenic stressors such as farming and tourism have more profound impacts on mammal communities than previously revealed by species distribution modeling only. For nature reserves that aim to conserve multiple species simultaneously, a more flexible, adaptive management framework is thus needed to capture the trade-offs between multiple species' spatial and temporal responses to anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - Prioritizing candidate areas to achieve species richness representation is relatively straightforward when distributions are known for many taxa; however, it may be challenging in data-poor regions. One approach is to focus on the distribution of a few charismatic species in areas that overlap with areas with little human influence, and another is to expand protection in the vicinity of existing protected areas. We assessed the effectiveness of these two approaches for protecting the potential distribution of 21 bird species affiliated with the piedmont dry forest in Argentina. We assessed the degree to which current protected areas met the representation target for each bird species. We found that 8% of the piedmont dry forest and 11% of the extent of occurrence of the bird species within piedmont dry forest were protected, indicating a shortfall. Areas with little human influence that overlap with the distribution of charismatic species had a higher number of bird species than areas with high human influence. Areas within the vicinity of protected areas performed similarly to priority areas, but included high human influence areas. We suggest that a prioritization scheme based on areas of charismatic species distribution that overlap with areas of low human influence can function as an effective surrogate for bird species affiliated with the piedmont dry forest in Argentina. Our results have operational implications for conservation planning in those regions of the world where biodiversity data are poor, but where decisions and actions to sustain biodiversity are urgently needed.

AB  - Modeling and mapping potential distribution of living organisms has become an important component of conservation planning and ecosystem management in recent years. Various correlative and mechanistic methods can be applied to build predictive distributions of living organisms in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Correlative methods used to predict species' potential distribution have been described as either group discrimination techniques or profile techniques. We attempted to determine whether group discrimination techniques could perform as well as profile techniques for predicting species potential distributions, using elevation (ELVN), parent material (ROCK), slope (SLOP), radiation index (RI) and topographic position index (TPI)) as explanatory variables. We compared potential distribution predictions made for Crimean juniper (Juniperus excelsa Bieb.) in the Yukari gokdere forest district of the Mediterranean region, Turkey, applying four group discrimination techniques (discriminate analysis (DA), logistic regression analysis (LR), generalized addictive model (GAM) and classification tree technique (CT)) and two profile techniques (a maximum entropy approach to species distribution modeling (MAXENT), the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP)). Visual assessments of the potential distribution probability of the applied models for Crimean juniper were performed by using geographical information systems (GIS). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to objectively assess model performance. The results suggested that group discrimination techniques are better than profile techniques and, among the group discrimination techniques, GAM indicated the best performance.

AB  - Although freshwater ecosystems contain high biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services, they are severely threatened worldwide. Many broad-scale approaches to conserve freshwater environments have been proposed, but as headwaters tend to host higher levels of biodiversity, identifying priority areas for conservation at a local scale is essential. An integrative three-step framework is proposed to recognize such areas, using anomuran crabs of the family Aeglidae as biodiversity indicator taxa, within four freshwater ecoregions in South America. First, the knowledge on the distribution of species occurring within the study area was updated and the species conservation status assessed. Second, species distribution modelling was used to identify areas of high richness and endemism. Third, these areas were compared with the existing protected area network, in addition to land-use and urban information, to indicate priority areas for conservation within four freshwater ecoregions (Laguna dos Patos, Upper Uruguay, Lower Uruguay, Tramandai and Mampituba) studied at a local scale. Analysis of the distribution of species of the genus Aegla showed that the present protected area network poorly covers freshwater habitats within the study region. Three priority areas for conservation were identified, with high levels of endemism and richness of aeglid species. These areas are mainly located close to current protected areas, and we suggest, therefore, that the enlargement of some protected areas, through the establishment of corridors, would better protect several species with distributions restricted to headwaters, such as macroinvertebrates and fishes, some of which are threatened with extinction.

AB  - Gap analysis is a widely used method for assessing the representation of species in protected area (PA) networks. However, representation does not imply persistence. Here, we investigated whether gap analysis may result in misleading conservation guidelines by comparing the representation to two indicators of persistence. We ran a gap analysis with Finnish breeding birds and identified conservation priorities based on current distribution patterns. We tested the sensitivity of these results by using two target setting schemes and several thresholds defining the amount of protected area, and found the levels of representation identified by gap analysis to be robust. We then compared the gap analysis results with recent population trends and projected changes in potential suitable climate under different climate change scenarios for the year 2050. We show that although high latitude species are well represented in PAs, they are currently declining and are projected to lose climatic suitability in the near future. In contrast, low latitude species with poor representation in PM have increasing population trends and are generally expected to expand their ranges into protected areas in the near future. This study demonstrates with empirical data a mismatch between representation in PM and population trends, resulting in misleading understanding of current PA effectiveness. The mismatch is linked to the latitude of species distributions and corresponds to expected future changes, indicating that the patterns are potentially driven by climate change. We therefore urge practitioners and researchers to include better indicators of persistence in gap-analysis frameworks even for short term assessments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over half of globally threatened animal species have experienced rapid geographic range loss. Identifying the parts of species' distributions most vulnerable to local extinction would benefit conservation planning. However, previous studies give little consensus on whether ranges decline to the core or edge. We built on previous work by using empirical data to examine the position of recent local extinctions within species' geographic ranges, address range position as a continuum, and explore the influence of environmental factors. We aggregated point-locality data for 125 Galliform species from across the Palearctic and Indo-Malaya into equal-area half-degree grid cells and used a multispecies dynamic Bayesian occupancy model to estimate rates of local extinctions. Our model provides a novel approach to identify loss of populations from within species ranges. We investigated the relationship between extinction rates and distance from range edge by examining whether patterns were consistent across biogeographic realm and different categories of land use. In the Palearctic, local extinctions occurred closer to the range edge than range core in both unconverted and human-dominated landscapes. In Indo-Malaya, no pattern was found for unconverted landscapes, but in human-dominated landscapes extinctions tended to occur closer to the core than the edge. Our results suggest that local and regional factors override general spatial patterns of recent local extinction within species' ranges and highlight the difficulty of predicting the parts of a species' distribution most vulnerable to threat.

AB  - Understanding the patterns of biodiversity is central to species conservation planning. Here we illustrate chiropteran diversity and distribution pattern of the hill ranges of the Eastern Ghats of Odisha state, India using roost survey and mist net survey techniques. The present study recorded 23 bat species including two newly recorded species for the study site i.e., Hipposideros galeritus and Megaderma spasma. The bat capture rate was the highest in the moist deciduous forest describing higher bat populations compared with the places of human habitation. Utilities of 21 climate, three physiographic and two disturbance variables and species distribution modelling could reveal that the north-eastern part was more suitable for bat distributions than the southern part of the region. The climate, physiographic and disturbance variables were crucial in their distributions, where elevation and potential evapotranspiration were highly significant. Unlike other species, Taphozous melanopogon showed negative correlation with these variables. The mean diurnal temperature and precipitation seasonality have positive influence on bat distributions, indicating their resilience to seasonal precipitation changes and day time temperature fluctuations. The negative effect of temperature seasonality on the distribution of Pteropus giganteus could attribute to its vulnerability to climate change effects. The study provides inputs for monitoring the future spatio-temporal changes, suggesting long term conservation measures. It could generate basic information on the impacts of climate change on bat distribution in the future climate change scenario.

AB  - Species distribution data are an essential biodiversity variable requiring robust monitoring to inform wildlife conservation. Yet, such data remain inherently sparse because of the logistical challenges of monitoring biodiversity across broad geographic extents. Surveys of people knowledgeable about the occurrence of wildlife provide an opportunity to evaluate species distributions and the ecology of wildlife communities across large spatial scales. We analyzed detection histories of 30 vertebrate species across the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India, obtained from a large-scale interview survey of 2318 people who live and work in the forests of this region. We developed a multispecies occupancy model that simultaneously corrected for false-negative (non-detection) and false-positive (misidentification) errors that interview surveys can be prone to. Using this model, we integrated data across species in composite analyses of the responses of functional species groups (based on disturbance tolerance, diet, and body mass traits) to spatial variation in environmental variables, protection, and anthropogenic pressures. We observed a positive association between forest cover and the occurrence of species with low tolerance of human disturbance. Protected areas were associated with higher occurrence for species across different functional groups compared with unprotected lands. We also observed the occurrence of species with low disturbance tolerance, herbivores, and large-bodied species was negatively associated with developmental pressures, such as human settlements, energy production and mining, and demographic pressures, such as biological resource extraction. For the conservation of threatened vertebrates, our work underscores the importance of maintaining forest cover and reducing deforestation within and outside protected areas, respectively. In addition, mitigating a suite of pervasive human pressures is also crucial for wildlife conservation in one of the world's most densely populated biodiversity hotspots.

AB  - The ability of species to shift their distributions in response to climate change may be impeded by lack of suitable climate or habitat between species' current and future ranges. We examined the potential for climate and forest cover to limit the movement of bird species among sites of biodiversity importance in the Albertine Rift, East Africa, a biodiversity hotspot. We forecasted future distributions of suitable climate for 12 Albertine Rift endemic bird species using species distribution models based on current climate data and projections of future climate. We used these forecasts alongside contemporary forest cover and natal dispersal estimates to project potential movement of species over time. We identified potentially important pathways for the bird species to move among 30 important bird and biodiversity areas (IBAs) that are both currently forested and projected to provide suitable climate over intervening time periods. We examined the relative constraints imposed by availability of suitable climate and forest cover on future movements.
   The analyses highlighted important pathways of potential dispersal lying along a north-south axis through high elevation areas of the Albertine Rift. Both forest availability and climate suitability were projected to influence bird movement through these landscapes as they are affected by future climate change. Importantly, forest cover and areas projected to contain suitable climate in future were often dissociated in space, which could limit species' responses to climate change. A lack of climatically suitable areas was a far greater impediment to projected movement among IBAs than insufficient forest cover. Although current forest cover appears sufficient to facilitate movement of bird species in this region, protecting the remaining forests in areas also projected to be climatically suitable for species to move through in the future should be a priority for adaptation management.

AB  - The marshes of Donana (SW, Spain) are some of the largest and best preserved Mediterranean marsh areas represented in Western Europe. They are considered a hotspot of biodiversity, and as such receive protected-area different systems of protected-area management. The importance of submerged macrophytes in the functioning of marsh ecosystems has been addressed in several studies. However, most of the animal biodiversity studies have been developed for vertebrates. Thus, the aims of this study are i) to assess the composition of the invertebrate community in the marsh of Donana (zooplankton and zoobenthos) in a set of sites representing,the different habitats of the marsh in both clear and turbid water states; ii) to compare diversity among patches in different states (clear vs turbid water); and iii) to address the main environmental factors that have influenced their community structure and diversity. A total of 102 taxa were recorded. The highest abundance values were attained by cladocerans and ostracods, both microcrustaceans, and by dipteran insects. It was possible to distinguish different marsh environments characterised by patches of clear water, where the macrophyte beds contribute to an increase of the structural heterogeneity of the marsh, providing the invertebrates with shelter and food resources and subsequently-influencing different invertebrate assemblages. Conductivity, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and chlorophyll-a concentration were the environmental variables that influenced the presence of turbid patches, which showed lower macrophyte cover, diversity and richness values than those seen in the clear water patches. The relationship between diversity H') and richness (S), suggested that processes related to species migration (i.e., hydrologic connection with other water bodies, flood duration, and dissemination of propagules) are the main constraints influencing the invertebrate community structure in the Donana marshes.

AB  - Plants are the bedrock of life on Earth but are increasingly threatened with extinction. The most cost-effective way of conserving plant diversity is through Protected Areas (PAs). However, the locality, size, and management of PAs are crucial for effectively maintaining diversity and have been criticized as currently inadequate. Using Armenia as our study site and orchids as our study taxa, we sought to (1) identify spatial patterns of orchid diversity hotspots and corresponding PA network sites; (2) examine if the current PA network is effective at capturing orchid species richness and diversity and (3) explore the relationship between the range of area suitability of species and level of protection. We used data collected from herbarium, field visits and GBIF occurrence records. Using freely available mapping software, we created heatmaps of observations and species richness. We compared PA sites based on the number of species (species richness) and diversity (Shannon-Weiner Index). Species range was developed using the MaxEnt model and a correlation analysis was performed against the proportion of the range within PA. We found that 57% of PA sites have a representation of at least one species of orchid, but some threatened species are not presented within any PA site. The Tavush and Syunik province not only held the highest species richness (>10 species), but the PA network within also held high orchid diversity (2.5 diversity index value for Dilijan National Park). We did not find a significant relationship between the range of area suitability for orchids and protection; however, all our target species had less than 30% of their range under protection. Our study highlights important challenges related to the limitations of available data, and we discuss these implications towards effective conservation outcomes for orchids for the region.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have increasingly subjected freshwater ecosystems globally to various pressures. Increasing land use activities have been highly linked to deteriorating freshwater ecosystems and dwindling biodiversity. For sound management and conservation policies to be implemented, relations between land use, environmental, and bi-otic components need to be widely documented. To evaluate the impacts of land use on biotic components, this study analyzed the diatom and macroinvertebrate community composition of the Eastern Highlands (Zimbabwe) streams to assess the main spatial diatom and macroinvertebrate community variances and how environmental variables and spa-tial factors influence community composition. Diatom and macroinvertebrate sampling was done in 16 streams in protected areas (national parks) and impacted sites (timber plantation and communal areas). Water (pH, phosphorus, and ammonium) and sediment (nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, manganese, and zinc) and habitat (sub-strate embeddedness, and habitat) variables differed significantly with land use. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the protected area had the best water quality, particularly marked by high pH levels and low phos-phorus concentrations among environment types. Heavy metals were high in the communal areas, although mercury was higher in the national park. Significant differences were observed in diatom metrics, specifically dominance and evenness, with no significant differences observed in macroinvertebrate metrics across land uses. Diatoms differed in terms of composition in response to land use. Results provide an important scientific reference for land use optimiza-tion and guidance for the formulation of policies to protect freshwater resources in African Highland streams. Manage-ment and conservation initiatives in the Eastern Highlands are further recommended as this study detected high levels of mercury in the protected area, implying high levels of illegal mining.

AB  - Despite its size and attractiveness, many Lucanus cervus sites remain undetected in NW Europe because of its short flight period and its nocturnal activity. Therefore, presentday designated conservation areas for L. cervus are probably insufficient for a sustainable conservation of the species. We applied eight species distribution modelling techniques (artificial neural networks, classification tree analysis, generalised additive models, generalised boosting models, generalised linear models, mixture discriminant analysis, multiple adaptive regression splines and random forests) to predict the distribution of L cervus in Belgium using 10 randomly generated calibration and evaluation sets. We used AUC, sensitivity (% correctly predicted presences in the evaluation set) and specificity (% correctly predicted absences in the evaluation set) and Kappa statistics to compare model performances. To avoid the incorporation of only marginally suitable woodland sites into the Natura 2000 network, we, conservatively, considered the species as being present only in grid cells where all 10 randomly generated model sets predicted the species as such. Model performance was, on average, good allowing to predict the potential distribution of L. cervus accurately. According to the predicted distribution using the more robust prevalence threshold, only 5731 ha (11% of the potentially suitable area) is protected under the Natura 2000 scheme in Belgium. Subsequently, we categorised the potentially suitable woodlands into three conservation priority categories based on their surface area and the already designated Natura 2000 area. Including the most suitable L. cervus woodlands previously not included in the Natura 2000 sites within such network would require protecting an area of 15,260 ha. Finally, we discuss the implications of using species distribution modelling for nature policy decisions in designating conservation networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Efficient monitoring of organisms is at the foundation of protected area and biodiversity management. Such monitoring programs are based on a systematically selected set of survey locations that, while able to track trends at those locations through time, lack inference for the overall region being "monitored". Advances in spatially-balanced sampling approaches offer alternatives but remain largely untested in marine ecosystems. This study evaluated the merit of using a two-stage, spatially-balanced survey framework, in conjunction with generalized additive models, to estimate epifauna cover at a reef-wide scale for mesophotic reefs within a large, cross-shelf marine park. Imagery acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle was classified using a hierarchical scheme developed under the Collaborative and Automated Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery (CATAMI). At a realistic image subsampling intensity, the two-stage, spatially-balanced framework provided accurate and precise estimates of reef-wide cover for a select number of epifaunal classes at the coarsest CATAMI levels, in particular bryozoan and porifera classes. However, at finer hierarchical levels, accuracy and/or precision of cover estimates declined, primarily because of the natural rarity of even the most common of these classes/morphospecies. Ranked predictor importance suggested that bathymetry, backscatter and derivative terrain variables calculated at their smallest analysis window scales (i.e. 81 m(2)) were generally the most important variables in the modeling of reef-wide cover. This study makes an important step in identifying the constraints and limitations that can be identified through a robust statistical approach to design and analysis. The two-stage, spatially-balanced framework has great potential for effective quantification of epifaunal cover in cross-shelf mesophotic reefs. However, greater image subsampling intensity than traditionally applied is required to ensure adequate observations for finer-level CATAMI classes and associated morphospecies.

AB  - "El Cachucho" Marine Protected Area (MPA), which comprises Le Danois Bank and its intraslope basin, was included during 2008 in the Nature 2000 network mainly because of the presence of the habitat "1170 Reefs" according to the EU Habitat Directive. To review the effectiveness of existing management measures, several activities aimed at characterizing the most structurally complex hard-bottom habitats were planned and carried out during the ESMAREC 0514 survey. For identification of these habitats, several transects using the photogrammetric towed sled Politolana were carried out on Le Danois Bank, in the depth range between 427 and 1379 m, searching for the sea beds with higher values of slope and backscatter. Photogrammetric techniques were used for image scaling, so we could determine the surface areas of different substrata types (fades) and their species densities. A total area of 28,762 m(2) was analyzed in the still images of 23 transects, verifying that 85% of the substrata of our study area are occupied by 4 different facies: Bedrock, bedrock with mixed sediments, mixed sediments with pebbles and boulders, and mixed sediments. Acoustic data and ground-truth visual data were combined to evaluate distinctive benthic scenarios. The relative abundances of the 123 epibenthic species identified by image analyses show that the most abundant are sponges (29%), cnidarians (26%), crustaceans (26%) and echinoderms (14%), i.e. mostly sessile species or those with low mobility. The keystone species of the "1170 Reefs" habitat are 3 cnidarians: Callogorgia verticiilata, Parcunuricea cf. placomus and Dendrophyllia cornigera, and 3 sponges, Asconema setubalense, Geodia msp.1 and Phakellia robusta. Eight new habitats (biotopes) have been identified on Le Danois Bank, six of which occur on the hard bottoms, with depth, substratum, BPI (Bathymetric Position Index) and slope as determining environmental variables that explain their spatial distributions.

AB  - Spatial management is a valuable strategy to advance regional goals for nature conservation, economic development, and human health. One challenge of spatial management is navigating the prioritization of multiple features. This challenge becomes more pronounced in dynamic management scenarios, in which boundaries are flexible in space and time in response to changing biological, environmental, or socioeconomic conditions. To implement dynamic management, decision-support tools are needed to guide spatial prioritization as feature distributions shift under changing conditions. Marxan is a widely applied decision-support tool designed for static management scenarios, but its utility in dynamic management has not been evaluated. EcoCast is a new decision-support tool developed explicitly for the dynamic management of multiple features, but it lacks some of Marxan's functionality. We used a hindcast analysis to compare the capacity of these 2 tools to prioritize 4 marine species in a dynamic management scenario for fisheries sustainability. We successfully configured Marxan to operate dynamically on a daily time scale to resemble EcoCast. The relationship between EcoCast solutions and the underlying species distributions was more linear and less noisy, whereas Marxan solutions had more contrast between waters that were good and poor to fish. Neither decision-support tool clearly outperformed the other; the appropriateness of each depends on management purpose, resource-manager preference, and technological capacity of tool developers. Article impact statement: Marxan can function as a decision-support tool for dynamic management scenarios in which boundaries are flexible in space and time.

AB  - Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) is one of the modelling techniques most recently applied to biodiversity conservation and it can be implemented with presence-only data through the generation of artificial absences (pseudo-absences). In this paper, three pseudo-absences generation techniques are compared, namely the generation of pseudo-absences within target-group background (TGB), testing both the weighted (WTGB) and unweighted (UTGB) scheme, and the generation at random (RDM), evaluating their performance and applicability in distribution modelling and species conservation. The choice of the target group fell on amphibians, because of their rapid decline worldwide and the frequent lack of guidelines for conservation strategies and regional-scale planning, which instead could be provided through an appropriate implementation of SDMs. Bufo bufo, Salamandrina perspicillata and Triturus camifex were considered as target species, in order to perform our analysis with species having different ecological and distributional characteristics. The study area is the "Gran Sasso-Monti della Laga" National Park, which hosts 15 Natura 2000 sites and represents one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in Europe. Our results show that the model calibration ameliorates when using the target-group based pseudo-absences compared to the random ones, especially when applying the WTGB. Contrarily, model discrimination did not significantly vary in a consistent way among the three approaches with respect to the tree target species. Both WTGB and RDM clearly isolate the highly contributing variables, supplying many relevant indications for species conservation actions. Moreover, the assessment of pairwise variable interactions and their three-dimensional visualization further increase the amount of useful information for protected areas' managers. Finally, we suggest the use of RDM as an admissible alternative when it is not possible to individuate a suitable set of species as a representative target-group from which the pseudo-absences can be generated.

AB  - Located in the Cantabrian Sea (NE Atlantic), 30 nm off the Asturian coast, "El Cachucho" was the first off-shore Marine Protected Area (MPA) to be declared in Spain. The area includes Le Danois Bank and its intraslope basin. It joined the OSPAR Network of MPAs in 2009 and, thereafter, was included in the Natura 2000 Network in 2011. The main reason for its declaration as MPA was the presence of the 1170 Reefs habitat included in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive. In 2018, the MPAs Master Management Plan was under revision and its design criteria were subjected to evaluation. We used Marxan decision support tool to evaluate the MPA's management design criteria. This tool selects the most important conservation features, while minimizing the socioeconomic cost. First, the 1170 Reefs habitat was defined as the main environmental value. Specifically, we took into account the six large sized target species that are more representative of this habitat in the area: the sponges Asconema setubalense, Geodia cf. barretti and Phakellia robusta, the anthipatarian Leiopathes glaberrima, and the gorgonians Placogorgia sp. and Callogorgia verticillata. A spatial distribution map was produced for each species using Generalized Additive Models (GAM). We also considered the presence of spawning stocks of fish species which are present in the area as an important conservation value. Their spatial distribution was modeled through Maxent software. Additionally, for the socioeconomic cost, fishing effort of the different fisheries operating in the area was estimated linking VMS/Logbook data before and after the MPA was declared. The first results obtained with the Maraxan tool were presented in public consultation, in the context of the LIFE + INTEMARES Project, to help in decision making within the new Management Plan. Thus, to improve the management measures aimed at the conservation of the environmental values of the MPA, an enlargement of the protected area to the West was proposed, and a more reasonable use of the buffer area to fishermen than that defined in the former Management Plan was suggested. Involving all stakeholders in the development of the management plan for this MPA is a decisive step for the creation and consolidation of an important network of MPAs in Spain.

AB  - Along the East African coast, marine top predators are facing an increasing number of anthropogenic threats which requires the implementation of effective and urgent conservation measures to protect essential habitats. Understanding the role that habitat features play on the marine top predator' distribution and abundance is a crucial step to evaluate the suitability of an existing Marine Protected Area (MPA), originally designated for the protection of coral reefs. We developed species distribution models (SDM) on the IUCN data deficient Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) in southern Kenya. We followed a comprehensive ecological modelling approach to study the environmental factors influencing the occurrence and abundance of dolphins while developing SDMs. Through the combination of ensemble prediction maps, we defined recurrent, occasional and unfavourable habitats for the species. Our results showed the influence of dynamic and static predictors on the dolphins' spatial ecology: dolphins may select shallow areas (5-30 m), close to the reefs (<500 m) and oceanic fronts (<10 km) and adjacent to the 100m isobath (<5 km). We also predicted a significantly higher occurrence and abundance of dolphins within the MPA. Recurrent and occasional habitats were identified on large percentages on the existing MPA (47% and 57% using presence-absence and abundance models respectively). However, the MPA does not adequately encompass all occasional and recurrent areas and within this context, we propose to extend the MPA to incorporate all of them which are likely key habitats for the highly mobile species. The results from this study provide two key conservation and management tools: (i) an integrative habitat modelling approach to predict key marine habitats, and (ii) the first study evaluating the effectiveness of an existing MPA for marine mammals in the Western Indian Ocean.

AB  - Resource managers at parks and other protected areas are increasingly expected to factor climate change explicitly into their decision making frameworks. However, most protected areas are small relative to the geographic ranges of species being managed, so forecasts need to consider local adaptation and community dynamics that are correlated with climate and affect distributions inside protected area boundaries. Additionally, niche theory suggests that species' physiological capacities to respond to climate change may be underestimated when forecasts fail to consider the full breadth of climates occupied by the species rangewide. Here, using correlative species distribution models that contrast estimates of climatic sensitivity inferred from the two spatial extents, we quantify the response of limber pine (Pinus flexilis) to climate change in Rocky Mountain National Park (Colorado, USA). Models are trained locally within the park where limber pine is the community dominant tree species, a distinct structural-compositional vegetation class of interest to managers, and also rangewide, as suggested by niche theory. Model forecasts through 2100 under two representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5 W/m(2)) show that the distribution of limber pine in the park is expected to move upslope in elevation, but changes in total and core patch area remain highly uncertain. Most of this uncertainty is biological, as magnitudes of projected change are considerably more variable between the two spatial extents used in model training than they are between RCPs, and novel future climates only affect local model predictions associated with RCP 8.5 after 2091. Combined, these results illustrate the importance of accounting for unknowns in species' climatic sensitivities when forecasting distributional scenarios that are used to inform management decisions. We discuss how our results for limber pine may be interpreted in the context of climate change vulnerability and used to help guide adaptive management.

AB  - A set of medium-scale historical maps was used to reconstruct changes in spatial patterns of forest area during the last 220 years in an agricultural matrix of north-eastern Europe (Zemgale region, Latvia). Changes in total forest area by soils were determined, as well as the time period of continuous forest cover. Proportion of protected area for each soil trophic group was also calculated. Patterns of recent forest development differed between soil trophic groups. Afforestation occurred mainly on wet and poor soils in the 19th and 20th centuries, while the proportion of woodland area on fertile soils typical for nemoral forests was fairly stable. Only 1% of the fertile soil area has been covered by continuous forest for more than 220 years, and only 11% of them are protected. Nemoral deciduous forests cover only 15% of their potential natural vegetation area of forested eutrophic soils. Therefore, in regard to habitat protection that is representative of natural distribution of ecosystems, priority in conservation should be given to forests on fertile soils.

AB  - The maned wolf, the largest canid in South America, was originally distributed in areas with open natural vegetation in the Cerrado biome, Chaco and Pampas regions. The dynamics of its distribution are, however, in flux, with populations declining at the southern limit of its distribution, and areas of apparent range expansion in Brazil. Although the maned wolf's overall distribution is well documented, little is known about its smallest-scale landscape use. Here we used a novel approach, characterising "favourable territories" for maned wolves using presence data and information on daily movement capacity. In this way, we used favourability distribution models to relate local landscape use by maned wolves to environmental drivers in the Serra da Mantiqueira, part of the core of the species distribution. Our results showed that the favourablity of territories for maned wolf activity increases with altitude, and with the proportion of coverage of upper montane vegetation refuges and of open habitats such as agricultural fields. Our results also show that the configuration of the environment with respect to topography is an important driver of the favourability of the landscape for maned wolf activity. Finally, we identified some human-wildlife conflicts in the surroundings of the protected area which could increase with increasing maned wolf populations. In conclusion, our results support the importance of maintaining the integrity of high-altitude open areas in the conservation of maned wolf habitat and provide useful data for maned wolf management at the core of its global current distribution. We highlight that this is the first study to use fuzzy logic tools at the local scale to analyze the favourability of territories for maned wolf activity in a highly favourable region along an elevational gradient.

AB  - We used a novel mid-water baited remote underwater video (BRUV) technique to survey pelagic and mid-water fish assemblages at Lord Howe Island Marine Park, off eastern Australia (31.5 degrees S, 159.1 degrees E). We found differences in assemblages among regions separated on,4 scale of similar to 10s of kilometres. Of the environmental variables measured in the present study (depth, temperature, water current speed), current speed had the greatest influence on the structure of pelagic assemblages. Carcharhinus galapagensis, Seriola rivoliana and Scomber australasicus had similar distributions and were associated with low flow environments. Seriola lalandi was associated with the higher flow environments sampled during our surveys, although current speeds in the sample area were relatively slow (0.03 to 0.34 m s(-1); mean 0.17 m s(-1)). Relationships between pelagic assemblages and current speed were detected when abundances were calculated using an area-based approximation for plume dispersal, but were not detected using a linear approximation, or when current was assumed constant across all BRUV deployments. Our results demonstrate the difficulty in separating the dual effects of current speed in BRUV studies: the effect of current on bait plume size and associated estimates of fish abundance, and the role of current as an aspect of preferred pelagic fish habitat. We recommend the use of area-based approximations of plume dispersal and the inclusion of accurate estimates of current speed as a statistical covariate when interpreting mid-water BRUV data. Our results indicate that oceanographic characteristics can be important for pelagic fish habitat selection over the scale of kilometres and should be considered during marine protected area zoning.

AB  - Cipo Canastero Asthenes luizaeis a relict ovenbird restricted to rocky outcrops at high elevations within thecampo rupestrevegetation of the Espinhaco Range in the state of Minas Gerais, south-eastern Brazil. This poorly known species is considered 'Near Threatened', but recent studies have suggested that it should be listed under a higher category of threat. To contribute to the knowledge of this species and its conservation assessment and related planning, we compiled all literature records of the species distribution (n= 16 locations), collected new data on its occurrence (n= 72 locations), and calculated its geographic range using four different approaches. First, we defined the sky islands where the species occurs (nine units) using the lowest elevation value recorded (1,100 m asl) as a cut-off. Second, we performed species distribution modelling (SDM) across the sky islands and identified an area of 2,225.21 km(2). Third, we measured the species' extent of occurrence (EOO = 24,555.85 km(2)) and used SDM to estimate its upper limit (EOOup = 30,697.58 km(2)). Fourth, we measured the area of occupancy (AOO = 228 km(2)) and used SDM to estimate its upper limit (AOOup = 1,827.39 km(2)). We analysed the Cipo Canastero sky islands in terms of landscape metrics including size, isolation, protected area coverage, shape index, core area index, and proportion covered by SDM. We observed a very fragmented distribution, especially in the North sector of the species distribution, composed of small and isolated populations (separated by up to 112 km); the South sector is the core of its distribution and is composed of larger, more connected patches with differences in shape complexity that are not strongly influenced by an edge effect. The range sizes calculated, along with other reported information regarding population and habitat trends, justifies the inclusion of the species in at least the 'Vulnerable' category.

AB  - Several factors may drive bird nest-site selection, including predation risk, resource availability, weather conditions and interaction with other individuals. Understanding the drivers affecting where birds nest is important for conservation planning, especially where environmental change may alter the distribution of suitable nest-sites. This study investigates which environmental variables affect nest-site selection by the Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans, the world's largest pelagic bird. Here, wind characteristics are quantitatively investigated as a driver of nest-site selection in surface-nesting birds, in addition to several topographical variables, vegetation and geological characteristics. Nest locations from three different breeding seasons on sub-Antarctic Marion Island were modelled to assess which environmental factors affect nest-site selection. Elevation was the most important determinant of nest-site selection, with Wandering Albatrosses only nesting at low elevations. Distance from the coast and terrain roughness were also important predictors, with nests more generally found close to the coast and in flatter terrain, followed by wind velocity, which showed a hump-shaped relationship with the probability of nest occurrence. Nests occurred more frequently on coastal vegetation types, and were absent from polar desert vegetation (generally above c. 500 m elevation). Of the variables that influence Wandering Albatross nest location, both vegetation type and wind characteristics are likely to be influenced by climate change, and have already changed over the last 50 years. As a result, the availability of suitable nest-sites needs to be considered in light of future climate change, in addition to the impacts that these changes will have on foraging patterns and prey distribution. More broadly, these results provide insights into how a wide range of environmental variables, including wind, can affect nest-site selection of surface-nesting seabirds.

AB  - Conservation decisions should be evaluated for how they meet conservation goals at multiple spatial extents. Conservation easements are land use decisions resulting from a combination of social and environmental conditions. An emerging area of research is the evaluation of spatial distribution of easements and their spatial correlates. We tested the relative influence of interacting social and environmental variables on the spatial distribution of conservation easements by ownership category and conservation status. For the Appalachian region of the United States, an area with a long history of human occupation and complex land uses including public-private conservation, we found that settlement, economic, topographic, and environmental data associated with spatial distribution of easements (N = 4813). Compared to random locations, easements were more likely to be found in lower elevations, in areas of greater agricultural productivity, farther from public protected areas, and nearer other human features. Analysis of ownership and conservation status revealed sources of variation, with important differences between local and state government ownerships relative to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and among U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) GAP program status levels. NGOs were more likely to have easements nearer protected areas, and higher conservation status, while local governments held easements closer to settlement, and on lands of greater agricultural potential. Logistic interactions revealed environmental variables having effects modified by social correlates, and the strongest predictors overall were social (distance to urban area, median household income, housing density, distance to land trust office). Spatial distribution of conservation lands may be affected by geographic area of influence of conservation groups, suggesting that multi-scale conservation planning strategies may be necessary to satisfy local and regional needs for reserve networks. Our results support previous findings and provide an ecoregion-scale view that conservation easements may provide, at local scales, conservation functions on productive, more developable lands. Conservation easements may complement functions of public protected areas but more research should examine relative landscape-level ecological functions of both forms of protection.

AB  - Mining is an important human activity, but it strongly alters terrestrial and aquatic landscapes. Understanding the response of community-level descriptors is essential to plan monitoring and management strategies. In this context, we investigated differences in the environmental conditions and ichthyofauna (taxonomic and functional) structure in five pristine and four disturbed streams in a Central Amazon protected area sampled in the dry season of 2012. Additionally, we analyzed if taxonomic and functional structure exhibited similar spatial variation patterns among streams. Pristine streams exhibited higher richness and proportion of catfishes (Siluriformes) than disturbed streams, but no differences in the functional structure. The taxonomic and functional structure of the fish assemblages in the Saraca-Taquera National Forest varied concomitantly among the streams. Our results indicate that taxonomic-based metrics were more sensitive to the mining impacts in the Saraca-Taquera National Forest, probably because of the high functional redundancy of the local assemblages. We highlight the sensitivity of richness and proportion of siluriformes for monitoring stream fish assemblages in the Central Amazon.

AB  - An important step in managing invasive species is determining the factors responsible for their current and potential distribution, especially when species distribution is climatically determined like in Reynoutria taxa case. The main aim of this paper was to integrate all available distribution data of the Reynoutria taxa in SE Europe and to predict in which habitats and along which corridors its future spread can be expected. Distribution data of the Reynoutria taxa were obtained from extensive field studies in the period from 2006 to 2016, as well as from the literature and herbarium sources. A total of 4081 localities in Serbia and the Kosovo region, Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Romania have been recorded, most frequently in riparian and human-made habitats. Ecologically suitable ranges for the Reynoutria taxa were predicted using the MaxEnt program and 19 bioclimatic variables which were derived from the WorldClim data set. Results of this study showed that the most frequent Reynoutria taxa in SE Europe are R. japonica var. japonica and hybrid R. xbohemica. The most suitable geographical areas for R. japonica and R. sachalinensis are mostly located in the north, while for R. xbohemica the central part of SE Europe is suitable. The precipitation of the warmest quarter had a high influence on the potential distribution modelling of these closely related species. Potential distribution modelling revealed R. xbohemica's high temperature tolerance in different seasons with high durability of drought (up to 60 mm per year less precipitation than parental species). Moreover, this research predicts which areas are most likely to be invaded, and makes suggestions where to focus management efforts for survey and removal of these invaders, especially in protected areas. According to the future climate analysis R. japonica and R. xbohemica could expand their range in riparian habitats up to 30-40%. Consequently, invasion in Slovenia's and Croatia's rivers requires urgent preventative measures. This study provides empirical evidence that these plants could become widespread throughout SE Europe within 25 years under the current trend and emphasizes that regionally specific management plans should be implemented to prevent further spread of these taxa.

AB  - We examined how the assemblage structure and assemblage-environment relationships of stream macroinvertebrates varied over three consecutive years in a boreal drainage system. We specifically examined whether classifications produced assemblage types that were stable through time, and how these assemblages could be predicted based on local environmental variables. We also used a combination of Procrustes rotation analysis and NMDS ordinations to examine the degree of year-to-year concordance of assemblage patterns. The composition of site clusters varied among years, resulting in only moderate among-year concordance of assemblage classifications. Stream width and in-stream habitat conditions, especially macrophyte cover, were the most important variables discriminating among the cluster groups. Despite temporally variable assemblage classifications, the overall macroinvertebrate assemblage structure was concordant among years. Among-year concordance was higher in-streams with low temporal variation in the physical environment, as well as high abundance and low variability of macrophytes. Due to among-year variability in cluster composition and weakly predictable assemblage-environment relationships, a posteriori assemblage classifications may be of limited value in the conservation planning of headwater streams.

AB  - Elevational gradients can serve as powerful tools for testing ecological relationships between species richness versus environmental variables. Although the patterns be usually from positive to humped-shaped, elevational gradients may run in a negative way with the species richness decreasing in relation to the altitude. The floristic gradient may vary according species biology, site and, scale for analyses. Therefore, elevational gradient can be useful for detecting points for biological conservation and may be analized by using sensitive species as approach for others species including banner-species. Along an elevational gradient in a harsh semiarid environment we are showing a negative relationship between bryophyte species richness and increasing elevation. The observed floristic gradient reflects environmental constraints related to light requirements and low humidity as environmental conditions become more severe at higher altitudes, where anthropogenic activities such as farming dramatically alter the vegetation covering. The diversity of bryophytes in terms of their light requirements makes them excellent bioindicators of environmental quality. We provide data that will be useful for conservation planning and management, and report species with rare distributions in Brazil and others not yet recorded as occurring in dry forests.

AB  - Capsule Careful management is required to maintain or create habitats with the correct proportions of rush with reeds that are preferred by this subspecies.
   Aims To determine the habitat requirements of Eastern Iberian (Western Iberian Reed Buntings were not included in the study) Reed Buntings Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi, a subspecies endemic to a few marshes in France, Spain and Morocco, with a population of 254-360 breeding pairs.
   Methods Twenty-five wetlands in Spain were surveyed and presence/absence of Iberian Reed Buntings was deteremined together with data on 41 environmental variables. The relationships between the birds and habitat data were investigated using GLM.
   Results Proportion of rush with reeds, proportion of reed-bulrush patches and perimeter length of rush-reed patches, were the variables that primarily explained the present distribution of Eastern Iberian Reed Buntings. Other vegetation classes traditionally associated with the presence of the Eastern Iberian Reed Buntings, such as sedges, were not found to be important in the selected models.
   Conclusion Conservation planning and management guidelines for this subspecies should focus on encouraging these specific-vegetation parameters. Flood control and grazing are proposed as the best practices that will favour these vegetation variables and avoid simplification of the plant community.

AB  - Implementation of effective conservation planning relies on a robust understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of the target species. In the marine realm, this is even more challenging for species rarely seen at the sea surface due to their extreme diving behavior like the sperm whales. Our study aims at (a) investigating the seasonal movements, (b) predicting the potential distribution, and (c) assessing the diel vertical behavior of this species in the Mascarene Archipelago in the south-west Indian Ocean. Using 21 satellite tracks of sperm whales and eight environmental predictors, 14 supervised machine learning algorithms were tested and compared to predict the whales' potential distribution during the wet and dry season, separately. Fourteen of the whales remained in close proximity to Mauritius, while a migratory pattern was evidenced with a synchronized departure for eight females that headed towards Rodrigues Island. The best performing algorithm was the random forest, showing a strong affinity of the whales for sea surface height during the wet season and for bottom temperature during the dry season. A more dispersed distribution was predicted during the wet season, whereas a more restricted distribution to Mauritius and Reunion waters was found during the dry season, probably related to the breeding period. A diel pattern was observed in the diving behavior, likely following the vertical migration of squids. The results of our study fill a knowledge gap regarding seasonal movements and habitat affinities of this vulnerable species, for which a regional IUCN assessment is still missing in the Indian Ocean. Our findings also confirm the great potential of machine learning algorithms in conservation planning and provide highly reproductible tools to support dynamic ocean management.

AB  - An understanding of species turnover at different spatial scales and the influence of environmental variables including distance are important for conservation planning and management. Ground dwelling, flightless invertebrates have poor dispersal abilities and other taxa may not be effective as surrogates. This is an important consideration for biodiversity conservation in Afrotemperate forests of the Drakensberg Mountains, South Africa, where flightless invertebrates are geographically isolated by the naturally fragmented state of forests. Seventeen Afrotemperate forests in four reserves across the Drakensberg were sampled using soil and leaf litter sampling, pitfall traps, active search quadrats and tree beats. Seventy-two species were recorded, comprising 31 mollusc, nine earthworm, one onychophoran, six centipede, twelve millipede and thirteen ant species. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that latitude (distance); fire history (disturbance) and mean annual precipitation were the most important factors governing invertebrate assemblage composition. beta(sim) measurements detected change in species at all spatial scales investigated, but no clear trends were evident. Distance or spatial scale alone does not explain species turnover and community composition. Effective selection of target areas, therefore, requires species level information to identify species of special concern.

AB  - Aim Global-scale studies are required to identify broad-scale patterns in the distributions of species, to evaluate the processes that determine diversity and to determine how similar or different these patterns and processes are among different groups of freshwater species. Broad-scale patterns of spatial variation in species distribution are central to many fundamental questions in macroecology and conservation biology. We aimed to evaluate how congruent three commonly used metrics of diversity were among taxa for six groups of freshwater species.
   Location Global.
   Methods We compiled geographical range data on 7083 freshwater species of mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fishes, crabs and crayfish to evaluate how species richness, richness of threatened species and endemism are distributed across freshwater ecosystems. We evaluated how congruent these measures of diversity were among taxa at a global level for a grid cell size of just under 1 degrees.
   Results We showed that although the risk of extinction faced by freshwater decapods is quite similar to that of freshwater vertebrates, there is a distinct lack of spatial congruence in geographical range between different taxonomic groups at this spatial scale, and a lack of congruence among three commonly used metrics of biodiversity. The risk of extinction for freshwater species was consistently higher than for their terrestrial counterparts.
   Main conclusions We demonstrate that broad-scale patterns of species richness, threatened-species richness and endemism lack congruence among the six freshwater taxonomic groups examined. Invertebrate species are seldom taken into account in conservation planning. Our study suggests that both the metric of biodiversity and the identity of the taxa on which conservation decisions are based require careful consideration. As geographical range information becomes available for further sets of species, further testing will be warranted into the extent to which geographical variation in the richness of these six freshwater groups reflects broader patterns of biodiversity in fresh water.

AB  - Aim Conservation planning for migratory species requires knowing how populations are connected throughout the annual cycle. We measured migratory connectivity for five migratory songbird species by combining stable-hydrogen isotopes in feathers (delta H-2(F)) with citizen science data on breeding range abundance.
   Location Caribbean Basin and North America.
   Taxa Neotropical migratory birds: Mniotilta varia, Setophaga ruticilla, Seiurus aurocapilla, Setophaga americana, and Setophaga discolor.
   Methods We analyzed delta H-2(F) in feathers grown on North American breeding grounds and sampled at 20 Caribbean Basin sites across most of the non-breeding range of each species. We made Bayesian assignments to breeding origin by combining delta H-2(F) values and North American Breeding Bird Survey abundance data. For each species, we used cluster analysis to group Caribbean sites into non-breeding regions that shared birds with similar breeding ground assignment probabilities. We then mapped assignment probabilities for the non-breeding regions of each species onto breeding ground delta H-2(F) surfaces and estimated the strength of migratory connectivity.
   Results Apart from some general similarities, the five species demonstrated different patterns of migratory connectivity. Species with larger non-breeding ranges exhibited stronger migratory connectivity compared to those with smaller non-breeding ranges. Despite geographical overlap, birds from each non-breeding region had mostly unique breeding ground origins.
   Main conclusions The contrasting patterns of migratory connectivity shown by the five species suggest that geographic distribution during the non-breeding period is a poor indicator of breeding ground origin. Our results indicate that full annual cycle conservation planning, which requires migratory connectivity information, should proceed on a species-specific basis.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and loss is the main cause of species extinction; thus, the appropriate placement of protected areas is critical for saving vulnerable and threatened species. However, how to expand the existing protected areas network for improving conservation efficiency is a vital concern. We examined the Qinling Mountains a widely recognized biogeographic treasure in China and East Asia, to identify key biodiversity areas (KBAs) and compare them with existing protected areas. We focused on 259 key protected wild plant and animal species and modeled species distributions with elevation and habitat preference. We then adapted two established algorithms (biodiversity hotspots of species richness [BHSR] and systematic conservation planning [SCP]) to identify priority areas, respectively. Results from these two algorithms addressed two conservation criteria: "represented" single species and "well-represented" species assemblages. SCP showed better performance (similar to 90%) than BHSR (similar to 78%) using the "represented" criterion covering a small portion (similar to 8%) of the total region; conversely, BHSR showed better performance (similar to 61%) than SCP (similar to 55%) using the "well-represented" criterion. The overlapping priority areas of both methods could achieve an optimal conservation that met dual criteria, which is considered as the candidate KBAs in this study. Surprisingly, we found that 63% of KBAs are not co-occurring with existing national nature reserves (NNRs). We highlight the unoccupied KBAs as deserving additional protection, with a result that the expansion of NNRs to KBAs will increase overall conservation coverage and efficiency. The integrated method developed here can be used generally as a repeatable and quantitative assessment framework to be implemented in protected areas network expansion and planning, in China and beyond.

AB  - Management of the marine environment is often hampered by a lack of comprehensive spatial information on the distribution of diversity and the bio-physical processes structuring regional ecosystems. This is particularly true in temperate reef systems beyond depths easily accessible to divers. Yet these systems harbor a diversity of sessile life that provide essential ecosystem services, sustain fisheries and, as with shallower ecosystems, are also increasingly vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts and environmental change. Here we use cutting-edge tools (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and ship-borne acoustics) and analytical approaches (predictive modelling) to quantify and map these highly productive ecosystems. We find the occurrence of key temperate-reef biota can be explained and predicted using standard (depth) and novel (texture) surrogates derived from multibeam acoustic data, and geographic surrogates. This suggests that combinations of fine-scale processes, such as light limitation and habitat complexity, and broad-scale processes, such as regional currents and exposure regimes, are important in structuring these diverse deep-reef communities. While some dominant habitat forming biota, including canopy algae, were widely distributed, others, including gorgonians and sea whips, exhibited patchy and restricted distributions across the reef system. In addition to providing the first quantitative and full coverage maps of reef diversity for this area, our modelling revealed that offshore reefs represented a regional diversity hotspot that is of high ecological and conservation value. Regional reef systems should not, therefore, be considered homogenous units in conservation planning and management. Full-coverage maps of the predicted distribution of biota (and associated uncertainty) are likely to be increasingly valuable, not only for conservation planning, but in the ongoing management and monitoring of these less-accessible ecosystems.

AB  - Questions Effective conservation planning of wetlands requires an understanding of the drivers of wetland diversity at different spatial scales. This study addresses the question: which environmental variables are most responsible for the turnover of wetland plant diversity at various spatial scales (beta and gamma diversity)? Additionally, how does alpha diversity, which expresses the diversity on a local level, compare between different wetland habitats? Location South Africa and Lesotho. Methods Variation in wetland vegetation along environmental gradients was studied using an existing data set consisting of 1,113 vegetation plots. Plant species composition was analyzed at three spatial scales using gradient analysis. Scale 1 represents a broad geographic scale, Scale 2 represents variation within a single catchment and Scale 3 represents variation within a single wetland. Shannon's Diversity and Evenness as proxies of alpha diversity were determined for five categories of wetland habitats. Results The most important factors at the geographic scale were latitude, base level of the catchment, temperature, climate and underlying parent material. At the catchment scale, altitude, hydrogeomorphic type and topographic location were the most influential factors, while soil texture, sodium content, organic carbon content, wetness and electric conductivity played a major role at the wetland scale. At the national level, the most important spatial scale was the geographic scale, the second was the catchment and the third was the wetland scale. Although there was a wide range of variation in Shannon's Diversity Index between the different wetland habitats, the differences were significant for all categories. Conclusions The results show that factors that play a major role in influencing plant diversity in wetlands are scale-dependent. This indicates the importance of considering all three spatial scales in the conservation planning of wetlands in southern Africa, especially given the many different threats that wetlands face, including climate change.

AB  - Stemming biodiversity loss requires strategic conservation guided by well articulated targets, whether they be proactive (e.g., protect biodiverse areas) or reactive (e.g., protect threatened species). Both types of targets can be effective, but there are trade-offs, especially for broadly distributed taxa such as migratory species, a group for which conservation has been challenged by limited knowledge of distributions throughout the annual cycle. We combined spatiotemporal distribution models with population trend data to first examine focal areas for the conservation of Neotropical migratory birds (n = 112 species) during the non-breeding period in the Western Hemisphere, based on a proactive approach (highest diversity) versus a reactive approach (strongest declines). For focal areas, we then assessed the extent of recent anthropogenic impact, protected area status, and projected changes in land cover using shared socioeconomic pathways. Spatial priorities for high diversity emphasized southern Mexico and northern Central America, and were strikingly different from areas with species in stronger decline, emphasizing the Andean cordilleras. Only 1.4% of the non-breeding region met targets for diversity and decline, mostly in southern Central America. Areas prioritized to conserve high species diversity have experienced less recent anthropogenic impact than areas prioritized for species in decline but are predicted to experience more rapid land conversion to less suitable agricultural landscapes in the next three decades. Our findings indicate how efficient conservation efforts will depend on the careful consideration of desired targets combined with reliable predictions about the locations and types of land cover change under alternative socioeconomic futures.

AB  - The Near Threatened white rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum went extinct in Botswana during the 20th century because of poaching. Several attempts have been made to reintroduce the species. From 2001 to 2003 four batches (a total of 32 individuals) of white rhinos were released in the Moremi Game Reserve. All were fitted with transmitters, ear notched and monitored on a regular basis. Rhinos released in the last batch moved significantly further from the release site compared to early batches. Six female rhinos from the last batch dispersed out of the Reserve. Activity area (95% minimum convex polygon; MCP) sizes decreased with years after release and increasing density of rhinos but only density had an effect on the core area (50% MCP) sizes. We conclude that the number of rhinos present in the area of release should be carefully considered before further individuals are released. When released in an area with rhinos that have established territories, the newly reintroduced individuals may be forced to disperse. If other areas of suitable habitat are available elsewhere in the same protected area, animals should be released at different sites to avoid unwanted long-term dispersal and to use the inverse density-dependent activity area sizes to maximize the rhino population in an area.

AB  - Estimates of extinction risk for Amazonian plant and animal species are rare and not often incorporated into land-use policy and conservation planning. We overlay spatial distribution models with historical and projected deforestation to show that at least 36% and up to 57% of all Amazonian tree species are likely to qualify as globally threatened under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria. If confirmed, these results would increase the number of threatened plant species on Earth by 22%. We show that the trends observed in Amazonia apply to trees throughout the tropics, and we predict thatmost of the world's >40,000 tropical tree species now qualify as globally threatened. A gap analysis suggests that existing Amazonian protected areas and indigenous territories will protect viable populations of most threatened species if these areas suffer no further degradation, highlighting the key roles that protected areas, indigenous peoples, and improved governance can play in preventing large-scale extinctions in the tropics in this century.

AB  - To prioritise conservation actions and management strategies for threatened forest deer species at the Atlantic forest, we aimed to identify and describe the most suitable habitat areas for forest deer species and to indicate conservation measures for state agents and local communities. We adopt an approach based on ecological niche modelling, key variable thresholds and spatial analyses. In addition, we associated our approach with a human influence index, an invasive species dataset of occurrences, protected area cover and IUCN category. We indicate 2 % (484 km2) of the Atlantic forest cover as conservation priority areas (CPAs). Of these, 56.8 % are outside protected areas, 20.7 % are inside IUCN categories i, ii and iii protected areas, 19.9 % are inside IUCN categories iv, v, and vi protected areas, and 2.6 % are inside indigenous areas. Also, we indicate the most relevant protected areas for deer conservation in the Atlantic forest. The CPAs were classified into more human-influenced areas (MHIA) and less human-influenced areas (LHIA), and we identified 21 significant (greater than120 km2) continuous CPAs outside protected areas. We highlight actions in several perspectives of human influence, governance levels and law protection that would rationalise the use of funds and human resources.

AB  - The Craugastor podiciferus complex is a group of phenotypically polymorphic direct-developing frogs that inhabit the Talamancan highlands of Costa Rica and Panama. The montane distribution of this group creates natural allopatry among members and offers an excellent opportunity to explore geographic models of speciation. Using a multilocus approach, we obtained data from one nuclear (c-myc) and three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, and COI) gene regions from 40 individuals within the C. podiciferus complex. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed a basal split that placed samples from western Panama as sister to Costa Rican (CR) samples, corroborating a previous suggestion that the former lineage may represent an undescribed species. Within the CR clades we found six distinct haplogroups whose distributions largely corresponded to geographic features and included instances of sympatry. Divergence estimates were used to develop a preliminary evolutionary timeframe for the diversification of the C. podiciferus complex. Based on collective evidence, we hypothesize that movement of the CR haplogroups has occurred between currently isolated areas of suitable habitat via second order climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene. The levels of genetic differentiation within the C. podiciferus complex are remarkable given the relatively small geographic area (ca. 8000 km(2)) of occurrence. This diversity emphasizes the need for further study and taxonomic revision to aid in conservation planning for this complex which, like many amphibians, has experienced recent population declines.

AB  - Brazilian Atlantic Forest is recognized as a hottest hotspot of biodiversity, and plant endemism is a key criterion used to this definition. In this biome, although geographic range of most plant species is unknown, it is possible to define limits of vegetation types. Here we performed a reserve selection analysis using vegetation types for Brazilian Atlantic Forest, more specifically in Rio de Janeiro State. The area of 19 vegetation types was calculated in each of the 5 km x 5 cells km superimposed to the Rio de Janeiro State. The representation targets established in the reserve selection procedure was 30% of the total area for more common vegetation types, and a higher target was established for rare vegetation types. The final network that represents all the targets for vegetation types with the smaller possible number of cells contains 351 cells. Many cells selected are coincident with current strictly protected areas, but this study shows the urgency to increase the number of protected areas mainly in the North and Northeast regions of Rio de Janeiro State. Twenty three cells are coincident with priority areas indicated to be created as strictly use reserves by a government agency. However, there are several important cells selected in our analysis that are not covered by the actual strictly reserves system. Four vegetation types are not represented in the current strict use reserve system. Further analyses based on vegetation could be blended with scattered data of species geographic distribution to obtain more comprehensive results and strategies.

AB  - Understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes that have shaped current patterns of biodiversity is crucial in the planning and implementation of broad scale conservation management. The temporal and spatial pattern of diversity across a landscape can help identify areas that have acted as climatically stable refugia historically, or do so currently. This has important implications for conservation efforts that try to maximise the evolutionary potential of species, as well as maintaining existing biodiversity. Northern Australia has recently reported catastrophic species decline, particularly in mammals, due to a series of threats. Here we apply an integrative approach utilising molecular analyses and spatial modelling to determine whether disjunct populations of a potentially rare, endemic mammal, the scaly-tailed possum (Wyulda squamicaudata) exhibit differentiation associated with biogeographic barriers or a recent decline. Significant but low genetic differentiation between the east and west Kimberley populations was detected. Principal component analyses indicate potential climatic niche differences that could support recent localised adaptations. Climatic reconstructions back to the last glacial maximum (LGM) indicate areas of suitable habitat have substantially shifted through time for W. squamicaudata and suggest multiple areas of refugia across the Kimberley since the LGM. Further comparative research is required to establish a biogeographical framework that will assist in our understanding of processes that have shaped biodiversity in northern Australia and assist in conservation planning.

AB  - Assessing a species' threatened status and then developing specific conservation strategies accordingly rely heavily on knowing that species' complete and accurate spatial distribution. In this study, we used the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) in China to represent a large threatened species for which distribution information is limited and spatially biased. We grouped the two main sources of black bear occurrence data into two different resolutions: (1) coarse resolution data corresponding specific management units (e.g., nature reserves) that cover large areas, and (2) fine resolution data composed of longitude and latitude records that were bias in their geographic range. Our distribution mapping approach integrated those two data types to examine black bear spatial patterns across the country. We used both presence and absence data in the Random Forest algorithm to predict black bear distribution at coarse (30 km) and fine (3 km) resolutions, and then refined the coarse-scale prediction with the fine-scale prediction using a map fusion technique based on the Bayes theorem. We thus generated an integrated high resolution range map that was both more accurate than the coarse-scale map and more representative of the black bear geographic range than was the fine-scale map. Our results showed that the total estimated range of Asiatic black bears in China was 462.3 x 10(3) km(2), 77.50% less than the most recent IUCN range map and 70.90% less than the area of habitat (AOH) estimation. Using those results, we identified two island and six mainland management units in China and, based on the predicted habitat conditions, proposed specific conservation strategies for each unit. Our study results provide practical knowledge and pragmatic guidance for future conservation planning and action for this species, and our framework provides an example and template for range estimations of species with similar types of occurrence records.

AB  - Aim Crop wild relatives (CWR) are an essential source of genetic material for the improvement of certain traits in related crop species. Despite their importance, increasing public, scientific and political support, large gaps exist in the amount of genetic material collected and conserved of many CWR. Here, we construct a dataset on the distribution of wild banana species (Musa spp.) and assess their risk and conservation status. We deal with the following questions: (a) What areas are potentially suitable for wild banana species? (b) How much of the wild banana diversity is currently at risk or insufficiently conserved ex and in situ?
   Location Native distribution area of wild banana species, ranging from the north-eastern states of India to north-eastern Australia.
   Methods We assessed the potential environmental range of wild species using a species distribution modelling approach with MaxEnt. Extinction risk was evaluated following IUCN criterion B, and the ex and in situ conservation status was assessed using an indicator for biodiversity and sustainable development targets.
   Results We found that 11 out of 59 assessed species can be considered as vulnerable and nine as endangered. Highest species richness was found along the border of south China and northern Vietnam, in the north-eastern states of India and on the Malayan peninsula. Our distribution modelling approach indicates that the northern Indo-Burmese region has the highest environmental suitability for most wild banana species and that lowland rain forests in general are highly suitable for bananas. Assessment of in and ex situ conservation status indicates that 56 out of 59 assessed species are currently insufficiently conserved ex situ and that 49 are of high priority for further conservation. Additional in situ conservation is of high priority for six species and of medium priority for 40 species.
   Main conclusions To date, little of the banana CWR are sufficiently conserved both in and ex situ.

AB  - Modelling the spatial distribution of multi-habitat species is challenging since they show multi-dimensional environmental responses that may vary sharply through habitats. Hence, for these species, the achievement of realistic models useful in conservation planning may depend on the appropriate consideration of habitat information in model calibration. We aimed to evaluate the role of different types of habitat predictors, along with habitat-partitioning, to improve model inference, detect non-stationary responses across habitats and simulate the impact of sampling bias on spatial predictions. As a case study, we modelled the occurrence of the multi-habitat plant species bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) in the Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain), where it represents a basic trophic resource for threatened brown bear and capercaillie. We used MaxEnt to compare a baseline model approach calibrated with topo-climatic variables against three alternative approaches using explicit habitat information based on vegetation maps and remote sensing data. For each approach, we ran non-partitioned (all habitats together) and habitat-partitioned models (one per habitat) and evaluated model performance, overfitting and extrapolation. The highest performance was for habitat-partitioned models including habitat predictors. The lowest overfitting was for the baseline non-partitioned model, at the cost of achieving the highest predicted fractional area. The extrapolation success of habitat-partitioned models was low, with the highest performance for the baseline approach. Our results highlight that multi-habitat species responses are non-stationary across habitats, with habitat-biased data resulting in weak spatial predictions. When modelling the distribution of multi-habitat species at regional scale, we recommend using habitat-partitioned models including habitat predictors, either vegetation maps or remote sensing data, to improve the realism of spatial outputs and its applicability in regional conservation planning.

AB  - Like other Mediterranean regions, south-western Australia is predicted to experience an increase in temperature and drought conditions as a result of climate change, leading to altered species distributions. This study provides the first assessment of the effectiveness of the reserve system in Australia for conserving native freshwater fish by considering the congruence between protected areas and potential climate refugia in a global biodiversity hotspot. Using species distribution modelling, exposure to climate change was predicted for 13 native fish taxa, and priority areas (refugia) for fish conservation were identified by overlapping the present and future suitable climate envelopes of these taxa. Areas with climate refugia for >70% of the native freshwater fish fauna were recognized as 'coldspots'. Two taxa were predicted to lose all suitable climate in the region by 2080, and five other taxa were predicted to lose >80% of their area of suitable climate. A 'coldspot' was identified consisting of a core area where >80% of taxa were predicted to persist and a larger surrounding area where >70% of taxa were predicted to persist. Although 93% of the core area of the coldspot is at present contained within the established protected areas network, only 26% of the surrounding area is contained within reserve boundaries. Future conservation actions, including the design and implementation of the protected area network, should take this coldspot into consideration.

AB  - Climate change is altering the distribution of marine species around the globe, including those providing critical 3-dimensional structure in important coastal habitats. We analysed how continued warming over the 21st century would affect the distribution of eelgrass Zostera marina, the dominant seagrass in the Northwest Atlantic and provider of essential ecosystem functions and services. We compiled presence-only occurrence records and built a species distribution model using Maxent to determine a present-day distribution, which was compared to physiological thresholds for eelgrass growth and reproduction. Present-day models were then projected to mid- (2040-2050) and end-century (2090-2100) using 2 contrasting emissions scenarios and different global climate models. Our projections suggest an average shift of the southern range limit by 1.41 degrees N to the north under a strong mitigation scenario (RCP 2.6) and 6.48 degrees N under a business-as-usual emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) by 2100, resulting in substantial loss of eelgrass habitat along the eastern coast of the USA. The northern edge shift was less certain, yet resulted in an expansion of total eelgrass habitat. To minimize the extent of eelgrass bed extinction and areas of reduced growth along the southern range, strong climate mitigation is critical. Moreover, warm-temperature stress in reduced-growth areas will greatly increase the susceptibility of eelgrass to other natural or anthropogenic stressors. Our results can inform coastal management and conservation planning to protect the essential structure, functions and services provided by eelgrass in a warming climate.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is one of the most studied topics in ecology but our knowledge is still limited particularly concerning matrix effects on species distribution in a human-dominated landscape. We tested the ability of random sampling hypothesis, colonization-extinction dynamics and matrix-related concepts to explain the variation in species richness, total bird density and community composition in old-forest bird assemblages in two contrasting landscapes. We collected data on breeding bird abundances from 66 old-growth forest reserves in NE Finland and six larger areas in adjacent Russian Karelia using the line transect method. In Finland, protected old-forest patches are embedded in a matrix dominated by young regeneration stands. In Russia, study areas were situated in continuous, old forest dominated landscapes. Bird assemblages in old-forest patches embedded in human-modified matrix in Finland were not random samples from Russian bird assemblages. In the Finnish assemblages, species richness was lower and total bird density higher. Species richness declined with increasing distance (isolation) to Russia. Bird assemblages in large forest reserves in Finland close to Russia were structurally more similar to assemblages in the continuous reference landscape than those in small and more distant reserves. The results support the idea that several mechanisms related to colonisation-extinction dynamics and to matrix resource availability influence species distribution in fragmented landscapes but in species-specific ways. We conclude that even though small and isolated protected areas may foster high relative bird species density their ecological integrity is compromised, and therefore, improving matrix quality around reserves may lead to considerable conservation benefits.

AB  - To determine the influence of nonclimatic factors on predicting the habitats of tree species and an assessment of climate change impacts over a broad geographical extent at about 1 km resolution, we investigated the predictive performance for models with climatic factors only (C-models) and models with climatic and nonclimatic factors (CN-models) using seven tree species in Japan that exhibit different ecological characteristics such as habitat preference and successional traits. Using a generalized additive model, the prediction performance was compared by prediction accuracy [area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC)], goodness of fit, and potential habitat maps. The results showed that the CN-models had higher predictive accuracy, higher goodness of fit, smaller empty habitats, and more finely defined borders of potential habitat than those of the C-models for all seven species. The degree of the total contribution of the nonclimatic variables to prediction performance also varied among the seven species. These results suggest that nonclimatic factors also play an important role in predicting species occurrence when measured to this extent and resolution, that the magnitude of model improvement is larger for species with specific habitat preferences, and that the C-models cannot predict the land-related habitats that exist for almost all species. Climate change impacts were overestimated by C-models for all species. Therefore, C-model outcomes may lead to locally ambiguous assessment of the impact of climate change on species distribution. CN-models provide a more accurate and detailed assessment for conservation planning.

AB  - Modelling dolphin distribution is key for understanding their ecology and for their conservation and management. Information on the distribution and preferred habitats of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins Tursiops sp. is lacking, particularly in metropolitan areas where the species is under threat from anthropogenic activities. Here, we used boat-based surveys and an ensemble modelling approach that combined results from 6 modelling techniques (generalised additive models, generalised boosted models, classification tree analysis, flexible discriminant analysis, random forest and maximum entropy) to identify areas of high probability of southern Australian bottlenose dolphin occurrence along the metropolitan coast of Adelaide, South Australia. We used kernel density estimation to identify core and representative areas according to behaviour and investigated the importance and potential ecological function of areas of high dolphin occurrence. The ensemble predictions of dolphin distribution performed better than the corresponding single models. Results indicate that depth, benthic habitat type and slope influenced dolphin occurrence along Adelaide's coast. Dolphins favoured shallow nearshore areas and temperate reefs in summer, shallow nearshore areas in autumn and deep waters further offshore in winter. In comparison to other observed behaviours, core feeding areas overlapped considerably with areas of high probability of dolphin occurrence. Thus, we suggest that prey availability is an important driver influencing the seasonal variation in dolphin distribution along Adelaide's metropolitan coast. Our predictions identify priority areas for dolphin conservation and for the implementation of boating and fishing regulations. Continued monitoring is needed to assess potential changes in preferred habitat under increasing anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Climate change has become an important cause of the loss of bird habitat and changes in bird migration and reproduction. The lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythropus) has a wide range of migratory habits and is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List. In this study, the distribution of suitable breeding grounds for the lesser white-fronted goose was assessed in Siberia, Russia, using a combination of satellite tracking and climate change data. The characteristics of the distribution of suitable breeding sites under different climate scenarios in the future were predicted using the Maxent model, and protection gaps were assessed. The analysis showed that under the background of future climate change, temperature and precipitation will be the main climatic factors affecting the distribution of breeding grounds, and the area associated with suitable breeding habitats will present a decreasing trend. Areas listed as an optimal habitat only accounted for 3.22% of the protected distribution; however, 1,029,386.341 km(2) of optimal habitat was observed outside the protected area. Obtaining species distribution data is important for developing habitat protection in remote areas. The results presented here can provide a basis for developing species-specific habitat management strategies and indicate that additional attention should be focused on protecting open spaces.

AB  - Climate change is acting to reallocate biomes, shift the distribution of species, and alter community assemblages in Alaska. Predictions regarding how these changes will affect the biodiversity and interspecific relationships of small mammals are necessary to pro-actively inform conservation planning. We used a set of online occurrence records and machine learning methods to create bioclimatic envelope models for 17 species of small mammals (rodents and shrews) across Alaska. Models formed the basis for sets of species-specific distribution maps for 2010 and were projected forward using the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) A2 scenario to predict distributions of the same species for 2100. We found that distributions of cold-climate, northern, and interior small mammal species experienced large decreases in area while shifting northward, upward in elevation, and inland across the state. In contrast, many southern and continental species expanded throughout Alaska, and also moved down-slope and toward the coast. Statewide community assemblages remained constant for 15 of the 17 species, but distributional shifts resulted in novel species assemblages in several regions. Overall biodiversity patterns were similar for both time frames, but followed general species distribution movement trends. Biodiversity losses occurred in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and Seward Peninsula while the Beaufort Coastal Plain and western Brooks Range experienced modest gains in species richness as distributions shifted to form novel assemblages. Quantitative species distribution and biodiversity change projections should help land managers to develop adaptive strategies for conserving dispersal corridors, small mammal biodiversity, and ecosystem functionality into the future.

AB  - Human induced land-use change in the form of urbanization and agriculture are rapidly transforming our planet's terrestrial landscapes and causing the loss of species at unprecedented rates. Studies documenting the impacts of development are extensive; however, less is known about the scale at which species respond to development and specific features of altered landscapes that make them vulnerable. This shortcoming may be due to the difficulty of collecting data across large spatial extents, but filling these information gaps are critical, particularly for species that have a disproportionate influence on ecosystems, such as ecosystem engineers. One such species, the southeastern pocket gopher (Geomys pinetis), has been declining throughout its range (south-eastern United States) and continued loss will likely have strong effects on the imperiled longleaf pine ecosystem in which it is closely associated. Using range-wide data from presence-absence surveys and publicly available presence-only data, we used recent advances in species distribution modeling to understand this ecosystem engineer's associations with extensive land use and cover changes. Our study showed that pocket gophers inhabit a variety of land-use types, including regions with low levels of anthropogenic development, but are largely absent from intensely urbanized areas and closed-canopy forests. Conservation planning to reduce the spread of extensive development and forest management strategies to reduce closed-canopy systems will be instrumental in reducing the decline of the species and ultimately protection of the longleaf pine ecosystem. The approach used in this study will be increasingly beneficial for understanding species response to land-use change.

AB  - The Earth is undergoing an accelerated rate of native ecosystem conversion and degradation and there is increased interest in measuring and modelling biodiversity from space. Biogeographers have a long-standing interest in measuring patterns of species occurrence and distributional movements and an interest in modelling species distributions and patterns of diversity. Much progress has been made in identifying plant species from space using high-resolution satellites (QuickBird, IKONOS), while the measurement of species movements has become commonplace with the ARGOS satellite tracking system which has been used to track the movements of thousands of individual animals. There have been significant advances in land-cover classifications by combining data from multi-passive and active sensors, and new classification techniques. Species distribution modelling has been growing at a striking rate and the incorporation of spaceborne data on climate, topography, land cover, and vegetation structure has great potential to improve models. There have been significant advances in modelling species richness, alpha diversity, and beta diversity using multisensors to quantify land-cover classifications and landscape metrics, measures of productivity, and measures of heterogeneity. Remote sensing of nature reserves can provide natural resources managers with near real-time data within and around reserves that can be used to support conservation efforts anywhere in the world. Future research should focus on incorporating recent spaceborne sensors, more extensive integration of available spaceborne imagery, and the collection and dissemination of high-quality field data. This will improve our understanding of the distribution of life on earth.

AB  - Aim This study aimed to predict the alpha and beta plant diversity of an arid mountain based on environmental variables derived from remotely sensed and ground truth data. Location Gebel Elba, Egypt. Methods Based on 133 vegetation plots of 100 m(2), we calculated alpha (Shannon index) and beta [the first ordination axis of nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS1)] plant diversity. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to map alpha and beta diversity based on various environmental variables derived from a digital elevation model, the SoilGrids dataset, and very high resolution PlanetScope satellite imagery. The predictive models for alpha and beta diversity were mapped within the northern slopes of Gebel Elba. An ANOVA post hoc test was used to compare Shannon index and NMDS1 values among plant communities. Results The selected models revealed the importance of altitude, landforms, solar insolation, catchment area, and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index for Shannon diversity and NMDS1. The GAMs explained 54.9% of Shannon diversity and 80.6% of NMDS1. The predicted diversity maps showed that the mountainous area was more diverse and substantially different from the open desert. The post-hoc test revealed a clear separation of mountain and desert vegetation. Conclusions Employing remotely sensed variables combined with ground truth data offers great opportunities for exploring spatial patterns of biodiversity. By mapping alpha and beta diversity, it was possible to determine the spatial distribution of plant diversity in Gebel Elba; the results highlighted the importance of the wadi systems and higher slopes of this mountain area. We expect our findings can be generalized to similar arid mountains in the region.

AB  - Nature-based tourism in protected areas is an easily experienced ecosystem service that humans enjoy, but it acts as tourism pressures on ecosystem. Some park managers, however, lack an understanding of the spatial distribution and ecological impact of these pressures. We analyzed the size and spatial distribution of these pressures in Korean national parks, using visitor statistics and social big data. In addition, by overlay it with endangered species distribution data, we analyzed areas where tourism pressures and ecologically significant areas could be conflicted. The tourism pressure differed according to the individual protected areas' characteristics. Due to the unevenness of the magnitude and spatial distribution of pressures, the ecological impacts could be spatially differentiated. This study suggests that tourism pressure may be a decisive factor affecting protected areas' ecosystems with increased visitors. Using social big data, managers can establish spatially explicit management policies that consider tourism pressures on individual protected areas.

AB  - Extensive sampling (450 grabs) was performed all over the inner part of Puck Bay (105 km(2) area) in summers of 2007-2009. The GIS-based analysis of samples was performed to assess in detail the distribution of 32 benthic species. The minimum area of occurrence was less than 1 km(2) for Lekanosphaera rugicauda and the maximum was 83 km(2) for Cerastoderma glaucum. The material reveals that species with the pelagic larval stage were most widespread, with the least distance between individuals and the highest average density (e.g. Cerastoderma glaucum, Hydrobia ventrosa). The most isolated and the least dense species within the studied area were discretely mobile, non-larval crustaceans (e.g. Gammarus oceanicus and Lekanosphaera rugicauda), present at single sites with the largest distance from each other. We conclude that analysis of species distribution helps in understanding the threats to populations of marine invertebrates and marine spatial planning, through locating the isolated species and populations.

AB  - Empirical studies and habitat suitability modeling project significant shifts in species distributions in response to climate change. Because habitat fragmentation can impede species range shifts, wildlife corridors may have increasing importance in enhancing climate resilience for species persistence. While habitat connectivity has been studied for over four decades, the design of connectivity specifically to facilitate species movement in response to climate change is a relatively new challenge. We conducted a systematic review of 116 relevant papers from 1996-2017. Research focused on assessing the utility of habitat connectivity for climate change adaptation by species (N = 29) and modeling and mapping climate-wise connectivity for planning purposes (N = 55). Others addressed fundamental questions of connectivity related to climate adaptation (N = 31). Based on empirical data and computer simulations examining species range shifts in response to climate change at leading edges of current distributions; it is clear that large protected areas connected through linkages, and stepping stones embedded in a permeable matrix promote population persistence and facilitate range expansion. We identified 13 approaches to modeling climate-wise connectivity based on either focal species or landscape structure. When prioritizing areas for connectivity conservation, approaches include focusing on connecting areas of low climate velocity, refugia, climate analogs, or linking current to future suitable habitats. Riparian corridors should be considered in connectivity plans because of their importance as natural movement corridors, climate gradients, and refugia. Guidance is provided on selecting the best methods for connectivity design depending on the objectives, available data, and landscape context. Future research needs to evaluate the functionality of climate-wise connectivity models for facilitating range shifts and compare connectivity outcomes across modeling approaches.

AB  - The present study evaluated the relationship between estrogenic hormone concentrations (17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and 17 beta-estradiol) in surface waters in the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and environmental variables. Four sampling stations were monitored ranging from a protected area to streams discharging human effluent in and around Billings Reservoir. Four sampling campaigns were carried out in each seasonal period: dry and wet. Samples for hormone analysis (in ng L-1) were concentrated (1000x) using solid-phase extraction C-18 cartridges and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole mass spectrometry detection, with 100 ng L-1 limit of quantification. Water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids were determined in situ; total phosphorus and Sinapis alba bioassays were performed subsequently. Reservoir active capacity (AC) and precipitation were also obtained. Estrogenic hormone concentrations were always below limit of quantification at pristine site; at the other sampling stations, 17 beta-estradiol concentrations varied from below limit of quantification to 1720 ng L-1 and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol from below limit of quantification to 1200 ng L-1, with the highest concentrations found in the streams discharging into the reservoir. These streams showed higher Pearson's correlation between 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, total phosphorus, and electrical conductivity when compared with reservoir stations. Germination index and EC presented negative correlation (Pearson's r = - 0.61), denoting a phytotoxicity increase with EC increment. AC influenced the dilution of pollutants and showed negative correlations with total phosphorus (Pearson's r = -0.56). These results highlight the relevance of including streams in water-monitoring programs, since they are important pollutants loads into watersheds.

AB  - Range maps of thousands of species, compiled and made freely available by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, are being increasingly applied to support spatial conservation planning. However, their coarse nature makes them prone to commission and omission errors, and they lack information on the variations in abundance within species' distributions, calling into question their value to inform decisions at the fine scales at which conservation often takes place. Here, we tested if species ranges can reliably be used to estimate the responsibility of sites for the global conservation of species. We defined specific responsibility' as the fraction of a species' population within a given site, considering it useful for prioritising species within sites; and defined overall responsibility' as the sum of specific responsibility across species within a site, assuming it informative of priorities among sites. Taking advantage of an exceptionally detailed dataset on the distribution and abundance of bird species at a near-continental scale - a level of information rarely available to local decision-makers - we created a benchmark against which we tested estimates of responsibility derived from range maps. We investigated approaches for improving these estimates by complementing range maps with plausibly available local data. We found that despite their coarse nature, range maps provided good estimates of sites' overall responsibility, but relatively poor estimates of specific responsibility. Estimates were improved by combining range maps with local species lists or local abundance data, easily available through local surveys on the sites of interest, or simulated expert knowledge. Our results suggest that combining range maps with local data is a promising route for improving the effectiveness of local conservation decisions at contributing to reducing global biodiversity losses. This is all the more urgent in hyper-diverse poorly-known regions where conservation-relevant decisions must proceed despite a paucity of biodiversity data.

AB  - Disturbance has been considered essential for maintaining biodiversity in temperate grassy ecosystems in Australia. This has been particularly well demonstrated for inter-tussock plant species in C-4 Themeda-dominated grasslands in mesic environments. Disturbance is also thought crucial to maintain the structure of preferred habitat for some animals. Relationships between disturbance and diversity may be contingent on ecosystem productivity, but little is known about the generality of the disturbance-promoting-diversity paradigm across the range of temperate grasslands. To date, the disturbance-promoting-diversity paradigm has taken a univariate approach to the drivers of biodiversity; rainfall is seen as a key driver of productivity, which then drives diversity, mediated by disturbance. We argue that this framework is too simplistic as biodiversity drivers are multivariate. We suggest that the accumulation of phytomass (live and dead plant material) is an important determinant of diversity in grassy ecosystems and that phytomass accumulation is governed by multiple drivers (of which disturbance is just one). For fauna, it is structure - not biomass - that determines habitat suitability, and this can be moderated by both abiotic and biotic drivers. The assumption that there is a consistent effect of disturbance on diversity through the range of temperate grassland settings in southern Australia ignores the likelihood that biodiversity also responds to other factors such as spatial heterogeneity in the environment, resource availability and climatic variation. We developed a conceptual model of the multivariate drivers of grassland diversity that explores mechanisms underpinning patterns of species richness. Despite four decades of research, it is clear that our understanding of the multivariate drivers of diversity across the range of temperate grasslands in Australia is still incomplete. Further research into the conditions under which disturbance is required to maintain biodiversity in grasslands is integral to conservation planning in these endangered systems.

AB  - In the conterminous United States, wolverines (Gulo gulo) occupy semi-isolated patches of high elevation subalpine habitats at naturally low densities. The long-term success of the wolverine metapopulation requires open space in valley bottoms that link the mountain ranges of the western US to facilitate dispersal. No previous analysis has used empirical data to determine the degree to which dispersing wolverines are sensitive, or not, to differences in habitat quality outside of areas suitable for a home range. This sensitivity is important because it influences conservation actions. Improving wolverine habitat connectivity models among mountain ranges will benefit future wolverine conservation aimed at maintaining gene flow among populations. To determine how to most accurately model wolverine habitat connectivity, we used a resource selection function to model habitat and then generated six circuit theory connectivity maps. Each connectivity map represented a degree of sensitivity to movement within low-quality habitats. We used three validation metrics to compare these different connectivity surfaces and determine which layer best approximated observed wolverine dispersal using relocation data. We found that a strong negative logistic exponential relationship between habitat quality and resistance best described observed wolverine dispersal (c = 8). This suggests that once outside of habitat suitable for a home range, wolverines are only moderately sensitive to changes in habitat quality. However, we found that there is still some lower threshold of dispersal habitat quality for wolverines, as dispersing wolverines follow lower-resistance pathways that connect high-quality habitat and do not move indiscriminately across the landscape. Our results highlight the need to disentangle dispersal data from home range data through validation using dispersal data. Our findings also indicate that the validation of connectivity metrics is an essential component of conservation planning to best support the persistence of species. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The Karst Areas in Southern China are known for their abundant plant diversity and high endemism, but confronted with unprecedented challenges in biodiversity conservation. To identify hotspots and evaluate conservation effectiveness and gaps of the areas we built an occurrence database containing 16,073 species with 344,179 distribution points. We identified plant diversity hotspots by employing the top 5% richness algorithm, complementary algorithm and spatial phylogenetics, and evaluated the conservation effectiveness and gaps of hotspots under current conservation network by consideration spatial distribution ranges of both. Then, we conducted correlation analysis of distribution patterns and predicted suitable habitat areas of threatened species. Hotspots identified in this study are of high value in conservation priority for 75 hotspot grid cells scattered in 9 periphery regions of the karst areas and harboured 78.70% species only with 5% area. Conservation effectiveness analysis indicated that there were 38, 27 and 48 hotspot grid cells protected by either national nature reserves (NNRs), provincial nature reserves (PNRs), or both. These protected cells contained 59.28%, 49.08% and 64.76% of all species, respectively. However, conservation gaps analysis showed that 37, 48 and 27 hotspot grid cells were located outside of the conservation networks of NNRs, PNRs, or both, as they contained only 65.63%, 70.98% and 59.53% of all species. Further analysis of the conservation status of different taxa showed a high proportion of regional endemic and threatened species shared by hotspots and conservation gaps, which may be due to high percentage of narrow-ranged species occurring in both. More attentions should be paid to strengthen conservation networks and create new conservation areas to address the apparent gaps. Targeted conservation planning should also focus on hotspot distribution patterns of specific plant taxa to address the mismatches of distribution patterns of different taxa as indicated by different algorithms. Other countermeasures, for example, dynamic monitoring and rearrangement of the conservation network, should be envisaged in the future. The current and future suitable habitat areas are mostly confined to the heartland of karst areas, while the identified hotspots of plant diversity are much more limited, and especially under climate change scenarios the karst biodiversity will face huge challenges.

AB  - Mapping habitat selection by threatened species provides critical information for conservation planning. For reintroduced populations, understanding habitat selection is also necessary to predict dispersal and inform selection of new reintroduction sites. Efforts to restore bison Bison bison to the boreal forest hinge on the persistence of geographically isolated populations that occupy diverse landscapes, and for many populations selected habitats are unknown. We used location data from GPS-collared bison to develop seasonal resource selection function (RSF) models and predictive maps for the reintroduced 'Nahanni' population. We accounted for variation in individual behaviour by calculating averaged population-level selection coefficients from individual RSFs, and we compared these results to a pooled RSF from all bison. Individual RSFs revealed variation in habitat selection that was not always captured by the pooled RSF, although there were some consistencies. Bison strongly selected forage-rich graminoid-dominated wetlands (fens) during winter, but less so in summer when there were potential tradeoffs with poor footing and biting flies. In summer, bison selected alternative sources of forage such as herbaceous, shrubby and fluvial habitats (i.e. riverine islands and gravel bars). The observed association with fluvial habitat may be an adaptation to low forage availability on this landscape. Bison also selected roads and anthropogenic clearings associated with resource development, demonstrating potential for human-wildlife conflict. Our predictive maps highlight areas of conservation interest, and should be considered in land use planning and environmental assessments. We demonstrate the value of foraging habitat for forest-dwelling bison, particularly in winter. Identifying forage-rich habitat patches, and connectivity between them, is important when considering sites for new reintroductions or expansion of existing populations. More broadly, our approach may be used to identify areas of high conservation interest, where resources do not allow extensive sample sizes of GPS-collared animals.

AB  - In the summer of 2019-2020, southern Australia experienced the largest fires on record, detrimentally impacting the habitat of native species, many of which were already threatened by past and current anthropogenic land use. A large-scale restoration effort to improve degraded species habitat would provide fire-affected species with the chance to recover and persist in burnt and unburnt habitat. To facilitate this, decision-makers require information on priority species needs for restoration intervention, the suite of potential restoration interventions, and the priority locations for applying these interventions. We prioritize actions in areas where restoration would most likely provide cost-effective benefits to priority species (defined by each species proportion of habitat burned, threat status, and vulnerability to fires), by integrating current and future species habitat suitability maps with spatially modelled costs of restoration interventions such as replanting, removing invasive species, and implementing ecologically appropriate fire management. We show that restoring the top similar to 69% (112 million hectares) of the study region (current and future distributions of priority species) accounts for, on average, 95% of current and future habitat for every priority species and costs similar to AUD$73 billion yr(-1) (AUD$650 hectare(-1) yr(-1)) annualized over 30 years. This effort would include restoration actions over 6 million hectares of fire-impacted habitat, costing similar to AUD$8.8 billion/year. Large scale restoration efforts are often costly but can have significant societal co-benefits beyond biodiversity conservation. We also show that up to 291 MtCO2 (similar to 150 Mt DM) of carbon could be sequestered by restoration efforts, resulting in approximately AUD$253 million yr(-1) in carbon market revenue if all carbon was remunerated. Our approach highlights the scale, costs, and benefits of targeted restoration activities both inside and outside of the immediate bushfire footprint over vast areas of different land tenures.

AB  - Predictive models are useful to support decision making, management and conservation planning. However, the performance of models varies across techniques and is affected by several factors including species prevalence (i.e. the occurrence rate of each species in the total samples). Here, we analysed and compared the performance of four common modelling techniques based on the species prevalence. The occurrence of macroinvertebrates collected at 63 sites along the Lower Mekong Basin was predicted using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Model performance was evaluated using Cohen's Kappa Statistic (Kappa), area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and error rate. We found a highly significant quadratic effect of species prevalence on the four modelling techniques' performance. Kappa and AUC were less depended on the species prevalence, making them a better measure. The best performance (Kappa and AUC) was reached when predicting species with an intermediate prevalence (e.g. 0.4-0.6). The four modelling techniques significantly yielded different performances (p < 0.01), of which ANN performed generally better when using the complete prevalence range (i.e. 0.0-1.0) and the lower prevalence range (i.e. <0.1). However, the four techniques similarly performed when predicting species with a higher prevalence range (i.e. >= 0.3). Our results provide useful insights into the application of modelling techniques in predicting species occurrence and how their performance varies for species with different prevalence ranges. We suggest that the selection of appropriate modelling techniques should carefully take into account the species prevalence, particularly in the case of rare and generalist species.

AB  - Complementarity analysis based on overlaying large numbers of species distribution maps is increasingly being employed by conservationists to determine conservation priorities. This method is used because of its efficiency in representing selected species in a minimal number of areas, thus maximizing the number of conserved species in relation to area, As such analyses are mostly based on coarse spatial scales, it is essential to test the efficiency and accuracy of these methods, and to develop supplementary analyses that allow us to translate the result into identification of conservation sites of a manageable size. Here we test the effectiveness of a coarse-scale (continent-wide) analysis using a more detailed (nation-Wide) logical inductive model based on point records. We find that, although there are differences in the effectiveness at these scales, most of the areas identified by the fine-scale data are nested within those identified by the coarse approach. We also find that areas identified as important for birds fit well within the current national focal areas for conservation in Uganda.

AB  - The impact of climate change on biodiversity is now evident, with the direct impacts of changing temperature and rainfall patterns and increases in the magnitude and frequency of extreme events on species distribution, populations, and overall ecosystem function being increasingly publicized. Changes in the climate system are also affecting human communities, and a range of human responses across terrestrial and marine realms have been witnessed, including altered agricultural activities, shifting fishing efforts, and human migration. Failing to account for the human responses to climate change is likely to compromise climate-smart conservation efforts. Here, we use a well-established conservation planning framework to show how integrating human responses to climate change into both species-and site-based vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans is possible. By explicitly taking into account human responses, conservation practitioners will improve their evaluation of species and ecosystem vulnerability, and will be better able to deliver win-wins for human-and biodiversity-focused climate adaptation.

AB  - Chioglossa lusitanica is a streamside salamander endemic to the northwestern corner of the Iberian Peninsula. In an extensive field survey we found the species to be widely distributed across northwestern Portugal. The distribution data were used to identify macroenvironmental parameters related to the presence of the species in Portugal, and to produce a descriptive distribution model for C. lusitanica. We modelled the species distribution based on five environmental parameters (precipitation, relief, July temperature, number of frost months and hardness of water) selected by logistic regression analysis. The model yielded a high score of correct classification (95%). Excluding parameters unavailable for Spain the model included four parameters (precipitation, relief, July temperature and altitude) and had a 93% correct classification score. Extrapolation of the model to Spain yielded a correct classification of 92% and served as a validation of the modelling technique in an independent area. The models indicate the existence of several potentially suitable areas outside the known distribution of the species, providing clues about the species historical biogeography. The models, through the identification of highly suitable and stable protection regions, may contribute to informed conservation planning.

AB  - The global distribution patterns of most vertebrate groups and several plant groups have been described and analyzed over the past few years, a development facilitated by the compilation of important databases. Similar efforts are needed for large insect groups that constitute the majority of global biodiversity. As a result of this lack of information, invertebrate taxa are often left out of both large-scale analyses of biodiversity patterns and large-scale efforts in conservation planning and prioritization. Here, we introduce the first comprehensive global database of ant species distributions, the Global Ant Biodiversity Informatics (GABI) database, based on the compilation of 1.72 million records extracted from over 8811 publications and 25 existing databases. We first present the main goals of the database, the methodology used to build the database, as well as its limitations and challenges. Then, we discuss how different fields of ant biology may benefit from utilizing this tool. Finally, we emphasize the importance of future participation of myrmecologists to improve the database and use it to identify and fill holes in our knowledge of ant biodiversity.

AB  - Tumih / Parepat (Combretocarpus-rotundatus Mig. Deneer) of the family Anisophylleaceae and Meranti (Shorea Belangerang, ShoreaTeysmanniana Dyer ex. Brandis) of Dipterocarpaceae are groups of species of vegetation that is modeled for the designation of its spread. Pioneer species are predicted as an indicator of ecosystem restoration succession of wet tropical peatland characteristic (unique) and very susceptible (fragile) in an endemic Sundaland hotspot. Projected climate change and conservation planning a topic of heated discussion, the analysis of alternative approaches and the development of a combination of search algorithm projection models within the fabric of the diffusion of the species to attain this through a geospatial information system technology. Model approach used to work out problems in research on this vegetation species level based machine learning is a method (hybrid), which is a combination of wavelet and neural network. Often the approach to field data into general use in the management of natural resources and biodiversity assessment. Expression of the hybrid models provides encouraging results, to decide the classification of the species Tumih / Parepat and Meranti through mapping of vegetation species that are backed up by the pattern of the spectral curve of the field spectrometer.

AB  - Global declines in biodiversity highlight the need to effectively monitor the density and distribution of threatened species. In recent years, molecular survey methods detecting DNA released by target-species into their environment (eDNA) have been rapidly on the rise. Despite providing new, cost-effective tools for conservation, eDNA-based methods are prone to errors. Best field and laboratory practices can mitigate some, but the risks of errors cannot be eliminated and need to be accounted for. Here, we synthesize recent advances in data processing tools that increase the reliability of interpretations drawn from eDNA data. We review advances in occupancy models to consider spatial data-structures and simultaneously assess rates of false positive and negative results. Further, we introduce process-based models and the integration of metabarcoding data as complementing approaches to increase the reliability of target-species assessments. These tools will be most effective when capitalizing on multi-source data sets collating eDNA with classical survey and citizen-science approaches, paving the way for more robust decision-making processes in conservation planning.

AB  - Background. International trade for luxury products, medicines, and tonics poses a threat to both terrestrial and marine wildlife. The demand for and consumption of gill plates (known as Peng Yu Sai, "Fish Gill of Mobulid Ray") from devil and manta rays (subfamily Mobulinae, collectively referred to as mobulids) poses a significant threat to these marine fishes because of their extremely low productivity. The demand for these gill plates has driven an international trade supplied by largely unmonitored and unregulated catches from target, and incidental fisheries around the world. Scientific research, conservation campaigns, and legal protections for devil rays have lagged behind those for manta rays despite similar threats across all mobufids.
   Methods. To investigate the difference in attention given to devil rays and manta rays, we examined trends in the scientific literature and updated species distribution maps for all mobufids. Using available information on target and incidental fisheries, and gathering information on fishing and trade regulations (at international, national, and territorial levels), we examined how threats and protective measures overlap with species distribution. We then used a species conservation planning approach to develop the Global Devil and Manta Ray Conservation Strategy, specifying a vision, goals, objectives, and actions to advance the knowledge and protection of both devil and manta rays.
   Results and Discussion. Our literature review revealed that there had been nearly 2.5-times more "manta"-titled publications, than "mobula" or "devil ray"-titled publications over the Past 4.5 years (January 2012 June 2016). The majority of these recent publications were reports on occurrence of mobulid species. These publications contributed to updated Area of Occupancy and Extent of Occurrence maps which showed expanded distributions for most mobulid species and overlap between the two genera. While several international protections have recently expanded to include all mobulids, there remains a greater number of national, state, and territory-level protections for manta rays compared to devil rays. We hypothesize that there are fewer scientific publications and regulatory protections for devil rays due primarily to perceptions of charisma that favour manta rays. We suggest that the well-established species conservation framework used here offers an objective solution to close this gap. To advance the goals of the conservation strategy we highlight opportunities for parity in protection and suggest solutions to help reduce target and by catch fisheries.

AB  - As a megadiverse country with a rapidly growing population, South Africa is experiencing a biodiversity crisis: natural habitats are being degraded and species are becoming threatened with extinction. In an era of big biodiversity data and limited conservation resources, conservation biologists are challenged to use such data for cost-effective conservation planning. However, while extensive, key genomic and distributional databases remain incomplete and contain biases. Here, we compiled data on the distribution of South Africa's > 10,000 endemic plant species, and used species distribution modelling to identify regions with climate suitable for supporting high diversity, but which have been poorly sampled. By comparing the match between projected species richness from climate to observed sampling effort, we identify priority areas and taxa for future biodiversity sampling. We reveal evidence for strong geographical and taxonomic sampling biases, indicating that we have still not fully captured the extraordinary diversity of South Africa's endemic flora. We suggest that these knowledge gaps contribute to the insufficient protection of plant biodiversity within the country-which reflect part of a broaderLeopoldean shortfallin conservation data.

AB  - AimCorrelative models that forecast extinction risk from climate change and invasion risks following species introductions, depend on the assumption that species' current distributions reflect their climate tolerances (climatic equilibrium'). This assumption has rarely been tested with independent distribution data, and studies that have done so have focused on species that are widespread or weedy in their native range. We use independent data to test climatic equilibrium for a broadly representative group of species, and ask whether there are any general indicators that can be used to identify when equilibrium occurs.
   LocationEurope and contiguous USA.
   MethodsWe contrasted the climate conditions occupied by 51 plant species in their native (European) and naturalized (USA) distributions by applying kernel smoothers to species' occurrence densities. We asked whether species had naturalized in climate conditions that differ from their native ranges, suggesting climatic disequilibrium in the native range, and whether characteristics of species' native distributions correspond with climatic equilibrium.
   ResultsA large proportion of species' naturalized distributions occurred outside the climatic conditions occupied in their native ranges: for 22 species, the majority of their naturalized ranges fell outside their native climate conditions. Our analyses revealed large areas in Europe that species do not occupy, but which match climatic conditions occupied in the USA, suggesting a high degree of climatic disequilibrium in the native range. Disequilibrium was most severe for species with native ranges that are small and occupy a narrow range of climatic conditions.
   Main conclusionsOur results demonstrate that the direct effects of climate on species distributions have been widely overestimated, and that previous large-scale validations of the equilibrium assumption using species' native and naturalized distributions are not generally applicable. Non-climatic range limitations are likely to be the norm, rather than the exception, and pose added risks for species under climate change.

AB  - Aim Bioclimatic envelope models (BEMs) for seven economically important tree species in Europe were independently validated using a hindcasting approach and fossil pollen records spanning the last 1000 years, including the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the 20th century (PRES). The aim was to determine the accuracy of combining BEMs and palaeoecological data to predict continental-scale changes in distribution, and the availability of fossil data to hindcast economically important species. Location Europe, 11 degrees W33 degrees E, 3372 degrees N. Methods Eight types of BEMs were implemented in this study, covering most state-of-the-art modelling techniques. Present and palaeoclimatic data were obtained from the atmosphereocean global circulation model ECHO-G. The last millennium was divided into three climatically distinct periods: the MWP (ad 9001300), the LIA (ad 16001850) and PRES (ad 19002000). Models were calibrated for each period and validated with climatic and pollen data from the remaining periods. Successfully validated models were projected onto a 1 degrees European grid. Results BEMs were successfully validated with independent data. The average area under the curve statistic showed strong model performance, indicating: (1) the strength of BEMs for modelling current and future distributions and, (2) the potential of fossil pollen records to undertake these approaches. European-scale 1 degrees- gridded maps of probability of occurrence largely agreed with observed 20th-century distributions for most taxa, allowing the construction of past modelled species distributions. Main conclusions Results suggest a high potential for BEMs to be used to model future species distributions, and highlight the importance of palaeoecological data to independently validate these models, taking into account the scales at which these data operate. Although valid, BEMs showed poorer performance with heavily managed species and/or those growing in heterogeneous terrain or with discontinuous distributions. The last millennium in Europe was characterized by an increase in woody crop species and a decline of forest species, suggesting increasing land use by humans.

AB  - We estimated the current location, quality, and connectivity of habitat for 50 species of breeding birds in four mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander, Nye, and Eureka Counties, Nevada) and projected the future location, quality, and connectivity of habitat for these species given different scenarios of climate-induced land-cover change. In the United States, such models are relevant to federally mandated management of wild animals by state-level agencies. We sampled birds during the breeding seasons of 2001-2009 with fixed-radius point counts. For each species, we used boosted regression trees to model incidence (proportion of years a location was surveyed in which the species was present) as a function of topography and current land cover and climate. To assess model fit, we calculated the proportion of binomial deviance explained. We used cross-validation to estimate the predictive accuracy of the models. We applied the conservation planning program Zonation to identify locations where incidences of multiple species were maximized through time given current land cover and two scenarios of land-cover change, expansion of pinyon-juniper woodland into sagebrush shrubsteppe and contraction of riparian woodland. Models based on a set of 13 covariates derived from remotely sensed data had some predictive capacity for 41 of 50 species. Model outputs suggested substantial changes in amount of habitat for many species following projected expansion of pinyon-juniper woodland, but less pronounced changes following projected contraction of riparian woodland. Zonation analyses indicated that the spatial distribution of the highest-quality habitat for the avian assemblage was relatively consistent through time under both scenarios. Breeding birds in the Great Basin commonly are grouped in management plans on the basis of their general association with land-cover classes such as pinyon-juniper woodland, sagebrush shrubsteppe, and riparian woodland. However, even within these groups, the environmental attributes that explained a high proportion of variation in species' incidences and the projected responses to different scenarios of land-cover change varied considerably among species.

AB  - Cactaceae (cacti), a New World plant family, is one of the most endangered groups of organisms on the planet. Conservation planning is uncertain as it is unclear whether climate and land-use change will positively or negatively impact global cactus diversity. On the one hand, a common perception is that future climates will be favourable to cacti as they have multiple adaptations and specialized physiologies and morphologies for increased heat and drought. On the other hand, the wide diversity of the more than 1,500 cactus species, many of which occur in more mesic and cooler ecosystems, questions the view that most cacti can tolerate warmer and drought conditions. Here we assess the hypothesis that cacti will benefit and expand in potential distribution in a warmer and more drought-prone world. We quantified exposure to climate change through range forecasts and associated diversity maps for 408 cactus species under three Representative Concentration Pathways (2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) for 2050 and 2070. Our analyses show that 60% of species will experience a reduction in favourable climate, with about a quarter of species exposed to environmental conditions outside of the current realized niche in over 25% of their current distribution. These results show low sensitivity to many uncertainties in forecasting, mostly deriving from dispersal ability and model complexity rather than climate scenarios. While current range size and the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List category were not statistically significant predictors of predicted future changes in suitable climate area, epiphytes had the greatest exposure to novel climates. Overall, the number of cactus species at risk is projected to increase sharply in the future, especially in current richness hotspots. Land-use change has previously been identified as the second-most-common driver of threat among cacti, affecting many of the similar to 31% of cacti that are currently threatened. Our results suggest that climate change will become a primary driver of cactus extinction risk with 60-90% of species assessed negatively impacted by climate change and/or other anthropogenic processes, depending on how these threat processes are distributed across cactus species.

AB  - The survival of an increasing number of species is threatened by climate change: 20%-30% of plants and animals seem to be at risk of range shift or extinction if global warming reaches levels projected to occur by the end of this century. Plant range shifts may determine whether animal species that rely on plant availability for food and shelter will be affected by new patterns of plant occupancy and availability. Brown bears in temperate forested habitats mostly forage on plants and it may be expected that climate change will affect the viability of the endangered populations of southern Europe. Here, we assess the potential impact of climate change on seven plants that represent the main food resources and shelter for the endangered population of brown bears in the Cantabrian Mountains (Spain). Our simulations suggest that the geographic range of these plants might be altered under future climate warming, with most bear resources reducing their range. As a consequence, this brown bear population is expected to decline drastically in the next 50 years. Range shifts of brown bear are also expected to displace individuals from mountainous areas towards more humanized ones, where we can expect an increase in conflicts and bear mortality rates. Additional negative effects might include: (a) a tendency to a more carnivorous diet, which would increase conflicts with cattle farmers; (b) limited fat storage before hibernation due to the reduction of oak forests; (c) increased intraspecific competition with other acorn consumers, that is, wild ungulates and free-ranging livestock; and (d) larger displacements between seasons to find main trophic resources. The magnitude of the changes projected by our models emphasizes that conservation practices focused only on bears may not be appropriate and thus we need more dynamic conservation planning aimed at reducing the impact of climate change in forested landscapes.

AB  - Aim Deforestation is rapidly altering Southeast Asian landscapes, resulting in some of the highest rates of habitat loss worldwide. Among the many species facing declines in this region, clouded leopards rank notably for their ambassadorial potential and capacity to act as powerful levers for broader forest conservation programmes. Thus, identifying core habitat and conservation opportunities are critical for curbing further Neofelis declines and extending umbrella protection for diverse forest biota similarly threatened by widespread habitat loss. Furthermore, a recent comprehensive habitat assessment of Sunda clouded leopards (N. diardi) highlights the lack of such information for the mainland species (N. nebulosa) and facilitates a comparative assessment. Location Southeast Asia. Methods Species-habitat relationships are scale-dependent, yet <5% of all recent habitat modelling papers apply robust approaches to optimize multivariate scale relationships. Using one of the largest camera trap datasets ever collected, we developed scale-optimized species distribution models for two con-generic carnivores, and quantitatively compared their habitat niches. Results We identified core habitat, connectivity corridors, and ranked remaining habitat patches for conservation prioritization. Closed-canopy forest was the strongest predictor, with similar to 25% lower Neofelis detections when forest cover declined from 100 to 65%. A strong, positive association with increasing precipitation suggests ongoing climate change as a growing threat along drier edges of the species' range. While deforestation and land use conversion were deleterious for both species, N. nebulosa was uniquely associated with shrublands and grasslands. We identified 800 km(2) as a minimum patch size for supporting clouded leopard conservation. Main conclusions We illustrate the utility of multi-scale modelling for identifying key habitat requirements, optimal scales of use and critical targets for guiding conservation prioritization. Curbing deforestation and development within remaining core habitat and dispersal corridors, particularly in Myanmar, Laos and Malaysia, is critical for supporting evolutionary potential of clouded leopards and conservation of associated forest biodiversity.

AB  - Given species inventories of all sites in a planning area, integer programming or heuristic algorithms can prioritize sites in terms of the site's complementary value, that is, the ability of the site to complement (add unrepresented species to) other sites prioritized for conservation. The utility of these procedures is limited because distributions of species are typically available only as coarse atlases or range maps, whereas conservation planners need to prioritize relatively small sites. If such coarse-resolution information can be used to identify small sites that efficiently represent species (i.e., downscaled), then such data can be useful for conservation planning. We develop and test a new type of surrogate for biodiversity, which we call downscaled complementarity. In this approach, complementarity values from large cells are downscaled to small cells, using statistical methods or simple map overlays. We illustrate our approach for birds in Spain by building models at coarse scale (50 x 50 km atlas of European birds, and global range maps of birds interpreted at the same 50 x 50 km grid size), using this model to predict complementary value for 10 x 10 km cells in Spain, and testing how well-prioritized cells represented bird distributions in an independent bird atlas of those 10 x 10 km cells. Downscaled complementarity was about 63-77% as effective as having full knowledge of the 10-km atlas data in its ability to improve on random selection of sites. Downscaled complementarity has relatively low data acquisition cost and meets representation goals well compared with other surrogates currently in use. Our study justifies additional tests to determine whether downscaled complementarity is an effective surrogate for other regions and taxa, and at spatial resolution finer than 10 9 10 km cells. Until such tests have been completed, we caution against assuming that any surrogate can reliably prioritize sites for species representation.

AB  - The spatial distribution and abundance of the seven most abundant species of echinoderms (Diadema mexicanum, Centrostephanus coronatus, Eucidaris thouarsii, Isostichopus fuscus, Pharia pyramidatus, Phataria unifascialis and Acanthaster ellisii) were evaluated in coral communities of Isla Isabel National Park (Mexico). Biological (corals and other benthic groups) and physical (rocks and boulders) structural elements of the habitat were evaluated to determine their relationship to these species. Our results show that species composition and abundance varied among sampling sites and between seasons. Also were obtained significant differences in the echinoderm assemblage among sites across seasons. Similar results were detected for the environmental variables related to benthic habitat structure. D. mexicanum, P. unifascialis, E. thouarsii and C. coronatus were the main contributors to the species abundance and distribution in Isla Isabel. Most echinoderm species were positively related to the coverage of different coral species, algae and various types of benthic organisms as well as to physical benthic variables. These outcomes suggest that the spatial distribution and abundance of these echinoderms are explained by the habitat structure, which should be used to design conservation and management strategies for coral communities.

AB  - The effectiveness of very high-resolution IKONOS multispectral satellite imagery for land cover/vegetation mapping in Pico da Vara Nature Reserve (S. Miguel Island, Archipelago of the Azores, Portugal) was assessed. A per-pixel supervised classification scheme was developed using two different datasets. The Dataset A included the IKONOS-2 ortho-rectified and atmospherically corrected Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) multispectral bands (4 bands in total). Besides the same spectral bands of Dataset A, Dataset B also included two additional GIS-based raster bands representing both 'Altitude' and 'Distance to water streams' layers, since these two environmental variables are strongly relevant for land cover/vegetation categories distribution in Pico da Vara Nature Reserve. Overall, most of the five supervised classification techniques applied (Support Vector Machine; Maximum Likelihood; K-Nearest Neighbor; Linear Discriminant Analysis; Probabilistic Neural Network) showed a strong agreement and a good accuracy. The best classification accuracy was obtained by applying the KNN classifier to Dataset B. Remote sensing by using very high-resolution IKONOS-2 multispectral imagery was confirmed as an effective method for land cover mapping in Pico da Vara Protected Area.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the trophic structure and nycthemeral variations in the diet of dominant fish species (Ariopsis felis, Bairdiella chrysoura, Micropogonias undulatus, Eucinostomus gula, Eucinostomus argenteus, Lagodon rhomboides and Sphoeroides testudineus) in Celestun Lagoon, a biosphere reserve located in the southern Gulf of Mexico, and influenced by freshwater seeps. A total of 1473 stomachs were analysed and nine trophic groups were recorded. BrayCurtis analyses with analyses of similarity (ANOSIM) statistical tests were used to determine two groups of feeding guilds: zoobenthivores and omnivores, with significant differences between time and habitat. The relationships between fish feeding habits, size class and environmental variables were investigated using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Most of the species showed a low niche breadth with high specialization towards amphipod consumption, with the exception of L. rhomboides (0.60), which indicated generalist feeding. This study in a protected area is an important source of information for drawing up conservation policies in relation to the management of aquatic resources, and will aid in the establishment of priority areas for conservation.

AB  - Using rainbow wrasse as a model species, we evaluate the impact of protection on the relationship between body size and: i) trophic position (TP), based on delta N-15; and ii) body condition (BC), based on weight-at-length. We found that the biomass of the rainbow wrasse, their predators and their competitors was higher inside the no-take marine protected area (NTA) than in the area open to fishing. The TP of rainbow wrasse was higher inside the NTA but the BC was lower. A domed relationship between TP and size was observed in both areas: the TP increased with size up to 12.6 cm total length, when all individuals shifted to terminal males, and then decreased. Although other confounding environmental variables may exist, the indirect effects of fishing on competition and predation risk are the most likely explanation for the changes in TP, BC and the ontogenetic dietary shift of the rainbow wrasse.

AB  - Habitat use of rodents is associated to environmental variables, species requirements and biological interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the macro and microhabitat use and spatial variation in the abundance of small wild rodents that inhabit Otamendi Natural Reserve, Argentina. We studied the rodent communities in 6 habitats: riparian forest, Celtis tala forest, lowland grassland, salt marsh and 2 highland grasslands. We captured a total of 153 individual of Scapteromys aquaticus, Akodon azarae, Oxymycterus rufus, Oligoryzomys flavescens, Deltamys kempi and O. nigripes, with a trapping effort of 3636 trap-nights. The species richness is maintained by the presence of different habitats that satisfy specific requirements from specialist and generalist species, using differentially the reserve and forming communities of different specific composition in each habitat. A differential macrohabitat use was observed by all species, and a certain level of selectivity at microhabitat scale was observed in individuals of 2 species. This study shows that the diversity of environments in the Otamendi Natural Reserve, which allows the maintenance of many wild species of small rodents; confirming the high ecological and conservational value of the reserves inside an urban region.

AB  - Predictive habitat mapping has shown great promise to improve the understanding of the spatial distribution and complexity of benthic habitats and is a valuable means to highlight species-environment relationships where field data are limited. Although spatial distribution models may represent an important step forward in science based ecosystem management, reliable predictions are hard to obtain in deep-sea environments, mainly owing to the usual paucity of high resolution maps in these settings. The aim of this study is to apply and test different spatial models to statistically predict the distribution of two Cold-Water Coral (CWC) species (Madrepora oculata, Dendrophyllia cornigera) in the Cap de Creus Canyon (NW Mediterranean), based on high-resolution swath-bathymetry (5 m resolution) and video observations through the manned submersible JAGO (IFM-GEOMAR). Several submarine canyons host CWC communities, as the environmental conditions tend to be particularly suitable for their settlement and development. Along the Cap de Creus Canyon, presence/absence of CWC was estimated in each 5 m resolution pixel based on video imagery. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), General Additive Model (GAM) and Random Forest were applied to represent non-linear species-environment relationships using terrain variables derived from multibeam bathymetry (slope, rugosity, aspect, backscatter). According to the models, CWC were most likely to be found on the steep walls of the southern flank which face the head and the thalweg of the canyon, aligning with the known CWC ecology acquired from previous studies. Outputs from the three models showed similar average performances in predicting CWC distribution from the available environmental variables. Slope and aspect for Madrepora oculata, and rugosity for Dendrophyllia cornigera drive their distribution, although in some cases the three models identified different variables controlling each species. To reduce differences and associated uncertainties between model outputs, 5 m resolution ensembles were produced for the two species. As a final step, an up-scaled 50 m resolution predictive map based on the fine scale ensembles is proposed as a valuable contribution for stakeholders, which need to manage large natural areas using objective and repeatable science-based approaches.

AB  - The general negative impact of forestry on wood-inhabiting fungal diversity is well recognized, yet the effect of forest naturalness is poorly disentangled among different fungal groups inhabiting dead wood of different tree species. We studied the relationship between forest naturalness, log characteristics and diversity of different fungal morpho-groups inhabiting large decaying logs of similar quality in spruce dominated boreal forests. We sampled all non-lichenized fruitbodies from birch, spruce, pine and aspen in 12 semi-natural forest sites of varying level of naturalness. The overall fungal community composition was mostly determined by host tree species. However, when assessing the relevance of the environmental variables separately for each tree species, the most important variable varied, naturalness being the most important explanatory variable for fungi inhabiting pine and aspen. More strikingly, the overall species richness increased as the forest naturalness increased, both at the site and log levels. At the site scale, the pattern was mostly driven by the discoid and pyrenoid morpho-groups inhabiting pine, whereas at the log scale, it was driven by pileate and resupinate morpho-groups inhabiting spruce. Although our study demonstrates that formerly managed protected forests serve as effective conservation areas for most wood-inhabiting fungal groups, it also shows that conservation planning and management should account for group- or host tree -specific responses.

AB  - Knowledge of species-environment associations is critical for the management of threatened amphibian populations facing habitat fragmentation and a restricted range. The Coastal Giant Salamander (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) is subject to habitat degradation from logging and human development and is classified as Threatened at its northern range limit in British Columbia, Canada. We examined habitat associations for D. tenebrosus in relation to relative abundance and presence/absence for 32 streams sampled across the approximately 100 km(2) range of the species in British Columbia. Of 12 environmental variables we measured at 100-m stream reaches and the adjacent riparian zone, D. tenebrosus relative abundance was positively associated with stream elevation, forest age, and the percentage of boulders within streams. A higher stream gradient was the best predictor of D. tenebrosus presence within a stream reach, with present sites having a 91% higher gradient than absent sites. When excluding sites with low relative abundance, D. tenebrosus presence was also predicted by greater forest age surrounding streams and higher site elevation. Our study highlights that conservation planning for stream-associated amphibians with patchy distributions may be improved by an understanding of species-specific habitat associations at the stream-reach scale.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is considered a priority for ecosystem conservation because it may mitigate the synergistic effects of climate change and habitat loss. Climate change predictions suggest changes in precipitation regimes, which will affect the availability of water resources, with potential consequences for landscape connectivity. The Greater Calakmul Region of the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) has experienced a 16% decrease in precipitation over the last 50 years, which we hypothesise has affected water resource connectivity. We used a network model of connectivity, for three large endangered species (Baird's tapir, white-lipped peccary and jaguar), to assess the effect of drought on waterhole availability and connectivity in a forested landscape inside and adjacent to the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve. We used reported travel distances and home ranges for our species to establish movement distances in our model. Specifically, we compared the effects of 10 drought scenarios on the number of waterholes (nodes) and the subsequent changes in network structure and node importance. Our analysis revealed that drought dramatically influenced spatial structure and potential connectivity of the network. Our results show that waterhole connectivity and suitable habitat (area surrounding waterholes) is lost faster inside than outside the reserve for all three study species, an outcome that may drive them outside the reserve boundaries. These results emphasize the need to assess how the variability in the availability of seasonal water resource may affect the viability of animal populations under current climate change inside and outside protected areas.

AB  - This article examines the sustainability of the Grain for Green Project in the Wolong Nature Reserve. Pertinent data were collected through a questionnaire survey and a spatial analysis of reforested lands. The study results identified four critical issues that may influence the sustainability of the project in the study area. The first issue is concerned with the project's impacts on local sustenance. Because local grain consumption depends greatly on compensation awarded by the project, the potential for sustainability of the project is compromised. The second issue is that the project causes negative effects on local incomes in the Wolong Nature Reserve, which may undermine local economic prospects. The third issue is that the project failed to deliver suitable habitat for the giant panda, although two of the suitability requirements that deal with landform features were met. Lastly, the project neglects great differences among geographical areas in the country, providing the same compensation and length of compensation period to all participants. Appropriate compensation mechanisms should be established and adapted to local economic, environmental, and social conditions. In managing nature reserves and moving toward sustainability, ensuring all aspects of local socioeconomic and ecological/environmental issues are properly addressed is a real challenge. Based on our study, some recommendations for improving sustainability of the project are given.

AB  - The Orange-breasted Bunting (Passerina leclancherii) is an endemics species of the tropical dry forest of western Mexico. In this study, the ecological niche factor analysis algorithm was applied, using species occurrence data, both from museum collection records and from actual field observations, as well as bioclimatic and topographic data to predict variables for an ecological/geographic niche model of the species. We visited, during three years (2004-2006), 51 sites (a total of 143 counting points) located in the states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan, Guerrero and Oaxaca. The Orange-breasted Bunting was recorded in 40 sites (78%) and 143 count points (34%), distributed in all the states except Nayarit. The most important variables predicting the occurrence of the Oriange-breasted Bunting were high seasonality in rainfall, low diurnal variation in temperature (between 9.5 degrees-15.5 degrees C), and low elevation (80% of the predicted area is located between 0 y 900 m). The Orange-breasted Bunting distributes in 40% of the study region (311,413 kin 2), on areas with forest cover > 70% (27% of the total points), 40-70% (35%), y < 40% (38%), similar numbers to the proportion of the total sampled sites (i.e., expected distribution). The patterns of the species potential distribution reveal that only 0.9%, of the area modeled as suitable habitat is currently under a natural protected area regime, while IBAS (priority areas for conservation of birds) include a 6.4%.

AB  - The study was carried out to understand the variability in phytoplankton production (Chlorophyll a) and mesozooplankton diversity from two different shallow coastal regions of south Andaman viz. Port Blair Bay (PBB), the only real urban area among the islands and Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park, a Marine Protected Area (MPA) at Wandoor. Seasonal sampling was carried out during the Northeast monsoon (NEM-November 2005), Intermonsoon (IM-April 2006), and Southwest monsoon (SWM-August 2006). Significant (P < 0.05) seasonal variation was observed in the environmental variables at both the regions. Higher average chlorophyll a (Chl. a) and mesozooplankton standing stock were observed at PBB compared to MPA, but the seasonal variation observed was marginal at both the study areas. Chl. a showed a steep increasing gradient from outer to the inner regions of the PBB. The number of zooplankton taxa recorded at both areas was quite similar, but marked differences were noticed in their relative contribution to the total abundance. Eventhough the Copepoda dominated at both the areas, the non-copepod taxa differed significantly between the regions. Dominance of carnivores such as siphonophores and chaetognaths were noticed at PBB, while filter feeders such as appendicularians and decapod larvae were more abundant at MPA. A total of 20 and 21 copepod families was recorded from PBB and MPA, respectively. Eleven species of chaetognaths were observed as common at both areas. Larval decapods were found to be predominant at MPA with 20 families; whereas, at PBB, only 12 families were recorded. In the light of the recent reports on various changes occurring in the coastal waters of the Andaman Islands, it is suspected that the difference in Chl. a as well as the mesozooplankton standing stock and community structure observed between the two study areas may be related to the various anthropogenic events influencing the coastal waters.

AB  - The study of southern dry forest lemurs has been largely restricted to small reserves; yet, the majority of the region's lemur populations reside outside protected areas. Lemur catta and Propithecus verreauxi occupy the same forests but have different dietary preferences. This study assessed L. catta and P. verreauxi population densities across a 3-km dry forest gradient (1,539 ha) in southern Madagascar. The study was designed to allow lemur densities to be related to particular forest types. A particular aim of this study was to collect lemur data in both protected and unprotected areas. Density estimates were calculated using point transect distance sampling in a study area that contained the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve and the adjacent disturbed forests. The highest densities recorded for each species were in the protected area where the two species were most segregated in their distribution, with L. catta density highest in gallery forest type and P. verreauxi density highest in dry deciduous. Densities of both species varied widely outside the protected area, but P. verreauxi density was more uniform than was L. catta. Results of this study indicate that patterns of lemur density in protected areas are not representative of patterns in disturbed forests; this also suggests that we cannot fully understand the ecological constraints facing primate species by studying them only in protected areas. This research highlights the value of pairing the study of landscape-level patterns of species distribution with both local ground-level ecological interpretations and broad-scale satellite data; information from only one level may give an incomplete view of the community.

AB  - Accurate efficient estimation of actual and potential species distribution is a critical requirement for effective ecosystem-based management and marine protected area design. In this study we tested the applicability of a terrestrial landscape modeling technique in a marine environment for predicting the distribution of ecologically and economically important groundfish, using 3 species of rockfish at Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS) as a model system. Auto-classification of multibeam bathymetry along with georeferenced submersible video transect data of the seafloor and demersal fishes were used to model the abundance and distribution of rockfish. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were created using habitat classification analyses of high-resolution (3 m) digital elevation models combined with fish presence/absence observations. Model accuracy was assessed using a reserved subset of the observation data. The resulting probability of occurrence models generated at 3 m resolution for the entire 120 km(2) study area proved reliable in predicting the distribution of all the species. The accuracies of the models for Sebastes rosaceus, S. flavidus and S. elongatus were 96, 92 and 92%, respectively. The probability of occurrence of S. flavidus and S. rosaceus was highest in the high relief rocky areas and lowest in the low relief, soft sediment areas. The model for S. elongatus had an opposite pattern, with the highest predicted probability of occurrence taking place in the low relief, soft sediment areas and a lower probability of occurrence in the rocky areas. These results indicate that site-specific and species-specific algorithmic habitat classification applied to high-resolution bathymetry data can be used to accurately extrapolate the results from in situ video surveys of demersal fishes across broad areas of habitat.

AB  - Efficient management of invasive alien plants requires robust and cost-efficient methods for measuring the abundance and spatial structure of invasive alien plants with sufficient accuracy. Here, we present such a monitoring method using ad hoc presence-absence records that are routinely collected for various management and research needs in Kruger National Park, South Africa. The total and local abundance of all invasive alien plants were estimated using the area-of-occupancy model that depicts a power-law scaling pattern of species occupancy across scales and a detection-rate-based Poisson model that allows us to estimate abundance from the occupancy, respectively. Results from these two models were consistent in predicting a total of about one million invasive alien plant records for the park. The accuracy of log-transformed abundance estimate improved significantly with the increase of sampling effort. However, estimating abundance was shown to be much more difficult than detecting the spatial structure of the invasive alien plants. Since management of invasive species in protected areas is often hampered by limited resources for detailed surveys and monitoring, relatively simple and inexpensive monitoring strategies are important. Such data should also be appropriate for multiple purposes. We therefore recommend the use of the scaling pattern of species distribution as a method for rapid and robust monitoring of invasive alien plants in protected areas. Not only do these approaches provide valuable tools for managers and biologists in protected areas, but this kind of data, which can be collected as part of routine activities for a protected area, provides excellent opportunities for researchers to explore the status of aliens as well as their assemblage patterns and functions.

AB  - Aim One of the limitations to using species' distribution atlases in conservation planning is their coarse resolution relative to the needs of local planners. In this study, a simple approach to downscale original species atlas distributions to a finer resolution is outlined. If such a procedure yielded accurate downscaled predictions, then it could be an aid to using available distribution atlases in real-world local conservation decisions.
   Location Europe.
   Methods An iterative procedure based on generalized additive modelling is used to downscale original European 50 x 50 km distributions of 2189 plant and terrestrial vertebrate species to c. 10 x 10 km grid resolution. Models are trained on 70% of the original data and evaluated on the remaining 30%, using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) procedure. Fitted models are then interpolated to a finer resolution. A British dataset comprising distributions of 81 passerine-bird species in a 10 x 10 km grid is used as a test bed to assess the accuracy of the downscaled predictions. European-wide, downscaled predictions are further evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce: (1) spatial patterns of coincidence in species richness scores among different groups; and (2) spatial patterns of coincidence in richness, rarity and complementarity hotspots.
   Results There was a generally good agreement between downscaled and observed fine-resolution distributions for passerine species in Britain (median Jaccard similarity = 70%; lower quartile = 36%; upper quartile = 88%). In contrast, the correlation between downscaled and observed passerine species richness was relatively low (rho = 0.31) indicating a pattern of error propagation through the process of overlaying downscaled distributions for many species. It was also found that measures of model accuracy in fitting original data (ROC) were a poor predictor of models' ability to interpolate distributions at fine resolutions (rho = -0.10). Although European hotspots were not fully coincident between observed and modelled coarse-resolution data, or between modelled coarse resolution and modelled downscaled data, there was evidence that downscaled distributions were able to maintain original cross-taxon coincidence of species-richness scores, at least for terrestrial vertebrate groups. Downscaled distributions were also able to uncover important environmental gradients otherwise blurred by coarse-resolution data.
   Main conclusions Despite uncertainties, downscaling procedures may prove useful to identify reserves that are more meaningfully related to local patterns of environmental variation. Potential errors arising from the presence of false positives may be reduced if downscaled-distribution records projected to occur outside the range of original coarse-resolution data are excluded. However, the usefulness of this procedure may be limited to data-rich regions. If downscaling procedures are applied to data-poor regions, then there is a need to undertake further research to understand the structure of error in models. In particular, it would be important to investigate which species are poorly modelled, where and why. Without such an assessment it is difficult to support unsupervised use of downscaled data in most real-world situations.

This is especially true where C&R fisheries are being developed because they are perceived as economically valuable, automatically self-sustaining, with low environmental impact. However, resources to support research, management, and enforcement are often lacking, leading to fisheries that are de facto C&R, with little oversight or conservation planning. This can lead to fisheries that are not sustainable due to low post-release mortality, overfishing, loss of critical habitats. In locations with limited resources, a framework is needed to maximize these resources to provide sufficient information for fisheries management and evaluation. The "flats fishery" of the Caribbean, comprised of bonefish (Albula vulpes), Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), permit (Trachinotus falcatus), and common snook (Centropomus undecimalis), supports an economically valuable recreational fishery that is C&R in many locations throughout its geographic range. Once a fishery that received little management attention, recent research has provided sufficient information to guide conservation and management. In this manuscript, the lessons learned from >10 years of research and conservation of the Caribbean flats fishery are used to demonstrate how C&R Fishery Evaluation Guidelines (FEGs) can be applied to this and similar C&R fisheries. The FEG factors include: species suitability, habitat, water quality, fishery status, fishery capacity, socio-economics, enforcement and compliance, cultural factors, and education.

AB  - A growing body of evidence has documented how wildlife alter their behavior in response to human encroachment. For carnivores, behaviors related to reproduction and communication are particularly sensitive to human disturbance and can provide an early warning indicator of development's negative impacts. Despite the important role carnivores play in an ecosystem, few tools have been developed to anticipate how future human development impacts these behaviors. We developed a set of models to understand spatial relationships between anthropogenic development and puma (Puma concolor) habitat selection for two critical reproductive behaviors: nursery habitat for raising young, and sites for communication with mates. Using geospatial location data from the Santa Cruz Mountains in California, USA, we found that female pumas use small nursery home ranges (9 km(2) +/- 1.72 SE) of predominantly natural habitat, potentially with low levels of human development (< 1 housing unit per 40 acres), when supporting kittens < 8 weeks old. Areas immediately surrounding (<= 600 m) puma communication sites were also almost entirely composed of undeveloped habitat or low-density development. When modeling projected human development compared to current land use, we found that increases in human development may eliminate 20% of current puma nursery habitat and nearly 50% of current communication site habitat. Future development will also increase the patchiness of suitable habitat, intensifying the difficulty of locating and accessing suitable areas for nurseries and communication. Focusing on the habitat needed to support reproductive and communication behaviors may be an effective way to prioritize conservation planning for pumas and other apex carnivores.

AB  - Amphibians are particularly vulnerable to climate changes that are expected to cause habitat fragmentation and loss and, ultimately, local extirpations. However, little is known about how the interaction between climate change and fragmentation may impede the ability of amphibians to adapt to climate change. Here, we used the iconic mountain frog Quasipaa boulengeri as an indicator species to extrapolate climate-driven shifts in its habitat availability and connectivity in central and southern China according to the minimum and maximum rep-resentative concentration pathways. The models projected an average habitat loss of 36%-71% and the in situ and ex situ climate-change refugia to be 29%-64% and 5%-18% of the present-day suitable habitats, respectively. An increase in habitat fragmentation was reflected in a 51% decrease in core patch size, a 9% increase in the mean least-cost path (LCP) length, and a 19% increase in the cost-weighted distance. These climate-driven shifts varied spatially around the Sichuan Basin, with those in the southeast of the Basin being the most pronounced habitat and connectivity losses and those along the Basin being relatively optimistic. The effectiveness of refugia may only be maintained through a narrow passageway along the southern Sichuan Basin because of the presence of LCPs over time. Our results emphasize the need to understand how climate change and connectivity will jointly affect the distribution of mountain amphibians and to accordingly adopt conservation strategies. Further, our findings highlight the importance of identifying and preserving climate-change refugia and habitat connectivity for species persistence and conservation planning. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The critically endangered wingless stonefly, Riekoperla darlingtoni (Illies, 1968), is endemic to the summit of Mt Donna Buang, Victoria, Australia. The known distribution of this species is within three short sections of alpine springs, making this species particularly vulnerable to climate change. We assessed changes in population abundance at the presumed type locality from 2005 to 2019. We found that the abundance of nymphs had decreased by more than 80% following the very dry winter of 2006 without a noticeable recovery. We also used environmental DNA (eDNA) to search for more localities within the species suitable habitat to re-evaluate its distribution. The eDNA survey uncovered two new localities 2.5 km west of the previously known populations, increasing the extent of occurrence to 0.37 km(2) for a total of five localities. The species requires urgent listing under national environmental conservation legislation in Australia, an associated action plan and further surveys using eDNA to identify more locations. The eDNA approach allows reliable detection of this elusive species over a range of up to 200 m. Climate warming and drying resulting in the reduction in snowfall, as well as increasing human traffic and associated infrastructure at the mountain summit, are the main processes thought to be key threats to this unique and susceptible species. Implications for insect conservation These surveys provide the data for listing of the species under the Australian federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) 1999. The newly developed eDNA methods allow for efficient and effective surveying of R. darlingtoni in order to obtain a more complete understanding of its distribution for future conservation planning.

AB  - This analysis presents a conservation planning framework for decisions under uncertainty and applies it to the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. Uncertainty arises from variable distributional shifts of species' ranges due to climate change. The planning framework consists of a two-stage optimization model that selects a nominal conservation area network in the first stage and evaluates its performance under the climate scenarios in the second stage. The model is applied to eleven at-risk species in Alaska including the threatened Spectacled Eider and Steller's Eider sea ducks and the polar bear. The 109th United States Congress and 2008 federal budget proposed opening for oil and gas development the "1002 Area" of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which intersects the Plain. This analysis finds that, if Arctic Alaska experiences 1.5 degrees C of warming by 2040 (as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's A2 scenario), then potential habitat will decrease significantly for eight of these at-risk species, including the polar bear. This analysis also shows that there is synergism between oil and gas development and climate change. For instance, climate change accompanied by no development of the 1002 Area results in an increase of potential habitat for Steller's Eider. However, if development accompanies climate change, then there is a 20% decrease in that area. Further, this analysis quantifies the tradeoff between development and maintenance of suitable habitat for at-risk species. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several climate models predict that the western Succulent Karoo in South Africa will aridify. This region includes the range of the smallest tortoise, Homopus signatus signatus. Although the effects of rainfall on the physiology and ecology of H. s. signatus received attention in recent years, the results of these studies have not been integrated to facilitate conservation planning. Here we evaluate the importance of body size and the responses of H. s. signatus to rainfall variation to make recommendations for the taxon's conservation. The small body of H. s. signatus offers one solution to its habitat of low primary productivity and rocky slopes. Nevertheless, female fecundity and egg size increase with female size, and large eggs result in large hatchlings capable of surviving their harsh environment. Females accumulate nutrients in the rainfall season, winter, but also in the dry season, to enable the production of large eggs. Egg production decreases during drought, although some females continue to channel resources to reproduction, apparently at the cost of their own growth. Reduced fecundity and growth, a result of aridification, would likely lower the production of large eggs and hatchlings. Therefore, conservation measures that reduce the mortality of large females may aid population sustainability. Because egg and hatchling size might drop below a minimum viable size in an aridified environment, H. s. signatus conservation would benefit from the development of suitable habitat corridors to enable tortoise movements to regions that will receive sufficient rainfall in the future.

AB  - Context In fragmented landscapes, connectivity between subpopulations is vital for species' persistence. Various techniques are used to assess the degree of connectivity between habitat patches, yet their performance is seldom evaluated. Models are regularly based on habitat selection by individuals in resident populations, yet dispersers may not require habitat which supports permanent residence.
   Objectives and methods Using a database of African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) occurrence records in north-eastern South Africa (n = 576), we developed and compared ecological niche models (ENM) for wild dogs packs and dispersers. Additionally, we used least cost path (LCP) and current flow models to assess connectivity. Results were further validated using occurrence records (n = 339) for cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus).
   Results and conclusions The ENM for wild dog packs identified large but isolated patches of suitable habitat, while the disperser ENM had greater suitability values for areas in between highly suitable patches. Without disperser-specific data, models omitted large areas which were confirmed to have provided connectivity. Although models derived from a potentially subjective cost layer have been criticised, the current flow model outperformed the other connectivity techniques and provided the most meaningful predictions for conservation planning. We identified five priority conservation areas for wild dogs, two of which had a greater feasibility for recolonisation. The scarcity of disperser-specific data promotes models using habitat data for resident individuals but here we illustrate the pitfalls thereof. Our study provides insights into the performance of these frequently employed techniques and how they may affect conservation management decisions.

KW  - PRIVATE-LAND
AB  - The Endangered Species Act has fostered considerable controversy surrounding its regulation of privately owned endangered species habitat. Private landowners believe that the law wrongly requires them to bear the burden of providing endangered species habitat on their property. At the same time, conservation of privately owned habitat is critical to the conservation of most endangered species. In order to resolve endangered species conflicts on private lands, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has been promoting the use of 'habitat conservation plans' which allow some loss of endangered species habitat in exchange for activities which minimize and mitigate for the loss. These plans have come under increasing criticism from environmentalists and conservation biologists who argue that the plans are contributing to the continued loss of endangered species habitat. This paper proposes that mitigation banking of endangered species habitat may provide a useful tool to resolve endangered species conflicts on private lands while concurrently advancing the recovery of endangered species. Mitigation banking would allow landowners seeking a permit to destroy endangered species habitat to mitigate the loss by buying mitigation credits from other private landowners who restore and/or protect suitable habitat. Mitigation banking has the potential to increase mitigation alternatives for the regulated community while providing a needed economic incentive for other landowners to restore and protect important habitats. From an ecological perspective, mitigation banking could allow for the exchange of fragmented habitats with little long range viability for habitats that are strategically located and can contribute to species' recovery. The paper concludes with a discussion of several questions that need further analysis in considering banking of endangered species habitat. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Riparian corridors and fencerows are hypothesized to increase the persistence of forest animals in fragmented landscapes by facilitating movement among suitable habitat patches. This function may be critically important for forest birds, which have declined dramatically in fragmented habitats. Unfortunately, direct evidence of corridor use has been difficult to collect at landscape scales and this limits support for corridors in conservation planning. Using telemetry and handheld GPS units, we examined the movement of forest birds by translocating territorial individuals of barred antshrikes (Thamnophilus doliatus; a forest specialist) and rufous-naped wrens (Campylorhynchus rufinucha; a forest generalist) 0.7-1.9 km from their territories in the highly fragmented tropical dry forest of Costa Rica. In each translocation, the directly intervening habitat comprised 1 of 3 treatments: forested riparian corridor, linear living fencerow, or open pasture. Antshrikes returned faster and with greater success in riparian corridors relative to pasture treatments. This species also traveled more directly in riparian corridor treatments, detoured to use forested routes in the other 2 treatments, and did not use fencerows even when they led directly to their home territories. By contrast, wrens were more likely to use fencerows when returning, and return time and success were equivalent among the 3 treatments. Both species crossed fewer gaps in tree cover during riparian corridor treatments than in fencerow or pasture treatments. We conclude that antshrikes, which may be representative of other forest specialists, use forested corridors for movement in this landscape and that fencerows are avoided as movement conduits.

AB  - A set of lander deployments in a deep marine protected area (MPA; El Cachucho) combining environmental sensors and a baited camera provided insight on the relationship between faunal behavior and oceanographic dynamics. Landers were deployed at different depths, ranging from 500 to 960 m for a period of 24-26 h. A total of 10,989 photographs were downloaded and synchronized using a time code with all the environmental vari-ables recorded (pressure, temperature, salinity, water current, and direction). Total richness accounted for 41 species of different taxonomic groups (21 fishes, 11 crustaceans, 6 echinoderms, and 3 molluscs). The most abundant species were Synaphobranchus kaupii, Mora moro, Phycis blennoides, Helicolenus dactylopterus, and Etmopterus spinax. Arrival times (Tarr) and maximum number of individuals (Nmax) greatly differed among stations.Cluster analysis showed two main faunal groups in relation to depth: those close to the top of the bank and those in the flanks. Species densities were estimated using Priede's equations and compared with those obtained in previous studies using trawl samplers. The relation of species with environmental variables showed high variability depending on the location of the station and the associated variables (depth, current, and water masses). Near-bottom dynamics were consistent with previously known oceanographic patterns at the bank, dominated by background anticyclonic recirculation along the flanks overlaid by strong tidal cycles. Current and hydrography tidally driven phases showed an evident effect in the arrival of species at some locations. Species appeared during specific periods matching the beginning of the flooding phase or end of the ebb phase. Movement rates (cm s-1) were estimated for some invertebrate species, such as crabs (Bathynectes maravigna, 0.66; Pagurus sp., 0.09), the gasteropod Colus gracilis (0.15), and echinoderms (Cidaris cidaris, 0.04; Araeosoma fenestratum, 0.23).

AB  - Effective long-term wildlife conservation planning for a species must be guided by information about population vital rates at multiple scales. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations declined substantially during the twentieth century, largely as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. In addition to the importance of conserving large tracts of suitable habitat, successful conservation of this species will require detailed information about factors affecting vital rates at both the population and range-wide scales. Research has shown that sage-grouse population growth rates are particularly sensitive to hen and chick survival rates. While considerable information on hen survival exists, there is limited information about chick survival at the population level, and currently there are no published reports of factors affecting chick survival across large spatial and temporal scales. We analyzed greater sage-grouse chick survival rates from 2 geographically distinct populations across 9 years. The effects of 3 groups of related landscape-scale covariates (climate, drought, and phenology of vegetation greenness) were evaluated. Models with phenological change in greenness (NDVI) performed poorly, possibly due to highly variable production of forbs and grasses being masked by sagebrush canopy. The top drought model resulted in substantial improvement in model fit relative to the base model and indicated that chick survival was negatively associated with winter drought. Our overall top model included effects of chick age, hen age, minimum temperature in May, and precipitation in July. Our results provide important insights into the possible effects of climate variability on sage-grouse chick survival.

AB  - The fragmentation of natural environments is one of the most important threats to biodiversity and involves changes in landscape configuration and habitat quality. The Atlantic Forest of South America has been highly fragmented, which creates concern for the conservation of its biodiversity. We evaluated the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on the terrestrial mammal assemblage of the Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina. The area still contains large fragments and a forest cover >50%. We evaluated the effect of the configuration of the fragments (area, isolation) and the quality of the environment surrounding them (% of forest, land uses, poaching). We sampled mammal assemblages with camera-traps. We used generalized linear models, with the number of species in smaller forest fragments (49 stations) and the difference in their composition to that of the largest forest fragment (control situation; 53 stations) as response variables. Species richness in the fragments increased with the proportion of forest in their surroundings and decreased with the distance to population sources. The dissimilarity of the assemblages of smaller fragments to those of the largest fragment increased with forest disturbance and by the contrast of the land uses (e.g., annual crops) surrounding the fragments. We modeled and mapped these effects, which can be used as spatially explicit planning tools for the conservation of the mammal assemblage in this landscape. The effect of fragmentation on the mammal assemblage is mediated by both anthropic effects that affect the quality of the environment and by the spatial configuration of fragments in the landscape.

AB  - Conservation measures often rely on habitat management, so knowledge about a species' habitat use is a prerequisite for effective conservation planning. The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, a medium-sized bird native to the Palaearctic steppes and today found in extensively farmed habitats, is a threatened species. Its population experienced a 94% decline in farmland habitats in France between 1982 and 1996, and populations all over Europe have suffered equally sharp declines. Due to this steep negative trend, this species has been the subject of a number of habitat selection studies in order to develop relevant conservation measures based on its habitat requirements. In this study, we investigated the habitat selection of a range of habitat types by both sexes and at two nested spatial scales: plot scale and landscape scale. In addition, we analysed intra-specific social interactions by incorporating conspecific density in the statistical models of habitat use. The study was conducted on a very high-density population, perhaps the highest ever recorded for this species at around 50 Bustards per 100 ha of suitable habitat. Our methodology combined two field approaches (point counts and quadrat counts). The findings showed rather limited sexual dimorphism in terms of habitat selection at a local scale, with only vegetation height differing between sexes at a micro-habitat scale, no selection at landscape scale, and a prevailing role of social factors at both scales. The implications for future conservation strategies in relation to population density and landscape composition are discussed.

AB  - Many wildlife species are known to actively select their habitat. Understanding habitat selection and use is crucial for conservation and management of endangered wildlife species. In this study, an index that can be used for reserve selection and management for the snub-nosed golden monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana), was developed. Environmental attributes of habitat and non-habitat sites of the Shennongjia District were analyzed. The relationship between habitat selection and effective range of the major variables were quantified. The results showed that elevation, distance to road and water, and vegetation were the most important contributors to the habitat selection index. Potential habitat areas of R. roxellana were predicted and mapped based on the index. Total area suitable as habitat for R. roxellana was estimated at 33,970 ha in Shennongjia District. Only 22% of the estimated habitat was within the current activity area of the animal and utilized. At the landscape scale, conservation of R. roxellana should therefore focus on expanding the current reserve to encompass areas with large patches of potential suitable habitat, planning road constructions away from habitat areas, and restricting road traffics on existing roads to improve connectivity between patches of potential habitat The habitat selection index can be used for predicting potential habitat areas for endangered wildlife species such as R. roxellana, and thus is of immediate interest to practitioners and policy makers of wildlife conservation in their conservation planning and management decision-making.

AB  - The immediacy of conservation decisions for imperiled species often requires rapid assessments of fundamental species-specific data to appropriately guide conservation resources, regulatory actions, and mitigation activities. The goal of this paper was to inform future conservation and management decisions for the imperiled Carson Valley silverspot butterfly (Speyeria nokomis carsonensis), a species that has been subject to conservation attention, yet very little is known about its distribution and habitat. Surveys for S. nokomis carsonensis and its habitat were conducted during 2004-2005. An 88% decline in the number of historic subpopulations was observed, but 30 new subpopulations were discovered. Among the 62 sites that either had populations or were considered potentially suitable habitat, three distinct habitat types were delineated: agricultural seeps, isolated springs, and riparian meadows. Riparian sites comprised 58% of all sites and little variation was observed in the proportion of occupancy across habitat types. Disturbance was substantially greater in unoccupied sites than in sites occupied by S. nokomis carsonensis. Livestock grazing was the primary threat (50% of sites) to habitat, while water diversions were a secondary threat (7 sites). The variability in habitat and threats identifies that even for highly specialized subspecies, all habitats simply cannot be considered equal candidates for inclusion in a conservation strategy for the butterfly. Adopting proactive management policies that conserve suites of sites within each habitat type and reduce grazing intensity within S. nokomis carsonensis habitats should be a priority to reduce threats and circumvent a prospective listing pursuant to the US Endangered Species Act.

AB  - (1) The presence and absence of 22 plant species of various growth forms and habitat associations were analysed in 423 habitat fragments totalling 10.4 km(2) in a 268 km(2) urban and suburban region, in Birmingham, UK. (2) Multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess the effects of patch geometry and quality on the species distributions. Measures of geometry were area, shape (S-factor), distance from open countryside and various measures of isolation from other patches. Potential habitat for each species was determined quantitatively, and the distribution of each species was considered within a subset of patches containing potentially suitable habitat types. There was found to be a significant positive correlation between the density of patches available to a species and the proportion of these patches which were occupied. (3) Logistic analyses and incidence functions revealed that, for many of the species, occupancy increased with site age, area, habitat number and similarity of adjacent habitats, while increasing distance to the nearest recorded population of the same species decreased the likelihood that a species would be found in a patch. (4) Patterns of occupancy are consistent with increased extinction from small sites, and colonisation of nearby habitats, coupled with an important role for site history. We conclude that spatial dynamics at the scale of the landscape are of importance to the long-term persistence of many plant species in fragmented landscapes, and must be seriously considered in conservation planning and management. These results have direct implications for the siting and connectivity of urban habitat reserves.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are widely acknowledged as the main driver of the decline of giant panda populations. The Chinese government has made great efforts to protect this charming species and has made remarkable achievements, such as population growth and habitat expansion. However, habitat fragmentation has not been reversed. Protecting giant pandas in a large spatial extent needs to identify core habitat patches and corridors connecting them. This study used an equal-sampling multiscale random forest habitat model to predict a habitat suitability map for the giant panda. Then, we applied the resistant kernel method and factorial least-cost path analysis to identify core habitats connected by panda dispersal and corridors among panda occurrences, respectively. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of current protected areas in representing core habitats and corridors. Our results showed high scale dependence of giant panda habitat selection. Giant pandas strongly respond to bamboo percentage and elevation at a relatively fine scale (1 km), whereas they respond to anthropogenic factors at a coarse scale (>= 2 km). Dispersal ability has significant effects on core habitats extent and population fragmentation evaluation. Under medium and high dispersal ability scenarios (12,000 and 20,000 cost units), most giant panda habitats in the Qionglai mountain are predicted to be well connected by dispersal. The proportion of core habitats covered by protected areas varied between 38% and 43% under different dispersal ability scenarios, highlighting significant gaps in the protected area network. Similarly, only 43% of corridors that connect giant panda occurrences were protected. Our results can provide crucial information for conservation managers to develop wise strategies to safeguard the long-term viability of the giant panda population.

AB  - This study investigated the nurseries of seven commercially important demersal species of the northern sector of the Strait of Sicily (central Mediterranean): red mullet. European hake, horned octopus, deep-water rose shrimp, greater forkbeard. Norway lobster and giant red shrimp. An eleven-year series of data collected through experimental trawling in the Strait of Sicily during spring and autumn was analyzed. The spatio-temporal persistence of the high-density aggregations (hot spots) of juvenile individuals in their first year of life was investigated to identify habitats that serve as nurseries. The density of recruits within the persistent nurseries was used as a proxy of the unit area contribution of individuals which recruit to the adult population. The spatial distribution patterns of the recruits of most the species were well defined and very stable in the long term. Persistent and potentially highly productive nurseries of European hake, deep-water rose shrimp and greater forkbeard were identified off the southern coast of Sicily. Persistent areas of recruits concentration were also observed for the other species investigated, but their specific potential contribution of individuals to the adult population was not substantial compared to adjacent grounds. The close or overlapped localization of sites which regularly host vulnerable life stages of different exploited species, revealed an area of great ecological significance which probably plays a major role in the dynamics of the fishery resources in the Strait of Sicily. Appropriate spatial protection measures of this area, including marine protected area designation, could complement conventional management approach for ensuring the long-term sustainability of these fisheries and stocks conservation.

AB  - Effective conservation requires understanding the processes that determine population outcomes. Too often, we assume that protected areas conserve wild populations despite evidence that they frequently fail to do so. Without large-scale studies, however, we cannot determine what relationships are the product of localized conditions versus general patterns that inform conservation more broadly. Leopards' (Panthera pardus) basic ecology is well studied but little research has investigated anthropogenic effects on leopard density at broad scales. We investigated the drivers of leopard density among 27 diverse protected areas in northeastern South Africa to understand what conditions facilitate abundant populations. We formulated 10 working hypotheses that considered the relative influence of bottom-up biological factors and top-down anthropogenic factors on leopard density. Using camera-trap survey data, we fit a multi-session spatial capture-recapture model with inhomogenous density for each hypothesis and evaluated support using an information theoretic approach. The four supported hypotheses indicated that leopard density is primarily limited by human impacts, but that habitat suitability and management conditions also matter. The proportion of camera stations that recorded domestic animals, a proxy for the extent of human impacts and protected area effectiveness, was the only predictor variable present in all four supported models. Protected areas are the cornerstone of large felid conservation, but only when the human-wildlife interface is well managed and protected areas shelter wildlife populations from anthropogenic impacts. To ensure the long-term abundance of large carnivore populations, reserve managers should recognize the ineffectiveness of "paper parks" and promote contiguous networks of protected areas that offer leopards and other large mammal populations greater space and reduced human impacts.

AB  - Aim Our aim was to uncover patterns of distribution of marine subtidal rocky reef communities across six taxonomic groups and decompose the relative roles of species loss and turnover in total community variation. Additionally, we propose an easily calculated index that can be used to highlight areas with unique species composition for conservation planning. We estimated the strengths of associations between environmental factors and species richness and rarity. Location Ilha Grande Bay, Brazil, covering about 150,000 ha harbouring different marine habitats. Methods We used the Marine Rapid Assessment Protocol at 42 sites to gather information on environmental variables and species in six subtidal marine groups. We determined "singular" sites as the regions harbouring higher numbers of rare species. Then, we estimated the roles of species loss and turnover on the observed total variation among sites. We used Generalized Linear Model to partition the relative importance of the selected environmental factors in driving variation in species richness and singularity. Results The singularity index and richness showed that the bay could be divided into three subregions for subtidal communities. Richness and rarity were structured at different spatial scales and associated with environmental variables related to water productivity and nutrients but varied among taxonomic groups. Community variation over space was largely associated with turnover of species. Main conclusions Higher singularity and richness on the western side of the bay and around the main island suggested that these regions should be conservation priorities, but high species turnover across the whole bay indicated that portions of the central channel should be included in conservation strategies. This draws attention to the importance of community variation rather than just species numbers in conservation and management planning. The high species turnover indicated that these rocky reefs have high beta diversity when compared to other studied biological systems.

AB  - International targets have committed governments to expanding the global protected area (PA) network to 17% of the terrestrial surface by 2020. Optimising PA placement in the landscape is challenging due to a poor knowledge of biodiversity distribution and multiple definitions of conservation value. We explore these two issues using a case study of a highly threatened bird Order in a region of conservation concern where PA network effectiveness for biodiversity has not been formally explored previously. To determine if the existing PA network protects the most important areas for 24 species of Himalayan Galliformes, we use a novel method to compare the current network placement to results produced from Zonation prioritisation software and modelled species distributions. Specifically, we identify areas of high species richness and then weight maps by three different species specific conservation values. The current PA network captures ranges poorly. We found statistically significantly poorer fits between the optimal and the existing placement of the Himalayan PA network for Zonation results that were: (i) unweighted; (ii) weighted by Red List score; and (iii) weighted by endemism to the Himalaya. Across these and two other Zonation results, the placement of the optimal PA network covered 58% more of Galliformes distributions than the existing network. We advocate some refinements to the existing PA network to maximise Galliformes coverage and suggest that our method could be used to model the optimal PA network for a wide range of species and/or regions, something which will support the assessment and attainment of CBD targets.

   Using New Zealand land snails as a case study, we evaluated recent spatial modelling approaches for the analysis of diversity in species-rich invertebrate groups. Applications and prospects for improved conservation assessment were investigated.
   Location
   New Zealand.
   Methods
   The study used a spatially extensive and taxonomically comprehensive, plot-based dataset on community structure in New Zealand land snails. Generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction (GRASP) was used to model and predict species richness as a function of environmental variables (including aspects of climate, soils and vegetation). Generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM) was used to model turnover in species composition in relation to environmental and geographical distances, and to assess community similarity and the representativeness of the reserve network.
   Results
   Observed land snail richness in 20 x 20 m plots ranged from 1 to 74 (mean 17.5). The GRASP model explained a modest 27% of the variation in richness. The GDM model explained 57% of the variation in species turnover and indicated approximately equal amounts related to environmental (Cody's beta diversity) and geographical distance (Cody's gamma diversity). Temperature and moisture were the most important environmental variables. Results indicate that snail distributions are not only sorted by environment but are also strongly influenced by historical effects consistent with those expected of poorly dispersing taxa that have persisted in refugia during past climatic change. The GDM model enabled spatial classifications of snail communities, highlighting diverse communities in heterogeneous regions, such as the South Island mountains, and also enabled continuous depictions of community similarity and adequacy of New Zealand's protected natural areas network.
   Main conclusions
   The GRASP and GDM analyses allowed us to model and depict spatial patterns of diversity in land snail communities involving 845 species, and produce community classifications and estimates of community similarity. These tools advance conservation assessment in species-rich groups, but require further conceptual and methodological development.

AB  - Spatial simulation may be used to model the potential effects of current biodiversity approaches on future habitat modification under differing climate change scenarios. To illustrate the approach, spatial simulation models, including landscape-level forest dynamics, were developed for a semi-natural grassland of conservation concern in a southern Italian protected area, which was exposed to woody vegetation encroachment. A forest landscape dynamics simulator (LANDIS-II) under conditions of climate change, current fire and alternative management regimes was used to develop scenario maps. Landscape pattern metrics provided data on fragmentation and habitat quality degradation, and quantified the spatial spread of different tree species within grassland habitats. The models indicated that approximately one-third of the grassland area would be impacted by loss, fragmentation and degradation in the next 150 years. Differing forest management regimes appear to influence the type of encroaching species and the density of encroaching vegetation. Habitat modifications are likely to affect species distribution and interactions, as well as local ecosystem functioning, leading to changes in estimated conservation value. A site-scale conservation strategy based on feasible integrated fire and forest management options is proposed, considering the debate on the effectiveness of protected areas for the conservation of ecosystem services in a changing climate. This needs to be tested through further modelling and scenario analysis, which would benefit from the enhancement of current modelling capabilities of LANDIS-II and from combination with remote sensing technologies, to provide early signals of environmental shifts both within and outside protected areas.

AB  - Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae were severely depleted by commercial whaling. Understanding key factors in their recovery is a crucial step for their conservation worldwide. In Oceania, the Chesterfield-Bellona archipelago was a primary whaling site in the 19th century, yet has been left almost unaffected by anthropogenic activities since. We present the results of the first multidisciplinary dedicated surveys in the archipelago assessing humpback whale populations 2 centuries post-whaling. We encountered 57 groups during 24 survey days (2016-2017), among which 35 whales were identified using photographs of natural markings (photo-ID), 38 using genotyping and 22 using both. Humpback whales were sparsely distributed (0.041 whales km-1): most sightings concentrated in shallow inner-reef waters and neighbouring offshore shallow banks. The recently created marine protected area covers most of the areas of high predicted habitat suitability and high residence time from satellite-tracked whales. Surprisingly for a breeding area, sex ratios skewed towards females (1:2.4), and 45% of females were with calf. Connectivity was established with the New Caledonia breeding area to the east (mtDNA F-ST = 0.001, p > 0.05, 12 photo-ID and 10 genotype matches) and with the Australian Great Barrier Reef breeding area to the west (mtDNA F-ST = 0.006, p > 0.05). Movement of satellite-tracked whales and photoID matches also suggest connections with the east Australian migratory corridor. This study confirms that humpback whales still inhabit the Chesterfield-Bellona archipelago 2 centuries post whaling, and that this pristine area potentially plays a role in facilitating migratory interchange among breeding grounds of the western South Pacific.

AB  - An assessment of the avifauna of Deva Vatala National Park (DVNP), Bhimber, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan was conducted from June 2017 to May 2018. Data were collected along one km line transects at three sites within the National Park: Barmala, Deva and Vatala. In total, 52 species were recorded, which included the globally threatened sociable lapwing. The most abundant species were asian green bee-eater, red-vented bulbul, house sparrow and common myna, and no species was unique to a single site in the DVNP. Highest abundance, richness and diversity was recorded in Deva, with lowest community measures recorded in Barmala. Species richness and diversity peaked in September and was lowest in November. Applying a suite of community composition analyses, bird communities were significantly different across all the three sites (ANOSIM), with 10 species explaining 16.5% to 17.2% of these community dissimilarities (SIMPER). Of these key contributing species, the relative abundance of seven species was significantly different across sites. This study documents spatio-temporal patterns in the avifauna of DVNP, providing a basis for ongoing monitoring in the DVNP, and further studies focusing on bird-habitat associations and the current impacts of habitat degradation. The presence of sociable lapwing is an indication of habitat suitability and highlights the need for further surveys in the region to locate other possible wintering grounds for this critically endangered species.
   With the current context of biodiversity losses, identifying changes in species and community composition is an important focus for supporting effective conservation management of protected area (Gamfeldt et al., 2008), which can play an integral role in biodiversity conservation (Ladin et al., 2016). This approach can assess existing biodiversity capital, current or anticipated drivers of impact, knowledge gaps and the directions

AB  - Tulips (Tulipa spp.) are one of the most widely appreciated plants worldwide, nevertheless species taxonomy and biogeography are often poorly understood. Most wild tulips inhabit the mountains of Central Asia, a recognised biodiversity hotspot, and a centre of tulip diversity. Despite the presence of several country-level endemic Tulipa species, most taxa span the borders of several nations. With no globally Red Listed tulip taxa from this region national level conservation assessments are an important resource. Nonetheless, threats posed to tulips are still inadequately understood, especially climate change, and given the trans-national nature of most species, distributional information is restricted and often misleading. Here we collate 330 species records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility with 85 newly collected records, to undertake species distribution modelling (MaxEnt) for ten native Central Asian species. This work showed that regional level models provide a much more comprehensive understanding of species' extinction risks, proportions of habitat in different countries, and limitations in protected area coverage. Furthermore, our climate modelling, the first of its kind for tulips, suggests that climate change will have a significant negative impact on the range size of all species; including those that are currently widespread. We therefore add climate change to the list of threats affecting tulip populations in Central Asia, which already includes livestock overgrazing, urbanisation, wild collection, and mining. Overall, our work shows that although national information is important, a regional approach is crucial not just for tulip conservation efforts, but likely for Central Asian plant conservation in general.

AB  - The period of larval drift into a suitable nursery area is considered to be of great significance for recruitment variability in flatfish. Here, a hydrodynamic model coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracking technique was utilized to study the drift from the first feeding larval stage until time of settlement of Central and Eastern Baltic flounder (Platichthys flesus), originating from spawning in the Baltic Sea deep basins, the Arkona- and Bornholm basin (central Baltic Sea), and the Gdansk deep and Gotland basin (eastern Baltic Sea). We examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of the probability to settle in preferred nursery habitat by detailed drift model simulations. The study suggests that the majority of larvae (89% and 74% for Central- and Eastern Baltic flounder, respectively) drift towards coastal areas and settle at metamorphosis 520 km from a sandy habitat enabling further migration to a preferred nursery area, i.e. larval drift seems not to be a major bottleneck in recruitment of flounder spawning in the Baltic Sea deep basins. The drift model results suggest that Central Baltic flounder utilize nursery areas mainly in the central and western Baltic, and in the Kattegat, whereas Eastern Baltic flounder mainly utilize the coast in the central and eastern Baltic. Thus, the two stock components seem to use different nursery areas following settlement. Further, in accordance with the "nursery size hypothesis", the model demonstrates that larvae from the Bornholm basin, utilizing areas with extensive distribution of preferred nursery habitat, display the highest relative successful transport to nursery grounds until settling (72% of successfully settled larvae), suggesting that spawning in the Bornholm Basin is of great importance for stock recruitment of deep basin spawning Baltic flounder.

AB  - Deforestation and a changing climate threaten the health and survival of lemurs in Madagascar. An important component of lemur health, parasite infection can reduce fitness and survival outcomes. Future lemur parasite richness, abundance and distribution may be highly influenced by climate change. Current knowledge of lemur parasites is narrow in geographic and temporal scope, with sampling at a limited number of sites, and thus far, there have been no attempts to assess the effects of climate change on lemur parasite distributions. We used geospatial tools to predict the distributions of six lemur parasites of high frequency and pathogenic potential. We then assessed how anticipated climate shifts in Madagascar may alter the distributions of these lemur parasites in the future. Under current climate conditions, we found that the focal parasites exhibited widespread potential distributions across Madagascar, covering 12-26% of surface land area and 40-86% of forested area. Our analyses also showed that parasites responded differently to projected climate changes, with shifts ranging from a contraction of current distributions by 7% to an expansion of 60%. A predicted net expansion in parasite distribution may expose naive lemur hosts to new parasites, which could have a profound effect on lemur health. Those parasites with the greatest potential for harmful effects are predicted to experience the largest expansion in range. Predicting these changing distributions will be critical for assessing population health, improving protected area design, preparing for reintroduction efforts and addressing potential parasite risk in lemurs, humans and domestic animals.

AB  - In the late 1990s, depletion of the target species Penaeus notialis (Pink Shrimp) in deeper waters (50 m) of the Nigerian coast resulted in a change of target species from P. notialis (Pink Shrimp) to shallower water species such as Penaeus monodon (Brown Shrimp). This study investigates the hypothesis that ecosystem impacts increased as industrial fleets increased fishing in shallower areas of the Nigerian coast by comparing the state of the ecosystem before and 20 yr after commercial shrimping commenced in Nigerian coastal waters (NCW). Two fishing scenarios were developed in Ecospace, the spatial modeling module of Ecopath with Ecosim software (Ecopath with Ecosim is a mass balanced trophic model that accounts for fishing impacts on food webs), with one having trawlers fishing everywhere beginning at the turn of the century (year 2000) and the other with no trawling in the first 5 nautical miles off the Nigerian coast through the entire period of model simulation (1985-2004). Modeling results showed increases in catch for some fisheries during the study period. In addition, estimated biomass for some functional groups increased especially for Small Pelagic fishes along with Rays, Reef fishes, Large Pelagics, and shallow water shrimps. All other exploited species in our modeling scenarios were estimated to have declining biomasses. Our expectation that redistribution of fishing effort in NCW will increase negative impacts of fishing the nearshore ecosystem was not supported by model results. This counterintuitive result may be because fishing effort on average was mostly distributed in the deeper areas of the inshore waters. Although specie such as Reef fishes appear to benefit from closure of the first 5 NM to fishing, the benefits appear to be negligible. We present the first ecosystem model developed for NCW, and our research contributes to fisheries ecology by furthering understanding of tropical coastal food webs and ecological response to fishing, especially in highly perturbed ecosystems like NCW.

AB  - How anticipated climate change might affect long-term outcomes of present-day agricultural conservation practices remains a key uncertainty that could benefit water quality and biodiversity conservation planning. To explore this issue, we forecasted how the stream fish communities in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) would respond to increasing amounts of agricultural conservation practice (ACP) implementation under two IPCC future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5: moderate reductions; RCP8.5: business-as-usual conditions) during 2020-2065. We used output from 19 General Circulation Models to drive linked agricultural land use (APEX), watershed hydrology (SWAT), and stream fish distribution (boosted regression tree) models, subsequently analyzing how projected changes in habitat would influence fish community composition and functional trait diversity. Our models predicted both positive and negative effects of climate change and ACP implementation on WLEB stream fishes. For most species, climate and ACPs influenced species in the same direction, with climate effects outweighing those of ACP implementation. Functional trait analysis helped clarify the varied responses among species, indicating that more extreme climate change would reduce available habitat for large-bodied, cool-water species with equilibrium life-histories, many of which also are of importance to recreational fishing (e.g., northern pike, smallmouth bass). By contrast, available habitat forwarm-water, benthic species with more periodic or opportunistic life-histories (e.g., northern hogsucker, greater redhorse, greenside darter) was predicted to increase. Further, ACP implementation was projected to hasten these shifts, suggesting that efforts to improve water quality could come with costs to other ecosystem services (e.g., recreational fishing opportunities). Collectively, our findings demonstrate the need to consider biological outcomes when developing strategies to mitigate water quality impairment and highlight the value of physical-biological modeling approaches to agricultural and biological conservation planning in a changing climate.

AB  - Biodiversity loss due to climate change is one of the most critical current environmental problems. Global warming is causing substantial species-range shifts and local extirpations, especially for species with restricted distribution ranges. Studies of impact of the climate change on species ranges and environmental suitability have become a fundamental tool for evaluating conservation strategies. However, one important limitation of these approaches is that only species with an adequate number of spatially distinct occurrence records can be modelled, generally excluding threatened rare species from the analyses, a situation referred to as the 'rare species modelling paradox'. To overcome this limitation, we analysed the effect of climate change on the richness of threatened endemic plants of Argentina employing a macroecological modelling approach, using three different modelling techniques (generalized linear mixed models - GLMM, generalized additive models - GAM, and boosted regression trees - BRT), four general circulation models, two representative CO2 concentration pathways (RCPs), and two time periods (2050 and 2070). We identified grid cells with the greatest decline in numbers of threatened endemics, determined species composition in these cells and characterized their vulnerability using three indices. A loss of species richness is observed in ca 83% of the cells, and both protected areas and hotspots of threatened species show significant decrease in future species richness. We identified 32 most affected cells under future climatic projections, including a total of 370 threatened endemic species and exhibiting high beta diversity values (high dissimilarity) among most of the cells. Cells with the highest vulnerability were located along the Central Andes of northwestern Argentina, along the Southern Andean Yungas, High Monte and Central Andean Puna ecoregions, and including a total of 118 threatened endemics (15% of those registered for Argentina) with greater representation of Asteraceae, Apocynaceae, Cactaceae and Iridaceae. However, coverage of protected area network is less than 5% for each of these cells. Our results highlight the urgent need for both in situ and ex situ conservation policies and strategies for the vascular flora of Argentina.

AB  - Integrated management of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) in heterogeneous landscapes requires considering the potential trade-offs between conflicting objectives. The UNESCO's Biosphere Reserve zoning scheme is a suitable context to address these trade-offs by considering multiple management zones that aim to minimise conflicts between management objectives. Moreover, in Mediterranean ecosystems, management and planning also needs to consider drivers of landscape dynamics such as wildfires and traditional farming and forestry practices that have historically shaped landscapes and the biodiversity they host. In this study, we applied a conservation planning approach to prioritise the allocation of management zones under future land-scape and climate scenarios. We tested different landscape management scenarios reflecting the outcomes of climate-smart and fire-smart policies. We projected the expected landscape dynamics and associated changes on the distribution of 207 vertebrate species, 4 ES and fire hazard under each scenario. We used Marxan with Zones to allocate three management zones, replicating the Biosphere Reserves zoning scheme ("Core area", "Buffer zone" and "Transition area") to address the various management objectives within the Biosphere Reserve. Our results show that to promote ES supply and biodiversity conservation, while also minimising fire hazard, the reserve will need to: i) Redefine its zoning, especially regarding Core Areas, which need a considerable expansion to help mitigate changes in biodiversity and accommodate ES supply under expected changes in climate and species distribution. ii) Revisit current management policies that will result in encroached landscapes prone to high intensity, uncontrollable wildfires with the potential to heavily damage ecosystems and compromise the supply of ES. Our results support that both climate-and fire-smart policies in the Meseta Ibe ' rica can help develop multifunctional landscapes that help mitigate and adapt to climate change and ensure the best possible main-tenance of biodiversity and ES supply under uncertain future climate conditions.

AB  - Spatially-explicit ecosystem models are increasingly considered for informing fisheries management. The inputs of these models that determine species distributions in the modeled system are critical. There is a need for methods to estimate species distributions in spatially-explicit ecosystem models from presence-only data. To address this need, we used a method relying on binomial generalized additive models integrating environmental covariates. This method allows for the production of distribution maps for ecosystem models such as Atlantis models, and of preference functions for Ecospace models; preference functions define the preferences of species groups for certain environmental parameter values and are employed by Ecospace to allocate species group biomasses spatially. The key step of the method we used is the objective generation of pseudo-absences for each month, by sampling with replacement the centroids of the cells of fine-scale spatial grids defined for each month. To demonstrate the method, we applied it to the diving bird and surface-feeding bird groups represented in the Atlantis model for the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), and to the seabird group represented in the Ecospace model for the West Florida Shelf. We also employed the distribution maps we constructed to provide a basis for a hypothetical marine protected area (MPA) planning scenario aiming to secure food for seabirds. Specifically, we produced a hotspot map for seabirds for the U.S. GOM from the distribution map of the species group, and then combined the hotspot map for seabirds with a hotspot map for their main prey, forage fish (Clupeidae and Exocoetidae), to determine where the hotspots of seabirds and forage fish overlap. This analysis suggested that, to secure forage fish for seabirds in the U.S. GOM, hypothetical MPAs should be implemented primarily within the coastal regions of the Louisiana-Texas shelf, within the coastal region of West Florida located between Sarasota and Naples and/or within Apalachee Bay, Florida.

AB  - Aim The Arctic is one of the planet's most rapidly warming regions, with trends expected to intensify in the future. Projections of shifts in species distributional ranges under future climate change are thus far lacking for most vertebrate species using the Arctic tundra. Our aim was to assess possible climate-induced changes in distributional ranges and inter-specific overlap of an Arctic species assemblage within the world's largest land-based protected area.
   Location During 1979-2013 location data of eight Arctic birds and mammals, Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus), Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos), muskox (Ovibos moschatus), polar bear (Ursus maritimus), rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta), snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) and snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) were collected in the Northeast Greenland National Park.
   Methods The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm and Schoener's D niche overlap index were used to assess shifts and changes in overlap of species-specific distributions under recent (1979-2013) and future (2061-2080; representative concentration pathways [RCPs] 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) bioclimatic conditions.
   Results Species distributions were projected to shift northward and upwards across all scenarios, and at higher rates than previously reported. Future distributions were also forecasted to become spatially less clustered and to expand in size for all species. Species-specific shifts in distribution ranges altered inter-specific overlap, most notably by an increase in overlap under scenario RCP 8.5.
   Main conclusions The rapid shifts in distribution ranges detected here underline that climate change impacts are most pronounced in areas with higher levels of warming, leading to accelerated shifts in species' ranges towards the poles. However, the concomitant range expansions we found may suggest that future climatic conditions in north-east Greenland may not have such a detrimental impact on the distribution of cold-adapted species as generally expected, at least in the near future.

AB  - Nearshore areas represent important habitats for many species, at least for part of their life cycle. Therefore, modeling and mapping nearshore habitats is essential for natural resource management and conservation, such as determining potential impacts to marine populations and their habitats from human activities and identifying conservation measures. Although fish survey and habitat data are uncommon for nearshore areas, two regional databases, the Nearshore Fish Atlas of Alaska (NFA) and ShoreZone, provide a rare opportunity to evaluate nearshore habitats for Alaska's shallow, nearshore fish assemblages. In the present study, we used the NFA and ShoreZone databases in a practical approach to model and map Alaska nearshore fish habitats. Specifically, we fitted generalized additive models (GAMs) to NFA and ShoreZone data to map the spatial patterns of probability of encounter and density of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) early juveniles in the northern southeastern Alaska (NSEA) area and walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) early juveniles in Prince William Sound (PWS). The density of Pacific cod early juveniles was found to be high in all of the western part of the NSEA area, particularly around Port Alexander. The density hotspots of walleye pollock early juveniles were found to be located in the northern and southernmost parts of PWS. Data inventories and modeling and mapping Alaska nearshore fish habitats provide valuable information to manage marine resources and human activities (e.g., to identify the main nursery areas of commercially important species along the Alaska coastline), and allow for other important ecological and ecosystem issues to be addressed (e.g., producing marine protected area planning scenarios to protect forage fishes used by large marine predators). The NFA and ShoreZone are valuable resources, and our efforts to leverage them to model and map nearshore fish habitats establishes a reference for similar efforts throughout Alaska's regions and beyond.

AB  - Aim Refugia play a key ecological role for the persistence of biodiversity in areas subject to natural or human disturbance. Temporary freshwater ecosystems regularly experience dry periods, which constrain the availability of suitable habitats. Current and future threats (e. g. water extraction and climate change) can exacerbate the negative effects of drying conditions. This could compromise the persistence of a large proportion of global freshwater biodiversity, so the identification and protection of refugia seems an urgent task.
   Location Northern Australia.
   Methods We demonstrate a new approach to identify and prioritize the selection of refugia and apply it to the conservation of freshwater fish biodiversity. We identified refugia using estimates of water residency time derived from satellite imagery and used a systematic approach to prioritize areas that provide all the fish species inhabiting the catchment with access to a minimum number of refugia while maximizing the length of stream potentially accessible for recolonization after the dry period. These priority refugia were locked into a broader systematic conservation plan with area-based targets and direct connectivity. We accounted for current threats during the prioritization process to ensure degraded areas were avoided, thus maximizing the ecological role of priority refugia.
   Results Priority refugia were located in lowland reaches, where the incidence of threats was less prominent in our study area and headwaters in good condition. An additional set of 106 planning units (6500 km(2)) were required to represent 10% of each species' distribution in the broad conservation plan. A hierarchical management zoning scheme was applied to demonstrate how these key ecological features could be effectively protected from the major threats caused by aquatic invasive species and grazing.
   Main conclusions This new approach to identifying priority refugia and incorporating them into the conservation planning process in a systematic way would help enhance the resilience of freshwater biodiversity in temporary systems.

AB  - Quercus semecarpifolia Sm. is a multipurpose, ecologically and economically important tree species of the sub-alpine ecosystem in the Indian Himalayan Region, forming a major part of the forests between 2800 and 3700 m amsl. Because of various natural and anthropogenic factors, populations of several forest species are dwindling in the region. This warrants the study of the population status, regeneration pattern, physicochemical properties of soil, and habitat suitability model of Q. semecarpifolia in the sub-alpine ecosystem of the Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP). In total, 37 populations, representing 4 habitats and 8 aspects between 2803 and 3613 m amsl and with 20-65 degrees slope, were sampled to determine the species richness, density, total basal area, Species Diversity Index (H'), Concentration of dominance (Cd), and profile of the species. Among the populations, total tree density of Q. semecarpifolia ranged from 40 to 840 Ind ha(-1), with a total basal area of 0.01-122.58 m(2) ha(-1), total shrub density of 240-1810 Ind ha-1, total herb density of 13.8-162.3 Ind m-2, total sapling density of 10-670 Ind ha(-1), and total seedling density of 10-700 Ind ha(-1). H' of trees ranged from 0.03 to 1.84, that of saplings between 0 and 2.44, of seedlings between 0 and 0.36, of shrubs between 0.43 and 2.28, and of herbs between 1.07 and 3.33. Cd for trees ranged from 0.00 to 1.00, that for saplings from 0.00 to 1.00, for seedlings from 0.00 to 1.00, for shrubs from 0.43 to 2.28, and for herbs from 0.07 to 3.33. Most individuals were in the range 73.6-94.5 cm circumference at breast height, and the least were in the ranges 136.6-157.5 cm and = 220.6 cm. Seedlings and saplings were relatively very high in number. Tree density showed a positive correlation with total nitrogen (p = 0.01, r = 0.35, n = 37) and a negative correlation with pH (p = 0.01, r = -0.13, n = 37). The MaxEnt model calibration test for Q. semecarpifolia yielded satisfactory results (AUCmean = 0.899 +/- 0.02). The BIO19 (precipitation in the coldest quarter) variable was the most influential and contributed 76.7% to the habitat model. The model identified an area of 145 km(2) as suitable for reintroduction of the species in the GHNP. Frequent monitoring of species populations, standardization of propagation protocol for mass multiplication, awareness among the inhabitants, and establishment in in-situ and ex-situ conditions are recommended.

AB  - In Maasai Steppe, public health and economy are threatened by African Trypanosomiasis; a debilitating and fatal disease to livestock (African Animal Trypanosomiasis -AAT) and humans (Human African Trypanosomiasis-HAT), if not treated. Tsetse fly is a primary vector for both HAT and AAT and climate is an important predictor of their occurrence and parasites they carry. While understanding tsetse fly distribution is essential for informing vector and disease control strategies, existing distribution maps are old and were based on coarse spatial resolution data, consequently, inaccurate understanding vector and disease dynamics necessary to design and implement fit for purpose mitigation strategies. Also, assertion that climate change is altering tsetse fly distribution in Tanzania lacks empirical evidence. Despite tsetse fly posing public health risks and economic hardship, no study has modelled their distributions at a scale needed for local planning. This study used MaxEnt species distribution modelling (SDM) and ecological niche modeling tools to predict potential distribution of three tsetse fly species in Tanzania Maasai Steppe from current climate information and project their distributions to midcentury climatic conditions under representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 scenarios. Current climate results predicted that G. m. morsitans, G. pallidipes and G swynnertoni cover 19,225 km(2), 7,113 km(2) and 32,335 km(2) and future prediction indicated that by the year 2050, the habitable area may decrease by up to 23.13%, 12.9% and 22.8% of current habitable area respectively. This information can serve as a useful predictor of potential HAT and AAT hotspots and inform surveillance strategies. Distribution maps generated by this study can be useful in guiding tsetse fly control managers, health, livestock and wildlife officers when setting surveys and surveillance programs. The maps can also inform protected area managers a potential encroachment into the protected area (PAs) due to shrinkage of tsetse fly habitats outside PAs.
   Author summary
   Spatial variation of African Trypanosomiasis burden depends on distribution of biotopes necessary for tsetse flies to thrive. Therefore, mapping the occurrence of the tsetse fly species is a useful predictor of African Trypanosomiasis transmission risk areas. Climate is a major determining factor for occurrence and survival of tsetse fly, the vector responsible for both HAT and AAT. Since resources for prevention and control of tsetse fly species and the disease they transmit are generally scarce in endemic settings, understanding potential impacts of climate change on tsetse fly species distribution in space and time is essential for informing coherent strategies for vector and disease control at a local scale.

AB  - Species distribution data are critical information sources when it comes to implementing the multiple Aichi Targets set by the international Convention on Biological Diversity. Although there have been international-scale efforts to aggregate distribution data, the magnitudes and locations of the gaps in biodiversity knowledge remain unclear. In this study, we use a large database, including over 200 000 species occurrence records, to identify knowledge gaps in biodiversity inventories for nine animal taxa in a Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot. Spatial modelling methods were employed to relate the completeness of inventories to population, road and protected area density. The completeness of faunistic inventories was correlated with the amount of protected areas, roads and population density. Despite more than 200 years of faunistic sampling, knowledge of the distributions of most animal taxa is still limited, especially for invertebrates. As the window of opportunity for achieving Aichi Targets 11 and 19 begins to close, means of filling such knowledge gaps are required. We argue that a combination of quantitative tools and citizen science data collection programmes may help inform conservation decisions.

AB  - Many developing countries lack information to manage their endangered species, urging the need for affordable and reliable information. We used Bayesian hierarchical spatial models, with oceanographic variables, to predict the distribution range of Epinephelus marginatus, the dusky grouper, for the entire Southwest Atlantic. Weran a model using scientific information gathered from the literature and another using information gathered from fishers on species presence or absence. In both models, temperature was an important determinant of species occurrence. The predicted occurrence of the dusky grouper overlapped widely (Schoener's D = 0.71; Warren's I = 0.91) between the models, despite small differences on the southern and northern extremes of the distribution. These results suggest that basic information provided by fishers on species occurrence in their area can be reliable enough to predict species occurrence over large scales and can be potentially useful for marine spatial planning. Fishers' knowledge may be an even more viable alternative to data collection than what was previously thought, for countries that both struggle with financial limitations and have urgent conservation needs.

AB  - DNA-based techniques are important tools for species assignment, in particular when identification with morphological criteria is difficult. The aim of this study was to genetically determine the species identity of tree frogs (Hyla spp.) populations from western and northern Switzerland (Swiss Plateau), this area being frequently subjected to introductions of species or sub-species from south of the Alps. We sequenced 261 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene from 24 samples of tree frogs from the Swiss Plateau, Ticino (southern Switzerland) and the Dombes region (Ain, France), and compared them with homologous sequences retrieved from DNA databases. The phylogenetic analyses revealed two distinct clades. The first one is represented by samples of Green tree frog (Hyla arborea) from the Swiss Plateau, France, Germany and Greece, confirming the current knowledge about the species' distribution. The second clade includes samples belonging to the Italian tree frog (Hyla intermedia) from south of the Alps (Ticino and Italy), and unexpectedly from the Grangettes site in western Switzerland. These results suggest the introduction of the Italian tree frog H. intermedia north of the Alps, and raise questions about the management of the Grangettes protected area.

AB  - India harbours the largest wild tiger population in the world and Tropical Dry Forest areas constitute the largest habitat for them. Recent extinctions, however, from two high profile tiger reserves, highlight the vulnerability of tiger in this habitat Our examination of historic range areas for tigers shows that populations are disappearing at a faster rate in Tropical Dry Forest (64% sites suffering local extinction in 100 years) than in any other suitable habitat in India. Focusing on data from the Tropical Dry Forest of Panna Tiger Reserve in central India, we examine the spatial ecology of the tiger population prior to its local extinction. We analyse home range sizes, overlaps and shifts, as well as the range expansion and contraction of radio-collared tigers between 1996 and 2005. In this reserve, the average annual home range sizes for both males (n = 2) and females (n = 4) were three to four times larger than those reported so far from other tropical habitats in India male: mean 179.3 +/- 11.8 km(2) (95% Fixed kernel; n = 7); female: mean 46.6 +/- 3.7 km(2); (95% Fixed kernel; n = 16). Adult female home ranges were exclusive and overlapped little with neighbouring female ranges (3 +/- 1.46%, n = 6). Male home ranges were not exclusive: resident floater males shared space with territorial males and mated with resident females. Home ranges of all breeding radio-collared tigers extended beyond the protected area boundary and were exposed to edge effects that exist at the periphery and outside. With such spatial use patterns, security and management measures provided within the boundary are unlikely to be very successful in protecting the population. Protected Areas in Tropical Dry Forest across India are relatively small (366.92 +/- 422.12 km(2) SD) and historical trends point towards a scale-mismatch that exists between the size of Protected Areas and the space use requirements of tigers. This scale mismatch adds to the vulnerability of existing small populations and perhaps explains why tiger populations in Tropical Dry Forest have disappeared at a faster rate than in any other tiger habitat of the sub-continent.

AB  - Planning conservation actions requires detailed information on species' geographic distribution. Species distribution data are most needed in areas hosting unique or endangered biodiversity. Italy is one of the European countries with the highest levels of herpetological diversity and endemism and is home to several threatened species of amphibians and reptiles. Information on the distribution of species' habitats can help identify sites where the species is most likely to thrive, as viable populations depend on it. Area of Habitat (AOH) maps reveal the distribution of the habitat available to the species within their geographic range. We produced high resolution, freely accessible global area of habitat maps for 60 species of reptiles and amphibians distributed in Italy, which represent 60% of all Italian amphibian and reptile species. We validated a total of 44 AOH maps through a presence-only based evaluation method, with 86% of these maps showing a performance better than expected by chance. AOH maps can be used as a reference for conservation planning, as well as to investigate macroecological patterns of Italian herpetofauna. Furthermore, AOH maps can help monitoring habitat loss, which is known to be a major threat to many reptile and amphibian species in Europe.

AB  - The contiguous United States population of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis Kerr) is listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act. However, the historic distribution of lynx in the Northeast is poorly understood. We used museum records, bibliographic records, and interviews to reconstruct the past distribution of lynx in Maine, which is at the current southern limit of the species' distribution in the eastern United States. We found a total of 118 records, representing at least 509 lynx in Maine. Lynx were observed throughout Maine, 1833-1912, with the exception of coastal areas. After 1913, lynx were most common in the forests of western and northern Maine, and absent to rare along the coast, but had not returned to southern Maine by 1999. Thirty-nine kittens representing at least 21 litters were distributed throughout northern and western Maine, 1864-1999. Populations apparently fluctuated, and in some years 200-300 lynx were harvested in Maine. Prior to the 1900s, lynx were much more widely distributed in the Northeast, ranging from Pennsylvania north into Quebec. Because Canada lynx have had a long presence in northern New England, and at times were relatively common, this species merits serious consideration in conservation planning in this region.

AB  - The distribution of living organisms, habitats and ecosystems is primarily driven by abiotic environmental factors that are spatially structured. Assessing the spatial structure of environmental factors, e.g., through spatial autocorrelation analyses (SAC), can thus help us understand their scale of influence on the distribution of organisms, habitats, and ecosystems. Yet SAC analyses of environmental factors are still rarely performed in biogeographic studies. Here, we describe a novel framework that combines SAC and statistical clustering to identify scales of spatial patterning of environmental factors, which can then be interpreted as the scales at which those factors influence the geographic distribution of biological and ecological features. We illustrate this new framework with datasets at different spatial or thematic resolutions. This framework is conceptually and statistically robust, providing a valuable approach to tackle a wide range of issues in ecological and environmental research and particularly when building predictors for ecological models. The new framework can significantly promote fundamental research on all spatially-structured ecological patterns. It can also foster research and application in such fields as global change ecology, conservation planning, and landscape management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tree distribution has been considered crucial to assess the relationships between species occurrence and changing climate across the globe, and accordingly in designing the conservation action plans. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand the most influential parameters for tree species distribution and its regeneration pattern. We used National Forest Inventory data collected in Western Himalaya (WH) and environmental parameters to reveal the aforesaid relationship and pattern. Three topographical factors (altitude, aspect, and slope), four major climatic variables (temperature, temperature seasonality, precipitation and its seasonality) and four edaphic factors (soil depth, soil humus, soil consistency and soil coarse fragments) were considered. The results indicated that the altitude and temperature were the major determining factors followed by temperature seasonality in shaping the distribution of major tree species in WH. The study also indicated an upward shift of regenerating individuals of these tree species toward higher altitude. These information about the extent of current tree distribution and their regeneration over the last one and half decade might help in systematic conservation planning and monitoring tree range dynamics under climate change scenario.

AB  - phylin is a package for the r programming environment which offers different methods to spatially interpolate genetic information from phylogeographic data. These interpolations can be used to predict the spatial occurrence of different lineages within a phylogeny using a modified method of kriging, which allows the usage of a genetic distance matrix to derive a model of spatial dependence. phylin improves the available methods to generate interpolated surfaces from a phylogenetic trees by assessing the autocorrelation structure of the genetic information, interpolating the genetic data based on a statistical model, estimating the uncertainty of the predictions and identifying lineage occurrence and contact zones probability without projection of pairwise genetic distances into mid-points between sample locations. The package also includes methods to plot interpolation surfaces and provide summary tables from the generated data and models. We provide an example of the usefulness of this tool by inferring the spatial occurrence of distinct historical evolutionary lineages of the Lataste's viper (Vipera latastei Bosca, 1878) in the Iberian Peninsula and identifying potential contact areas. The maps of phylogenetic patterns obtained with these methods provide a spatial context to test hypotheses related to processes underlying the geographic distribution of genetic diversity and to inform conservation planning.

AB  - The data in this article provide information about the species richness of each political unit in Myanmar and their preliminary conservation status. The dataset was compiled by gathering scattered data from different sources. The majority of the data were compiled from the authors' collections and historical and recent floristic treatments. Online databases and herbarium specimens were additional resources used for data compilation. In total, 603 species were documented and species names were standardized in accordance with the International Plant Names Index and Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group. Species composition between political units was calculated using the minimum variance of the Jaccard's dissimilarity matrix. Conservation status for 558 pteridophyte species from Myanmar was evaluated based on the global occurrences and occurrences only in Myanmar, and species with less than three occurrences were excluded from the analysis. This dataset can be applied as the reference data for future taxonomic revisions, biodiversity assessments, and conservation planning. Moreover, the data can be used for global diversity assessment, broad-scale species distribution modeling and bioclimatic modeling. The data provided in this manuscript have been analyzed and discussed in Khine and Schneider [1]. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Black Sea remains one of the most fragile marine systems globally. The six countries that share the coastline of this semi-enclosed sea have declared, through the Convention on Biological Diversity and regional conventions, their intention to conserve biodiversity and increase the coverage of the protected areas. However, currently only a small proportion of the marine area is under protection. Here, we spatially delineated priority conservation sites that could ensure species protection under the impact of different threats. We developed a cumulative risk index, incorporating anthropogenic pressures related to pollution and fisheries. We then combined this information with distribution data of marine species to apply a systematic conservation planning approach. We identified eleven key areas that cover 10% of the Black Sea, the protection of which could attain realistic conservation targets. These sites are mainly located in neritic and coastal habitats, which also host a number of species that avoid the anoxic part of the ocean basin. The management and efficient protection of these key areas require international collaboration, representing the only way to alleviate the severe degradation of this sensitive, but valuable, marine system.

AB  - Ecosystem distributions are expected to shift as a result of global warming, raising concerns about the long-term utility of reserve systems based on coarse-filter ecosystem representation. We tested the extent to which proportional ecosystem representation targets would be maintained under a changing climate by projecting the distribution of the major ecosystems of Alberta, Canada, into the future using bioclimatic envelope models and then calculating the composition of reserves in successive periods. We used the Marxan conservation planning software to generate the suite of reserve systems for our test, varying the representation target and degree of reserve clumping. Our climate envelope projections for the 2080s indicate that virtually all reserves will, in time, be comprised of different ecosystem types than today. Nevertheless, our proportional targets for ecosystem representation were maintained across all time periods, with only minor exceptions. We hypothesize that this stability in representation arises because ecosystems may be serving as proxies for land facets, the stable abiotic landscape features that delineate major arenas of biological activity. The implication is that accommodating climate change may not require abandoning the conventional ecosystem-based approach to reserve design in favour of a strictly abiotic approach, since the two approaches may be largely synonymous.

AB  - Evolutionary and genetic knowledge is increasingly being valued in conservation theory, but is rarely considered in conservation planning and policy. Here, we integrate phylogenetic diversity (PD) with spatial reserve prioritization to evaluate how well the existing reserve system in Victoria, Australia captures the evolutionary lineages of eucalypts, which dominate forest canopies across the state. Forty-three per cent of remaining native woody vegetation in Victoria is located in protected areas (mostly national parks) representing 48% of the extant PD found in the state. A modest expansion in protected areas of 5% (less than 1% of the state area) would increase protected PD by 33% over current levels. In a recent policy change, portions of the national parks were opened for development. These tourism development zones hold over half the PD found in national parks with some species and clades falling entirely outside of protected zones within the national parks. This approach of using PD in spatial prioritization could be extended to any clade or area that has spatial and phylogenetic data. Our results demonstrate the relevance of PD to regional conservation policy by highlighting that small but strategically located areas disproportionally impact the preservation of evolutionary lineages.

AB  - Viability analysis of well-selected focal species can complement ecosystem-level conservation planning by revealing thresholds in habitat area and landscape connectivity. Mammalian carnivores are good candidates for focal species because their distributional patterns often strongly reflect regional-scale population processes. We incorporated focal species analysis of four carnivore species, fisher (Martes pennanti), lynx (Lynx canadensis), wolverine (Gulo gulo), and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), into a regional conservation plan for the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada. We developed empirical habitat models for fisher, lynx, and wolverine based on a geographically extensive data set of trapping and sighting records. Predictor variables derived directly from satellite imagery were significantly correlated with carnivore distribution and allowed us to predict distribution in areas lacking detailed vegetation data. Although we lacked similar distributional data for grizzly bear, we predicted bear habitat by adapting and extrapolating previously published, regional-scale habitat models. Predicted habitat for grizzly bear has high overlap with that for wolverine, intermediate overlap with fisher, and low overlap with lynx. High-quality habitats for fisher and lynx, unlike those for wolverine and grizzly bear, are not strongly associated with low levels of human population and roads. Nevertheless, they are naturally fragmented by topography and vegetation gradients and are poorly represented in existing protected areas. Areas with high biological productivity and low human impact are valuable habitat for all four species but are limited in extent. Predicted habitat values for lynx and wolverine are significantly correlated with trapping data from an area outside the extent of the original data set. This supports the use of empirical distribution models as the initial stage in a regional-scale monitoring program. Our results suggest that a comprehensive conservation strategy for carnivores in the region must consider the needs of several species, rather than a single, presumed umbrella species. Coordinated planning across multiple ownerships is necessary to prevent further fragmentation of carnivore habitat, especially in the U.S.-Canada border region.

AB  - The Habitats Directive of the European Union is a key legislative instrument in Europe, supporting the conservation of rare, threatened or endemic species. It aims at ensuring that the species listed in the Annexes of the Habitats Directive show a favourable conservation status, i.e., that they are able to maintain viable populations and that their natural range is sufficient and not decreasing currently, nor will in the future. However, climate change may hamper Habitats Directive species in achieving (or maintaining) a favourable conservation status, particularly when these impacts are amplified by adverse land use. Here, we studied Habitats Directive species in Finland for which >= 70% of the occurrences were recorded with the resolution of <= 100 m. The number of occurrence sites for the 52 species studied ranged from one site to 13,653 sites, summing up to 19,367 sites. For all these sites and their surroundings, we assessed the vulnerabilities caused by climate change and land use. The climate exposure of occurrence sites was measured based on the rapidity of climatic changes (i.e. climate velocity) in three climate variables (growing degree days, mean January air temperature, water balance) at each site. Risks caused by land use were assessed using two negative and four positive variables that respectively described the quantity of land cover and habitats that is either harmful (e.g. clear-cut forest and drained peatlands) or supportive (protected areas and suitable habitats) to species occurrences. To complement climate and land-use variables, three additional variables describing protection status of the sites and the number of occurrences of the same species in the landscape were examined. Comparison of the mean vulnerability values for each species showed that some of the species inhabit, on average, areas with high climate exposure. Moreover, in certain species climate change-induced vulnerabilities consistently coincide with negative land use. However, in many of the 52 species there was large variation in the vulnerability levels between individual occurrence sites, concerning both climate exposure and land-use variables. Considering the vulnerabilities due to climate change separately, 40-60% of the species occurrence sites are expected to face high exposure caused by rapid changes in summer or winter temperatures, which presents challenges in maintaining a favourable conservation status. Our results also revealed numerous species occurrences where high climate velocity coincided with a large amount of negative land use and low amount of suitable habitat, for which climate-wise conservation planning could be targeted.

AB  - During the last decades, the Amazon rainforest underwent uncontrolled exploitation that modified its environmental variables. The current paper analyzes the spatiotemporal dynamics of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), and surface albedo, and temperature in two different vegetation covers, preserved and deforested areas. We calculated the remote-sensing products using Landsat 5 TM images obtained during the dry season 1984, 1991, 2000, and 2011 of the central region of the State of Rondonia, Brazil. The results showed a reduction of vegetation indexes NDVI (similar to 0.70 in 1984 to similar to 0.27 in 2011) and LAI (similar to 1.8 in 1984 to similar to 0.3 in 2011), with an increase of surface albedo (0.12 in 1984 to 0.20 in 2011) and temperature (similar to 24 degrees C in 1984 to 30 degrees C in 2011) as the effect of the rainforest converted in grassland during the study period. No changes in any variables were observed in the protected area. Forest conversion into grassland resulted in a decrease of 69% in NDVI and 110% in LAI and a rise of 59% and 24% in albedo and surface temperature, respectively.

AB  - The coastline of northern Australia may be a refuge for elasmobranchs threatened or extirpated from much of their former ranges across South-East Asia. In this study, we used baited remote underwater video stations to survey the abundance, size and assemblage of elasmobranchs in the Cobourg Marine Park in northern Australia. Two sites were sampled inside the park and one site was sampled outside the park, covering two management zones: open and partially protected. During the austral summer, 85 individuals of 12 species of elasmobranch were observed over 12 days. No significant differences were observed among sites in either size or abundance for common species. Videos were dominated by Carcharhinus melanopterus (relative abundance +/- s.d., 0.29 +/- 0.90 h(-1)), Nebrius ferrugineus (0.03 +/- 0.24 h(-1)) and Urogymnus granulatus (0.08 +/- 0.28 h(-1)), which comprised >81% of all individuals. Environmental variables had no measurable effect on the abundance of elasmobranchs. The abundance and diversity of elasmobranchs in Cobourg Marine Park is high compared with other similar turbid, inshore areas of northern Australia. The large number of juveniles observed in our surveys also suggests the possibility of a nursery area.

AB  - Vast areas of forests in North-eastern Ethiopia have been replaced by cropland, shrub land or grazing areas. Thus, information about how vegetation composition and structure varies with disturbance is fundamental to conservation of such areas. This study aimed to investigate the effects of disturbance on the population structure and regeneration potential of five dominant woody species within forest where local communities harvest wood and graze livestock. Vegetation structure and environmental variables were assessed in 50 quadrats (20mx20m). In most of both disturbed and undisturbed treatments, Juniperus procera was the highest contributor to the basal area of the forest, while that of Olinia rochetiana was the lowest. Analysis of population structure showed high density at lower Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and low density at higher DBH classes. Undisturbed forest treatments had 84% canopy cover, 22m mean vegetation height and a density of 1320 trees of dominant species and 1024 seedlings/saplings ha(-1). In disturbed habitats, canopy cover (73%), mean vegetation height (18m) and density of dominant trees and saplings were significantly lower than in undisturbed habitats. Thus, to ensure species, survival and maintain species diversity managed use of the protected area is essential.

AB  - A novel embedded sensor network records changes in key climatic-environmental variables over a range of altitude in the BaekduDaegan Mountain (BDM) of Gangwon Province in Korea, a protected mountain region with unique biodiversity undergoing climate change research. The investigated area is subdivided into three horizontal north-south study areas. Three variables, temperature (T, A degrees C), relative humidity (RH, %), and light intensity (LI, lumens m(-2), or lux, lx), have been continuously measured at hourly intervals from June, 2010 to September, 2011 using HOBO H8 devices at 10 fixed study sites. These hourly observations are aggregated to monthly, seasonal and annual mean values, and results are summarized to inaugurate a long-term climate change investigation. A region wide T difference in accordance with altitude, or lapse rate, over the interval is calculated as 0.4A degrees C 100 m(-1). T lapse rates change seasonally, with winter lapse rates being greater than those of summer. RH is elevated in summer compared to other seasons. LI within forestland is lower during summer and higher during other seasons. The obtained results could closely relate to the vegetation type and structure and the terrain state since data loggers were located in forestland.

AB  - Despite the high number of fish species described for the Amazon region, the ichthyofauna that inhabits the depths of the main channels of large tropical rivers is one of the least known. In order to know the diversity patterns of these fish in whitewater rivers of the Central Amazon, we used data from the main channel benthic fish assemblage of the Japur??, Purus and Madeira rivers and tested the hypothesis that there are marked spatial and seasonal differences in the composition of the fish community among them. For this, we used a multivariate dispersion test, total 3 diversity and its decomposition into local (LCBD) and species contribution to 3 diversity (SCBD). Additionally, we tested for relationships between LCBD values and richness, total abundance, and environmental variables. We categorized species with higher SCBD values into resident or migratory to investigate the potential importance of floodplains to benthic fish assemblage of the main channel of whitewater rivers. Our results corroborate the proposed hypothesis, showing that there are seasonal and inter-river differences in benthic ichthyofauna, being more evident for the Purus River. LCBD showed strong negative relationships with species richness and total abundance, particularly in the Japur?? and Madeira rivers in rising season, indicating that rivers and season with high uniqueness in their composition also had low richness and abundance. LCBD was negatively correlated with conductivity and pH, which increased with declining these environmental variables, as observed mainly in Japur?? River in both seasons. Approximately one third of the species had higher than average SCBD values and were considered major contributors to 3 diversity, as well as classified as migratory. This demonstrates the importance of conducting studies that use spatial and seasonal variables, in addition to including the background fish fauna in conservation studies, expanding the protected area and taking into account the different patterns of diversity between rivers. Furthermore, these differences in assemblage composition might be explained by the asymmetrical spatial use of habitats during different seasons, strongly suggesting the importance of the flood-pulse cycle for maintaining diversity in this environment.

AB  - Overlapping interests between humankind and nature have resulted in humans and wildlife interacting. These interactions usually emanate from the absence of fences or hard boundaries to restrict animal movement and when this happens, it results in Human Carnivore Conflict (HCC). People residing in areas adjacent to protected areas are the ones mostly at risk of HCC. In this study, we used ensemble modelling to explain predation risk and indicate the key drivers of HCC in Matetsi Communal Area, Zimbabwe. Ensemble modelling involves building a single consensus model from several candidate models. We used seven environmental variables for the modelling process, and these were distance from the park boundary, distance from rivers, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), human population density and livestock density for cattle, goats and sheep. Livestock kill sites were used as the presence data. Our results illustrate that ensemble modelling explains predation risk with a true skill statistic (TSS) of 0.9 for Matetsi Communal Area. This study provides the potential application of ensemble modelling in HCC management through identifying predation risk areas. In identifying predation risk areas, proactive and cost-efficient management strategies for dealing with HCC in specific high-risk areas are plausible.

AB  - Arid lands provide several products and services to humankind, but human activities affect this environment, increasing the extinction risk of the native species. Thus, to successfully conserve the biodiversity of these ecosystems, it is necessary to identify which environmental factors influence the spatial distribution of the organisms that offer these benefits. Darkling beetles play a relevant role on the functioning of deserts. Although these insects are among the most abundant and diverse in these environments, there is no agreement on the relative importance that different environmental factors have as determinants of their spatial distribution. In this work, we assessed the role of climate, vegetation, and soil variables as factors that determine distribution patterns of darkling beetles within the Natural Protected Area Peninsula Valdes (Northeastern Patagonia). Five groups of environmental units were identified, each one with an exclusive tenebrionid species assemblage and different species diversity. The most influential environmental variables were temperature, precipitations, and soil texture. Results suggest that the magnitude of several ecosystem processes may vary among the groups of environmental units. We recommend prioritizing the conservation of the five groups of environmental units and incorporating the darkling beetles-environment relationship in future conservation strategies for arid Patagonia.

AB  - Diatom assemblages were investigated in 16 springs and five streams of the Dolomiti Bellunesi National Park (south-eastern Alps Italy), by collecting individual samples of the main substrata (stones, bryophytes, surface sediment), and measuring an extensive number of morphological, physical, and chemical variables. An empirical grouping of these aquatic ecosystems, based mainly on morphological features and physical paramerters, mostly agreed with groupings produced by non-metric multidimensional scaling. Significant differences among the diatom assemblages were found among the groups identified: however, these differences were most significant in the epilithic than in the epiphytic assemblages. Epiphytic and epilithic diatoms differed significantly according to: a) the identity of several species. b) the relative abundance of some other species, c) the Bray-Curtis distance between the assemblages, and d) taxa richness and diversity index. However, on studying species composition by canonical analysis, with reference to environmental variables (here called macrohabitat) on the one hand, and the type of substrata (stones and mosses) on the other, it was shown that the macrohabitat was responsible for more than 40% of the variability among diatom assemblages, whereas the microhabitat (i.e. different substrata) accounted for only 3%. Multivariate analyses (CCA) showed that the environmental factors most influential in structuring diatom assemblages were substrate particle size (influenced in turn by current velocity), permanence of flow, shade, nitrates, and total phosphorus. Characteristic groups of species were identified in the different morphological and hydrological types of springs and streams. Stream sites were often affected to a certain extent by organic pollution, even within the protected area, and consequently colonized by cosmopolitan, eutraphentic or tolerant taxa. In springs, in addition to common and widely distributed species, many poorly known, rare, or Red List species were found, in particular among the less abundant taxa. Our study therefore highlights the important role of springs as valuable habitats for the conservative of aquatic biodiversity.

AB  - Aim The Marine Ecoregions of the World (MEOW) system delineates the oceans into 232 ecoregions. Here, we aimed to evaluate the suitability of this system to represent species distributions within Indo-West Australian waters, explore alternative ecoregions and new subecoregions and investigate environmental variables that are correlated with species distributions within those waters.
   Location Indo-West Australia.
   Taxon Vertebrates, invertebrates, marine plants.
   Methods We downloaded occurrence data for 14,513 marine species from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System. We analysed differences in species composition among nine ecoregions within Indo-West Australian waters using pairwise permutational multivariate analysis of variance to evaluate how well the MEOW system represents species distributions within those waters. We delineated subecoregions within each distinct ecoregion using hierarchical cluster analysis with the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages. We analysed relationships between environmental variables and species composition using distance-based linear models.
   Results Species composition was significantly different among ecoregions, except for three adjacent regions, which were combined into a single large ecoregion. Hence, seven distinct ecoregions were further analysed. Our study identified 13 subecoregions within these ecoregions that each separate into 'inshore' and 'offshore' zones. Depth explained the most variation in species composition of the combined taxa and sea surface temperature was the most important parameter in explaining the variability in most taxa.
   Main Conclusion The MEOW system did not represent well the distribution of marine species within Indo-West Australian waters. Alternatively, we show that those waters encompass seven distinct ecoregions with 13 subecoregions. The main environmental drivers of species distributions could be depth and sea surface temperature. The proposed ecoregions and subecoregions allow us to improve the biogeographic hypotheses for understanding the evolution of marine species and identify representative marine habitats and species composition for the setting of Marine Protected Area networks within Indo-West Australian waters.

AB  - Introduction: Numbers of alien plant species are rising around the globe, but not all of them become invasive. Whereas introductions have been documented for several decades in some regions of the world, knowledge on alien species in Western Mexico is limited. Here, we study roadside vegetation along an elevational gradient, which includes a protected area.
   Objective: We analysed the floristic composition of herbaceous alien species, their distribution patterns, and their relationship with various environmental factors. A relative importance value index (IVI) identified the most important and, therefore, probably invasive taxa.
   Methods: During 2017 and 2018, roadside vegetation was documented with 4-6 transects every 300 altitudinal meters, from 0 to 2 100 m, for a total of 37 transects. Each transect consisted of five 1 m(2) plots. All herbaceous species were registered and alien taxa identified. A cluster analysis distinguished grouping of species based on elevation. The potentially invasive species were identified by their IVI, based on the sum of relative frequency and density values. The influence of environmental variables was analysed with a canonical correspondence analysis.
   Results: Most alien species were grasses; other families were represented by one or two species. The species were grouped into three main clusters. The fast group included rare species, the second consisted of species restricted to higher altitudes, and the third group were tropical taxa with a distribution from sea level to medium altitudes. The most important potentially invasive species were: Urochloa maxima, Melinis repens. Eragrostis ciliaris and Cynodon dacrylon, all African grasses introduced for grazing. The IVI of the species was related to tree cover, leaf litter depth and surface stone cover for some species and, for others, to soil compaction, distance to major roads and elevation.
   Conclusions: The alien ruderal species clustered according to the general climate (temperate vs. tropical). Grasses of African origin are of highest concern as invasive species. Although most introductions are related to human disturbance, each species becomes dominant under certain environmental conditions. Thus, management programs must be specifically adjusted to each individual invasive alien.

AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the extent and distribution of an OSPAR priority habitat under current baseline ocean temperatures; to illustrate the prospect for habitat loss under a changing ocean temperature scenario; and to demonstrate the potential application of predictive habitat mapping in "future-proofing" conservation and biodiversity management. Maxent modelling and GIS environmental envelope analysis of the biogenic bed forming species, Modiolus modiolus was carried out. The Maxent model was tested and validated using 75%/25% training/test occurrence records and validated against two sampling biases (the whole study area and a 20km buffer). The model was compared to the envelope analysis and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Area Under the curve; AUC) was evaluated. The performance of the Maxent model was rated as 'good' to 'excellent' on all replicated runs and low variation in the runs was recorded from the AUC values. The extent of "most suitable", "less suitable" and "unsuitable" habitat was calculated for the baseline year (2009) and the projected increased ocean temperature scenarios (2030, 2050, 2080 and 2100). A loss of 100% of "most suitable" habitat was reported by 2080. Maintaining a suitable level of protection of marine habitats/species of conservation importance may require management of the decline and migration rather than maintenance of present extent. Methods applied in this study provide the initial application of a plausible "conservation management tool".

AB  - Ecoregions are increasingly being used as a framework for conservation planning. The Mid-Boreal Uplands Ecoregion stretches across Canada from Manitoba to British Columbia. From the perspective of conservation and to understand the dynamics of plant diversity and community composition in a common wetland type, we examined the plant communities and environmental variables in 80 wooded moderate-rich fens within this ecoregion. Regional diversity totalled 273 species, with 86 bryophytes and 187 vascular plants. Total diversity was greatest in Manitoba and decreased in a longitudinal trend west through Saskatchewan and Alberta. This may be related, in part, to orographic precipitation at Manitoba sites and a gradient of growing degree days. Richness of locally rare vascular plants exhibited a clear west to east gradient. Ten species of provincially rare vascular plants were observed across the ecoregion, but without pattern. Ordinations and other analyses revealed distinct plant communities for all three locations, with vascular plant assemblages more discrete than bryophyte assemblages. Bryophyte diversity increased with latitude and longitude, whereas vascular plant diversity decreased. Additionally, elevation, precipitation, surface water alkalinity, water temperature, percent overstory density, and peat organic C played a role in determining species richness and community composition. Overall, species composition and diversity in a single wetland type exhibited continuous change across multiple political jurisdictions at the ecoregion scale. Conservation plans for wetlands at the ecodistrict scale may be preferable.

AB  - South Africa has committed to address freshwater conservation at the catchment scale, using a combination of landscape-level and species-level features as surrogates of freshwater biodiversity. To support this work, we examined fishes in the Olifants River catchment, where multiple anthropogenic pressures affect streams. Patterns in fish assemblage data across 88 sites were analysed and related to landscape environmental variables using statistical techniques of multivariate ordination, cluster analysis, and regression tree analysis. We identified 6 distinct fish assemblage types, which were separated by altitude and human influence, primarily dry-land cropping and dams. In the tipper reaches of the catchment, we identified a faunal shift from Barbus neefi, which occurred in less impacted sites, to B. anoplus and Tilapia sparrmanii, which were favored in cropland and mixed cropland/urban settings, respectively. The fish assemblage of the middle section of the catchment was not unique, but supported one species, Chiloglanis pretoriae, that could be considered a focal species for conservation. The low altitude, high-runoff section of the catchment supported the most species. However, species richness increased in association with dams, through the addition of species that are more tolerant of flow and physicochemical modifications. Thus, species richness may not be an optimal conservation target for this system. Rather, a series of indicators will be necessary to track and measure conservation success in the Olifants catchment.

AB  - Questions: The objectives of this study were to clarify the extent to which environmental factors and geographical distance account for tropical floristic composition, and propose a methodology for delimiting the boundaries of floristic types based on species similarity.
   Location: The Panama Canal watershed.
   Methods: To assess which factors (climate, topography, geology and geographical distance) account for floristic composition, we performed Mantel tests on distance matrices and partitioned variation in species composition using canonical analysis. We used a permutation-based regression model computed on distance matrices and a hierarchical clustering of the tree composition to construct a predictive map of forest types of the Panama Canal Watershed.
   Results: We found that spatial variation alone explained 22-27% of species variation, while the fraction of species variation explained by environmental variables was smaller (10-12%); 13-19% of the variation was accounted for by the joint effect of environmental variation and geographic distance. The similarity-based map emphasizes the principal division in tree flora between the drier Pacific side and the wetter Caribbean slopes.
   Conclusions: The distribution of Panamanian tree species appears to be primarily determined by dispersal limitation, then by environmental heterogeneity. 'Environmental segregation' processes do play an important role. Maps of broad-scale vegetation patterns based on thorough tree inventories can be used in conservation planning in the tropics.

AB  - Seamounts and oceanic islands rise from the seafloor and provide suitable habitat for a diverse range of biological assemblages including Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs). Whilst they have been the focus of some work globally, there has been little description of the biological and physical environments of seamounts in the South Atlantic Ocean. In this study, we characterized benthic assemblage composition from 13 seamounts and oceanic islands spanning 8-40 degrees S within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Ascension Island, Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha. Drop camera imagery was collected between 170 and 1000 m. All fauna present in images were identified and quantified, and multivariate statistics were used to describe biological assemblages and identify their environmental drivers. Benthic communities of temperate regions (Tristan da Cunha archipelago) were shown to be distinct from those found in the tropics, with latitude and depth identified as key environmental drivers of assemblage composition. Our results are consistent with the current understanding of the biogeography of the South Atlantic, both in terms of the distinction between tropical and temperate regions, and the influence of depth and water mass structure on assemblage distribution. Faunal assemblages are similar to those observed in the North Atlantic in terms of functional groups. VMEs are present within the EEZs of all three territories and are potentially protected from some threats by large marine protected areas (MPAs). Our imagery, data and analyses provide a baseline for south Atlantic seamounts so that future monitoring can establish whether existing protected status is sufficient to conserve both unique biodiversity and considerable potential for vital ecosystem services.

AB  - The magnitude and direction of an invasive species' impact may be determined by its co-existence and interaction with other species. In Argentina, wild boar, red deer, and fallow deer are introduced mammals that have important negative impacts on ecosystems. In Patagonia, nonnative Pinaceae removal programs have been promoted since the 1980s to control exotic conifers and restore native vegetation. The consequences of removing exotic trees without continued management intervention may be unexpected due novel interactions between nonnative species. We evaluate habitat use of introduced ungulates, interactions with native and exotic plants, and their implications for restoration objectives in areas where pines have been removed. Exotic plant species richness and abundance was greater in clear-cuts than native forest or pine plantations. In contrast, richness and abundance of native plants was highest in native forests. Clear-cuts had the highest plant species diversity, primarily driven by high numbers of exotics, relative to native forests. Boar and deer were recorded in clear-cuts, native forests, and pine plantations, but deer were more frequently observed in clear-cuts. Removal of pines created a suitable habitat for deer. The herbivory pressure of deer, coupled with the presence and abundance of invasive plants, can prevent or hinder the establishment and development of native shrubs and trees that are required for the structure and function of the native ecosystem. Although the conditions in clear-cuts present complex challenges for natural regeneration, these sites could be an excellent opportunity for active restoration strategies, by excluding ungulates and controlling exotic plants to promote native species recovery.

AB  - The population dynamics of shark species are generally poorly described because highly mobile marine life is challenging to investigate. Here we investigate the genetic population structure of the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) in French Polynesia. Five demes were sampled from five islands with different inter-island distances (50-1500 km). Whether dispersal occurs between islands frequently enough to prevent moderate genetic structure is unknown. We used 11 microsatellites loci from 165 individuals and a strong genetic structure was found among demes with both F-statistics and Bayesian approaches. This differentiation is correlated with the geographic distance between islands. It is likely that the genetic structure seen is the result of all or some combination of the following: low gene flow, time since divergence, small effective population sizes, and the standard issues with the extent to which mutation models actually fit reality. We suggest low levels of gene flow as at least a partial explanation of the level of genetic structure seen among the sampled blacktip demes. This explanation is consistent with the ecological traits of blacktip reef sharks, and that the suitable habitat for blacktips in French Polynesia is highly fragmented. Evidence for spatial genetic structure of the blacktip demes we studied highlights that similar species may have populations with as yet undetected or underestimated structure. Shark biology and the market for their fins make them highly vulnerable and many species are in rapid decline. Our results add weight to the case that total bans on shark fishing are a better conservation approach for sharks than marine protected area networks.

AB  - In order to explore the variation in aboveground biomass among five topographically-defined habitats in old-growth forest, we measured aboveground biomass within a 20 ha permanent plot in Southern China. Aboveground biomass was estimated by using allometric regression equations. In the present study, there was no significant difference between the average aboveground biomass in 2005 (153.7 +/- 58.7 mg ha(-1)) and in 2010 (152.3 +/- 60.8 mg ha(-1)). Biomass also varied substantially among habitats, from 138.9 Mg ha(-1) in the higher slope and lower valley habitat to 200.1 mg ha(-1) in the mountain ridge habitat in 2005, and from 132.1 mg ha(-1) in the lower slope to 198.8 mg ha(-1) in the mountain ridge in 2010. Medium trees were the largest contributor (48%) to the total aboveground biomass within all habitats. Variability in species contributions to total habitat biomass were suggestive of species habitat preferences. This study provides a detailed overview of aboveground biomass patterns among old-growth forest habitats and highlights the importance of incorporating community characteristics and environmental variables (i.e. topography) into forest ecosystem carbon studies. The results will further our understanding of the contributions of old-growth forests to global carbon cycles and provide valuable information to improve conservation planning strategies.

AB  - The Himalayan region is one of the global biodiversity hotspots. However, its biodiversity and ecosystems are threatened due to abiotic and biotic drivers. One of the major biotic threats to biodiversity in this region is the rapid spread of Invasive Alien Species (IAS). Natural forests and grasslands are increasingly getting infested by IAS affecting regeneration of native species and decline in availability of bio-resources. Assessing the current status of IAS and prediction of their future spread would be vital for evolving specific species management interventions. Keeping this in view, we conducted an in-depth study on two IASs, viz., Ageratina adenophora and Lantana camara in the Indian part of Kailash Sacred Landscape (KSL), Western Himalaya. Intensive field surveys were conducted to collect the presence of A. adenophora (n = 567) and L. camara (n = 120) along an altitudinal gradient between 300 and 3000 m a.s.l. We performed Principal Component Analysis to nullify the multi-colinearity effects of the environmental predictors following MaxEnt species distribution model in the current and future climatic scenarios for both the species. All current and future model precision (i.e., Area Under the Curve; AUC) for both species was higher than 0.81. It is predicted that under the current rate of climate change and higher emission (i.e., RCP 8.5 pathway), A. adenophora will spread 45.3% more than its current distribution and is likely to reach up to 3029 m a.s.l., whereas, L. camara will spread 29.8% more than its current distribution range and likely to reach up to 3018 m a.s.l. Our results will help in future conservation planning and participatory management of forests and grasslands in the Kailash Sacred Landscape-India.

AB  - Land use change-mostly habitat loss and fragmentation-has been recognized as one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide. According to the habitat amount hypothesis, these phenomena are mostly driven by the habitat area effect. As a result, species richness is a function of both the extent of suitable habitats and their availability in the surrounding landscape, irrespective of the dimension and isolation of patches of suitable habitat. In this context, we tested how the extent of natural areas, selected as proxies of suitable habitats for biodiversity, influences species richness in highly anthropogenic landscapes. We defined five circular sampling areas of 5 km radius, including both natural reserves and anthropogenic land uses, centred in five major industrial sites in France, Italy and Germany. We monitored different biodiversity indicators for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, including breeding birds, diurnal butterflies, grassland vegetation, odonata, amphibians, aquatic plants and benthic diatoms. We studied the response of the different indicators to the extent of natural land uses in the sampling area (local effect) and in the surrounding landscape (landscape effect), identified as a peripheral ring encircling the sampling area. Results showed a positive response of five out of seven biodiversity indicators, with aquatic plants and odonata responding positively to the local effect, while birds, vegetation and diatoms showed a positive response to the landscape effect. Diatoms also showed a significant combined response to both effects. We conclude that surrounding landscapes act as important biodiversity sources, increasing the local biodiversity in highly anthropogenic contexts.

AB  - Assessing progress towards achieving conservation targets is required for all countries committed to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Natura 2000 network is the largest protected area network in the world and was created to protect Europe's threatened species and habitats, often requiring active management. This study assesses the effectiveness of areas classified under the EU Birds Directive at protecting Western Europe's agro-steppes, the last remnants of suitable habitat for several endangered bird species. We quantify agro-steppe habitat change in the last 10 years using high-resolution aerial images of 21 Special Protection Areas and surrounding areas. The selected SPAs hold one third of the global population of great bustards Otis tarda, a flagship conservation species. Agro-steppe area losses occurred across all sites surveyed but were 45% lower inside Natura 2000 compared to non-protected areas. Natura 2000 sites still lost over 35,000 ha of agro-steppe habitat in 10 years, an area that could hold more than 500 great bustards. These low yield farmlands are being converted predominately to permanent and irrigated crops. At the current rate of habitat conversion, agro-steppes could be reduced to 50% of the present area during the next century. Moreover, the greater conversions outside protected sites may transform the remaining agro-steppes into isolated "islands" with low population connectivity. Our study on agro-steppes illustrates the relevant contribution of Natura 2000 at protecting Europe's key habitats, but also highlights crucial insufficiencies that still need to be addressed to achieve the CBD conservation targets and halt biodiversity loss.

AB  - Aim Protected areas are frequently defined on the basis of biological importance. Ecosystem services are expected to be under protection when biodiversity is preserved; however, new approaches are needed to confirm this statement. We evaluated how spatial associations between ecosystem services and plant biodiversity on a large spatial scale influence their representativeness in current protected areas.
   Location Brazilian seasonally tropical dry forest (Caatinga).
   Methods We produced woody plant biodiversity maps (species richness, narrow- range species richness and beta diversity) using species distribution modelling. We estimated regulating services (water purification, carbon storage and erosion control), provisioning services (water supply, fodder and agriculture) and supporting services (water balance, net primary productivity and soil fertility) using primary data and a proxy-based approach. We performed spatial correlation analyses between biodiversity and ecosystem services using Pearson's correlation test. After estimating the percentage of hotspot areas of biodiversity and ecosystem services presented in two types of protected areas (strict protection and sustainable use), we compared it to expected distribution by null model.
   Results Mostly weak and intermediary positive correlations arose among biodiversity and ecosystem services (beta diversity with water balance and species richness with water purification and carbon storage). Negative correlations occurred among water balance with both species richness and narrow- range species richness. Strict protection areas were well represented in terms of carbon storage and underrepresented for fodder and agriculture. Sustainable use protected areas were important for water balance. Plant biodiversity variables were not represented in current protected areas.
   Main conclusions Positive correlations between biodiversity and ecosystem services do not assure the protection of these targets in protected areas. Surrogates choice based only on spatial correlations might not effectively protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. Selection of priority areas must include biodiversity and ecosystem services as distinct conservation targets.

AB  - Networks of protected areas are a key component of efforts to conserve biodiversity. However, there are concerns about an uncritical focus on the percentage area of reserves without an assessment of how well formal reserves are actually protecting biodiversity. In response, we completed a spatial analysis of the formal reserve system in the Australian state of Victoria. We quantified how well the reserve system captured a crude surrogate for vegetation communities (viz: Ecological Vegetation Classes) as well as distribution models for an array of threatened forest-dependent species. We found evidence of a high degree of overlap between areas subject to intensive forestry (clearcutting) operations and the modelled distribution of a suite of forest-dependent species. A key outcome of our study was that areas around sites subject to past logging as well as new areas proposed for logging under the Timber Release Plan in Victoria had significantly higher values for threatened forest-dependent species (as determined by habitat distribution models) than areas that had not been logged. We found significant differences in the spatial characteristics of the dedicated reserve systems and informal protected area networks, with the latter featuring much of its area close to a tenure boundary where logging occurs. Our empirical analyses demonstrating the impacts of ongoing logging operations on areas with high environmental suitability for threatened species have important implications. In particular, the current reserve system is inadequate for a suite of forest-dependent taxa, including critically endangered Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) and the vulnerable Greater Glider (Petauroides volans). This suggests a high degree of conflict between areas of high value for conservation and areas targeted for wood production.

AB  - Conservation of bird populations is increasingly focused on landscapes. We combined data collected in 2005-2011 from 16,250 North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) survey points with local and remotely sensed environmental data to model the distribution of 7 grassland bird species in the Northern Great Plains of the United States. We analyzed data at the survey point level, which is consistent with the scale of conservation treatments that we apply, and avoided information loss caused by pooling data at the BBS route level. By accounting for observer effects, nesting of survey points within routes, and sequence of survey points, we accommodated BBS survey design, refined estimates of important habitat predictors, improved model fit, and reduced or eliminated positive spatial autocorrelation in model residuals. The predictive power of models was greatly increased by including variables that characterized annual and long-term precipitation, as well as local land cover attributes not available from satellite-derived land cover data. Occurrence models from survey-point-level BBS data and environmental data with high thematic resolution were able to describe habitat relationships that are often associated with fine-grained, local studies, but across broad spatial extents and at scales relevant to local conservation actions. Predicted occurrence was strongly correlated with observed numbers, suggesting that occurrence models may be useful indicators of density. Relationships derived from models allowed us to develop spatially explicit decision support tools, which can be used to target areas for conservation treatments and to assess the conservation actions of multiple conservation programs and joint ventures (e.g., Prairie Pothole, Rainwater Basin, and Northern Great Plains joint ventures) in the U.S. Northern Great Plains.

AB  - Conservation managers and policy makers are often confronted with a challenging dilemma of devising suitable strategies to maintain agricultural productivity while conserving endemic species that at the early stages of becoming pests of agricultural crops. Identification of environmental factors conducive to species range expansion for forecasting species distribution patterns will play a central role in devising management strategies to minimize the conflict between the agricultural productivity and biodiversity conservation. Here, we present results of a study that predicts the distribution of Indrella ampulla, a snail endemic to the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, which is becoming a pest in cardamom (Ellettaria cardamomum) plantations. We determined the distribution patterns and niche overlap between I.ampulla and Ellettaria cardamomum using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) niche modeling techniques under current and future (2020-2080) climatic scenarios. The results showed that climatic (precipitation of coldest quarter and isothermality) and soil (cation exchange capacity of soil [CEC]) parameters are major factors that determine the distribution of I.ampulla in Western Ghats. The model predicted cardamom cultivation areas in southern Western Ghats are highly sensitive to invasion of I.ampulla under both present and future climatic conditions. While the land area in the central Western Ghats is predicted to become unsuitable for I.ampulla and Ellettaria cardamomum in future, we found 71% of the Western Ghats land area is suitable for Ellettaria cardamomum cultivation and 45% suitable for I.ampulla, with an overlap of 35% between two species. The resulting distribution maps are invaluable for policy makers and conservation managers to design and implement management strategies minimizing the conflicts to sustain agricultural productivity while maintaining biodiversity in the region.

AB  - Wetlands, especially ponds, and their associated amphibian biodiversity are threatened by agricultural intensification. To improve conservation planning of these ecosystems, we need to understand at which scales biodiversity responds to human-induced disturbances. This study aims to assess the level-dependence of environment-amphibian biodiversity relationships in 150 ponds in an intensive agricultural landscape in Seine-et-Marne (France). Amphibian diversity surveys, site characteristic measurements and landscape descriptions are analysed. The hierarchy of the effects of local and regional variables on species richness, regional heterogeneity of species composition and species occurrences is investigated at three spatial levels: pond level, 1-, and 4-km(2) level. Species richness is negatively influenced at all levels by the fish presence. Water quality and pond density, which emphasize level-dependent effects, significantly increase species richness at the local and regional levels, respectively. With few exceptions, species occurrence analysis shows similar patterns, confirming, locally, the importance of fish avoidance, and, regionally, the need for increasing pond density. Environmental variables have no effect on the regional heterogeneity of species composition, questioning the potential existence of dispersal processes at scales above 1 km(2). This study highlights the relevance of a pond-group-centred approach compared to a pond-centred approach with regard to pond conservation in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The notion that species might exhibit thresholds in their response to habitat alteration is appealing from a conservation perspective. Such thresholds could be used as targets for conservation in managed landscapes. In New Brunswick, Canada, forest management produces mosaics of varying stand age, species composition, and structure. We sampled this gradient in habitat suitability to examine the shape of species response functions and to look for evidence of statistically significant thresholds. We focused our attention on bird species breeding in late-seral forest and surveyed them at 390 point-count stations sampling broad-leaved deciduous to pure coniferous stands and a variety of silvicultural treatments (patch cutting, single-tree selection, spruce plantation [35-45 years old], and no recent treatment). A principal components analysis (PCA) on local vegetation separated stations along two axes reflecting gradients in stand composition and habitat alteration (increasingly open canopy and decreasing density of large trees/snags), respectively. We combined logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to detect thresholds in species occurrence along these gradients. Of the 42 species frequent enough to be included in the analyses, 13 (31%) showed a significant (p<0.01) negative response to habitat alteration. Eight of the 13 species sensitive to habitat alteration exhibited thresholds in their occurrence after controlling for the suitability of local habitat. According to curves of the expected number of sensitive species (based on their ROC-derived thresholds), canopy closure and the density of large trees (>30 cm dbh) should be at least 70% and 80 stems/ha, respectively, to expect to find the complete assemblage of bird species. However, these values should be viewed as liberal, given the nature of our response variable. More refined (e.g., fitness) parameters should be used to be conservative. Nonetheless, the approach allowed us to establish preliminary quantitative targets for conservation planning based on time-efficient sampling methods, and to explicitly account for the continuous variability existing within and among silvicultural treatments rather than to assume homogeneity within treatments.

AB  - Aim Populations of large ungulates are dwindling worldwide. This is especially so for wild sheep, which compete with livestock for forage, are disturbed by shepherds and their dogs, and are exposed to disease transmissions from livestock. Our aim was to assess spatial patterns in realized niche overlap between wild and domestic sheep to better understand where potential competition might arise, and thus to identify priority areas for wild sheep recovery. Location Southern Caucasus (220,000 km(2)). Methods We studied Gmelin's mouflon (Ovis orientalis gmelinii), an ancestor of domestic sheep, to investigate seasonal habitat use and niche overlap with domestic sheep. To map habitat, we analysed mouflon occurrences collected during 2006-2016, and domestic sheep occurrences from shepherd camp locations digitized on high-resolution satellite imagery. We mapped areas of potential competition between mouflon and domestic sheep and assessed potential habitat displacement. Results Mouflon and domestic sheep niches overlapped substantially (overlap index I = 0.89, where 1 means perfect overlap) but were not identical. Mouflon habitat was less widespread than domestic sheep habitat (14,000 vs. 40,270 km(2)) and tended to be located in more rugged areas with less vegetation cover. We identified 51 priority patches as reintroduction candidates if grazing pressure and poaching were reduced. Main conclusions Our results suggest that competition with domestic sheep might have pushed mouflon into marginal habitat. Thus, conservation efforts focusing on current mouflon habitat might miss suitable reintroduction sites. We demonstrate that a combined habitat model for wild and domestic sheep can identify general sheep habitat, which might be more useful for conservation planning than understanding current mouflon habitat selection. Our results highlight that considering competition with livestock is important for large ungulate conservation, both in terms of reactive (e.g., lessening livestock pressure in prime habitat) and proactive strategies (e.g., reintroduction in areas with low contemporary overlap).

AB  - The large uncertainty surrounding the future effects of sea-level rise and other aspects of climate change on tidal marsh ecosystems exacerbates the difficulty in planning effective conservation and restoration actions. We addressed these difficulties in the context of large-scale wetland restoration activities underway in the San Francisco Estuary (Suisun, San Pablo and San Francisco Bays). We used a boosted regression tree approach to project the future distribution and abundance of five marsh bird species (through 2110) in response to changes in habitat availability and suitability as a result of projected sea-level rise, salinity, and sediment availability in the Estuary. To bracket the uncertainty, we considered four future scenarios based on two sediment availability scenarios (high or low), which varied regionally, and two rates of sea-level rise (0.52 or 1.65 m/100 yr). We evaluated three approaches for using model results to inform the selection of potential restoration projects: (1) Use current conditions only to prioritize restoration. (2) Use a single future scenario (among the four referred to above) in combination with current conditions to select priority restoration projects. (3) Combine current conditions with all four future scenarios, while incorporating uncertainty among future scenarios into the selection of restoration projects. We found that simply using current conditions resulted in the poorest performing restoration projects selected in terms of providing habitat for tidal marsh birds in light of possible future scenarios. The most robust method for selecting restoration projects, the "combined" strategy, used projections from all future scenarios with a discounting of areas with high levels of variability among future scenarios. We show that uncertainty about future conditions can be incorporated in site prioritization algorithms and should motivate the selection of adaptation measures that are robust to uncertain future conditions. These results and data have been made available via an interactive decision support tool at www.prbo.org/sfbayslr.

AB  - The plant-disperser relationship and its key predictors in Indian tropical archipelagos are understudied. East of the Indian mainland (the Eastern coast, EC) are the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (AN, about 1221km away at the shortest distance), which exhibit a great plant diversity, with 848 unique species. West of the Indian mainland (the Western Ghats, WG) are another group of islands, the Lakshadweep Islands (LD, about 320km away at the shortest distance), which exhibit less diversity (102 unique species) than do the AN. We compared these two mainland-island pairs (EC-AN, WG-LD), which exhibit different insular isolation conditions, to understand the plant dispersal mechanisms and their determining predictors (plant richness, geographic area, perimeter, elevation, and shortest distance). We found epizoochory (adherence to an animal surface), ornithochory (birds), and hydrochory (water) to be the dominant dispersers of both the pairs. Additionally, the plant dispersal in the WG-LD pair is predominantly driven by anemochory (wind), possibly denoting the effects of the northeasterly trade winds. The major role of biotic dispersers in the EC-AN pair may be explained as resulting from plant dispersal to more remote islands through biotic dispersers being more rapid and efficient. The plant commonality was found to be positively correlated with the plant richness, geographic area, and perimeter; whereas it was negatively correlated with the shortest distance and elevation of the selected mainland-island pairs. Both linear (R-2=0.85) and non-linear (R-2=0.95) regression with maximum accuracy found island plant richness, geographic area, and shortest distance to the nearest mainland pool to be the determinants in explaining plant-dispersal mechanisms. These predictors are important to maintain the habitat suitability and connectivity and thereby support more newly dispersed plants. The plant-disperser relationship (epizoochory, ornithochory, anemochory, and hydrochory) and the key predictors (plant richness, geographic area, and shortest distance) found in this study could be useful for conservation, planning, and monitoring of biodiversity.

AB  - Although sea ice loss is the primary threat to polar bears (Ursus maritimus), little can be done to mitigate its effects without global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other factors, however, could exacerbate the impacts of sea ice loss on polar bears, such as exposure to increased industrial activity. The Arctic Ocean has enormous oil and gas potential, and its development is expected to increase in the coming decades. Estimates of polar bear resource selection will inform managers how bears use areas slated for oil development and to help guide conservation planning. We estimated temporally-varying resource selection patterns for non-denning adult female polar bears in the Chukchi Sea population (20082012) at two scales (i.e., home range and weekly steps) to identify factors predictive of polar bear use throughout the year, before any offshore development. From the best models at each scale, we estimated scale-integrated resource selection functions to predict polar bear space use across the population's range and determined when bears were most likely to use the region where offshore oil and gas development in the United States is slated to occur. Polar bears exhibited significant intra-annual variation in selection patterns at both scales but the strength and annual patterns of selection differed between scales for most variables. Bears were most likely to use the offshore oil and gas planning area during ice retreat and growth with the highest predicted use occurring in the southern portion of the planning area. The average proportion of predicted high-value habitat in the planning area was >15% of the total high-value habitat for the population during sea ice retreat and growth and reached a high of 50% during November 2010. Our results provide a baseline on which to judge future changes to non-denning adult female polar bear resource selection in the Chukchi Sea and help guide offshore development in the region. Lastly, our study provides a framework for assessing potential impacts of offshore oil and gas development to other polar bear populations around the Arctic.

AB  - Large Marine Ecosystems such as the Canary Current system off West Africa sustains high abundance of small pelagic prey, which attracts marine predators. Seabirds are top predators often used as biodiversity surrogates and sentinel species of the marine ecosystem health, thus frequently informing marine conservation planning. This study presents the first data on the spatial (GPS-loggers) and trophic (stable isotope analysis) ecology of a tropical seabird-the endangered Cape Verde shearwater Calonectris edwardsii-during both the incubation and the chick-rearing periods of two consecutive years. This information was related with marine environmental predictors (species distribution models), existent areas of conservation concern for seabirds (i.e. marine Important Bird Areas; marine IBAs) and threats to the marine environment in the West African areas heavily used by the shearwaters. There was an apparent inter-annual consistency on the spatial, foraging and trophic ecology of Cape Verde shearwater, but a strong alteration on the foraging strategies of adult breeders among breeding phases (i.e. from incubation to chick-rearing). During incubation, birds mostly targeted a discrete region off West Africa, known by its enhanced productivity profile and thus also highly exploited by international industrial fishery fleets. When chick-rearing, adults exploited the comparatively less productive tropical environment within the islands of Cape Verde, at relatively close distance from their breeding colony. The species enlarged its trophic niche and increased the trophic level of their prey from incubation to chick-rearing, likely to provision their chicks with a more diversified and better quality diet. There was a high overlap between the Cape Verde shearwaters foraging areas with those of European shearwater species that overwinter in this area and known areas of megafauna bycatch off West Africa, but very little overlap with existing Marine Important Bird Areas. Further investigation on the potential nefarious effects of fisheries on seabird communities exploiting the Canary Current system off West Africa is needed. Such negative effects could be alleviated or even dissipated if the 'fisheries-conservation hotspots' identified for the region, would be legislated as Marine Protected Areas.

AB  - Plastic pollution is widespread in all the oceans and seas, representing a significant threat to most of their ecosystems even in marine protected areas (MPAs). This study determines the floating plastic distribution in four different periods between 2014 and 2015 in the recently approved Menorca Channel MPA (Balearic Islands). Plastic debris were persistent during all sampling periods on the surface of the Channel, composed mainly by the microplastic sizes. Average particle abundances ranged from 138,293 items.km(-2) in autumn to 347,793 items.km(-2) during the spring, while weight densities varied from 458.15 g(DW).km(-2) in winter to 2016.67 g(DW).km(-2) in summer. Rigid plastics were the most frequent particles in all the periods analysed (from 89.40%-winter to 94.54%-spring). The high-resolution and particle distribution models corroborated that the oceanographic variability shapes different patterns of presence of plastics, and in particular the existence of areas with almost no plastics.

AB  - A global strategy is necessary to achieve the level of coordination, synergy and therefore optimization of resources to achieve the broad goal of conserving mammals worldwide. Key elements for the development of such a strategy include: an institutional subject that owns the strategy; broad conservation goals, quantitative targets derived from them and appropriate indicators; data on the distribution of species, their threats, the cost-effectiveness of conservation actions; and a set of methods for the identification of conservation priorities. Previous global mammal research investigated phylogeny, extinction risk, and the species and areas that should be regarded as global conservation priorities. This theme issue presents new key elements: an updated Red List Index, a new list of evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species, new high-resolution mammal distribution models, a global connectivity analysis and scenarios of future mammal distribution based on climate and land-cover change. Area prioritization schemes account for mammalian phylogeny, governance and cost-benefit of measures to abate habitat loss. Three discussion papers lay the foundations for the development of a global unifying mammal conservation strategy, which should not be further deterred by the knowledge gaps still existing.

AB  - Seascape ecology is an emerging pattern-oriented and integrative science conceptually linked to landscape ecology. It aims to quantify multidimensional spatial structure in the sea and reveal its ecological consequences. The seascape ecology approach has made important advances in shallow coastal environments, and increasing exploration and mapping of the deep seabed provides opportunities for application in the deep ocean. We argue that seascape ecology, with its integrative and multiscale perspective, can generate new scientific insights at spatial and temporal scales relevant to ecosystem-based management. Seascape ecology provides a conceptual and operational framework that integrates and builds on existing benthic ecology and habitat mapping research by providing additional pattern-oriented concepts, tools and techniques to (1) quantify complex ecological patterns across multiple scales; (2) link spatial patterns to biodiversity and ecological processes; and (3) provide ecologically meaningful information that is operationally relevant to spatial management. This review introduces seascape ecology and provides a framework for its application to deep-seabed environments. Research areas are highlighted where seascape ecology can advance the ecological understanding of deep benthic environments.

AB  - Networks of protected areas often fail to include favorable areas for all species, even when they cover a considerable percentage of a territory. To assess the effectiveness of protected areas, harsh thresholds are commonly used (e.g. minimum 20% of the cell must be covered by a protected area to define it as protected). Setting a threshold implies a transformation of continuous data into binary data which frequently results in information loss and in outcomes changing sharply depending on the threshold set. To avoid uncertainty and information loss when evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas, we developed the "Insecurity Index" based on species distribution modeling and fuzzy logic. The Insecurity Index (0-1) of a species represents how much of the fuzzy set of favorable areas for the species is not included in the protected areas. The larger the extent of favorable areas of a species that is not covered by protected areas, the higher the Insecurity Index. We applied this approach to Andalusia, in the south of Spain, which sustains 22 out of the 40 raptor species present in Europe, and has about 30% of its territory covered by regional and Natura 2000 protected areas. By measuring and mapping the Insecurity Index of raptors in Andalusia we assessed the extent to which protected areas exclude favorable sites for forest, cliff and steppe nesting raptors, identified species with a high Insecurity Index and mapped high priority areas for implementing conservation actions. The Insecurity Index was significantly higher for steppe nesting raptors (mean Insecurity Index = 0.81) compared to forest (mean Insecurity Index = 0.62) and cliff nesting raptors (mean Insecurity Index = 0.59). We propose areas of high insecurity for steppe nesting raptors, as potential sites for implementing actions aimed at providing nesting habitat for these species. As demonstrated here for raptors in Andalusia, the Insecurity Index can be used to assess and compare the extent to which species' favorable areas are left unprotected by reserves while avoiding uncertainty and information loss due to the use of thresholds.

AB  - We modelled the distributions of two toads (Bufo bufo and Epidalea calamita) in the Iberian Peninsula using the favourability function, which makes predictions directly comparable for different species and allows fuzzy logic operations to relate different models. The fuzzy intersection between individual models, representing favourability for the presence of both species simultaneously, was compared with another favourability model built on the presences shared by both species. The fuzzy union between individual models, representing favourability for the presence of any of the two species, was compared with another favourability model based on the presences of either or both of them. The fuzzy intersections between favourability for each species and the complementary of favourability for the other (corresponding to the logical operation "A and not B") were compared with models of exclusive presence of one species versus the exclusive presence of the other. The results of modelling combined species data were highly similar to those of fuzzy logic operations between individual models, proving fuzzy logic and the favourability function valuable for comparative distribution modelling. We highlight several advantages of fuzzy logic over other forms of combining distribution models, including the possibility to combine multiple species models for management and conservation planning.

AB  - While cost estimation is a very positive tool for spatial conservation prioritisation, there are few examples where costs (in monetary terms) are applied. We present a repeatable method to estimate and map field values in monetary terms using common correlative models. We modelled, with a resolution of 1 km(2), the information obtained by several real estate's agencies with a set of eleven environmental, climatic, and anthropogenic variables. Land cover was the main influencing factor, but further variables were affecting bids on field sales according to the socio-economic specificity of each administrative province. The estimated values were related to endemic plant species richness, their conservation status and altitudinal ranges. Richest areas in endemics have lower values given current market conditions and, within these endemic rich areas, values near the coast were generally higher than the rest of endemic-rich territories. Despite their limits, our method offers an alternative perspective on the challenges of simplifying the extrapolation of useful information for planning and disseminating the conservation of many ecosystem services providers.

AB  - The Antarctic region is usually considered a pristine area. Nevertheless, regional warming effects and increasing human activities, including the presence of several research stations, are inducing considerable environmental changes that may affect the ecosystem's functions. Therefore, during the XXXIII Antarctic expedition, we carried out an investigation in Terra Nova bay (Ross Sea), close to the Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) n.161. In particular, we compared the effects of two different types of impacts on the meiobenthic assemblages: anthropogenic impact (AI), associated with the activity of Mario Zucchelli Research Station (MZS), and natural impact (NI) attributable to a large colony of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) in Adelie Cove. For each impacted site, a respective control site and two sampling depths (20 and 50 m) were selected. Several environmental variables (pH, dissolved oxygen, major and minor ions, heavy metals, organic load, and sediment grain size) were measured and analysed, to allow a comprehensive characterization of the sampling areas. According to the criteria defined by Unites States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA 2009), heavy metal concentrations did not reveal critical conditions. However, both the MZS (AI20) and penguin colony (NI20) sites showed higher heavy metal concentrations, the former due to human activities related to the Italian research station, with the latter caused by the penguins excrements. Meiobenthic richness and abundance values suggested that the worst ecological condition was consistently related to the Adelie penguins colony. Furthermore, the higher contribution of r-strategists corroborates the hypothesis that the chronic impact of the penguin colonies may have stronger effects on the meiobenthos than the human activities at the MZS. Food is not limited in shallow Antarctic bottoms, and microscale differences in primary and secondary production processes can likely explain the greater spatial heterogeneity, highlighted both by the univariate and multivariate attributes of meiobenthic assemblage (i.e., richness, diversity, abundance, whole structure assemblage, and rare taxa) at the deeper stations. As reported in other geographical regions, the assemblage structure of rare meiobenthic taxa is confirmed to be more susceptible to environmental variations, rather than the whole assemblage structure.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are a cornerstone of global efforts to shield wildlife from anthropogenic impacts, yet their effectiveness at protecting wide-ranging species prone to human conflict - notably mammalian carnivores - is increasingly in question. An understanding of carnivore responses to human-induced and natural changes in and around PAs is critical not only to the conservation of threatened carnivore populations, but also to the effective protection of ecosystems in which they play key functional roles. However, an important challenge to assessing carnivore communities is the often infrequent and imperfect nature of survey detections. We applied a novel hierarchical multi-species occupancy model that accounted for detectability and spatial autocorrelation to data from 224 camera trap stations (sampled between October 2006 and January 2009) in order to test hypotheses about extrinsic influences on carnivore community dynamics in a West African protected area (Mole National Park, Ghana). We developed spatially explicit indices of illegal hunting activity, law enforcement patrol effort, prey biomass, and habitat productivity across the park, and used a Bayesian model selection framework to identify predictors of site occurrence for individual species and the entire carnivore community. Contrary to our expectation, hunting pressure and edge proximity did not have consistent, negative effects on occurrence across the nine carnivore species detected. Occurrence patterns for most species were positively associated with small prey biomass, and several species had either positive or negative associations with riverine forest (but not with other habitat descriptors). Influences of sampling design on carnivore detectability were also identified and addressed within our modeling framework (e. g., road and observer effects), and the multi-species approach facilitated inference on even the rarest carnivore species in the park. Our study provides insight for the conservation of these regionally significant carnivore populations, and our approach is broadly applicable to the robust assessment of communities of rare and elusive species subject to environmental change.

AB  - Protected-area sagebrush steppe ecosystems are few in number and increasingly important to the North American conservation network as sagebrush steppe faces growing threats from land use, climate change, and invasive species. We analyzed the distribution and abundance of native perennial and invasive annual plants to better understand patterns of plant invasion within two protected areas: John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (JODA), located in central Oregon, and Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (CRMO), located in southeast Idaho. We used multivariate analysis to examine vegetation monitoring datasets and illuminate geographic variation in plant cover along gradients of well-known aspects of resistance to plant invasion (elevation, exposure [slope and aspect], precipitation and proximity to disturbance). Topographically mediated resistance to invasion appeared to manifest in the park with greater topographic variability (JODA), while increased elevation was more strongly associated with resistant sites in the park, which spanned a greater elevational gradient (CRMO). Factors that may mitigate moisture-mediated resistance also differed between sites. Slope and aspect were factors of apparent resistance for bunchgrass communities in JODA, while high crop year precipitation appeared to benefit medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae [L.] Nevski) and the weedy native subshrub broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae [Pursh] Britton & Rusby) over bunchgrasses and Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young). Increased elevation and distance to disturbed areas were the most important factors of resistance in forb-rich communities at CRMO, with the invasive annuals cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), tumble mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum L.), and Descurainia spp. Webb & Bethel. invading in low elevations and in close proximity to roads or agricultural fields. Such complexity underscores the idiosyncratic nature of the manifestation of resistance and the need for place-based empirical studies to provide information for guiding protected-area management.

AB  - Ecological Risk Assessment for the Effects of Fishing (ERAEF) is an assignment process of magnitudes and probabilities to the damaging effects of fishing activities, and is used to identify and prioritize the risks of fishing to marine ecosystems. Productivity and susceptibility analysis (PSA), part of ERAEF, assumes that the susceptibility of a species to impact, and its productivity, determines the potential for recovery of the species if its population collapses. In this study, PSA of the species most caught by the handline fishery of the artisanal fleet from the state of Ceara, Northeast Brazil. Sampling was conducted by monitoring fishing landings from 2017 to 2019 at Mucuripe, Batoque marine protected area (MPA), and Prainha do Canto Verde MPA. The seven productivity attributes were maximum length (Lmax), von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (K), length at first maturity (L50), L50/Lmax, intrinsic growth rate (r), fecundity, and trophic level. The six susceptibility attributes were: availability (the geographic overlap of fishing activity according to species distribution), percentage of individuals caught larger than the L-50, management strategy, commercial category, frequency of occurrence, and abundance. The productivity values ranged from 1.24 to 2.88. The species Scomberomorus cavalla showed the lowest productivity, while Holocentrus adscensionis showed the highest productivity with a high r and K. Susceptibility values ranged from 1.18 to 2.27. The species Lutjanus synagris caught at Batoque MPA showed the highest susceptibility, which was a high commercial category score, frequency of occurrence, and abundance at this site. Vulnerability values ranged from 1.71 to 3.46. The species S. cavalla, L. analis, and Ablennes hians were the most vulnerable, ranked as high risk at all sites. H. adscensionis was the least vulnerable at all sites. The vulnerabilities were not statistically different across the sites, suggesting a lack of effective management measures in the MPA.

AB  - Aim: A major problem for conservation in Amazonia is that species distribution maps are inaccurate. Consequently, conservation planning needs to be based on other information sources such as vegetation and soilmaps, which are also inaccurate. We propose and test the use of biotic data on a common and relatively easily inventoried group of plants to infer environmental conditions that can be used to improvemaps of floristic patterns for plants in general.
   Location: Brazilian Amazonia.
   Methods: We sampled 326 plots of 250 m x 2 m separated by distances of 1-1800 km. Terrestrial fern individuals were identified and counted. Edaphic data were obtained from soil samples and analysed for cation concentration and texture. Climatic data were obtained from Worldclim. We used a multivariate regression tree to evaluate the hierarchical importance of soils and climate for fern communities and identified significant indicator species for the resultant classification. We then tested how well the edaphic properties of the plots could be predicted on the basis of their floristic composition using two calibration methods, weighted averaging and k-nearest neighbour estimation.
   Results: Soil cation concentration emerged as the most important variable in the regression tree, whereas soil textural and climatic variation played secondary roles. Almost all the plot classes had several fern species with high indicator values for that class. Soil cation concentration was also the variable most accurately predicted on the basis of fern community composition (R-2 = 0.65-0.75 for log-transformed data). Predictive accuracy varied little among the calibration methods, and was not improved by the use of abundance data instead of presence-absence data.
   Conclusions: Fern species composition can be used as an indicator of soil cation concentration, which can be expected to be relevant also for other components of rain forests. Presence-absence data are adequate for this purpose, which makes the collecting of additional data potentially very rapid. Comparison with earlier studies suggests that edaphic preferences of fern species have good transferability across geographical regions within lowland Amazonia. Therefore, species and environmental data sets already available in the Amazon region represent a good starting point for generating better environmental and floristic maps for conservation planning.

AB  - The Elongated Tortoise (Indotestudo elangata) is generally threatened by habitat loss, over-exploitation, and fire; however, little is known about its distribution and the specific threats it faces across its range. We used a presence-only species distribution model to determine the potential climatically suitable distribution for this species within the Indian subcontinent and then evaluated this area for lire-prone zones and protected areas. Annual precipitation, isothermality, and elevation are key predictors for the distribution of this species. Our results show that only a small percentage (5.2%) of the predicted area has a high occurrence probability for the species. On the other hand, 29% of the total predicted distribution falls within high-occurrence fire zones. Moreover, slash and burn cultivation may have a large impact on the species in the northeastern parts of India. Only 8% of the predicted distribution range falls within the network of protected areas within the Indian subcontinent. Further, a detailed finer-scale study of the habitat use would be useful to prioritize key areas for management and conservation of this endangered species on the Indian subcontinent.

AB  - Despite its small size, Bhutan has similar to 160 mammal species, including the critically endangered tiger (Panthera tigris), snow leopard (Panthera uncia) and many other IUCN Red-Listed species. This rich mammal diversity is being documented through exhaustive surveys that are hampered by insufficient funds, inadequate human resources and difficult access to mountainous terrain. Camera trapping is relatively new in Bhutan, but is addressing these challenges. Initially, camera trapping focused on tigers, but has since broadened to include other mammals. Notable camera trap findings include the highest recorded elevation for tigers, unusual colour morphs of the Asiatic golden cat (Pardofelis temminckii), occurrence of the Pallas's cat (Octolobus manul) in the eastern Himalayas and the presence of the takin (Budorcas taxicolor), Bhutan's national animal, in Thrumshingla National Park. There is, however, scope to expand camera trapping to include Bhutan's poorly known small and medium-sized mammals. Current camera trapping in Bhutan is noticeably ad hoc and we recommend integrating camera trapping into tradi-tional surveys as a standardised, robust survey protocol for rugged terrain. This will enable the landscape modelling of species distribution in Bhutan for effective wildlife conservation and management, given potential impacts from climate change, economic development and increased pressure from people on protected area resources.

AB  - In the summer of 2011, the infralittoral fringe of Linosa Island (Sicilian Channel, Italy) was surveyed through visual census, by both scuba diving and snorkelling, with the aim of collecting updated data on marine alien species distribution and abundance on the island. Surveys revealed the presence of Pinctada imbricata radiata, an invasive alien bivalve of Indo-Pacific origin, first recorded in the Mediterranean Sea at the end of the 19th century in Egyptian waters. Since then, the species has successfully spread throughout the Mediterranean, systematically colonizing new habitats of the eastern basin and becoming very abundant in the Levantine Sea. Conversely, occurrences in the western basin have been reported only sporadically. Many studies have been carried out on P. imbricata radiata in its native range (Indian Ocean and Red Sea) while the Mediterranean populations have been investigated only in Tunisia. The finding of P. imbricata radiata around Linosa Island (Sicilian Channel, Italy) is discussed analysing the biometric features of the species and taking into consideration its ecological characteristics and possible pathways of introduction in the Marine Protected Area of Linosa Island.

AB  - A survey of bryophyte diversity in Bilaspur District (Chhattisgarh) and nearby areas has brought to light an unexpectedly rich bryoflora. Liverworts have a great diversity which includes both leafy and thalloid forms. Presence of 24 species of thalloid liverworts was recorded collectively from protected area Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere reserve (AABR) as well as other regions of Bilaspur district and Lafa Hills, Korba. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of elevation on the diversity of bryophytes in regional scale. For the study each location was mapped zone wise on 21 micro plots ranging between altitudes 230 m to 1011 m. Using presence or absence of species, bryophyte species richness was compared at each altitude. These zones exhibit high species richness at mid-high elevation (around 525-1000 m) with an average 4-6 species of distribution rate. It is observed 83% of liverwort population as terrestrial, 10% as epiphytic, 7% grows in aquatic habitats and below 5% recorded as ubiquitous at various altitude ranges. Species composition shows variability along the elevation and microhabitat distribution which shows homogeneity of liverwort population. This study reveals the current status of liverworts in Bilaspur region.

AB  - In 2008, the IUCN threat status of the Asian tapir (Tapirus indicus) was reclassified from vulnerable to endangered. The latest distribution map from the IUCN Red List suggests that the tapirs native range is becoming increasingly fragmented in Peninsular Malaysia, but distribution data collected by local researchers suggest a more extensive geographical range. Here, we compile a database of 1261 tapir occurrence records within Peninsular Malaysia, and demonstrate that this species, indeed, has a much broader geographical range than the IUCN range map suggests. However, extreme spatial and temporal bias in these records limits their utility for conservation planning. Therefore, we used maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to elucidate the potential extent of the Asian tapir's occurrence in Peninsular Malaysia while accounting for bias in existing distribution data. Our MaxEnt model predicted that the Asian tapir has a wider geographic range than our fine-scale data and the IUCN range map both suggest. Approximately 37% of Peninsular Malaysia contains potentially suitable tapir habitats. Our results justify a revision to the Asian tapir's extent of occurrence in the IUCN Red List. Furthermore, our modeling demonstrated that selectively logged forests encompass 45% of potentially suitable tapir habitats, underscoring the importance of these habitats for the conservation of this species in Peninsular Malaysia.

AB  - Here we applied phylogenetically based conservation analyses using a novel multivariate approach to better evaluate the effects of human land use on different primate lineages worldwide. Using a 1' x 1' grid, we obtained information on primate species distribution and the cover of six land use categories (Urban, Village, Cropland, Rangeland, Seminatural and Wild). We synthesized the phylogenetic composition into principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure. We correlated phylogenetic composition and land use in each region, and assessed statistical significance via null model. In America, the Atelidae clade was associated to areas with larger coverage of villages whereas Pitheciidae was found on areas with higher cover of wildlands. Moreover, we found some Atelidae, Callitrichidae and Pitheciidae species to be associated with seminatural areas, while other Alouatta and Callicebus species were more related with higher coverage of rangelands. In Madagascar, Lemuridae was negatively associated with wild areas. Africa did not show any statistically significant association between clades and land use. Asia had an intense association of some Cercopithecidae species with high coverage of villages. Primate lineages are currently facing different land use pressures, which would imply in the need of clade-specific conservation planning.

AB  - Evolutionary studies have played a fundamental role in our understanding of life, but until recently, they had only a relatively modest involvement in addressing conservation issues. The main goal of the present discussion meeting issue is to offer a platform to present the available methods allowing the integration of phylogenetic and extinction risk data in conservation planning. Here, we identify the main knowledge gaps in biodiversity science, which include incomplete sampling, reconstruction biases in phylogenetic analyses, partly known species distribution ranges, and the difficulty in producing conservation assessments for all known species, not to mention that much of the effective biological diversity remains to be discovered. Given the impact that human activities have on biodiversity and the urgency with which we need to address these issues, imperfect assumptions need to be sanctioned and surrogates used in the race to salvage as much as possible of our natural and evolutionary heritage. We discuss some aspects of the uncertainties found in biodiversity science, such as the ideal surrogates for biodiversity, the gaps in our knowledge and the numerous available phylogenetic diversity-based methods. We also introduce a series of cases studies that demonstrate how evolutionary biology can effectively contribute to biodiversity conservation science.

AB  - Accurate estimates of species' distributions are needed to ensure that conservation-planning efforts are directed at appropriate areas. Since the early 1980s, temperate-breeding populations of Branta canadensis (Canada Goose) have increased, yet reliable estimates of the species' distribution are lacking in many regions. Our objective was to identify the landcover features that best predicted Canada Goose distribution. In April 2015, we surveyed 300 one-km(2) plots across North Carolina and observed 449 Canada Geese. We quantified percent coverage of 7 continuous landcover variables at 5 different spatial extents for each of the 300 plots. We fit logistic regression models using presence and absence at the 300 plots as the dependent variable and percent-cover covariates as independent variables. The best model for predicting Canada Goose presence included percent pasture within the 9 km(2) surrounding the survey plot and percent open water within the 1-km(2) survey plot. The probability of Canada Goose presence increased with increasing percent open water and percent pasture, albeit at different spatial extents, which provided important cover and food resources, respectively. Our approach using remote-sensing data to accurately predict Canada Goose presence across a large spatial extent can be employed to determine distributions for other easily surveyed, widely distributed species.

AB  - Seed dispersal is a key process in plant spatial dynamics. However, consistently applicable generalizations about dispersal across scales are mostly absent because of the constraints on measuring propagule dispersal distances for many species. Here, we focus on fleshy-fruited taxa, specifically taxa with large fleshy fruits and their dispersers across an entire continental rainforest biome. We compare species-level results of whole-chloroplast DNA analyses in sister taxa with large and small fruits, to regional plot-based samples (310 plots), and whole-continent patterns for the distribution of woody species with either large (more than 30 mm) or smaller fleshy fruits (1093 taxa). The pairwise genomic comparison found higher genetic distances between populations and between regions in the large-fruited species (Endiandra globosa), but higher overall diversity within the small-fruited species (Endiandra discolor). Floristic comparisons among plots confirmed lower numbers of large-fruited species in areas where more extreme rainforest contraction occurred, and recolonization by small-fruited species readily dispersed by the available fauna. Species' distribution patterns showed that larger-fruited species had smaller geographical ranges than smaller-fruited species and locations with stable refugia (and high endemism) aligned with concentrations of large fleshy-fruited taxa, making them a potentially valuable conservation-planning indicator.

AB  - Primates worldwide are faced with increasing threats making them more vulnerable to extinction. Anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat degradation and fragmentation, are among the main concerns, and in Madagascar, these issues have become widespread. As this situation continues to worsen, we sought to understand how fragmentation affects primate distribution throughout the island. Further, because species may exhibit different sensitivity to fragmentation, we also aimed to estimate the role of functional traits in mitigating their response. We collated data from 32 large-bodied lemur species ranges, consisting of species from the families Lemuridae (five genera) and Indriidae (two genera). We fitted Generalized Linear Models to determine the role of habitat fragmentation characteristics, for example, forest cover, patch size, edge density, and landscape configuration, as well as the protected area (PA) network, on the species relative probability of presence. We then assessed how the influence of functional traits (dietary guild, home range size) mitigate the response of species to these habitat metrics. Habitat area had a strong positive effect for many species, and there were significantly negative effects of fragmentation on the distribution of many lemur species. In addition, there was a positive influence of PAs on many lemur species' distribution. Functional trait classifications showed that lemurs of all dietary guilds are negatively affected by fragmentation; however, folivore-frugivores show greater flexibility/variability in terms of habitat area and landscape complexity compared to nearly exclusive folivores and frugivores. Furthermore, species of all home range sizes showed a negative response to fragmentation, while habitat area had an increasingly positive effect as home range increased in size. Overall, the general trends for the majority of lemur species are dire and point to the need for immediate actions on a multitude of fronts, most importantly landscape-level reforestation efforts.

AB  - The concept of green infrastructure (GI) seeks to identify and prioritize areas of high ecological value for wildlife and people, to improve the integration of natural values in landscape planning decisions. In 2018, the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, established a roadmap for biodiversity conservation, which includes the operationalization of GI covering 30% of the territory by 2030. In this paper, we demonstrate a GI mapping framework in the canton of Geneva. Our approach is based on the combined assessment of three 'pillars', namely species' distribution, landscape structure and connectivity, and ecosystem services, to optimize the allocation of conservation actions using the spatial prioritization software, Zonation. The identified priority conservation areas closely overlap existing natural reserves. Including the three pillars in the landscape prioritization should also improve adhesion to the GI idea, without undermining the protection of threatened species. With regards to land use planning, public and private land parcels with high values for GI may require specific incentives to maintain their desirable characteristics, as they are more likely to be degraded than areas with more building restrictions. Visualizing priority conservation areas in a spatially explicit manner will support decision-makers in Geneva to optimally allocate limited resources for ecosystem preservation.

AB  - We compared within-population variability and degree of population differentiation for neutral genetic markers (RAPDS) and eight quantitative traits in Central American populations of the endangered tree, Cedrela odorata. Whilst population genetic diversity for neutral markers (Shannon index) and quantitative traits (heritability, coefficient of additive genetic variation) were uncorrelated, both marker types revealed strong differentiation between populations from the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica and the rest of the species' distribution. The degree of interpopulation differentiation was higher for RAPD markers (F-ST 0.67 for the sampled Mesoamerican range) than for quantitative traits (Q(ST) = 0.30). Hence, the divergence in quantitative traits was lower than could have been achieved by genetic drift alone, suggesting that balancing selection for similar phenotypes in different populations of this species. Nevertheless, a comparison of pair-wise estimates of population differentiation in neutral genetic markers and quantitative traits revealed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.66) suggesting that, for C. odorata, neutral marker divergence could be used as a surrogate for adaptive gene divergence for conservation planning. The utility of this finding and suggested further work are discussed.

AB  - The realized species richness of tropical forests cannot yet be reliably mapped at a regional scale due to lack of systematically collected data. An estimate of the potential species richness (PSR), however, can be produced through the use of species distribution modelling. PSR is interpretable as a climatically determined upper limit to observed species richness. We mapped current PSR and future PSR under climate change scenarios for Mesoamerica by combining the spatial distributions of 2000 tree species as predicted by generalized additive models built from herbaria records and climate layers. An explanatory regression tree was used to extract conditional rules describing the relationship between PSR and climate. The results were summarized by country, ecoregion and protected area status in order to investigate current and possible future variability in PSR in the context of regional biodiversity conservation. Length of the dry season was found to be the key determinant of PSR. Protected areas were found to have higher median PSR values than unprotected areas in most of the countries within the study area. Areas with exceptionally high PSR, however, remain unprotected throughout the region. Neither changes in realized species richness nor extinctions will necessarily follow changes in modelled PSR under climate change. However model output suggests that an increase in temperature of around 3 degrees C, combined with a 20 percent decrease in rainfall could lead to a widespread reduction of around 15 percent of current PSR, with values of up to 40 percent in some moist lower montane tropical forests. The modelled PSR of dry forest ecoregions was found to be relatively stable. Some cooler upper montane forests in northern Mesoamerica, where few species of tropical origin are currently found, may gain PSR if species are free to migrate.

AB  - Evaluating the species use of protected area networks is of considerable worldwide importance, especially as a feedback for policy-makers and the conservation community. Based on the data of an annual, citizen-science monitoring programme of long tradition (2004-2015), we test the hypothesis that the European Natura 2000 network protects high quality habitats preferentially settled by wintering waterbird species in a central European State (the Czech Republic). We analysed species-specific variables (protection status, flyway population trend and numbers, geographical distribution, and foraging guild) explaining the proportions of numbers in Natura 2000 and individual-species changes in numbers inside and outside Natura 2000. The proportions of numbers in individual species were generally low in Natura 2000 sites. The observed pattern revealed the expected higher preference of protected Annex I species for Natura 2000 sites compared to other species and showed foraging guilds having significant differences in Natura 2000 preference, with high preference in herbivores and fish eaters and low preference in invertebrate-eaters compared to omnivores. Northern species also showed a high preference for Natura 2000. The predicted prevalence of a higher rate of increase, or lower rate of decrease, inside Natura 2000, indicating that Natura 2000 facilitated the species' distribution changes, was not shown; instead, the positive and negative trends inside Natura 2000 were almost equivalent. We concluded that the low preference for Natura 2000, the distribution changes shifting species outside Natura 2000, and limits to the carrying capacity of the protected network sites, could all make an issue in effectively safeguarding the non breeding populations of waterbirds. The extension of the Natura 2000 network to facilitate their wintering requirements and distribution changes is therefore a high priority.

AB  - We use a geodatabase to investigate the distribution patterns of an important subset of floristic reports recorded for the Parco Nazionale delle Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona, Campigna in the northern Apennines, Italy. This database was analysed using spatial statistical techniques and a digital elevation model. Significant relationships between species presence, sampling effort and species richness were then analysed in relation to topographical variables and to an existing vegetation map. Report-based rarefaction techniques were used to compare areas having different numbers of species recorded. Overall, the analysis shows that some areas of the park are richer in species of conservation interest than others, and that these have been more intensely investigated. Meanwhile, for other areas, botanical knowledge is scarce or even absent. This has led to clustering and redundancy of floristic data in some areas. The study confirms that the existence of a complete and up-to-date geodatabase creates a valuable resource which enables information gaps to be bridged. Such gaps often exist in biological databases for rare and narrowly distributed species. The wider application of these analyses should also give useful indications of how the incidences of these species of conservation interest are associated with particular environmental variables.

AB  - As both plant and animal species shift their ranges in response to a changing climate, maintaining connectivity between present habitat and suitable habitat in the future will become increasingly important to ensure lasting protection for biodiversity. Because the temporal period commensurate with planning for mid-century change is multi-generational for most species, connectivity designed to facilitate climate adaptation requires pathways with 'stepping-stones' between current and future habitat. These areas should have habitats suitable not only for dispersal, but for all aspects of species lifecycles. We integrated present-day land use, topographic diversity, and projections of shifting climate regimes into a single connectivity modeling approach to identify pathways for mid-century shifts in species ranges. Using Omniscape we identified climate linkages, or areas important for climate change-driven movement, as the areas with more current flow than would be expected in the absence of climate considerations. This approach identified connectivity potential between natural lands in the present climate and natural lands with future analogous climate following topo-climatically diverse routes. We then translated the model output into a strategic framework to improve interpretation and to facilitate a more direct connection with conservation action. Across modified landscapes, pathways important to climate-driven movement were highly coincident with the last remaining present-day linkages, reinforcing their importance. Across unfragmented lands, the presence of climate-adapted pathways helped inform the prioritization of conservation actions in areas where multiple connectivity options still exist. Many climate linkages follow major watercourses along elevational gradients, highlighting the importance of protecting or managing for these natural linear pathways that provide movement routes for climate adaptation. By integrating enduring landscape features with climate projections and present-day land uses, our approach reveals "no-regrets" pathways to plan for a connected landscape in an uncertain future.

AB  - Ecological diversity based on quantitative data is widely used to characterize biological communities, but recently morphological and functional traits have also been used to analyse the structure of fish assemblages. This diversity and structure is usually linked to variables such as habitat complexity and composition, depth, and spatial and temporal variations. In this study, several fish assemblages off the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean) were ecologically and morphologically analysed and compared. The morphological analysis was performed from body shape of fish species using geometric morphology. Moreover, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyse the effect of local environmental variables such as habitat, locality and depth on the composition and abundance of assemblages. The results revealed greater differences among assemblages in the clustering performed from morphological data, which is linked to habitat complexity, than those shown by the ecological analysis. Moreover, the CCA analysis indicated that type of substratum and the location significantly influenced the composition and structure of the fish assemblages. These results evidenced that morphology provides different and complementary information than ecological analysis because it allows to predict the ecological and functional habits of species within the community, helping to improve the understanding of the fish assemblages structure.

AB  - Species that inhabit spatially-distinct regions at different stages of their lifecycle pose challenges to conservation managers, particularly when distributions span international or jurisdictional boundaries. Despite the importance of non-breeding habitat to the persistence of individuals and species, there remains limited information on the habitat requirements of many species during the non-breeding period. We used Global Positioning System tracking devices to determine the non-breeding movements of Great Frigatebirds, Fregata minor, and Lesser Frigatebirds, F. ariel, across much of Southeast Asia. These data were analysed with MaxEnt modelling to identify important habitat features for non-breeding frigatebirds and inform priorities for targeted conservation measures. Models with the greatest predictive performance were influenced strongly by bathymetry. Predicted habitat suitability was greatest in shallow waters. Similarly, warmer waters had greater predicted suitability during the wet season. We also identify 45 roosting sites that form an important component of the habitat used by non-breeding frigatebirds in this region. The existing marine protected area (MPA) network contains only a small proportion of habitat identified as suitable or optimum for non-breeding frigatebirds. This is of particular concern given that some parts of the region's marine environment are among the most heavily human-impacted in the world. Our findings can be used to implement spatially-targeted conservation measures such as education campaigns focusing on bycatch reduction and subsidies for bycatch reduction methods (e.g., streamer lines) for fisheries operating in suitable and optimum habitat. They could also inform placement of additional MPAs to maintain habitat integrity in areas we identified as suitable or optimum habitat, particularly when these habitats occur in close proximity to roosting sites. Such approaches will likely provide benefits to frigatebird populations tracked in the present study as well as those dispersing to the study region from other ocean basins. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - A rural landscape is the final result of the mutual interaction among several natural ecosystems with the artificial intervention of the Man, who transformed the rural land, joining the agricultural production needed for human life with the control and care of extra-urban territory. A rural landscape includes the physical elements of landforms, the hydrological components and transitory elements such as lighting and weather conditions, strictly connected with living elements of land cover including indigenous vegetation, flora and fauna, as well as their possible spontaneous way of organization into different ecosystems. Human elements include different forms of land use, buildings and other rural constructions, who play a central role in determining the formal and substantial characteristics of the extraurban landscape, influencing the agricultural environment and the visual perception of its landscape. Combining both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, a rural landscape reflects a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and national identity, helping to define the self-image of the people who inhabit it, and a sense of place that differentiates one region from others.
   The diffusion of intensive agriculture, together with the expansion of urban areas and consequent enlargement of the anthropic activities onto the rural landscape, determined a general loss in wetland areas all over the World. Because of the high rate of wetland loss over the last century, it has become routine to mitigate these losses by designing and executing specific targeted technical interventions, i.e., building or restoring existing constructions able to create local micro-environment favourable for some amphibian and reptile species, restoring existing wetlands or constructing new artificial ones, etc. Several studies have demonstrated anyway the difficulty of replicating natural habitats when attempting to create suitable habitat for these species.
   In the present paper, the final results of an international Project - named: "ARUPA", financed by the EU LIFE+ Programme - aimed to guarantee the survival and increase in the population of some species of amphibians and reptiles in a protected area, are reported. The actions of the project were taken in the natural protected area surrounding the City of Matera (one of the UNESCO site of the Basilicata Region - Southern Italy) that is an EU Community Interest Site and Special Protection Zone as well. During this Project, some biosystems engineering techniques were employed, through specific constructions for the conservation and re-inclusion of some endangered species. Among these constructions, some dry-stone walls were built or restored, as well as some artificial ponds were realized. Their engineering design and construction aspects, which would contribute to the preservation of the local rural landscape, are here reported and discussed.

AB  - Once one of the most abundant raptors in the world, the White-rumped Vulture (Gyps bengalensis) has faced a drastic population decline across its global range for the past three decades. In India, the main cause of this decline has been the accidental ingestion of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac through livestock carcasses. However, some breeding populations still survive in the forested landscapes of India's Western Ghats. But these populations have also been facing several anthropogenic threats recently, and now show a declining population trend. The two possible conservation strategies for G. bengalensis are to ban diclofenac and develop further captive breeding and reintroduction programs. In this context, we modelled potential reintroduction sites for the species in the Western Ghats by considering its key habitat features and ecological niche models to maximise the likelihood of its long-term regional persistence. Models were developed for current and future climate change scenarios using nesting and foraging occurrence records. Our models predict climatically stable habitats under three climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways; RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5) for three future time periods (2030s, 2050s, and 2080s). The primary determinants of nest-site selection by G. bengalensis evaluated using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) revealed a preference for larger trees closer to water sources. Based on our findings, we suggest possible reintroduction sites in the southern Western Ghats that are climatically stable in the future time periods. Our approach can encourage policymakers to prioritize sites for future species management in the wild. The key results and its implications on conservation of G. bengalensis populations within the Western Ghats hotspot are further discussed in detail.

AB  - The Cerrado is considered the most biodiverse savanna in the world, as well as the second largest Brazilian Biome. In recent decades, primarily due to agricultural expansion and wildfires, this biome has been severely degraded, losing nearly 50% of its original vegetation. This study aims to evaluate the degradation dynamics of the Cerrado vegetation as a function of human activity and climate variability. Products related to vegetation index (MOD13Q1) and an imaging spectroradiometer with moderate resolution from 2001 to 2018 were used to calculate the vegetation degradation index (VDI), which considers the vegetation cover as a function of human actions (deforestation, forest fires, agriculture, and farming). Rain and air temperature data were obtained from the Conventional Weather Station of Janu ' aria-Minas Gerais. Fire foci data were calculated using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer MODIS MCD14DL product sensor (TERRA/AQUA). Specifically, this study focused on the degradation of the vegetation in the Pandeiros River EPA (environmental protection area) that has increased due to the variability of climatic conditions, forest fires, and agricultural activities. The dry season provided greater sensitivity for the evaluation of the vegetation degradation process of the Pandeiros River EPA. The negative effects observed from the variation of climatic conditions and anthropogenic actions on the vegetation dynamics of the Pandeiros River EPA demand greater attention from administrative bodies on strategies for the conservation, preservation, and management of natural resources of conservation areas.

AB  - Seamounts are prominent features of the world's seafloor, and are the target of deep-sea commercial fisheries, and of interest for minerals exploitation. They can host vulnerable benthic communities, which can be rapidly and severely impacted by human activities. There have been recent calls to establish networks of marine protected areas on the High Seas, including seamounts. However, there is little biological information on the benthic communities on seamounts, and this has limited the ability of scientists to inform managers about seamounts that should be protected as part of a network. In this paper we present a seamount classification based on "biologically meaningful" physical variables for which global-scale data are available. The approach involves the use of a general biogeographic classification for the bathyal depth zone (near-surface to 3500 m), and then uses four key environmental variables (overlying export production, summit depth, oxygen levels, and seamount proximity) to group seamounts with similar characteristics. This procedure is done in a simple hierarchical manner, which results in 194 seamount classes throughout the worlds oceans. The method was compared against a multivariate approach, and ground-truthed against octocoral data for the North Atlantic. We believe it gives biologically realistic groupings, in a transparent process that can be used to either directly select, or aid selection of, seamounts to be protected. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A spatially-explicit predictive model was developed for the cover of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica in a marine protected area (MPA) at Palma Bay (NW Mediterranean). A low-cost, novel drop camera system was designed and used to acquire standardized images that were used for estimating P. oceanica cover. A simple, semi-quantitative cover index through visual inspection allowed robust estimates that are free of between-observer bias. A Bayesian kriging approach was implemented through a hierarchical model for non-Gaussian data. The map that was produced is a good match to a previous map of the presence-absence of P. oceanica that was produced by combining side scan sonar and aerial photography. The influence of bathymetry, near-bottom orbital velocities (U-b) and slope on cover distribution were evaluated using a generalized linear model, while taking into account the spatial dependence between observations. We found that the important environmental variables were depth and U-b, while no effect of slope was found. The approach used here allowed us to not only map the cover of Posidonica oceanica but also to provide spatial-explicit information of prediction uncertainty. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background and aims: Studies of plant communities in the Andean sector of San Juan province (Argentina) are scarce. In the provincial Precordillera, La Invernada valley was declared a protected area in 1993 with the name of Private Reserve of Multiple Uses Don Carmelo. Despite being an area of interest from the phytogeographical point of view, it lacks studies of its vegetation. The objective of this work was to determine floristically the plant communities, the vegetation floors and the phytogeographical units of the reserve.
   M&M: A total of 146 floristic releves were made, and environmental variables as slope, geomorphologic unit, altitude, plant cover were recorded, and physic-chemical analyses of soils were carried out. The biologic and chorologic spectra for each community were performed. Obtained data were analyzed using multivariate methods.
   Results: In total, 143 vascular plant species were recorded, and ten plant communities determined. Dominant life forms were chamaephytes and hemicriptophytes. Chorologically the studied area belongs to the Cuyano District of the phytogeographical province of Puna, while below 2600 m a.s.l. elements of Cardonal and Monte are found.

AB  - Local and landscape features influence the spatial distribution of biodiversity. At the landscape scale, heterogeneity has compositional and configurational components that can be measured at different resolutions of conservation planning. We assess the importance of local and landscape features measured at different planning resolutions for maintaining taxonomic and functional butterfly diversity. In remnant conservation corridors that dissect alien tree plantations, butterflies were sampled along a gradient of successional stages, from open and recently burned grasslands to closed-canopy woody habitats. Changes in local vegetation structure were represented by measures of canopy cover. At the landscape scale, compositional and configurational heterogeneity were measured at two resolutions: a simple binary classification of suitable habitat versus unsuitable transformed habitat, and a classification that accounts for the different successional stages within corridors (i.e. within-corridor heterogeneity). Butterfly assemblages were characterized using taxonomic (Simpson's diversity index) and functional indices (Rao's quadratic entropy). The relationship between environmental filters and species traits was further assessed using multivariate modelling. Taxonomic diversity did not reflect functional diversity, as the latter showed differential trait specific responses to local vegetation structure. For both functional and taxonomic diversity, local and landscape variables representing within-corridor heterogeneity were more important than landscape variables measured at the coarser planning resolution. Butterfly diversity showed a negative relationship with increasing edge density between grassy and woody habitats. Synthesis and applications. To promote the taxonomic and functional dimensions of biodiversity, management should aim to maintain both open- and closed-canopy habitats within corridors. These habitats should be contiguous, and corridors as wide as possible, to increase the patch size of contiguous habitat while reducing the proportion of edge.

AB  - The objectives of this study were: (i) to establish the diversity and population structure of Faidherbia albida community, and (ii) to determine major environmental factors that influence recruitment and regeneration of F. albida in the Zambezi Heartland area. F. albida woodland community constitutes an important habitat in Lower Zambezi (Chongwe) National Park, Zambia and Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe which forms the Zambezi Heartland. Data on woody vegetation and environmental variables were collected in 2005 from 25 sample plots distributed across the study area using a stratified random design. A total of 38 tree species were recorded with Mana Pools National Park (H' = 1.3) having a higher species diversity compared to the Lower Zambezi National Park (H' = 0.8). F. albida tree density was significantly higher in Lower Zambezi National Park than in the adjacent Mana Pools National Park (P < 0.05). The size class distribution of stems of F. albida exhibited roughly a negative exponential or "inverse J" curve, however, with Lower Zambezi National Park having a higher recruitment of seedling compared to Mana Pools National Park. The lower F. albida tree density and regeneration capacity in Mana Pools National Park may be attributed to increased herbivore pressure, changes in river flooding regime that followed the river impoundment at Kariba Dam, and also variation in soil composition.

AB  - Light traps have been used worldwide to sample pre-settlement stages as a good estimator of larval availability and distribution to nearshore habitats; however few studies have been performed to date in temperate environment, such as Mediterranean rocky reefs. Here we describe the spatial and temporal variability of post-larval assemblage in the south-western Mediterranean Sea using light traps, and the effects of environmental variables on their abundances. We sampled 2 coastal localities with 9 light-traps for 2 consecutive nights during 13 months. Post-larval occurrence presented a seasonal pattern in which greater abundances and richness occurred during summer and autumn months. Sea surface temperature, currents and winds were the most important variables related to larval abundance. Important spatial differences in terms of diversity and post-larval abundances were found in an area protected from fishing. Although not tested, we suggest that 1) bottom morphology, 2) presence and distribution of habitat types in coastal areas, including those of adults, 3) local oceanographic conditions, and 4) direct and indirect MPA effects, may influence post-larval distribution, resulting in fine-scale spatial differences. These results reinforce the need to undertake further studies on early life stages of fishes to better understand the dynamic of coastal fish populations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Arid regions lack models predicting shifts in biological and environmental conditions, thus precluding the implementation of efficient water policies. The aim of this study was to evaluate how macroinvertebrate communities respond to habitat and chemical conditions in arid-land streams of North Eastern Algeria, and how these communities are affected by human activities. We used Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to classify the sites of the Belezma National Park according to environmental conditions (including habitat and chemical variables), thus generating a template against which biotic conditions could be matched. The macroinvertebrate inventory included 93 taxa covering over 4 phyla, 8 classes, 22 orders and 58 families. Overall, coarse substrates were the most taxon-rich habitats (48 taxa). Wadi Chaaba, located in the integral zone of the park, hosted the most diversified fauna (40 taxa). The SOM delineated 3 clusters of stations (A, B and C), which combined environmental characteristics (altitude, flow velocity, physicochemical descriptors of water, type and substrate surfaces, human pressure) and characteristic benthic macroinvertebrate communities. The distribution patterns of the benthic macroinvertebrates were examined with reference to their pollution-sensitive or pollution-resistant status, and to the associated environmental variables. Wadi Chaaba, which is located in the protected area of the Park, was the healthiest stream, in that it hosted the most pollution-sensitive, indicator species.

AB  - Streams of protected areas should be subjected to less environmental degradation than surrounding areas and consequently support greater aquatic biodiversity. To test this, 186 environmental and landscape variables were measured in 34 streams within the CaxiuanA National Forest (CNF) and its surrounding zone in the eastern Amazon. We expected that streams inside the CNF protected area would have more riparian forest cover and large woody debris (LWD) that increase instream habitat complexity and aquatic biodiversity. Several environmental variables differed between streams in the CNF and surrounding zone; however, the major difference was greater LWD, leaf litter, and channel depth in CNF streams. Richness of fish, Chironomidae, EPT (Ephemeroptera + Plecoptera + Trichoptera), and all-groups combined were positively associated with LWD. Assemblage taxonomic composition was correlated with several variables, but most groups revealed no clear differentiation between the two areas. This lack of differentiation may be explained by relatively minor environmental impacts in areas surrounding the CNF given the region's small human population. The most notable impact to streams outside of the CNF was removal of LWD to facilitate boat passage. To conserve aquatic biodiversity, we recommend expansion of protected areas and adoption of policies governing land use in surrounding zones.

AB  - Recently, China advanced a policy of establishing a protected area system with national parks as the main body, and so the development of protected areas has entered a transitional period. However, to promote the coordinated development of economic construction and ecological protection of protected areas, their management needs to be more comprehensive and refined. Therefore, a more quantitative and refined spatial planning and management method for protected areas is urgently needed. This study took Sanjiangyuan National Park as the research object and considered the three biodiversity elements of species, ecosystems and landscape. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, and Fragstats software were used to determine the areas with highly suitable species habitat, areas of high ecosystem service value and areas of high landscape diversity. Based on these areas, Marxan software was used to calculate the irreplaceability value, identify the boundary of Sanjiangyuan National Park and clarify the gaps of the existing Sanjiangyuan National Park in the space. We suggest that at least 18,569 km(2) of the eastern part of the Sanjiangyuan Region with a high irreplaceability value should be included in the existing Sanjiangyuan National Park. Moreover, the first-level zones were also classified based on irreplaceability, and the second-level functional zones were classified by K-means clustering based on the evaluation of ecological vulnerability and economic construction suitability. The first-level zones include "core conservation zones" and "general control zones", which had areas of 71,758.20 km(2) (57.99%) and 51,980.13 km(2) (42.01%), respectively. The core conservation zoneswere further zoned into primary vulnerable zones and secondary vulnerable zones. The subzones of the general control zones are multifunctional and they are tourism-grazing-living zones, grazing-living zones, tourism-living zones, tourism zones and other areas.

AB  - Climate driven species' range shifts may interfere with existing protected area (PA) networks, resulting in a mismatch between places where species are currently protected and places where they can thrive in the future. Here, we assess the climate-smartness of the Austrian PA network by focusing on endemic species' climatic niches and their future representation within PAs. We calculated endemic species' climatic niches and climate space available in PAs within their dispersal reach under current and future climates, with the latter represented by three climate change scenarios and three time-steps (2030, 2050, and 2080). Niches were derived from the area of occupancy of species and the extent of PAs, respectively, and calculated as bivariate density kernels on gradients of mean annual temperature and annual precipitation. We then computed climatic representation of species' niches in PAs as the proportion of the species' kernel covered by the PA kernel. We found that under both a medium (RCP 4.5) and severe (RCP 8.5) climate change scenario, representation of endemic species' climatic niches by PAs will decrease to a sixth for animals and to a third for plants, on average, toward the end of the century. Twenty to thirty percent of Austrian endemic species will then have no representation of their climatic niches in PAs anymore. Species with larger geographical and wider elevational ranges will lose less climatic niche representation. The declining representation of climatic niches in PAs implies that, even if PAs may secure the persistence of a part of these endemics, only a small portion of intraspecific diversity of many species may be represented in PAs in the future. We discuss our findings in the context of the varied elevational gradients found in Austria and suggest that the most promising strategies for safeguarding endemic species' evolutionary potential are to limit the magnitude of climate change and to reduce other pressures that additionally threaten their survival.</p>

AB  - Knowledge of the fish assemblages of Andean mountain streams is restricted to accessible areas. This study is the first biological survey of the remote Suaza River in the Colombian Andes, at its source in the Cueva de los Guacharos National Park. Mechanistic insight into the ecological patterns and gradients of the river is provided, focusing on the spatial distribution of fish communities in relation to environmental variables and habitat characteristics. Electrofishing surveys and macroinvertebrate sampling were carried out, the river habitat was characterized, three environmental quality indices were applied, and potential water pollutant concentrations were measured. Twenty-seven fish species were recorded - two of them exotic (Poecilia reticulata and Xiphophorus hellerii) - as well as 45 macroinvertebrate families. Fish species richness was higher at lower altitudes with gentle slopes, where habitat temperature, size and heterogeneity were higher. Although macroinvertebrate diversity slightly increased downstream following a similar pattern as fish species richness, it declined at lower sites. Fish assemblages were distributed in three clusters corresponding to headwaters, middle sections and lower reaches of the river, showing correlations with environmental factors, suggesting habitat preferences. Although the headwaters of the Suaza River remains pristine inside the park, human influence is responsible for ecosystem alteration downstream.

AB  - Fourteen species of echinoderms and their relationships to the benthic structure of the coral reefs were assessed at 27 sites-with different levels of human disturbances-along the coast of the Mexican Central Pacific. Diadema mexicanum and Phataria unifascialis were the most abundant species. The spatial variation of the echinoderm assemblages showed that D. mexicanum, Eucidaris thouarsii, P. unifascialis, Centrostephanus coronatus, Toxopneustes roseus, Holothuria fuscocinerea, Cucumaria flamma, and Echinometra vanbrunti accounted for the dissimilarities among the sites. The spatial variation among the sites was mainly explained by the cover of the hard corals (Porites, Pocillopora, Pavona, Psammocora), different macroalgae species (turf, encrusting calcareous algae, articulated calcareous algae, fleshy macroalgae), sponges, bryozoans, rocky, coral rubble, sand, soft corals (hydrocorals and octocorals), Tubastrea coccinea coral, Balanus spp., and water depth. The coverage of Porites, Pavona, and Pocillopora corals, soft coral, rock, and Balanos shows a positive relationship with the sampling sites included within the natural protected area with low human disturbances. Contrary, fleshy macroalgae, sponges, and soft coral show a positive relationship with higher disturbance sites. The results presented here show the importance of protecting the structural heterogeneity of coral reef habitats because it is a significant factor for the distribution of echinoderm species and can contribute to the design of conservation programs for the coral reef ecosystem.

AB  - Aim Despite the importance of termite mounds in plant species' taxonomic diversity, no study has quantified the effect of termite mounds on woody plant species' phylogenetic diversity and phyloendemism. In order to understand how mounds influence phylogenetic diversity (PD), we had two objectives: (i) to determine the influence of termite mounds on PD and (ii) to determine how this varies with environmental and geographic factors. Location Africa. Method We performed a meta-analysis on 21 studies that satisfied our selection criteria out of 369 that we initially identified. All these studies sampled woody plants that occurred on Macrotermes mounds and the surrounding savanna matrix. Results Part of our findings shows that termite mounds had higher PD compared with the surrounding savanna plots. We found that phyloendemism (PE) does not respond to the effects of Macrotermes mounds at small scales, that is between mounds and the savanna matrix. However, at continental scales, phyloendemism responded to environmental variables such as altitude, rainfall and temperature. Altitude and latitude acted negatively on both PD and phyloendemism, while temperature had a positive influence on both metrics. Main conclusions We provide the first quantification of the effect of termite mounds on woody plants' PD in the savannas. Overall, termite mounds contribute, not only to taxonomic diversity in the savanna but also to PD of woody plants. Our analysis shows that termite mounds contribute strongly to overall savanna PD, hence the need to consider them in conservation planning.

AB  - The West Sahara-Sahel is a remote region where knowledge gaps on mammal distribution have hampered accurate local biodiversity assessments and the development of optimised conservation planning in the region. Using a geographical information system and ecological niche-based modelling tools, this study combines high resolution presence data from 22 mammals and environmental factors from the West Sahara-Sahel to identify suitable areas for mammal occurrence, biogeographic affinities among taxa, and local hotspots of species richness. The maximum entropy approach was used to relate environmental factors with mammal distributions and to predict suitable areas of species' occurrence. Biogeographic groups were defined based on the spatial similarities of predicted distributions. Ecological niches of analysed taxa were summarized through Principal Components Analyses based on topoclimatic and habitat variables. Distributions of most mammals were related with climate and/or habitat features, and some were associated with topography. Suitable areas were predicted mostly within known distributions of mammalian taxa. Low values of niche breadth were estimated for all taxa, indicating a tendency for specialization in the study area. Shared distributional ranges among taxa allowed the identification of five groups with different biogeographic affinities. Most groups occurred in the ecoregions North Saharan steppe and woodlands and Sahelian Acacia savanna, reflecting their availability and stressing the importance of these ecoregions for local mammal conservation. Predicted suitable areas were poorly represented in the current network of protected areas, especially in Mauritania. The southern Mauritanian mountains contained suitable habitat for most of the studies mammals, but are largely unprotected. The fine scale ecological niche-based models built with high resolution data can be used to identify key-areas for conservation and management, and could be applied to other remote regions and taxonomic groups worldwide.

AB  - Detailed understanding of a species' natural history and environmental needs across spatial scales is a primary requisite for effective conservation planning, particularly for species with complex life cycles in which different life stages occupy different niches and respond to the environment at different scales. However, niche models applied to conservation often neglect early life stages and are mostly performed at broad spatial scales. Using the endangered heath tiger beetle (Cicindela sylvatica) as a model species, we relate presence/absence and abundance data of locally dispersing adults and sedentary larvae to abiotic and biotic variables measured in a multiscale approach within the geographic extent relevant to active conservation management. At the scale of hundreds of meters, fine-grained abiotic conditions (i.e., vegetation structure) are fundamental determinants of the occurrence of both life stages, whereas the effect of biotic factors is mostly contained in the abiotic signature. The combination of dense heath vegetation and bare ground areas is thus the first requirement for the species' preservation, provided that accessibility to the suitable habitat is ensured. At a smaller scale (centimetres), the influence of abiotic factors on larval occurrence becomes negligible, suggesting the existence of important additional variables acting within larval proximity. Sustained significant correlations between neighbouring larvae in the models provide an indication of the potential impact of neighbourhood crowding on the larval niche within a few centimetres. Since the species spends the majority of its life cycle in the larval stage, it is essential to consider the hierarchical abiotic and biotic processes affecting the larvae when designing practical conservation guidelines for the species. This underlines the necessity for a more critical evaluation of the consequences of disregarding niche variation between life stages when estimating niches and addressing effective conservation measures for species with complex life cycles.

AB  - Identifying suitable habitats of protected species is an essential question in ecology and conservation planning. Modelling approaches have been widely used to identify environmental features that contribute to a species' ecological requirements and distribution. On Reunion Island, a fast-growing French territory located in the south-western Indian Ocean, anthropogenic impacts are mainly concentrated along the coast, representing a potential threat for Indo-Pacific bottlenose (Tursiops aduncus) and spinner (Stenella longirostris) dolphins, two resident coastal species. Beside coastal development, commercial and recreational dolphin-watching are growing, particularly along the west coast. To promote effective local management, habitat modelling was applied using presence-only data collected from 2008 to 2012 on the west coast of the island. Ecological Niche Factor Analyses were used to investigate the effect of physiographic variables on the distribution of these two dolphin species and delineate suitable habitats. It was found that the core habitat of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins was mainly restricted by depth and confined to coastal waters ranging from 4.7 to 75.8 m deep. The species preferentially used soft substrates (sand and mud) and tended to be ubiquitous in terms of substrate type/color used. Foraging activities were significantly related to soft substrates. The diurnal core habitat of spinner dolphins was confined to one discrete area, on the flat portion of the insular shelf, between 45.1 m and 70.7 m of depth. Suitable habitat was mainly related to soft and light-colored substrates, with a clear avoidance of dark-colored substrates. The core habitats of both species were very restrained spatially and therefore vulnerable to human activities. The fine scale habitat mapping achieved in this study represents baseline data to conduct ad hoc impact assessment and support conservation actions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lotic systems, in particular temporal streams, represent an important proportion of continental waters, but are poorly studied. This is particularly clear in central Mexico, where temporal streams are abundant and remain poor studied despite their great potential for high diversity and the important energy within these ecosystems. The aim of this study was to analyze the environmental variables and scales at which these variables have effects on aquatic insect assemblages in a semiarid fluvial system in Central Mexico. A total of 89 genera were registered, the order Coleoptera showing the highest richness. Peak values for alpha diversity were found on permanent sites in the dry season (D-1=10.63), the more stable environment in permanent streams during the dry season might accounted for this pattern. Assemblages at our study sites showed low similarity (I-j < 0.45) indicating high genera replacement among sites, possibly related to differences in hydroperiod. Partition analysis indicates that variation in genera composition among rivers contributed a large proportion of the diversity (37%). Results from the canonical correspondence analysis point to mesohabitat, velocity, ecological quality, and hydrological order, as the most important variables explaining diversity patterns. In addition, hydrological condition and intermittency were important factors related to diversity (similar to 21-22%). The results suggest that permanent sites function has species sources for intermittent sites, highlighting the need for conservation planning at the landscape level in the Xichu's basin.

AB  - Understanding diversity patterns along altitudinal gradients, and their underlying causes are important for conserving biodiversity. Previous studies have focused on climatic, energetic, and geographic variables (e.g., mid-domain effects), with less attention paid to human-induced habitat modifications. We used published data of bird distributions along an elevational gradient (0-4900 m) in the Nepalese Himalaya and interpolated species presence between elevational limits. The relationship between species richness and environmental variables was analyzed using generalized linear models. A low plateau relationship between bird richness and elevation was observed, with a main peak at intermediate elevations (2800 m). Across the total gradient, interpolated bird species richness had a unimodal relationship to maximum monthly precipitation and a linear response to seasonal variation in temperature, proportion of forest cover, and proportion of protected area. In lower elevations (0-2800 m), interpolated species richness had a positive and linear response to the proportion of Ramsar sites and a unimodal response to habitat heterogeneity. At higher elevations (2900-4900 m), interpolated bird richness had a positive linear response to monthly variation in temperature and a negative linear response to proportion forest cover. We conclude that factors related to human management are important drivers of elevational gradients in bird species richness. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Management of communities in fragmented systems requires application of models for predicting and understanding patterns of diversity at relevant scales. Metacommunity models may help explain patterns of beta-diversity, but more empirical investigations are needed to determine the generality of these models and the importance of matrix identity as a mediator of metacommunity processes. We studied patterns of beta diversity among cypress domes in a landscape composed of two different matrix types within Big Cypress National Preserve to determine whether community composition differed by matrix type and to evaluate predictions of metacommunity models. We sampled fully-aquatic vertebrates in 16 cypress domes. A causal modeling framework was used to assess the relative importance of space and environmental variables measured in the domes and in the nearby matrix in explaining variation in community similarities. Our results show that community composition was influenced by matrix type, which violates the common metacommunity assumption that matrix identity has negligible effect on patch patterns. We found different drivers of beta-diversity patterns between matrix types; similarities among dome communities within cypress-prairie matrix were influenced by local environmental conditions and matrix characteristics, while communities in pine-rockland domes were most influenced by conditions in the matrix. Our results have implications for use of metacommunity models in conservation planning and we suggest that future research should focus on the importance of matrix identity and complexity in mediating community patterns in patchy landscapes.

AB  - Beta diversity can be analysed using various approaches, but those integrating site and species contributions to beta diversity are rare in floodplain lake systems. We analysed the beta diversity of rotifers and cladocerans across 50 floodplain lakes in Brazil, focusing on both pelagic and littoral zones. We partitioned beta diversity into local contributions (LCBD), species contributions (SCBD), and related LCBD with environmental variables and SCBD with species features. We expected lower species richness and higher ecological uniqueness for both groups in the pelagic zones than in the littoral zones. The highest ecological uniqueness and low species richness were detected in the pelagic zone, whereas the littoral zones had high species richness and low ecological uniqueness. We found a negative relationship between species richness and LCBD for rotifers, but no significant relationship was detected for cladocerans. Nitrate, transparency and conductivity affected variation in ecological uniqueness. Common and accessory species had higher contributions to beta diversity compared with rare species. The SCBD of rotifers and cladocerans showed similar responses based on occurrence and density data. We suggest that the use of zooplankton assemblages to determine conservation actions across floodplain lakes should be based on different biological groups and lake zones. The inclusion of littoral zones adds to our knowledge of zooplankton biodiversity that has typically been based on studies of pelagic zones, and may have implications for the conservation planning of floodplain lakes.

AB  - Restoration and conservation of species-rich nature reserves requires inclusion of landscape-scale connections and transport processes such as hydrologic flows and species dispersal. These are important because they provide suitable habitat conditions and an adequate species pool. This study aimed at identifying the key hydrologic flows and plant dispersal processes affecting a landscape with species-rich fen reserves where restoration measures are carried out to set back succession. It also intended to use this information for delineating the area relevant for conservation planning on an Operational Landscape Unit map. The study was carried out for complexes of fen ponds in former turbaries in the Vechtplassen area, The Netherlands. A number of recent insights on plant dispersal were integrated with knowledge on hydrologic flows in the present approach. The results showed that groundwater discharge to ensure mesotrophic, base-rich conditions, should be enhanced by restoring the groundwater recharge areas NE of the reserves. A nearby lake with suitable water chemistry was also identified as a key source of surface water to feed the fens in dry periods. Water dispersal was identified as important within the fen reserves, whereas dispersal by daily migrating dabbling ducks, typically occurring over 2-3 km, was the most important route connecting the reserves with the surrounding landscape. The delineation of the Operational Landscape Unit for this region provides a basis for conservation and restoration that take fundamental landscape connections and transport processes into account. This unique approach simultaneously considers hydrological transport processes as well as species dispersal in the larger landscape beyond the reserves themselves and therefore leads to greater success of restoration and conservation.

AB  - Habitat modelling and predictive mapping are important tools for conservation planning, particularly for lesser known species such as many insectivorous bats. However, the scale at which modelling is undertaken can affect the predictive accuracy and restrict the use of the model at different scales. We assessed the validity of existing regional-scale habitat models at a local-scale and contrasted the habitat use of two morphologically similar species with differing conservation status (Mormopterus norfolkensis and Mormopterus species 2). We used negative binomial generalised linear models created from indices of activity and environmental variables collected from systematic acoustic surveys. We found that habitat type (based on vegetation community) best explained activity of both species, which were more active in floodplain areas, with most foraging activity recorded in the freshwater wetland habitat type. The threatened M. norfolkensis avoided urban areas, which contrasts with M. species 2 which occurred frequently in urban bushland. We found that the broad habitat types predicted from local-scale models were generally consistent with those from regional-scale models. However, threshold-dependent accuracy measures indicated a poor fit and we advise caution be applied when using the regional models at a fine scale, particularly when the consequences of false negatives or positives are severe. Additionally, our study illustrates that habitat type classifications can be important predictors and we suggest they are more practical for conservation than complex combinations of raw variables, as they are easily communicated to land managers.

AB  - Capsule Predation risk of artificial nests resembling Hazel Grouse Tetrastes bonasia nests was reduced in more diverse habitats and when roads and trails were closer. Aims To determine the importance of habitat structure and the presence of roads and hiking trails for the predation risk of artificial ground nests. Methods We investigated predation on artificial nests in mountain spruce forests with high tourist numbers in the Tatra Mountains, Southern Poland, in 2012-2014. Some 174 artificial ground nests resembling those of Hazel Grouse were set up and monitored. For 98 artificial nests, we compared environmental variables at two area scales, and the forest structure between predated and surviving nests. Results At the local scale (within 5 m) artificial nests were more likely to be predated at sites with lower occurrence of ferns and lying dead wood. At the wider spatial scale (within 100 m), nests were more likely to survive if near to roads and tourist trails. The occurrence of different tree species in the forest stand did not significantly influence predation rate of artificial nests. The mean daily nest predation rate was not high and varied between years (0.003-0.009). Conclusion Greater habitat diversity and the presence of roads and trails increased the survival of ground nests. These results are potentially important for conservation planning for threatened ground-nesting birds, such as the Tetraonidae.

AB  - Accurate mapping of marine species and habitats is an important yet challenging component of establishing networks of representative marine protected areas. Due to limited biological data, marine classifications based on abiotic data are often used as surrogates to represent biological patterns. We tested the surrogacy of an existing physiographic marine classification using non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational analysis of variance to determine whether species composition was significantly different among physiographic units. We also present an alternative ecological classification that incorporates biological and environmental data in a community modeling approach. We use data on 174 species of demersal fish and benthic invertebrates to identify mesoscale biological assemblages in a 100,000 km(2) study area in the northeast Pacific Ocean. We identified assemblages using cluster analysis then used a random forest model with 12 environmental variables to delineate mesoscale ecological units. Our community modelling approach resulted in five geographically coherent ecological units that were best explained by changes in depth, temperature and salinity. Our model showed high predictive performance (AUC = 0.93) and the resulting ecological units represent more distinct species assemblages than those delineated by physiographic variables alone. A strength of our analysis is the ability to map model uncertainty to identify transition zones at unit boundaries. The output of this study provides a biotic driven classification that can be used to better achieve representativity in the MPA planning process.

AB  - In South America the biogeographic history has produced different biomes with different vegetation types and distinct floras. As these vegetation types may diverge in evolutionary histories, we analysed how alpha and beta phylogenetic diversity vary across them and determine the main drivers of variation in phylogenetic diversity. To this end, we compiled a list of 205 sites and 1222 tree species spread over four biomes and eight vegetation types in central South America. For each site we evaluated six measures of evolutionary alpha diversity (species richness, phylogenetic diversity sensu stricto and the standardized effect size of phylogenetic diversity, mean phylogenetic distance and mean nearest taxon distance) and beta diversity (phylogenetic Sorensen's similarity). We checked the influence of spatial and environmental variables using generalized least squares models. The greatest phylogenetic differentiation was found between west and east of central South America, mainly between the Chaco communities and the other vegetation types, suggesting that species found in this biome come from different lineages, comparing with the others vegetation types. Our results also showed a clustered phylogenetic structure for the Dry Chaco woodlands, which may be associated with harsh environmental conditions. In addition to historical process, climatic conditions are the main drivers shaping phylogenetic patterns among the distinct vegetation types. Understanding patterns of phylogenetic diversity and distribution can greatly improve conservation planning and management since it allows the conservation of unique biome characteristics.

AB  - The Ross Sea, Antarctica, is amongst the least human-impacted marine environments, and the site of the world's largest Marine Protected Area. We present research on two components of the Ross Sea benthic fauna: mega-epifauna, and macro-infauna, sampled using video and multicore, respectively, on the continental shelf and in previously unsampled habitats on the northern continental slope and abyssal plain. We describe physical habitat characteristics and community composition, in terms of faunal diversity, abundance, and functional traits, and compare similarities within and between habitats. We also examine relationships between faunal distributions and ice cover and productivity, using summaries of satellite-derived data over the decade prior to our sampling. Clear differences in seafloor characteristics and communities were noted between environments. Seafloor substrates were more diverse on the Slope and Abyss, while taxa were generally more diverse on the Shelf. Mega-epifauna were predominantly suspension feeders across the Shelf and Slope, with deposit feeder-grazers found in higher or equal abundances in the Abyss. In contrast, suspension feeders were the least common macro-infaunal feeding type on the Shelf and Slope. Concordance between the mega-epifauna and macro-infauna data suggests that non-destructive video sampling of mega-epifauna can be used to indicate likely composition of macro-infauna, at larger spatial scales, at least. Primary productivity, seabed organic flux, and sea ice concentrations, and their variability over time, were important structuring factors for both community types. This illustrates the importance of better understanding bentho-pelagic coupling and incorporating this in biogeographic and process-distribution models, to enable meaningful predictions of how these ecosystems may be impacted by projected environmental changes. This study has enhanced our understanding of the distributions and functions of seabed habitats and fauna inside and outside the Ross Sea MPA boundaries, expanding the baseline dataset against which the success of the MPA, as well as variability and change in benthic communities can be evaluated longer term.

AB  - The Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park was established in 1923 and is considered a flagship conservation area in Italy. It includes large extensions of semi-natural grasslands, maintained by traditional transhumant grazing for centuries. The patterns and drivers of grassland composition within the Park are still poorly investigated, and the scattered phytosociological data available were often based on releves with varied and not precisely defined sizes.
   In order to provide for the first time a general overview of the Park's dry grasslands, we analysed a dataset of 87 releves with a fixed size of 2 x 2 m, precisely delimited in the field and GPS-located. Specific research aims were: (1) to classify the vegetation plots into floristic-ecological types, supported by an analysis of mean (Italy-specific) Ellenberg Indicator Values (EIVs); (2) to assign the types to up-to-date phytosociological syntaxa; (3) to identify the main environmental drivers for both composition and richness patterns; (4) to test the degree of correlation between (Italy-specific) EIVs and the measured environmental variables.
   Environmental predictors included high-resolution climatologies and remote-sensed standing biomass. Main vegetation types were identified using Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA). Distancebased RDA was performed as a constrained ordination method to reveal correlations between floristic composition and environmental variables. Drivers of species richness were explored through partial correlation and Regression Trees.
   HCA and NMDS revealed four floristically and ecologically well-interpretable groups, in turn well corresponding to the level of phytosociological class (namely Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, Nardetea strictae, Festuco hystricis-Ononidetea striatae and Festuco-Brometea). Constrained ordination showed that most of the floristic variation was explained by biomass, annual precipitation (Pann) and mean annual temperature (Tm). Strong and significant positive correlations were found between biomass and EIV for Nitrogen (EIV-N), and between T-m and EIV for Temperature (EIV-T). Strong and significant negative correlations were found between P-ann and EIV-T, EIV for Continentality (EIV-C) and EIV for soil Reaction (EIV-R). Species richness was positively correlated with slope inclination and negatively with elevation; richness was higher in sites with a high rock cover, and on limestone or clayey substrata than on siliceous ones.
   We conclude that in the study area: a) dry semi-natural grasslands are arranged at least into four distinguishable, high rank floristic-ecological groups; b) a mixture of climatic (especially precipitation) and edaphic (especially bedrock and soil reaction) gradients are the main drivers of such composition patterns; c) species richness is higher in sites more stressed by summer drought and/or nutrient scarcity; d) community-means of Italy's specific EIVs are well correlated with environmental variables in grasslands, including a good correspondence between EIV-T and mean annual temperature.

AB  - Background Seven out of ten hornbill species in the Philippines are threatened with extinction. Among these is the endangered Visayan Hornbill (Penelopides panini), found on the islands of Panay and Negros. Threatened by habitat loss and hunting, its population size is thought to have declined from 1800 individuals 20 years ago to less than 1000. However, a recent study on Negros estimated 3564 individuals across three core forest blocks. This study aims to quantify the Visayan Hornbill population size in and around the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park (NWPPNP) on Panay, the largest contiguous low-elevation forest landscape remaining across its range, and its broad habitat associations across a gradient of environmental degradation. Methods Hornbills were surveyed using 10-min distance sampling point counts (n = 367) along transects (average length 1.1 km). Environmental variables were recorded along transects, while habitat was classified into primary forest, secondary forest, plantation, or open habitat. Distance software was used to estimate population densities stratified by habitat, with the overall population estimate taken as a mean of habitat density estimates weighted by habitat area. Using generalized linear mixed models, hornbill occurrence was modelled using combinations of nine environmental variables as main and two-way fixed effects. Results Surveys covered 204.4 km(2) of the 374.8 km(2) Northwest Panay Peninsula. Hornbills were not recorded in plantations or open habitats. Hornbill density was significantly higher in primary forest (17.8 individuals/km(2) +/- 26.9% CV) than in secondary forest (3.7 individuals/km(2) +/- 33.2% CV; z = 15.212, P < 0.001). The overall population estimate for the NWPPNP and environs is 2109 individuals, and 2673 individuals for the entire Northwest Panay Peninsula. Hornbill presence was best explained by a model including distance from the Park boundary alongside five interaction effects and transect as a random effect. Distance, and the interaction between distance and medium-sized trees were significant predictors of hornbill presence. Conclusions Our study evidences the habitat preference of the Visayan Hornbill, highlights the importance of the NWPPNP for the species' conservation, and provides strong evidence for re-assessing the global population size.

AB  - In order to characterize spatial patterns and environmental and biological drivers of organic matter remineralization and nutrient regeneration in deep-sea sedimentary habitats, we measured fluxes of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate, and silicate at the sediment-water interface during 48-h ex situ incubation of sediment cores. We sampled a total of 6 stations (351-445 m depth) inside the Laurentian Channel Marine Protected Area (MPA), on the outer continental shelf of Newfoundland (Canada). We assessed the potential effect of octocoral sea pens on uni- and multivariate benthic nutrient fluxes at large- and small-scale by comparing sea pen fields and other sedimentary habitats, and cores with and without sea pens. For each station, we evaluated a wide range of environmental variables, including physico-chemical and sedimentary factors, and we identified macrofaunal organisms inhabiting the cores, assessed their taxonomic diversity, community composition, and biological trait expression. Our analysis identified macrofaunal species richness and the density of a few key taxa, as well as environmental factors such as the quantity of sedimentary organic matter as the primary drivers of variation of multivariate benthic fluxes. Macrofauna explained up to 41% of the variation in benthic fluxes, whereas environmental variables only explained up to 19%, highlighting the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning. Uni- and multivariate analysis of fluxes did not reveal clear spatial patterns within the MPA habitats and stations, and fluxes showed high small-scale variability. We found enhanced ammonium efflux rates associated with the presence of sea pens at both small- and large-scale, likely reflecting both direct and indirect effects of these soft corals on organic matter deposition and sedimentary biogeochemical processes. Sea pens, however, did not appear to influence other fluxes, leaving their role for organic matter remineralization unclear. The extreme complexity and small-scale heterogeneity of benthic processes, particularly within what appears to be a relatively homogeneous environment, underscores the need for further studies to facilitate generalizations of patterns and drivers of benthic nutrient fluxes at larger scales, which will ultimately enable the effective integration of ecosystem functioning into conservation strategies.

AB  - Aquatic biodiversity is threatened by anthropogenic activities operating across jurisdictional and conservation area boundaries. Strategic conservation planning for broad, multispecies and multijurisdictional landscapes benefits from data-driven approaches emphasizing persistence of priority species while accounting for human uses and stakeholder priorities. This study presents such an assessment for conservation of priority fishes of the U.S. Great Plains. Distribution models for 28 priority fishes were incorporated into a prioritization framework using the open-source software Zonation. A series of assessments were produced, including (1) identification of distinct conservation areas based on connectivity and compositional similarity of priority streams, (2) perspectives for fish habitat condition prioritized towards undisturbed habitat (indicating protection potential) and disturbed habitat (indicating restoration potential), (3) ranking species conservation values at local (state) and global scales, and (4) development of "bang-for-buck" perspectives emphasizing richness of species at state, basin, and study region scales. Assessment highlights include prioritizations primarily among unfragmented main-stem reaches, considerable state-boundary-based edge effects for rankings when using state based conservation values, and identification of eight distinct regions containing natural communities of priority taxa. Further, we integrate an assessment product into a tiered framework for conservation implementation that facilitates coordination among stakeholders across jurisdictions and increases efficiency of conservation efforts. This set of analyses thus provides varying perspectives to

AB  - Spatially explicit models of animal abundance are a critical tool to inform conservation planning and management. However, they require the availability of spatially diffuse environmental predictors of abundance, which may be challenging, especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats. This is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-layered and species-rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots. We developed an approach that calibrates remote-sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used as a predictor of primate density based on published models. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to relate 9.8-ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics extracted from Landsat 8 imagery. We tested the potential of this approach for spatial inference of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus monkey, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors of abundance. The best GLM had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area. Our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements. Results show the potential of using open-access and global remote-sensing data to derive an important predictor of-animal abundance in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density. This approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance of abundance modeling for informing conservation. This is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns of abundance, in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions, such as improving forest protection, may need to be focused on priority areas.

TI  - Incorporating natural and human factors in habitat modelling and spatial prioritisation for the Lynx lynx martinoi
T2  - WEB ECOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Countries in south-eastern Europe are cooperating to conserve a sub-endemic lynx species, Lynx lynx martinoi. Yet, the planning of species conservation should go hand-in-hand with the planning and management of (new) protected areas. Lynx lynx martinoi has a small, fragmented distribution with a small total population size and an endangered population. This study combines species distribution modelling with spatial prioritisation techniques to identify conservation areas for Lynx lynx martinoi. The aim was to determine locations of high probability of occurrence for the lynx, to potentially increase current protected areas by 20% in Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. The species distribution modelling used generalised linear models with lynx occurrence and pseudo-absence data. Two models were developed and fitted using the lynx data: one based on natural factors, and the second based on factors associated with human disturbance. The Zonation conservation planning software was then used to undertake spatial prioritisations of the landscape using the first model composed of natural factors as a biological feature, and (inverted) a second model composed of anthropological factors such as a cost layer. The first model included environmental factors as elevation, terrain ruggedness index, woodland and shrub land, and food factor as chamois prey (occurrences) and had a prediction accuracy of 82 %. Second model included anthropological factors as agricultural land and had a prediction accuracy of 65 %. Prioritised areas for extending protected areas for lynx conservation were found primarily in the Albania-Macedonia-Kosovo and Montenegro-Albania-Kosovo cross-border areas. We show how natural and human factors can be incorporated into spatially prioritising conservation areas on a landscape level. Our results show the importance of expanding the existing protected areas in cross-border areas of core lynx habitat. The priority of these cross-border areas highlight the importance international cooperation can play in designing and implementing a coherent and long-term conservation plan including a species conservation plan to securing the future of the lynx.

AB  - Network expansion of marine protected areas in a changing world is a difficult task for conservation planners. Brazil experiences a combination of low and uneven protection of marine environmets, increasing anthropogenic pressures, climate change, and gaps in information regarding the geographical distribution of many species (Wallacean shortfall). Here, we addressed these issues and present a strategy for identifying priority marine areas for conservation in Brazil that would contribute to increasing species representation and achievement of conservation targets. Within this strategy, we accounted for (i) species range shifts due to climate change and their influence on species distribution, (ii) the lack of species geographical distribution data, and (iii) anthropic pressures on oceans. First, we built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 12 threatened starfish species in both present and future (2100) times using Maxent. We also quantified and mapped species range shifts. Second, we developed three conservation spatial solutions and compared the 10% top-ranked areas. The results showed that ENMs had a good performance in representing the distribution of species, even those that had few occurrence records. Our models forecasted a significant range expansion for the majority of species (10 out 12) by 2100. We found that the priority sites covering the top-ranked 10% in the study area identified in ours conservation spatial solutions would protect between 10.41% and 15.88%, on average, of suitable areas for the starfish species. Our results indicated priority sites for conservation less affected by anthropic pressures (similar to 2%) when data on human impacts on oceans were incorporated into the spatial prioritization process. We identified a network of priority marine sites for conservation that minimized human influence and considered the effects of climate change on species distribution. We used threatened starfish species as a case study for illustrating our approach; however, such an approach could be applied to any taxonomic group, which supports the development of more effective conservation actions that represent biodiversity under such threats.

AB  - AimIdentification of priority conservation areas and evaluation of coverage of the current protected areas are urgently needed to halt the biodiversity loss. Identifying regions combining similar environmental traits (climate regions) and species assemblages (biogroups) is needed for conserving the biodiversity patterns and processes. We identify climate regions and biogroups and map species diversity across the Sahara-Sahel, a large geographical area that exhibits wide environmental heterogeneity and multiple species groups with distinct biogeographical affinities, and evaluate the coverage level of current network of protected areas for biodiversity conservation.

   MethodsWe use spatially explicit climate data with the principal component analysis and model-based clustering techniques to identify climate regions. We use distributions of 1147 terrestrial vertebrates (and of 125 Sahara-Sahel endemics) and apply distance clustering methods to identify biogroups for both species groups. We apply reserve selection algorithms targeting 17% of species distribution, climate regions and biogroups to identify priority areas and gap analysis to assess their representation within the current protected areas.
   ResultsSeven climate regions were identified, mostly arranged as latitudinal belts. Concentrations of high species richness were found in the Sahel, but the central Sahara gathers most endemic and threatened species. Ten biogroups (five for endemics) were identified. A wide range of biogroups tend to overlap in specific climate regions. Identified priority areas are inadequately represented in protected areas, and six new top conservation areas are needed to achieve conservation targets.
   Main conclusionsBiodiversity distribution in Sahara-Sahel is spatially structured and apparently related to environmental variation. Although the majority of priority conservation areas are located outside the areas of intense human activities, many cross multiple political borders and require internationally coordinated efforts for implementation and management. Optimized biodiversity conservation solutions at regional scale are needed. Our work contradicts the general idea that deserts are uniform areas and provide options for the conservation of endangered species.

AB  - Understanding the social dimensions of conservation opportunity is crucial for conservation planning in multiple-use landscapes. However, factors that influence the feasibility of implementing conservation actions, such as the history of landscape management, and landholders' willingness to engage are often difficult or time consuming to quantify and rarely incorporated into planning. We examined how conservation agencies could reduce costs of acquiring such data by developing predictive models of management feasibility parameterized with social and biophysical factors likely to influence landholders' decisions to engage in management. To test the utility of our best-supported model, we developed 4 alternative investment scenarios based on different input data for conservation planning: social data only; biological data only; potential conservation opportunity derived from modeled feasibility that incurs no social data collection costs; and existing conservation opportunity derived from feasibility data that incurred collection costs. Using spatially explicit information on biodiversity values, feasibility, and management costs, we prioritized locations in southwest Australia to control an invasive predator that is detrimental to both agriculture and natural ecosystems: the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). When social data collection costs were moderate to high, the most cost-effective investment scenario resulted from a predictive model of feasibility. Combining empirical feasibility data with biological data was more cost-effective for prioritizing management when social data collection costs were low (<4% of the total budget). Calls for more data to inform conservation planning should take into account the costs and benefits of collecting and using social data to ensure that limited funding for conservation is spent in the most cost-efficient and effective manner.
   El Valor de Usar Modelos de Viabilidad en la Planeacion de la Conservacion Sistematica para Predecir la Comprension de Manejo de los Terratenientes Entender las dimensiones sociales de las oportunidades de conservacion es importante para la planeacion de la conservacion en terrenos de uso multiple. Sin embargo, los factores que influyen la viabilidad de implementar acciones de conservacion, como la historia del manejo del terreno y la disposicion de los terratenientes a comprometerse, frecuentemente son dificiles o consumen mucho tiempo para poder cuantificar y rara vez se incorporan a la planeacion. Examinamos como las agencias de conservacion pueden reducir los costos de adquisicion de dicha informacion al desarrollar modelos pronosticadores de manejo de viabilidad con parametros de factores sociales y biofisicos que probablemente influyan sobre las decisiones de los terratenientes de participar en el manejo. Para probar la utilidad de nuestro modelo mejor fundamentado, desarrollamos cuatro escenarios alternativos de inversion basados en diferentes entradas de datos para la planeacion de la conservacion: solo datos sociales; solo datos biologicos; oportunidad de conservacion potencial derivada de la viabilidad modelada que no cause gastos de colecta de datos sociales; y oportunidades conservacion existentes derivados de datos de viabilidad que causaron gastos de colecta. Al usar informacion espacialmente explicita sobre los valores de la biodiversidad, viabilidad y gastos de manejo, priorizamos ubicaciones en el suroeste de Australia para controlar a un depredador invasor que es danino para la agricultura y los ecosistemas naturales: el zorro rojo (Vulpes vulpes). El escenario de inversion mas rentable resulto de un modelo pronosticador de viabilidad. Combinar los datos de viabilidad empirica con datos biologicos fue mas rentable para priorizar el manejo cuando los gastos de colecta de datos sociales fueron bajos (<4% del presupuesto total). Al querer mas datos para informar a la planeacion de la conservacion se deben considerar los gastos y beneficios de colectar y usar datos sociales para asegurar que el financiamiento limitado de la conservacion se gaste de la manera mas rentable y efectiva.

AB  - The interior forest of protected area (PA) recover quickly in terms of greater diversity and structural complexity than peripheral and outsides, which may be due to high plant-frugivore interactions in the interior forest than the disturbed outsides. To describe the structural and functional differences in tree communities from interior to outside forests with in small PA, we quantitatively analyzed the vegetation of Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, a rich primate habitat of Northeast India. Vegetation was sampled at a parts per thousand yen10 cm girth at breast height by 10 m x 500 m sized 20 line transects (10 ha) laid in the interior (N = 7), peripheral (N = 7) and outside (N = 6) zones of this sanctuary. All transects were ordinated by Principal Component Analysis based on correlation between diversity and existing disturbance indices. We found significant differences (P < 0.05) in taxonomic richness and diversity indices between the habitat. Van diagram confirmed greater unique species richness in the interior zone (64) than peripheral (28) and outside (6) zones. Overall density (ha(-1)) did not differed across the zones, but basal area (m(2) ha(-1)) was significantly (P < 0.01) high in peripheral zone. Vertical distribution of stem density was linearly declined across zones ( > 0.70; P < 0.01) with increase in the canopy height. Horizontal distribution of adult stems showed significant inverse quadratic relationship ( > 0.80; P < 0.001), which suggests very low density of canopy forming voluminous trees in the interior zone. Immediate protection, restoration and management of interior regions are required to preserve local plant genetic diversity and also to maintain suitable habitat for threatened wildlife.

AB  - In this study we projected the effect of anthropogenic climate change in endemic and restricted-range Andean bird species that spread out from the center of Bolivia to southeastern Peru. We also analyzed the representation of these species in protected areas. The ensemble forecasts from niche-based models indicated that 91-100% of species may reduce their range size under full and no dispersal scenarios, including five species that are currently threatened. The large range reduction (average 63%) suggests these mountain species may be threatened by climate change. The strong effects due to range species losses are predicted in the humid mountain forests of Bolivia. The representation of bird species also decreased in protected areas. Partial gap species (94-86%) are expected to increase over the present (62%). This suggests climate change and other non-climate stressors should be incorporated in conservations plans for the long-term persistence of these species. This study anticipates the magnitude of shifts in the distribution of endemic birds, and represents in the study area the first exploration of the representation of rangerestricted Andean birds in protected areas under climate change.

AB  - The patterns of habitat use by the franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei) along its distribution are poorly known. This study investigates the patterns of habitat use with respect to depth for 18 1 individuals of different age, size, gender and reproductive condition off Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. The results reveal that franciscanas are very homogeneously distributed according to depth. Individuals from all lengths utilize nearly the entire range of depths of the surveyed area. Larger or older animals do not use deeper waters than younger animals, indicating that body size and age are not limiting factors for franciscanas that occupy deeper or offshore waters. Gestation seems to not cause a change in the distribution Of females. Although the sex-ratio of the overall data did not vary from 1:1 in different depth intervals, a small-scale comparison between the northern and southern coast demonstrated the existence of some kind of sexual segregation. Franciscana by-catch in Rio Grande do Sul is not sustainable and it is agreed that management procedures are needed. Nevertheless, the available data on species distribution do not allow the designing of a protected area in order to minimize the by-catches of a particular sex/reproductive class.

AB  - Ecological niche modeling can provide insights into a species' demography, ecology and biogeography, and the environmental factors that determine them. Exploration of ecological niche models and niche-divergence among closely-related and cryptic organisms can also be useful for species delineation and discrimination, and such information can inform and facilitate conservation of their populations. In this study, I used an ecological niche modeling approach to investigate the conservation biogeography of the fork-marked lemurs (genus Phaner), a group of cryptic, nocturnal primates that are endemic to Madagascar. I constructed all ecological niche models in MaxEnt, using a range of climatic and habitat-related variables. I examined interspecific niche-separation within the Phaner genus, and among two sub-populations of P. electromontis, a species which has previously been hypothesized to represent two distinct, cryptic taxa. All ecological niche models performed well and with high accuracy, and whilst the percentage contribution of each environmental variable differed between species, the results suggested that climate may be the primary determinant of Phaner distribution. Further, all four Phaner species occupied distinct ecological niches, a result that was also mirrored in the two P. electromontis subpopulations. This suggests that one of the two sub-populations may indeed be a distinct, as-yet undescribed species, but further genetic and ecological research is needed to substantiate this result. Finally, the ecological niche models revealed that only 23.0% of the suitable land area for Phaner occurrence within Madagascar is forested, limiting the geographic distribution of these lemurs. Whilst much of this suitable habitat is thankfully protected, deforestation continues throughout Madagascar, and this under-studied group of lemurs requires further research attention and continued conservation efforts.

AB  - The distribution of threatened species often serves to drive conservation decisions. Much of the distribution of many threatened species is already protected. These species may need fostering, but not necessarily further protected areas. We propose a simple and generic means of assessing the degree of protection presently offered to a threatened species, namely, the proportion of its distribution that is unprotected. This index classifies threatened species into two classes: most of their distribution range is either (1) inside protected areas (protected), or (2) outside of protected areas (unprotected). We propose that evaluation of land for planning and conservation should be based chiefly on the distribution of those threatened species that are not yet protected by the current reserve network. Our approach is exemplified in a case study of vertebrate species in Israel. We constructed a "hotspots map" using only the threatened species that have more than 60% of their distribution unprotected (n = 57), and compared it to a similar map with all threatened vertebrates (n = 118). This latter map had all hotspots around the Rift Valley in the eastern part of the country, while the former map had some hotspots in the western parts of the country as well. This study highlights the importance of a clear decision regarding which species should be used in prioritizing areas for conservation.

The measurements were made in six plots: three plots located in the Iboubikro forest and three in Blue Lake Forest (circular plots of 1,256 m(2) or 40 m of plot diameter). 85 trees of DBH >= 10 cm, divided into 25 species and 14 families have been recorded. Biomass data was collected using the tree-ring or floristic inventory method and data analyzed using SPSS v. 18.0 statistical software. The results showed that, the Fabaceae had significant trees (17 species), with a relative diversity index of 20% followed by the Mimosaceae with 14 species and a relative diversity index of 16%. Millettia laurentii, Pentaclethra eetveldeana, Eriocoelum macrocarpum, Millettia pinnata and Sorindeia juglandifolia were listed as most important species in the area based on their relative frequency. Further study has been done to identify and determine the trees taxon for Lesio-louna tropical forest and their phytogeographical distribution. Flora of Lesio-louna protected area has a remarkable diversity and the floristic richness is very considerable in its specific composition.

AB  - Anthropogenic mortality of wildlife is typically inferred from measures of the absolute decline in population numbers. However, increasing evidence suggests that indirect demographic effects including changes to the age, sex, and social structure of populations, as well as the behavior of survivors, can profoundly impact population health and viability. Specifically, anthropogenic mortality of wildlife (especially when unsustainable) and fragmentation of the spatial distribution of individuals (home-ranges) could disrupt natal dispersal mechanisms, with long-term consequences to genetic structure, by compromising outbreeding behavior and gene flow. We investigate this threat in African leopards (Panthera pardus pardus), a polygynous felid with male-biased natal dispersal. Using a combination of spatial (home-range) and genetic (21 polymorphic microsatellites) data from 142 adult leopards, we contrast the structure of two South African populations with markedly different histories of anthropogenically linked mortality. Home-range overlap, parentage assignment, and spatio-genetic autocorrelation together show that historical exploitation of leopards in a recovering protected area has disrupted and reduced subadult male dispersal, thereby facilitating opportunistic male natal philopatry, with sons establishing territories closer to their mothers and sisters. The resultant kin-clustering in males of this historically exploited population is comparable to that of females in a well-protected reserve and has ultimately led to localized inbreeding. Our findings demonstrate novel evidence directly linking unsustainable anthropogenic mortality to inbreeding through disrupted dispersal in a large, solitary felid and expose the genetic consequences underlying this behavioral change. We therefore emphasize the importance of managing and mitigating the effects of unsustainable exploitation on local populations and increasing habitat fragmentation between contiguous protected areas by promoting in situ recovery and providing corridors of suitable habitat that maintain genetic connectivity.

AB  - Internationally there is political momentum to establish networks of marine protected areas for the conservation of threatened species and habitats. Practical implementation of such networks requires an understanding of the distribution of these species and habitats. Predictive modelling provides a method by which continuous distribution maps can be produced from limited sample data. This method is particularly useful in the deep sea where a number of biological communities have been identified as vulnerable 'habitats', including Lophelia pertusa reefs. Recent modelling efforts have focused on predicting the distribution of this species. However the species is widely distributed where as reef habitat is not. This study uses Maxent predictive modelling to investigate whether the distribution of the species acts as a suitable proxy for the reef habitat. Models of both species and habitat distribution across Hatton Bank and George Bligh Bank are constructed using multibeam bathymetry, interpreted substrate and geomorphology layers, and derived layers of bathymetric position index (BPI), rugosity, slope and aspect. Species and reef presence records were obtained from video observations. For both models performance is fair to excellent assessed using AUC and additional threshold dependant metrics. 7.17% of the study area is predicted as highly suitable for the species presence while only 0.56% is suitable for reef presence, using the sensitivity-specificity sum maximisation approach to determine the appropriate threshold. Substrate is the most important variable in the both models followed by geomorphology in the RD model and fine scale BPI in the SD model. The difference in the distributions of reef and species suggest that mapping efforts should focus on the habitat rather than the species at fine (100 m) scales. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is causing shifts in species distributions worldwide. Understanding how species distributions will change with future climate change is thus critical for conservation planning. Impacts on oceanic islands are potentially major given the disproportionate number of endemic species and the consequent risk that local extinctions might become global ones. In this study, we use species climate envelope models to evaluate the current and future potential distributions of Azorean endemic species of bryophytes, vascular plants, and arthropods on the Islands of Terceira and Sao Miguel in the Azores archipelago (Macaronesia). We examined projections of climate change effects on the future distributions of species with particular focus on the current protected areas. We then used spatial planning optimization software (PRION) to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas at preserving species both in the present and future. We found that contractions of species distributions in protected areas are more likely in the largest and most populated island of Sao Miguel, moving from the coastal areas towards inland where the current protected areas are insufficient and inadequate to tackle species distribution shifts. There will be the need for a revision of the current protected areas in Sao Miguel to allow the sustainable conservation of most species, while in Terceira Island the current protected areas appear to be sufficient. Our study demonstrates the importance of these tools for informing long-term climate change adaptation planning for small islands.

AB  - Despite their importance in ecosystems, population sizes and trends are unknown for many seabirds, including in the Antarctic. Here we report on the first comprehensive survey of south polar skuas Stercorarius maccormicki and Antarctic shags Leucocarbo bransfieldensis in Ryder Bay, and collate previous count data. In austral summer 2017/18, totals of 259 skuas at club sites and 978 occupied skua territories were counted in 2.3 km(2) of suitable habitat at Rothera Point and adjacent islands. Based on the mean nearest neighbour distance (23.2m), skua nest densities were comparable with colonies elsewhere. Long-term monitoring of skuas at Rothera Point indicated considerable annual variation and overall increases of 1.9 and 1.3% per annum, respectively, in breeding pairs from 1975/76 to 2017/18, and occupied territories from 1988/89 to 2017/18. In total, 405 pairs of Antarctic shags bred at two known and one newly discovered colony in 2017/18. Previous counts at the two known colonies indicated substantial annual variation and increases of 5.5 and 3.3% per annum, respectively, from 1985/86 to 2017/18 and 1989/90 to 2017/18. Factors leading to overall increases in both species, and the intermittent seasons of near-complete failure to breed, are unclear, but likely to reflect impacts of environmental change on their marine prey or sea ice. The breeding populations of south polar skuas and Antarctic shags in Ryder Bay represent 10.3 and 3.5%, respectively, of revised global estimates of 9500 and 11,684 breeding pairs. We recommend that the breeding colonies be included as important bird areas (IBAs) and within the Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) system, and provision made to conserve foraging areas at sea.

AB  - The genus Ferocactus has complex taxonomy and phylogenetic and evolutionary history, affected greatly by geographic and reproductive isolation in its diversification and evolution. However, the number of species classified in risk categories is shocking, therefore the knowledge on species' distribution patterns and their environmental determinants, as well as the processes of habitat loss due to land use change is important. In this paper, we used ecological niche modeling to generate potential distribution of nine species of Ferocactus protected by Mexican law, then using geographic information systems we obtained the bioclimatic profile of each species and the influence of climatic variables in their geographic distribution. We also evaluated the effects of the change of land use in their distribution area and estimated the safeguarded area within a Natural Protected Area. The results show that habitat loss is greater in the species whose distribution area is in the center of Mexico compared to those living in the Baja California Peninsula and the representativeness of most species is low in Natural Protected Areas. It might be necessary to re-evaluate the risk categories of species, as well as coordinate efforts to identify potential areas suitable for conservation strategies or recovery plans and to promote the decree of new areas (or extension thereof) to protect the habitat of the species.

AB  - The Vulnerable bumphead parrotfishBolbometopon muricatum, a highly prized fishery resource worldwide, has experienced population declines throughout its geographical range. There is limited knowledge of the distribution and abundance of, and threats to, this fish in Indian waters, particularly for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. To assess the species' distribution and conservation status we conducted underwater surveys across 75 sites around 51 islands and interviewed 99 fishers across the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. We recorded a total of 59 individualB. muricatumacross nine sites from the northernmost island in the Andamans (Landfall Island) to the southernmost island in the Nicobars (Great Nicobar Island). Interviews revealed that most fishers (100% in Nicobar, 94% in Middle Andaman, 62% in South Andaman) had seenB. muricatum, and knowledge of the species is highest amongst spearfishers. Generalized linear models indicated that presence of marine protected areas and high live coral cover influenced the abundance and distribution ofB. muricatum. The species' density seems to be naturally low in the archipelago. We discuss our findings in the light of protecting rare and threatened species, and recommend strengthening the existing marine protected areas in these islands.

AB  - To demonstrate conservation effects resulting from marine protected areas, many studies rely on spatial comparisons between areas afforded different levels of protection. These spatial comparisons can be confounded if the habitat and reef size are dissimilar and not accounted for in the statistical analysis. Taking into account reef size (obtained from multibeam sonar data) and benthic habitat structure, this research tested the effect of management zonation (No-take Sanctuary Zone = NTSZ; Controlled Pelagic Zone = CPZ) on the population structure (relative abundance and average biomass) of six fish species in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa. Furthermore, this study tested the effect of ignoring reef size in spatial comparisons. Our results showed that reef size had a significant positive effect on the relative abundance and average biomass of most, but not all species. When reef size was included in the models, the results showed that two of the six species presented no effect of management zone; two appeared to be directly affected by the permitted (past and present) fishing activity in the CPZ; and the last two species appeared to be affected by the disturbance caused by the diving and/or boating activity in the CPZ. Excluding reef size from the analysis consistently resulted in the predicted relative abundance and average biomass decreasing in the CPZ and increasing in the NTSZ. This effect was most marked in the average biomass data, as the management zone effect changed from negligible to significant for five of the six species. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the reef size, or area of suitable habitat, when conducting spatial comparisons among species and illustrate the potential impact of the trade-off required to accommodate human needs within protected spaces.

AB  - Understanding processes driving patterns of species distribution and diversity is one of the main objectives of community ecology. The aim of our study was to evaluate the spatial variation in assemblage composition of stream-dwelling macroinvertebrates and identify which factors (e.g. water quality, land cover) are the most important drivers. We applied the elements of the metacommunity structure approach on a dataset of 38 communities from the Futaleufu basin in northwestern Patagonia. To better understand assemblage variation, we deconstructed our macroinvertebrate dataset into different taxonomic and trait groups. We then identified the most influential factors driving community composition using random forests. We found that half of our datasets (i.e. macroinvertebrate groups) exhibited a nested structure with clumped species loss, while the other half showed a quasi-nested pattern with either clumped or stochastic species loss. Overall, water quality was the most important driver of community variation, although climate, geography, and land cover were more or less relevant in particular cases. We found differences in the relative importance of the selected explanatory variables among datasets. This would suggest that different components of the macroinvertebrate community respond differently to environmental factors. Our findings could be of value for conservation planning, as they suggest that preserving the most species-rich streams would, to some extent, guarantee the conservation of the entire species pool.

AB  - Aim Natural disaster risk reduction (DRR) is becoming a more important function of protected area (PAs) for current and future global warming. However, biodiversity conservation and DRR have been handled separately and their interrelationship has not been explicitly addressed. This is mainly because, due of prevailing strategies and criteria for PA placement, a large proportion of PAs are currently located far from human-occupied areas, and habitats in human-occupied areas have been largely ignored as potential sites for conservation despite their high biodiversity. If intensely developed lowland areas with high flooding risk overlap with important sites for biodiversity conservation, it would be reasonable to try to harmonize biodiversity conservation and human development in human-inhabited lowland areas. Here, we examined whether extant PAs can conserve macroinvertebrate and freshwater fish biodiversity and whether human-inhabited lowland flood risk management sites might be suitable to designate as freshwater protected areas (FPAs). Location Across Japan. Methods We examined whether extant PAs can conserve macroinvertebrate and freshwater fish biodiversity and analysed the relationship between candidate sites for new FPAs and flood disaster risk and land use intensity at a national scale across Japan based on distribution data for 131 freshwater fish species and 1395 macroinvertebrate species. Results We found that extant PAs overlapped with approximately 30% of conservation-priority grid cells (1 km(2)) for both taxa. Particularly for red-listed species, only one species of freshwater fish and three species of macroinvertebrate achieved the representation target within extant PAs. Moreover, more than 40% of candidate conservation-priority grid cells were located in flood risk and human-occupied areas for both taxa. Main conclusions Floodplain conservation provides suitable habitat for many freshwater organisms and helps control floodwaters, so establishing new FPAs in areas with high flood risk could be a win-win strategy for conserving freshwater biodiversity and enhancing ecosystem-based DRR (eco-DRR).

AB  - This study measures beetle diversity and distribution pattern along elevations at Fraser's Hill, a pristine tropical forest in Malaysia. Sites were sampled at 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 in and 1800 in a.s.l. using two light traps, two Malaise traps and 25 pitfall traps at each elevation. Sampling was carried out at three months' intervals in 2015. Altogether, 1981 beetles representing 32 families and 116 species were collected, with proportion of obtained species above 70% at all elevations. Species richness was not significant among elevations, thus forming no discernible pattern of species distribution. Higher Shannon diversity increased steadily with elevation and dominance was lowest at the two highest elevations, while beetle abundance decreases significantly with elevation. There was no significant difference between the diversity values at 500 m and 1000 m, and 1500 m and 1800 m, whereas there was significant difference between 500 m and 1500 m, and 1000 in and 1800 m. The results highlight the importance of different microhabitats for different beetle species and their own responses to environmental parameters that differ with altitudinal clines. These findings also highlight the importance of Fraser's Hill as a key location for biological conservation and as protected area.

AB  - Context. Buffer zones are supposed to serve the dual purpose of 'extension buffering', or an extension of core habitat areas, and 'socio buffering' to provide goods and services to humans; however, few studies have evaluated both human use of buffer zones and the occurrence of wildlife.
   Aims. The aim of the present study was to quantify the effects of human disturbance on wildlife by recording the use of the 4-km-wide buffer zone of Huai Kha Kaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (HKKWS), Thailand, by humans and domestic animals.
   Methods. Occurrence of signs of large mammals were recorded along 37 transects and relationships among distance to settlements, human activities, occurrence of domestic animals and different wildlife species were analysed.
   Key results. In total, 210 interviewed respondents from adjacent villages all used the buffer zone, and the transect survey revealed that a large proportion of the plots (71%) were used by humans and/or domestic animals. The frequency of human use decreased linearly with distance from the buffers-zone edge, whereas the use by cattle decreased rapidly at a distance of 2000m from the buffer-zone edge. In general, the HKKWS buffer zone was a suitable habitat for several wildlife species. Sambar deer and banteng occurred in >25% of the plots. The proportion of plots with signs of sambar deer, banteng and elephant was negatively associated with the proportion of plots with signs of domestic animals, whereas the proportion of plots with signs of common muntjac was negatively associated with the proportion of plots with signs of human activities.
   Conclusions. The results from the present study suggest that the 4-km buffer zone in HKKWS reduces the impact of both humans and domestic animals.
   Implications. The size of human populations, restrictions for grazing domestic animals and habitat quality are suggested to be factors of importance for establishment of well designed buffer zones.

AB  - We analysed more than 25 years of change in passerine bird distribution in South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho, to show that species distributions can be influenced by processes that are at least in part independent of the local strength and direction of climate change: land use and ecological succession. We used occupancy models that separate species' detection from species' occupancy probability, fitted to citizen science data from both phases of the Southern African Bird Atlas Project (1987-1996 and 2007-2013). Temporal trends in species' occupancy probability were interpreted in terms of local extinction/colonization, and temporal trends in detection probability were interpreted in terms of change in abundance. We found for the first time at this scale that, as predicted in the context of bush encroachment, closed-savannah specialists increased where open-savannah specialists decreased. In addition, the trend in the abundance of species a priori thought to be favoured by agricultural conversion was negatively correlated with human population density, which is in line with hypotheses explaining the decline in farmland birds in the Northern Hemisphere. In addition to climate, vegetation cover and the intensity and time since agricultural conversion constitute important predictors of biodiversity changes in the region. Their inclusion will improve the reliability of predictive models of species distribution.

AB  - In contrast to most insect guilds, gall-forming insects are thought to reach highest diversity on sclerophyllous vegetation, such as Neotropical savannas and Mediterranean vegetation types. The water and nutrient stress endured by meristems of canopy trees in tall wet tropical rainforests may cause leaf sclerophylly. Hence, the upper canopies of such ecosystems may represent a suitable habitat for gall-forming insects. At the San Lorenzo Protected Area, Panama, we estimated free-feeding herbivory and gall densities within five sites in 2003 and 2004, by surveying leaves in vertical and horizontal transects. In each sample, we recorded leaf density (mature and young foliage), free-feeding herbivore damage and number of galls, including the presence of live larvae, parasitoids or fungi. We surveyed 43 994 leaves, including 231 plants and 73 tree and liana species. We collected 5014 galls from 17 host-plant species, including 32 gall species of which 59% were restricted to the canopy (overall infestation rates: 2.4% in 2003, 5.5% in 2004). In 2003, 16% of the galls were occupied by live larvae, against 5% in 2004. About 17-20% of leaves surveyed suffered from free-feeding herbivory. Leaf sclerophylly increased significantly with sampling height, while free-feeding herbivory decreased inversely. Conversely, the number of live galls collected in the canopy was 13-16 times higher than in the understorey, a pattern consistent across sites and years. Hence, the probability of gall survivorship increased with increasing leaf sclerophylly as death by fungi, parasitoids or accidental chewing were greater in the understorey. Increasing harsh ecophysiological conditions towards the upper canopy appear favourable to galls-forming population maintenance, in support of the hypothesis of harsh environment. Hence, gall diversity and abundance in the upper canopy of tall tropical forests are perhaps among the highest in the world.

AB  - Knowledge of animal foraging behaviour has implications for management and conservation. While Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus comprise a major proportion of the southern African marine predator biomass, little is known about their at-sea movements. We investigated foraging distribution, habitat use and diving behaviour for 35 adult female Cape fur seals from 3 breeding colonies experiencing contrasting oceanographic regimes. Animals from Black Rocks, the smallest and eastern-most colony, undertook shorter foraging trips and utilised shallower waters over the shelf. In comparison, animals from the larger west coast colonies, at Kleinsee and False Bay, travelled further and utilised deeper shelf and shelf-slope waters. However, across colonies, females typically preferred depths of < 500 m and slopes of < 5 degrees. Kleinsee and False Bay seals selected sea surface temperatures within the range typically preferred by pelagic prey species such as round herring, sardine and anchovy (14-19 degrees C). Black Rocks individuals showed bimodal preferences for colder (16 degrees C) and warmer waters (> 22 degrees C). Dive behaviour was similar between Kleinsee and False Bay individuals (unavailable from Black Rocks), with both pelagic and benthic foraging evident. Diel patterns were apparent at both sites, as dive depth and benthic diving increased significantly during daylight hours, likely reflecting vertical movements of prey species. We provide the first assessment of Cape fur seal movement behaviour for the South African component of the population. Observed geographic differences likely reflect the availability of suitable habitat but may also indicate differences in foraging strategies and density-dependent effects throughout the range of this species.

AB  - Migratory nectarivorous bats provide important ecological services throughout their ranges, particularly for their food plants. These services include pollinating food plants, dispersing seeds, and reducing genetic isolation in plant populations. However, many important food plants occur in imperiled ecosystems, particularly in tropical dry forests. We assessed the conservation status of lands containing high richness of food plants for three migratory nectarivores-the Mexican long-tongued bat (Choeronycteris mexicana), the Mexican long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris nivalis), and the lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae)-throughout their ranges including migratory, transition, and resident habitat zones. We found low to moderate levels of land protection in regions with high chiropterophilic plant diversity, but this may be offset by sustainable agroforestry, cultivation, and in-situ management. The models we used are available as an ArcGIS map package to help allocate conservation and restoration efforts on the ground. Our results support the need for greater land protection throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental to increase contiguity of protected lands and potential stopover habitat for migratory nectarivorous bats. Additionally, our data show the need for greater land protection in southern resident zones to enhance year-round habitat for nectarivorous bats in the face of rapid deforestation.

AB  - Farmland ponds promote regional aquatic biodiversity; however, optimally managing these ponds requires knowledge on how the biodiversity differs between ponds across catchments with different land uses. This study investigated the response of macrophytes, both those in the pond and on the bank, as well as dragonfly and water beetle species richness, diversity and composition in artificial ponds, to numerous environmental variables in catchments dominated by three land uses: protected areas (as reference sites), sugarcane-dominated and forestry-dominated landscapes, across two seasons. There was a strong association between insect species richness and vegetation cover, particularly sedges (Cyperus spp.) in spring and bulrushes (Typha capensis) in summer. There was also a positive response between insect species richness and sedges up to 70% cover, and bulrushes up to 40% cover, after which there was a decrease. Furthermore, the protected area ponds contained more rare and specialist insect species. Pond size was not a major variable for biodiversity overall. Although there was generally little congruence in composition among the three taxa, dragonflies were a good surrogate for water beetles and floating macrophytes. Well-vegetated ponds, both in the water and along the margin, are the most suited to promoting biodiversity, as long as the vegetation is not too dense, and not dominated by one plant species. Artificial ponds in production landscapes have great potential for conserving aquatic species, irrespective of land use, as long as there is management for macrophyte density and heterogeneity.

AB  - Small soda lakes represent one of the most vulnerable ecosystem types due to their high hydrological sensitivity to climate change and anthropogenic interventions. Since diatoms are excellent bioindicators, determining the -diversity and the structuring dynamics of diatom metacommunities can provide valuable information for conservation planning for soda pans. In this study, two diatom metacommunities were surveyed monthly during a one-year period from distinct regions of the Carpathian basin: the Fert-Hansag National Park (FH) between 2013 and 2014, and the Danube-Tisza Interfluve (DT) between 2014 and 2015. We explored whether -diversity of diatom assemblages in the two regions is enhanced by species turnover or nestedness (related to richness differences) and investigated the role of deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping -diversity patterns. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of environmental variables, geographic distance and temporal variation to community structure. High -diversity (>90%) was revealed for both metacommunities, and was maintained primarily by species turnover. Within the metacommunity of the DT where the natural hydrological cycle of soda pans is not disturbed, diatom communities assembled mainly due to the selection force of environment at a spatiotemporal scale. In the soda pans located in the habitat reconstruction area of the FH, besides species-sorting, significant temporal variation in community structure appeared as a result of water management and periodic water supply. Our results point to the need for a conservation management strategy which maintains the natural hydrological regime of small saline lakes, and therefore their habitat heterogeneity which is of high conservation value.

AB  - Knowledge of a species' geographic distribution is crucial to assessing its vulnerability. It is also important to know if protected areas provide effective protection for raptor species. Here, we examine the species richness (S) patterns, factors predicting S and the effectiveness of protected areas (EPA) in the conservation of diurnal raptors in Venezuela. We modeled geographic distributions (SDM) of 64 raptor species using ecological niche models. Nine climatic and seven landscape metrics were used as environmental predictors. SDM were stacked to examine S and predictors of S were investigated using regression models. This study evaluated S patterns in the 13 bioregions defined for Venezuela. A gap analysis was performed to evaluate the EPA in the conservation of raptor diversity. Forty species showed a continuous distribution, whereas as disjunct distributions were observed in 24 species. Species richness differed among bioregions; six pairwise compared bioregions did not show differences. Guyana Massif and the mountains of northern Venezuela had the highest species richness. Landscape features, specifically canopy height, land cover and terrain slope explained most of the species richness. Environmental heterogeneity affected the distribution of S and is therefore important in conservation planning for Neotropical raptors. Responses from environmental variables used to predict S were scale dependent; it is necessary to standardize methods/experimental design to study the biogeography of raptors. Priority-setting for the conservation of raptors in Venezuela must consider restricted range species, even if they are not threatened. A new territorial ordering is urgent to improve the protection of this group of birds.

AB  - Due to the existence of terrestrial barriers to freshwater fish dispersion, it is believed that its distribution is strongly associated with historical factors related to the formation of the habitats they occupy. By the other hand, some studies reveal the influence of abiotic conditions (such as size of water bodies, pH, conductivity) on the composition of fish fauna occurring in small streams. This study aimed to investigate whether drainage basins, because catchment boundaries are potential barriers to fish dispersion, or the physical structure and physico-chemical characteristics of water have a greater influence on fish community structure in small streams. We sampled 22 streams belonging to five drainage basins in the Madeira-Purus interfluve. Fish were caught with dip nets and a small trawl, and data were simultaneously obtained on structural characteristics of the streams and physico-chemical characteristics of the water. Community composition was analyzed using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), and variables related to structural and physico-chemical characteristics were summarized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Two explanatory models relating faunal composition to environmental factors were constructed: the first using only continuous variables and the second including the drainage basin as a categorical variable. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and AIC weight were used to select the best model. Although structural and physico-chemical variables significantly contributed to explaining faunal composition, the model including the drainage basin was clearly the better of the two models (more than 90% support in the data). The importance of drainage basins in structuring fish communities in streams may have significant consequences for conservation planning in these environments.

AB  - Tracking and quantifying ecological changes at large and long-term scales is a central point for monitoring and conservation issues. The Community Trajectory Analysis Framework was used in complement with classical methods to analyse and represent long-term changes in marine habitats at 42 stations in the bay of Saint-Brieuc (western English Channel), sampled in 1987, 2001 and 2019. The taxonomic and functional trajectories of intertidal benthic assemblages were studied at local and assemblage scales. Whatever the perennial contribution of dominant prevalent species at the site scale, some species were highly variable over time and space, influencing the structuration of assemblages. Taxonomic changes were not systematically associated with significant changes in the functional properties at local and community scale. The consideration of local changes and variations at the species level explained the differences in composition observed at the scale of assemblages. Observed changes mainly reflected random population dynamics of structuring prevalent species in habitat under strong natural pressures, rather than specific changes of the community. Few species reveal the long-term effect of green tides in some assemblages. Overall, this study confirms the complexity to disentangle factors of changes in the absence of a monitoring strategy specifically devoted the measurement of environmental factors and anthropogenic pressures. The study also highlights the need for the development of benthic monitoring strategies at multiple spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Excess sediment and nutrient runoff from land-based human activities are considered serious threats to coastal and marine ecosystems by most conservation practitioners, resource managers, fishers, and other "downstream" resource users. Deleterious consequences of coastal runoff, including eutrophication and hypoxia, have been observed worldwide. Literature on integrated coastal management offers numerous methods to address land-based activities that generate runoff, but many of these approaches are time- and resource-intensive. Often, high-level conservation managers have few tools to aid in decisions about whether land-based threats that generate runoff are of sufficient concern to warrant further investment in planning and management interventions. To address this decision-making process, we present a decision tree that uses geophysical and ecological characteristics to sort any marine coastal ecosystem into a category of high, moderate, low, or minimal risk from the land-based threats of nutrient and sediment runoff. By identifying situations where runoff could influence biodiversity or ecosystem services, the decision tree assists managers in making informed, and standardized decisions about when and where to invest further efforts in integrated land-sea planning. We ground-truth the decision tree by evaluating it in five very different regions and conclude the tree classifies regions similarly to the existing literature that is available, but based on less information. Recognizing that the decision tree only encompasses environmental variables, we also discuss approaches for interpreting the decision tree's outputs in local social and economic contexts. The tree provides a tool for conservation managers to decide whether the scope of their work should include land-sea planning.

AB  - This study examined the effects of forest structure (tree species richness, canopy height, percent canopy cover, understory density, tree density and DBH) and avian species traits (nest type and indicator list status) on the diversity, abundance and dissimilarity of bird communities in forest remnants and reforestation areas adjacent to Costa Rican banana plantations. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly related to tree species richness, canopy height and canopy cover in multiple linear regressions, the latter two forest structure variables being the best statistical predictors. Stratification of analyses by bird species indicator categories improved fits of regressions, because correlations with environmental variables differed in sign for different guilds of birds, a result likely to hold for other avifaunas. Analysis of avifauna dissimilarities among sites demonstrated that the species composition of bird communities was highly correlated with forest structure and tree species composition. Logistic regressions indicated that birds making protected (cavity, burrow, pendant, sphere and covered) nests were 2-6 times more likely to be present in the study avifauna than birds making open (cup, saucer, platform and scrape) nests and indicators of disturbed habitats were 11 times more likely to be present than indicators of primary forest. The forest structure data used were simple and inexpensive to collect, and data on avian traits were drawn from the literature. Thus, these methods could easily be replicated at other locations and would be valuable management aids and biodiversity assessment tools for conservation planning.

AB  - The Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is a small seabird that is currently listed as threatened in Canada. Understanding this species' marine habitat preferences plays a vital role in our ability to focus conservation planning. We used the longest-running at-sea survey dataset available in British Columbia to examine hotspot persistence and habitat use at Laskeek Bay, Haida Gwaii, BC. The Laskeek Bay Conservation Society has been conducting spring and summer surveys along fixed transect routes in open and shoreline waters from 1997 to 2018. Along with analyzing this long-term dataset, we conducted surveys to measure oceanographic variables (2018-2019) and tested whether Marbled Murrelets in the same area used prey and oceanographic information to select marine habitat in conjunction with physical habitat features. Our hotspot persistence map, defined as areas that repeatedly had counts above a 75% threshold relative to other areas during a given survey, showed that murrelets consistently preferred shoreline transects. Murrelets also preferred shallow marine areas closer to streams, above higher proportions of sandy substrate and closer proximity to abundant nesting habitat. Modeling weather and time variables contributed little additional predictive power. Nonetheless, models that included physical environmental, oceanographic, and prey variables outperformed those with only physical environmental variables. Stratified water was the oceanographic variable most strongly related to higher counts. Our study suggests that stratified waters could work with stream systems to create productive zones for foraging murrelets, and highlights the importance of murrelets having access to marine areas with the preferred physical features.

AB  - Clouded leopards are among Asia's most widely distributed felids, but also among its least known and most vulnerable. Clouded leopards occur in some of the most rapidly disappearing forests in the world, yet a comprehensive assessment of their status and habitat use is lacking, which in turn limits identification of their priority conservation needs and capacity to act as umbrella species for conserving associated forest biodiversity. To address this need for the Sunda species (Neofelis diardi), we applied multi-scale modeling to identify both key environmental variables influencing habitat use and optimal scales of relationship with these variables. We detected clouded leopards at 18.3% of 1544 camera stations and 17 of 22 sampling locations on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. Multi-scale GLMM revealed that recent forest loss and large-scale plantations strongly and negatively influence clouded leopard detection. Our findings also suggest that higher elevations and ridges are important components of N. diardi habitat use. We illustrate how scale optimization of habitat use can provide critical information for characterizing the requirements of protected areas, and identify core habitat patches and connectivity gaps in need of future protection. Our findings indicate greater challenges facing clouded leopards on Sumatra, including higher poaching pressure, greater fragmentation, and roughly half the habitat area available to N. diardi on Borneo. This research contributes vital insights to assist in prioritizing habitat conservation networks for the protection of this vulnerable felid and the forest biodiversity for which it is an ambassador species.

AB  - Recently, several large marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established globally, and it is hoped that they will aid the recovery of populations of highly mobile, large pelagic species. Understanding the distribution of these species within MPAs is key to delivering effective management, but monitoring can be challenging over such vast areas of open ocean. Historical fisheries data, collected prior to MPA establishment, can provide an insight into the past distributions of target species. We investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) tuna catch using logbook data from the purse seine fishery in the British Indian Ocean Territory from 1996 to 2010, before it was established as an MPA in April 2010. Generalized additive models were used to predict tuna presence and relative abundance from fishing records in relation to temporal and environmental variables. Significant variables included sea salinity, temperature, and water velocity. Predictions from the models identified a distinct hotspot for large yellowfin tuna within the MPA, and areas of high predicted relative abundance of skipjack tuna. We recommend that these areas are used as focal points from which populations can be monitored and investigations into tuna residency time can occur, so that the effectiveness of the MPA in conserving highly mobile pelagic fish can be determined.

AB  - The aims of this study were (1) to examine the geographic distribution of red-listed species of agricultural environments and identify their national threat spots (areas with high diversity of threatened species) in Finland and (2) to determine the main environmental variables related to the richness and occurrence patterns of red-listed species. Atlas data of 21 plant, 17 butterfly and 11 bird species recorded using 10 km grid squares were employed in the study. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed separately for species richness and occurrence of individual species of the three species groups using climate and land cover predictor variables. The predictive accuracy of models, as measured using correlation between the observed and predicted values and AUC statistics, was generally good. Temperature-related variables were the most important determinants of species richness and occurrence of all three taxa. In addition, land cover variables had a strong effect on the distribution of species. Plants and butterflies were positively related to the cover of grasslands and birds to small-scale agricultural mosaic as well as to arable land. Spatial coincidence of threat spots of plants, butterflies and birds was limited, which emphasizes the importance of considering the potentially contrasting environmental requirements of different taxa in conservation planning. Further, it is obvious that the maintenance of various non-crop habitats and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes has an essential role in the preservation of red-listed species of boreal rural environments.

AB  - The mapping of earth's biodiversity has advanced our theoretical and empirical understanding of biodiversity and has thus guided conservation efforts. Yet, early biodiversity maps often relied on alpha diversity indices, while beta diversity has rarely been used for practical conservation actions. We used generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM) and variance partitioning to map beta diversity patterns of Hainan Island, China, and explore its underlying factors based on a large dataset of 248,538 individual trees belonging to 1,016 species in 902 forest plots. We used principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering to visualize community similarity, and spatial overlap analysis to assess the ability of the current protected areas (PAs) to encompass beta diversity. The GDMs explained 27.65% and 26.58% of the variation in beta diversity at the genus and species levels, respectively. The community composition of tree species in Hainan presented a general east-to-west gradient, and three floristic regions were delineated. This biogeographical pattern is predominantly structured by mean annual precipitation. Environmental variables, rather than geographical distance, were the most important factors determining present beta diversity patterns. Currently, PAs of Hainan Island are concentrated on mountain forest areas, while the lowland forest has largely been ignored. Thus, we suggest that biodiversity mapping based only on alpha diversity is not enough to identify conservation gaps, and the inclusion of beta diversity in such maps constitutes a promising tool to maximize the biodiversity coverage of PAs. Our study provides empirical evidence that a spatially explicit analysis of beta diversity in a specific region can be used for conservation planning. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Robust ways to meet objectives of environmental conservation and social and economic development remain elusive. This struggle may in part be related to insufficient understanding of the feedbacks between conservation initiatives and socialecological systems, specifically, the ways in which conservation initiatives result in social changes that have secondary effects on the environments targeted by conservation. To explore this idea, we sampled peer-reviewed articles addressing the social and environmental dimensions of conservation and coded each paper according to its research focus and characterization of these feedbacks. The majority of articles in our sample focused either on the effect of conservation initiatives on people (e.g., relocation, employment) or the effect of people on the environment (e.g., fragmentation, conservation efficacy of traditional management systems). Few studies in our sample empirically addressed both the social dynamics resulting from conservation initiatives and subsequent environmental effects. In many cases, one was measured and the other was discussed anecdotally. Among the studies that describe feedbacks between social and environmental variables, there was more evidence of positive (amplifying) feedbacks between social and environmental outcomes (i.e., undesirable social outcomes yielded undesirable environmental effects and desirable social outcomes yielded desirable environmental effects). The major themes within the sampled literature include conflict between humans and wild animals, social movements, adaptive comanagement, loss of traditional management systems, traditional ecological knowledge, human displacement and risks to livelihoods, and conservation and development. The narratives associated with each theme can serve as hypotheses for facilitating further discussion about conservation issues and for catalyzing future studies of the feedbacks between conservation and socialecological systems.

AB  - Multivariate classifications of environmental factors are used as frameworks for conservation management. Although classification performance is likely to be sensitive to choice of input variables, these choices have been subjective in most previous studies. We used the Mantel test on a limited set of sites for which biological data were available to iteratively seek a definition of environmental space (i.e., intersite distances calculated with a set of appropriately transformed and weighted environmental variables) that bad maximal correlation with the same sites described in a biological space. The procedure was used to select input variables for a classification of New Zealand's rivers that discriminates variation in fish communities for biodiversity management. The classification performed (i.e., discriminated biological variation) better than classifications with subjectively chosen variables. The inherently linear measures of environmental distance that underlie multivariate environmental classifications mean that they will perform best if they are defined based on variables for which there is a linear variation in the biological community throughout the entire range of the variable. Classification performance will therefore be improved when variables that have nonlinear relationships with biological variation are transformed to make their relationship with biological turnover more linear and when the contributions of environmental factors that have particularly strong relationships with biological variation are increased by weighting. Our results indicate that attention to the manner in which environmental space is defined improves the efficacy of multivariate classification and other techniques in which the environment is used as a surrogate for biological variation.

AB  - Cliff outcrops are structural components of the environment that can maintain a large variety of wildlife; however, they are still rather overlooked in conservation planning. We evaluate whether cliffs used by the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) for communal roosting are associated with local aggregations of other bird species, and if their presence in combination with other local (vegetation cover, plant species richness, topographic heterogeneity) and regional (distance to water) environmental variables play a significant role in the structuring of local bird diversity. We selected twenty-four localities in-north-western Patagonia (Argentina) to compare the abundance and richness of birds across four habitat types: a cliff used as condor roost (CC), closest cliffs to CC not used for roosting with the same (SC) or different (DC) aspect and the vegetation matrix surrounding the cliffs (MA). This led to 264 fixed 100 m-radius points spread over 96 sampling sites. We recorded more individuals and species on cliffs than on MA; however, sample-based rarefaction curves showed that the high species richness observed on cliffs was actually the consequence of the high number of individuals recorded. Habitat type, vegetation cover and the richness of dominant vascular plants were the most important variables accounting the richness and abundance of birds. We concluded that condor roosts represent suitable habitats for the aggregation of individuals of other bird species thus leading to hotspots of occupancy and high species richness. Those cliffs should be reconsidered in the mapping of important conservation areas and for the proposal of mesofilter conservation strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantifying and understanding the main drivers of biodiversity responses to human disturbances at multiple scales is key to foster effective conservation plans and management systems. Here we report on a detailed regional assessment of the response of ant communities to land-use change and forest disturbance in the Brazilian Amazon. We aimed to explore the effects of land-use intensification at both site and landscape scales, examining variation in ant species richness and composition, and asking which set of environmental variables best predict observed patterns of diversity. We sampled 192 sites distributed across 18 landscapes (each 50 km(2)) in Paragominas, eastern Brazilian Amazon, covering ca. 20,000 km(2). We sampled from undisturbed primary forest through varyingly disturbed primary forests, secondary forests, pastures and mechanised agriculture, following a gradient of decreasing total aboveground biomass. Irrespective of forest disturbance class, ant species richness was almost twice as high in forests when compared to production areas. In contrast, ant species composition showed continuous variation from primary forest to intensive agriculture, following a gradient of aboveground biomass. Ant species richness at all spatial scales increased with primary forest cover in the surrounding landscapes. We highlight the limited value of species richness as an indicator of changes in habitat quality, reinforcing calls to consider species composition in assessments of forest disturbance. Taken together, our results reveal the unique biodiversity value of undisturbed primary forests, but also show that disturbed primary forests and secondary forests have high conservation value, and thus play an important role in regional conservation planning.

AB  - (Stream macroalgae of Irati National Forest, mid-southern Parana State, Southern Brazil). Surveys of stream macroalgal communities in Brazil are almost exclusively based on data from Sao Paulo State. There are no extensive studies concerning stream macroalgae in Parana state. Having in mind the scarcity of works treating these important primary producers in lotic ecosystems, a more comprehensive study was carried out in order to increase our knowledge of stream macroalgal community biodiversity in Parana state. In this context, the main objective of this study was to do a floristic survey of stream macroalgal communities in Irati National Forest (INF), a protected area of Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (Araucaria Forest). Eleven streams were sampled in 2005 (July 19-21) and 2006 (February 2-4). In each stream, a 10-meter cross-transect was established in which a detailed visual examination took place to determine the presence of macroalgae. In addition, the following environmental variables were measured at each sampling date: temperature, specific conductance, pH, dissolved oxygen, depth, nutrients, water colour and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The floristic survey resulted in the identification of 23 taxa and showed the dominance of Chlorophyta over other algal divisions. Only the genus Phormidium Kutzing ex Gomont was represented by more than one species. In general, the majority of species found at Irati National Forest have been reported in previous studies; however, a significant portion of the macroalgae was composed of taxa that rarely occur in Brazilian streams or they may be new to science.

AB  - Although important to guide conservation management, detailed demographic studies on rare or elusive species inhabiting fragmented, human-dominated landscapes are often hampered by the species' low densities, and the logistic and ethical constraints in obtaining reliable information covering large areas. Genetic non-invasive sampling (gNIS) provides cost-effective access to demographic information, though its application to small mammals is still scarce. We used gNIS to infer on the demography of an endemic small mammal, the Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae), occurring as a spatially-structured population in a 462-ha Mediterranean farmland landscape. We intensively sampled fresh vole feces in four seasons, extracted the DNA, and performed individual identification based on genotypes built using nine microsatellites. We then estimated population size and individual survival relative to environmental variables, controlling for heterogeneity in capture probabilities using capture-mark-recapture modelling. Population size increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season, while survival remained constant across the study period. Individuals captured along road-verges and around water-bodies survived longer than those captured near agricultural fields. The use of gNIS on a heterogeneous landscape such as our study area allowed us to demonstrate that human land-use activities affect Cabrera vole demographic parameters in Mediterranean farmland, with implications for conservation planning towards its long-term persistence. Our approach can be widely applied to other elusive small mammals of conservation concern, but for which informative demographic data are still scarce.

AB  - Assessment and monitoring of biodiversity is critical for conservation planning. Considering the cost and time associated to monitoring, selecting proper bio-indicators is important, particularly in countries where financial resources are limited. The objectives of this study were to investigate community congruence of macro -invertebrates and wetland birds in natural wetlands of southwest Ethiopia, exposed to different levels of human disturbance and to identify important environmental variables related to these bio-indicators. Data on macro -invertebrates, birds, physico-chemical water quality, human disturbance and vegetation cover were collected from 54 sampling sites distributed over 12 wetlands during dry and wet season of 2015. Procrustes analysis was used to quantify community congruence between the two assemblages across different disturbance levels. The congruence of macroinvertebrates and wetland dependent birds was higher for low disturbed wetlands (R-2 = 0.60) than for moderately disturbed wetlands (R-2 = 0.31). Moderately disturbed wetlands showed no significant congruence between macroinvertebrates and wetland birds and between wetland dependent and wetland associated birds. A significant and positive relation between richness of macroinvertebrates and wetland dependent birds was observed when the full data set was used, whereas no significant relation was observed when the data was split according to the different levels of human disturbance. Vegetation cover, dissolved oxygen, water depth, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and conductivity were significantly correlated with both macroinvertebrate and wetland bird occurrence. Based on our study we suggest to monitor both bio-indicators as they provide important complementary information on the status of the wetlands.

AB  - Enormous and increasing loss of biodiversity requires evaluation of surrogate taxa as a tool for conservation biology and new reserve selection, in spite of the fact that this approach has become questionable. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of gradient complexity on species richness and community composition among three taxonomic groups. We compared efficiency of vascular plants to indicate diversity of cryptogams (bryophytes, lichens) and snails in two contrasting habitat types (treeless fens and forests) within the same geographic region. We examined correlation of their species richness (Spearman rank correlation), community composition (Bray-Curtis similarity, Mantel test) and their responses to environmental variables (detrended and canonical correspondence analysis). We also focused on Red List species. We found that spatial congruence among studied taxa was affected by habitat type, however vascular plants were good indicator of snail biodiversity in both habitats. Nevertheless, all significant positive correlations of species richness were associated with the congruence in main environmental gradients. Although there was a consistency in significantly positive cross-taxon correlation in community similarity, the congruence was insufficient for conservation purposes. Furthermore we confirmed the necessity of integration of at-risk species in conservation planning as Red List species were poor indicators for total species richness and vice versa. We suggest the complementation of existing reserve network with small-scale protected areas focused on conservation of at-risk ecosystems, communities or species. In this study vascular plants were not found as a sufficient indicator for fine-filter conservation of other taxa.

AB  - <list list-type="1" id="icad12044-list-0001"> Grasshoppers are often an important functional component of ecosystems, and many species show high levels of endemism. Evidence exists that percentage surface rock cover within a landscape can predict diversity of grasshopper species. Nevertheless, the reason why grasshopper species are responding to rocky landscapes has not been established. Here, we explore whether grasshoppers are responding to physical rockiness per se, or rather to specific correlates of higher surface rock exposure within a landscape. We also determine if this response varies between grasshopper taxonomic groups. We sampled grasshoppers in Afro-montane grasslands in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and recorded 10 environmental variables. We explored the influence of these variables on grasshopper community composition and grasshopper family composition. We also determined the vegetation characteristics, which significantly correlate with percentage surface rock cover in this landscape (geophyte richness, perennial grass richness and vegetation density), and then measured the similarity of species composition across these correlates. Overall, grasshopper assemblage composition, as well as familial composition, responded strongly to an elevation gradient, and not to the correlates of surface rock cover. In turn, the higher species richness in such areas is more likely a function of the significant vegetation correlates of higher surface rock cover. Across taxonomic groups, there are specialist species within each group which are associated with environmental conditions related to surface rockiness through its underlying correlates. Rock exposure across this grassland landscape is therefore an important contributor to grasshopper dispersion patterns, and has important implications for conservation planning for this taxon.

AB  - With both a full collection of native vascular plant distributions and a full checklist of source plants of the Chinese Materia Medica (CMM), the Uygur Medicine (UM), and the Kazak Medicine (KM) for the Xinjiang region, we defined medicinal plant: vascular plant ratios (simplified as medicinal plant ratios hereafter) as the value of medicinal plant richness divided by vascular plant richness. We aimed to find whether the ratios are constant or change in different environments, which environmental variables determine medicinal plant ratios, and whether the ratios are more influenced by human or by natural environments. Finally, suggestions for medicinal plant conservation were addressed. We found that (1) medicinal plant ratios were not constant, and they were high in the Tarim Basin which was largely covered by desert, while they were relatively low in mountainous areas, especially in the Tianshan Mountains where the general species richness was high; (2) medicinal plant ratios were not significantly influenced by human activities, indicated by human population density distributions, but they were highly correlated with plant species richness and climate, i.e. ratios decreased with plant species richness and MAP, and were related quadratically with MAT; (3) CMM ratio and UM ratio were more influenced by plant richness than by climate, while KM ratio was more influenced by climate. We concluded that the percentages of plants used as medicines were not influenced by distances from human settlements, but were determined by species richness or climate. We suggest that (1), in general, the medicinal plant ratio could be a complementary indicator for medicinal plant conservation planning and (2), for the region of Xinjiang, not only high diversity areas, but also some extreme environments should be considered as compensation for a better protection of medicinal plants.

AB  - This paper presents results of two monitoring programs carried out in two decades during April 1993-May 1994, and April 2015 May 2016 in the East Wadi of El-Kebiri, a protected area (PNEK) of eastern Numidia (northeastern Algeria). Monitoring was located in areas with different degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Selected environmental variables were recorded during the monitoring periods.. The Odonata fauna and biological indices were used to characterize development of the study area, after two decades and to assess the quality of the environment. The alteration of this river has resulted in a marked simplification of the original (1993-1994) odonatological fauna. Over the past two decades, odonatological species richness has decreased from 14 to 7 species inventoried during the 1993 and 2015 seasons. The phenology of adult was extended until early December 2015, possibly as a result of global warming. Odonata are identified as useful as indicators of environmental change in the monitored river systems. The majority of species such as the Gomphidae are not tolerant of increased contamination and changes in structure of the river. Only some species such as Lestes vridis, Platycnemis subdilatata, Ischnura graellsii and Ceriagrion tenellum, appear to be adapted to changed conditions and became dominant in heavily disturbed sites. The species disappeared from these sites are clearly associated with good water quality and less disturbance, which highlights the importance of the conservation of the habitats of freshwater and regular monitoring

AB  - Raptors are emblematic of the global biodiversity crisis because one out of five species are threatened with extinction and over half have declining populations due to human threats. Yet our understanding of where these "threats" impact raptor species is limited across terrestrial Earth. This is concerning because raptors, as apex predators, are critically positioned in ecological food webs, and their declining populations can undermine important ecosystem services ranging from pest control to disease regulation. Here, we map the distribution of 15 threats within the known ranges of 172 threatened and near threatened raptor species globally as declared by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. We analyze the proportion of each raptor range that is exposed to threats, identify global hotspots of impacted raptor richness, and investigate how human impacts on raptors vary based on several intrinsic (species traits) and extrinsic factors. We find that humans are potentially negatively affecting at least one threatened raptor species across three quarters of Earth's terrestrial area (78%; 113 million km(2)). Our results also show that raptors have 66% of their range potentially impacted by threats on average (range 2.7-100%). Alarmingly, critically endangered species have 90% of their range impacted by threats on average. We also highlight 57 species (33%) of particular concern that have > 90% of their ranges potentially impacted. Without immediate conservation intervention, these 57 species, including the most heavily impacted Forest Owlet (Athene blewitti), the Madagascar Serpent-eagle (Eutriorchis astur), and the Rufous Fishing-owl (Scotopelia ussheri), will likely face extinction in the near future. Global "hotspots" of impacted raptor richness are ubiquitous, with core areas of threat in parts of the Sahel and East Africa where 92% of the assessed raptors are potentially impacted per grid cell (10 species on average), and in Northern India where nearly 100% of raptors are potentially impacted per grid cell (11 species). Additionally, "coolspots" of unimpacted richness that represent refuges from threats occur in Greenland and Canada, where 98 and 58% of raptors are potentially unimpacted per grid cell, respectively (nearly one species on average), Saharan Africa, where 21% of raptors are potentially unimpacted per grid cell (one species on average), and parts of the Amazon, where 12% of raptors are potentially unimpacted per grid cell (0.6 species on average). The results provide essential information to guide conservation planning and action for the world's imperiled raptors.

AB  - Question: Evergreen bushlands in Ethiopia have been inadequately studied and mapped. We address the question whether there is a transitional semi-evergreen bushland on the eastern escarpment of the Ethiopian Highlands, with unique floristic characteristics that distinguish it from the evergreen bushlands in other parts of Ethiopia and eastern Africa.
   Methods: Based on a review of the recent descriptions of evergreen bushlands in Ethiopia, we hypothesize that there is a distinct zone of natural semi-evergreen bushland, which is restricted to the eastern and southeastern escarpment of the Ethiopian Highlands. In contrast, evergreen bushlands in other parts of Ethiopia are considered to be of a secondary nature. To test this hypothesis, we carried out qualitative vegetation surveys in 354 locations across Ethiopia and classified the vegetation in these locations based on the occurrences of indicator species. Based on this data, we created predictive distribution models of the semi-evergreen bushland in Ethiopia using various environmental distribution models. We furthermore compared the occurrences of characteristic evergreen bushland species in Ethiopia with the occurrence of these species within the evergreen bushlands in Kenya and Uganda.
   Results: The vegetation surveys confirmed the existence of a distinct type of evergreen bushland vegetation. The transitional semi-evergreen bushland forms a transitional zone between the Acacia-Commiphora woodland and bushland and the Afromontane forest on the eastern and southeastern escarpments of Ethiopia, but is also characterized by a number of species that, within Ethiopia, are unique to this zone. Most of the characteristic species of the transitional semi-evergreen bushland are not found or only in lower densities in western Ethiopia. There is, furthermore, a limited overlap in characteristic species of the evergreen bushlands of Kenya and Uganda.
   Conclusions: Our results provide important information on the hitherto inadequately studied semi-evergreen bushland of Ethiopia. It highlights the unique character of this part of the evergreen bushlands in Ethiopia, which we argue should be taken into account for future conservation planning.

AB  - A new predictive modelling technique called the fuzzy envelope model (FEM) is introduced. The technique can be used to predict potential distributions of organisms using presence-only locality records and a set of environmental predictor variables. FEM uses fuzzy logic to classify a set of predictor variable maps based on the values associated with presence records and combines the results to produce a potential distribution map for a target species. This technique represents several refinements of the envelope approach used in the BIOCLIM modelling package. These refinements are related to the way in which FEMs deal with uncertainty, the way in which this uncertainty is represented in the resultant potential distribution maps, and the way that these maps can be interpreted and applied. To illustrate its potential use in biogeographical studies, FEM was applied to predicting the potential distribution of three invasive alien plant species (Lantana camara L., Ricinus communis L. and Solanum mauritianum Scop.), and three native cicada species (Capicada decora Germar, Platypleura deusta Thun. and P. capensis L.) in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. These models were quantitatively compared with models produced by means of the algorithm used in the BIOCLIM modelling package, which is referred to as a crisp envelope model (the CEM design). The average performance of models of the FEM design was consistently higher than those of the CEM design. There were significant differences in model performance among species but there was no significant interaction between model design and species. The average maximum kappa value ranged from 0.70 to 0.90 for FEM design and from 0.57 to 0.89 for the CEM design, which can be described as 'good' to 'excellent' using published ranges of agreement for the kappa statistic. This technique can be used to predict species' potential distributions that could be used for identifying regions at risk from invasion by alien species. These predictions could also be used in conservation planning in the case of native species.

AB  - Aim To contribute directly to Norway's national and international commitments to systematic, long-term conservation of crop wild relatives (CWR) by ensuring both the in situ and ex situ protection and availability of a broad range of CWR genetic diversity within the country.
   Location Norway.
   Methods We created a priority list of CWR within Norway based upon four main criteria including economic value from national to global level of associated crops and inclusion in Annex 1 of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA). Species presence data were gathered from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and used for predictive species distribution modelling in MaxEnt. CAPFITOGEN software was utilized to create an ecogeographic land characterization (ELC) map and to identify complementary in situ genetic reserves and ex situ collecting priorities which target the full range of ecogeographic diversity of taxa.
   Results An inventory of 204 priority CWR within Norway was compiled. A grid cell complementary network of 19 in situ areas (similar to 10 km(2) ) conserved 201 priority CWR, and a separate analysis identified a protected area complementary network of 23 reserves that conserved 181 priority taxa. For ex situ conservation, 177 taxa did not have ex situ accessions and of the 24 with accessions, 15 had the minimum of five populations conserved throughout their ecogeographic range.
   Main conclusions We present the first comprehensive national recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation of 204 priority CWR in Norway. Proposals target the conservation of the ecogeographic diversity of the priority CWR and hence their genetic diversity. Both the priority taxa and the methodology used are applicable at regional and global scales with the recommendations not only helping Norway to meet its international obligations for conservation of genetic diversity of CWR but also ensuring this genetic diversity is available for use in tackling global food security.

AB  - The Itapeva Ecological Station - EEcI (24 degrees 04'S and 49 degrees 04'W, altitude 750 m), Itapeva, Sao Paulo State, is a Protected Area (PA) predominantly covered by cerrado denso and cerradao, whose occurrence in the region represents the southern limit of distribution of cerrado sensu lato. Aiming to know the regional flora and assuming the existence of floristic peculiarities due to the local weather conditions (incidence of frosts and absence of water deficit), we conducted a floristic survey in this PA from February 2008 to May 2010 and recorded 437 species in seven different physiognomies. In the cerrado sensu law physiognomies, 346 species, distributed among 87 families and 220 genera, were found. The richest families were Asteraceae (31 species), Fabaceae (27), Myrtaceae (26), Melastomataceae (21), Rubiaceae (15), Lauraceae (12), Bignoniaceae (11) and Poaceae (10). Concerning richness and family representativeness, the EEcI flora does not differ from that of other cerrado sensu lato remnants at lower latitudes. However, frequent species in those remnants - Dimorphandra mollis, Xylopia aromatica, Eugenia aurata and Tocoyena formosa - were not found in the study area region, probably due to frost effects and other limiting climatic factors. On the other hand, geographical distribution models did not predict the occurrence of Annona dioica, Brosimum gaudichaudii, Duguetia furfuracea, Anadenanthera peregrina var. falcata, Caryocar brasiliense and Schefflera vinosa for the region of Itapeva, possibly due to the absence of water deficit. The floristic data obtained in this study may assist in the parameterization of these models. The floristic similarity observed between the physiognomic extremes of the cerrado sensu law in the EEcI: cerradao and cerrado ralo, 26%, was smaller than the floristic similarity between the swamp grassland physiognomy and the cerrado ralo (27%), and between the former and the cerrado denso (30%). Therefore, considering floristic composition as one of the defining aspects of vegetation type, the swamp grassland can be included in the delimitation of cerrado sensu law in the EEcI. We recorded eight species threatened with extinction. Due to the PA's small dimensions, we suggest the expansion of its area for a more effective conservation of these species' populations.

AB  - Identifying conservation strategy is essential regarding prioritization, planning, and managing biodiversity. The Eastern Himalayan freshwater reaches contain diverse taxa of fish species. Despite having several coarse scales of assessment, the information regarding the fine-scale conservation priorities is scanty. The development of indices from multimeric attributes has been proved efficient, aiding conservation planning, in-depth research, exploitation, policy-making, and public awareness. Therefore, this study aims to provide detailed indexing of conservation values for the freshwater fish species inhabiting the sub-Himalayan Terai-Dooars ecoregion of the Eastern Himalayas. Based on three years of extended sampling in six freshwater reaches, 170 indigenous fish species were identified. Each fish species was assigned a discrete conservation value following their rarity, taxonomic singularity, contribution to beta diversity, global threat status, regional importance, and maximal achievable body lengths. Neolissochilus hexagonolepis has the highest conservation value. In contrast, the lowest values were observed for Pethia gelius, Pethia guganio, and Pethia phutunio. The freshwater habitats of upper and lower elevation harbor essential fish species for conservation, driven by precipitation, topographic, and land cover variability. Such results were accomplished through spatial interpolation and prioritization regarding fish conservation, protection, and vulnerability toward the human footprint for this region of the Eastern Himalayas.

AB  - The Apennine wolf (Canis lupus italicus, Altobello, 1921) is currently experiencing a period of great population change. Any information that helps to understand this transformation will be valuable for managing it. Here we provide, for the first time, quantitative data (habitat suitability, segregation, seasonal activity, daily time budget, social structure and sex-ratio) on the population of Italian wolf from the Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni National Park, the largest protected area in Italy, that houses a rising population. Using transects to locate signs and traces, we have identified 224 presence points, useful for elaborating the ecological suitability map for the wolf, in and around the Park. The suitable area expands up to 1042.65 km(2), with elevation being the strongest predictive variable affecting the species. The model predicts two main suitable patches (Alburni Mountains and Cervati/Motola Mountains), and at least seven remote areas, differently linked to each other by ecological corridors. Camera-trapping information was collected in the two suitable patches (Alburni and Cervati/Motola) for the wolf and revealed some characteristics of this population. The highest number of wolves was recorded in May and December, and during the night, depending on the reproductive behavior and dynamic of dispersion. Single individuals and couples (at least 3 recorded) are observed more frequently than groups (maximum of 3 groups that varied from three to eight individuals). The sex-ratio in the population, inferred by camera-trapping, showed a balanced population, with males found to be group leader in 91% of the cases. Furthermore, genetic analysis revealed that the males were in charge of marking the territory in 86% of cases. Our data increases the knowledge of the wolf population from Cilento, which seemed to have stopped at the 1990s, until now. Our contribution could be helpful in defining a wolf management strategy in the National Park, as well as in the other regions of the Apennine mountains and Alps, where the wolf is expanding, aiming also at coexistence with local human communities.

AB  - Protected Areas are considered as an important and widely applied tool for biodiversity conservation. They are especially relevant for conservation of threatened species populations. This paper presents study aimed to investigate population status and suitability of habitat conditions of a regionally Critically Endangered plant species, Bupleurum aureum (Apiaceae). Our research has been conducted in National Park "Smolny" (European Russia). The field studies were carried out in 2008, 2013-2018 in two study sites (Plot1, Plot2). In each study sites, square plots (1x1 m) were established to cover the most number of B. aureum individuals. The population status was assessed on the basis of the morphometric traits of individuals (height of generative individuals, number of umbellulas per umbella, number of schizocarpiums per umbellula), number of individuals per population, age structure of populations, composition of accompanying flora. We analysed relationships between environmental conditions (shadiness, soil moisture, salt regime of soil, soil nitrogen, soil pH, soil moisture variability) and morphometric and population traits of B. aureum to reveal the most influencing environmental factors. We found that at the north-western limit of the range, B. aureum has relatively low abundance and height of individuals in compare to available data from other parts of its range. The population age structure indicated higher habitat suitability in Plot1 due to presence of both vegetative and generative individuals. At the same time, in Plot2, B. aureum population is under serious threat due to a lack of vegetative individuals noted during almost whole study period. We suppose a forthcoming threat of probable loss of this B. aureum population. Environment data obtained in both habitats of B. aureum populations in National Park "Smolny" (Russia) indicated high relationships between soil moisture and the number of inflorescences formed by plants. We suppose a threat of extinction of the B. aureum population due to the building activity of Castor fiber inhabiting the small river Bakhmustika located nearby of study area. If the small river will be dammed, it could lead to decrease in B. aureum population in both studied sites due to the increase in ground water level.

AB  - Habitat disturbance is disrupting ecological processes globally. The Atlantic Forest is particularly affected by land-use intensification and defaunation, where primates play a key role in seed dispersal. Here, we evaluate how primate assemblages in the Atlantic Forest change according to landscape modification and the ecological consequences on seed dispersal. For this, we used 38 primate assemblages in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We assessed the effects of patch size, mean inter-patch distance, functional connectivity and matrix permeability on primate species richness, functional evenness and functional dispersion, distinguishing response traits (sensitivity to habitat disturbance) from effect traits (effect on seed dispersal). We further investigated which primate functional response-effect traits were retained in forest patches of different sizes. Increased inter-patch distance reduced primate species richness. Decreased patch size led to a more uneven and less divergent distribution of response trait values within the functional space indicating the filtering of primates with similar strategies to cope with habitat loss. However, the increased divergence of effect traits in smaller patches indicates that those primates present distinct traits as seed dispersers. Finally, less permeable landscapes retained an uneven distribution of primate effect traits. Our findings indicate that reduced patch size results in primates with similar response traits, living in small groups and travelling short distances daily, but with contrasting traits as seed dispersers, which is positive for the persistence of non-redundant services in disturbed landscapes. However, the reduced species richness in such isolated patches and the resistance to movement among them may compromise the long-term viability of primate ecosystem services. Therefore, we encourage that further conservation planning should increase landscape connectivity, ensure the effective protection of native forests and increase anthropogenic matrix quality to develop biodiversity-friendly landscapes that protect not only species but also the ecosystem services they provide.

AB  - Context The Amur tiger and leopard, once roaming over the Eurasian continent, are now endangered and confined to the Sikhote-Alin Mountains, Russia-a landscape that has been increasingly fragmented due to human activities. The ultimate fate of these big cats depends on whether they can resettle in their previous main historical range in NE China. Recent sightings of these animals along the China-Russia border have aroused new hope, but direct evidence is lacking.
   Objectives The main objectives of our study were (1) to determine the abundance and spatiotemporal patterns of tigers, leopards, and primary prey; (2) to investigate factors influencing the resettlement of the two big cats; and (3) to propose a landscape-scale conservation plan to secure the long-term sustainability of the Amur tiger and leopard.
   Methods We monitored the two felids, their prey, and human activities, with 380 camera-trap stations, for a total of 175,127 trap days and over an area of 6000 km 2 in NE China. We used the constraint line method to characterize cattle grazing and human influences on tigers, leopards, and their prey species.
   Results Our results show that, unexpectedly, at least 26 tigers and 42 leopards are present within China, which are confined primarily to a narrow area along the border with Russia. We have further identified that cattle grazing and human disturbances are the key hurdles to the dispersal of the tigers and leopards farther into China where suitable habitat is potentially available.
   Conclusions Amur tigers and leopards are returning to China, indeed, but their long-term resettlement is not likely without active and timely conservation efforts on landscape and regional scales. To overcome the hurdles to the resettlement of tigers and leopards in China, we propose a "Tiger and Leopard Resettlement Program'' that will engage the government, local communities, and researchers, so that the long-term sustainability of the Amur tigers and leopards can be ensured.

AB  - Aim Our objective was to identify the distribution of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) in fragmented oakjuniper woodlands by applying a geoadditive semiparametric occupancy model to better assist decision-makers in identifying suitable habitat across the species breeding range on which conservation or mitigation activities can be focused and thus prioritize management and conservation planning.
   Location Texas, USA.
   Methods We used repeated double-observer detection/non-detection surveys of randomly selected (n = 287) patches of potential habitat to evaluate warbler patch-scale presence across the species breeding range. We used a geoadditive semiparametric occupancy model with remotely sensed habitat metrics (patch size and landscape composition) to predict patch-scale occupancy of golden-cheeked warblers in the fragmented oak-juniper woodlands of central Texas, USA.
   Results Our spatially explicit model indicated that golden-cheeked warbler patch occupancy declined from south to north within the breeding range concomitant with reductions in the availability of large habitat patches. We found that 59% of woodland patches, primarily in the northern and central portions of the warbler's range, were predicted to have occupancy probabilities <= 0.10 with only 3% of patches predicted to have occupancy probabilities >0.90. Our model exhibited high prediction accuracy (area under curve = 0.91) when validated using independently collected warbler occurrence data.
   Main conclusions We have identified a distinct spatial occurrence gradient for golden-cheeked warblers as well as a relationship between two measurable landscape characteristics. Because habitat-occupancy relationships were key drivers of our model, our results can be used to identify potential areas where conservation actions supporting habitat mitigation can occur and identify areas where conservation of future potential habitat is possible. Additionally, our results can be used to focus resources on maintenance and creation of patches that are more likely to harbour viable local warbler populations.

   Species-area relationships are often applied, but not generally approved, to guide practical conservation planning. The specific species group analysed may affect their applicability. We asked if species-area curves constructed from extensive databases of various sectors of natural resource administration can provide insights into large-scale conservation of boreal forest biodiversity if the analyses are restricted only to red-listed species.
   Location
   Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods
   Our data included 12,645 records of 219 red-listed Coleoptera and Fungi from the whole of Finland. The forest data also covered the entire country, 202,761 km(2). The units of species-area analyses were 224 municipalities where the red-listed forest species have been observed. We performed a hierarchical partitioning analysis to reveal the relative importance of different potential explanatory variables. Based on the results, for all red-listed species, species associated with coniferous trees and for Fungi, the area of economically over-aged forests explained the best the variation in data. For species associated with deciduous trees and Coleoptera, the forest area explained better variation in data than the area of old forests. In the subsequent log-log species-area regression analyses, we used the best variables as the explanatory variable for each species group.
   Results
   There was a strong relationship between the number of all red-listed species and the area of old forests remaining, with a z-value of 0.45. The area explained better the number of species associated with conifer trees and Fungi than the number of species associated with deciduous trees and Coleoptera.
   Main conclusions
   The high z-values of species-area curves indicate that the remaining old-growth patches constitute a real archipelago for the conifer-associated red-listed species, since lower values had been expected if the surrounding habitat matrix were a suitable habitat for the species analysed.

AB  - Migratory animals are declining worldwide and coordinated conservation efforts are needed to reverse current trends. We devised a novel genoscape-network model that combines genetic analyses with species distribution modeling and demographic data to overcome challenges with conceptualizing alternative risk factors in migratory species across their full annual cycle. We applied our method to the long distance, Neotropical migratory bird, Wilson's Warbler (Cardellina pusilla). Despite a lack of data from some wintering locations, we demonstrated how the results can be used to help prioritize conservation of breeding and wintering areas. For example, we showed that when genetic, demographic, and network modeling results were considered together it became clear that conservation recommendations will differ depending on whether the goal is to preserve unique genetic lineages or the largest number of birds per unit area. More specifically, if preservation of genetic lineages is the goal, then limited resources should be focused on preserving habitat in the California Sierra, Basin Rockies, or Coastal California, where the 3 most vulnerable genetic lineages breed, or in western Mexico, where 2 of the 3 most vulnerable lineages overwinter. Alternatively, if preservation of the largest number of individuals per unit area is the goal, then limited conservation dollars should be placed in the Pacific Northwest or Central America, where densities are estimated to be the highest. Overall, our results demonstrated the utility of adopting a genetically based network model for integrating multiple types of data across vast geographic scales and better inform conservation decision-making for migratory animals.

AB  - The biogeography of marine benthic macroinvertebrates of US Atlantic estuaries and inshore coastal areas from Delaware Bay north to Passamaquoddy Bay was studied to compare recent data with historical biogeographic studies, define physical-chemical factors affecting species' distributions, and provide information for calibrating benthic indices of environmental condition. Five years (2000-2004) of data from 614 non-polluted, soft-bottom stations from the National Coastal Assessment were analyzed. Multidimensional scaling done on Bray-Curtis similarity matrices of species' relative abundance (547 species) suggested seven subregions: two based on salinity (oligohaline, mesohaline) and five based on latitude. Species' distribution patterns for stations with salinities >= 18 (n = 558) were strongly influenced by latitude; Cape Cod was a clear faunal transition zone (R = 0.92, p<0.001). Conversely, for stations with salinities <18 (n = 56), salinity was the more important factor. An ordination of abiotic variables (temperature, salinity, sediment percent silt-clay, depth) correlated well with the ordination of species' relative abundance data (R=0.77, p<0.001). The first split of a multivariate regression tree was by a summer bottom temperature of 20 degrees C at Cape Cod. Salinity and percent silt-clay led to further splits. These results support the existence of Virginian and Transhatteran biogeographic provinces. They constitute a baseline for addressing broad-scale and long-term issues such as global climate change, species invasions, and conservation planning.

AB  - We performed a population genomics study of the aye-aye, a highly specialized nocturnal lemur from Madagascar. Aye-ayes have low population densities and extensive range requirements that could make this flagship species particularly susceptible to extinction. Therefore, knowledge of genetic diversity and differentiation among aye-aye populations is critical for conservation planning. Such information may also advance our general understanding of Malagasy biogeography, as aye-ayes have the largest species distribution of any lemur. We generated and analyzed whole-genome sequence data for 12 aye-ayes from three regions of Madagascar (North, West, and East). We found that the North population is genetically distinct, with strong differentiation from other aye-ayes over relatively short geographic distances. For comparison, the average F-ST value between the North and East aye-aye populations separated by only 248 km-is over 2.1-times greater than that observed between human Africans and Europeans. This finding is consistent with prior watershed- and climate-based hypotheses of a center of endemism in northern Madagascar. Taken together, these results suggest a strong and long-term biogeographical barrier to gene flow. Thus, the specific attention that should be directed toward preserving large, contiguous aye-aye habitats in northern Madagascar may also benefit the conservation of other distinct taxonomic units. To help facilitate future ecological- and conservation-motivated population genomic analyses by noncomputational biologists, the analytical toolkit used in this study is available on the Galaxy Web site.

AB  - Ecological Reserve determination for rivers in South Africa presently does not include it water temperature component, in spite of its importance in determining species distribution patterns. To achieve this requires an understanding of how lotic thermographs front South African rivers differ from northern hemisphere rivers, to avoid mismanaging rivers based oil incorrect regional assumptions. Hourly water temperatures from 20 sites in lour river systems, representing a range of latitudes, altitudes and stream orders, were assessed using a range of metrics. These data were analysed using principal component analyses and multiple linear regressions to understand what variables a water temperature model for use in ecoregions within South Africa should include. While temperature data are generally lacking in low- and higher-order South African rivers, data suggest that South African rivers are warmer than northern hemisphere rivers. Water temperatures could be grouped into cool, warm and intermediate types. Based oil temperature time series analyses, this paper argues that a suitable water-temperature model for use in ecological Reserve determinations should be dynamic, include flow and air temperature variables, and be adaptive through It heat exchange coefficient term. The inclusion of water temperature in the determination and management of river ecological Reserves would allow for more holistic application of the National Water Act's ecological management provisions. Water temperature guidelines added to the ecological Reserve could be integrated into heuristic aquatic monitoring programmes within priority areas identified in regional conservation plans.

AB  - The Critically Endangered blue-eyed black lemur Eulemur flavifrons of north-western Madagascar is one of the most threatened primates. The majority of research and conservation efforts for the species have been restricted to the Sahamalaza Peninsula but there are unstudied and unprotected populations farther inland. The dearth of information regarding the transition between E. flavifrons and its parapatric sister species, the Vulnerable black lemur Eulemur macaco, and the possibility of a hybrid population complicates conservation planning for both species. We surveyed 29 forest fragments across both species' ranges to investigate the boundary between the taxa, whether hybrids persist, and the threats to lemurs in the region. We found E. flavifrons in six fragments and E. macaco in 17. We never observed E. flavifrons and E. macaco in the same location and we found no conclusive evidence of hybrids. Three fragments in which E. flavifrons was present were north of the Andranomalaza River, which had previously been considered the barrier between the two species. Based on these observations and a literature review, we provide updated ranges, increasing the extent of occurrence (EOO) of E. flavifrons by 28.7% and reducing the EOO of E. macaco by 44.5%. We also evaluate the capacity of protected areas to conserve these lemurs. We recommend additional surveys and the implementation of an education programme in this region to help conserve both species.

AB  - Multispecies wildlife monitoring across large geographical regions is important for effective conservation planning in response to expected impacts from climate change and land use. Unlike many species of birds, mammals, and amphibians which can be efficiently sampled using automated sensors including cameras and sound recorders, reptiles are often much more challenging to detect, in part because of their typically cryptic behavior and generally small body sizes. Although many lizard species are more active during the day which makes them easier to detect using visual encounter surveys, they may be unavailable for sampling during certain periods of the day or year due to their sensitivity to temperature. In recognition of these sampling challenges, we demonstrate application of a recent innovation in distance sampling that adjusts for temporary emigration between repeat survey visits. We used transect surveys to survey lizards at 229 sites throughout the Mojave Desert in California, USA, 2016. We estimated a total population size of 82 million (90% CI: 65-99 million) for the three most common species of lizards across this 66,830 km(2) ecoregion. We mapped how density at the 1-km(2) scale was predicted to vary with vegetation cover and human development. We validated these results against independent surveys from the southern portion of our study area. Our methods and results demonstrate how multispecies monitoring programs spanning arid ecoregions can better incorporate information about reptiles.

AB  - Western Tragopan (Tragopanmelanocephalus) is a beautiful pheasant species and is endemic to western Himalayas. It has large distribution range but different populations are fragmented within the western Himalayan moist temperate forests. Its distribution in Pakistan is restricted to some parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJ&K). This species is globally ` vulnerable' since its fragmented small populations are declining dueto continuing forest loss and habitat destruction throughout its range. This study was carried out to model the potential distribution and habitat of Western Tragopanin Neelam and Muzaffarabad districts of AJ&K by incorporating the physical, biological and climatic variables into MaxEnt model. Land cover data, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope, aspect, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), temperature, precipitation, topographic and sighting datasets were processed in Geographic Information System (GIS) to produce meaningful predictor variables, subsequently used in the MaxEnt software. The results showed that 11,112 ha area (2% of the total study area) is highly suitable for Western Tragopan, 30,248 ha area (5.3%) moderately suitable while 525,445 ha (92.7%) area is unsuitable. Jackknife test evaluated the importance of predictor variables and DEM, precipitation and land cover were found to be the most important variables for this study. The study evaluated the species-habitat relationship within the study area and can be helpful in the management and in-situ conservation planning of the species in its distribution range.

AB  - The conservation field is experiencing a rapid increase in the amount, variety, and quality of spatial data that can help us understand species movement and landscape connectivity patterns. As interest grows in more dynamic representations of movement potential, modelers are often limited by the capacity of their analytic tools to handle these datasets. Technology developments in software and high-performance computing are rapidly emerging in many fields, but uptake within conservation may lag, as our tools or our choice of computing language can constrain our ability to keep pace. We recently updated Circuitscape, a widely used connectivity analysis tool developed by Brad McRae and Viral Shah, by implementing it in Julia, a high-performance computing language. In this initial re-code (Circuitscape 5.0) and later updates, we improved computational efficiency and parallelism, achieving major speed improvements, and enabling assessments across larger extents or with higher resolution data. Here, we reflect on the benefits to conservation of strengthening collaborations with computer scientists, and extract examples from a collection of 572 Circuitscape applications to illustrate how through a decade of repeated investment in the software, applications have been many, varied, and increasingly dynamic. Beyond empowering continued innovations in dynamic connectivity, we expect that faster run times will play an important role in facilitating coproduction of connectivity assessments with stakeholders, increasing the likelihood that connectivity science will be incorporated in land use decisions.

AB  - Understanding the distribution and abundance of threatened species is crucial to elaborate effective management plans for wild populations; however, elusive species prove difficult to detect. To support conservation strategies for the Vulnerable Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the only freshwater sirenian, we analyzed presence/absence data with hierarchical models based on imperfect detection to assess T. inunguis occupancy in a Sustainable Development Reserve, Brazilian Central Amazon. In parallel, we compared the effectiveness of direct and indirect sampling methods to provide occupancy (psi) and detection (p) estimates. Combining both sampling methods' presence datasets provided higher accuracy estimates. The Amazonian manatee's detection probability had never been estimated before: surprisingly, it was high (p = 0.50, SD = 0.05) and positively related with macrophyte coverage. Results suggest that the studied communities resident impact is not affecting the manatee occupancy, with greatest probabilities closer to human settlements. The final occupancy estimate obtained (psi = 0.85, SD = 0.12) can be a baseline to Amazonian manatee long-term monitoring studies, and provide support for decision makers and local communities to establish effective protection zones for the species. Our approach highlights the potential of hierarchical models to understand the distribution not only of T. inunguis in different habitats, but also of other threatened Amazonian aquatic mammals.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to update the distribution of the Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) in Portugal in order to determine regions of suitable environmental conditions and to assess potential occurrence areas, as a first step towards a conservation strategy for the species. Data on the distribution of the species was derived from barn owl pellet samples. Climatic, topographic and soil descriptors were selected and logistic regression was used to model the species distribution. The effort in data collection resulted in the enlargement of the previously known distribution of M. cabrerae. Two logistic models were developed, one environmental and one autologistic, integrating variation due to spatial autocorrelation. The results showed that the species are more likely to occur over the most central region of Portugal, extending its range to the north-eastern side and to the southwest. The preferred areas of occurrence are characterized by medium rainfall values (between 600 and 1200 mm), low to medium humidity values (lower than 85%) and acid to neutral soils (pH between 3 and 7). Species probability of occurrence is discussed in terms of paleontological data and geographical barriers. Potential distribution maps suggest a fragmentation of the overall national population and allowed the identification of three major areas of high probability of occurrence: northeast, center and southwest. As most of these areas are outside Classified Areas Network, models obtained may be regarded as valuable tools in conservation planning. (c) 2007 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

AB  - Floodplains are highly complex and dynamic systems in terms of their hydrology. Thus, they comprise a wide habitat heterogeneity and therefore harbour highly specialized species. For future projections of habitat and species diversity, process-based models simulating ecohydrological conditions and resulting habitat and species distributions are needed. We present a new modelling framework that includes a physically based, surface water-groundwater model coupled with a habitat model. Using the model framework, we simulate the occurrence of 23 flood meadow plant species in a Rhine River floodplain. To benchmark the data, results are compared with a conventional approach with simple spatial hydrological information. Our results show that models with predictors obtained from the surface water-groundwater model are significantly more accurate for rare and endangered species, as well as for typical flood meadow species. A total of 15 hydrological predictors were defined, which look relevant and promising for a good prediction, but at the same time reflect very different hydrological conditions. The standard deviation of the groundwater level, wet soil conditions, and inundation belong to the most relevant predictors for an accurate prediction. Therefore, we recommend including more specific hydrological information in habitat models of species in complex floodplain ecosystems. Such spatial explicit habitat models can also open up further possibilities, such as the projection of global change impact studies or nature conservation planning.

AB  - Climate change is having profound effects on the distributions of species globally. Trait-based assessments predict that specialist and range-restricted species are among those most likely to be at risk of extinction from such changes. Understanding individual species' responses to climate change is therefore critical for informing conservation planning. We use an established Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) protocol to describe the curious range-restriction of the globally threatened White-tailed Swallow (Hirundo megaensis) to a small area in southern Ethiopia. We find that, across a range of modelling approaches, the distribution of this species is well described by two climatic variables, maximum temperature and dry season precipitation. These same two variables have been previously found to limit the distribution of the unrelated but closely sympatric Ethiopian Bush-crow (Zavattariornis stresemanni). We project the future climatic suitability for both species under a range of climate scenarios and modelling approaches. Both species are at severe risk of extinction within the next half century, as the climate in 68-84% (for the swallow) and 90-100% (for the bush-crow) of their current ranges is predicted to become unsuitable. Intensive conservation measures, such as assisted migration and captive-breeding, may be the only options available to safeguard these two species. Their projected disappearance in the wild offers an opportunity to test the reliability of SDMs for predicting the fate of wild species. Monitoring future changes in the distribution and abundance of the bush-crow is particularly tractable because its nests are conspicuous and visible over large distances.

AB  - Millions of birds migrate to and from the Arctic each year, but rapid climate change in the High North could strongly affect where species are able to breed, disrupting migratory connections globally. We modelled the climatically suitable breeding conditions of 24 Arctic specialist shorebirds and projected them to 2070 and to the mid-Holocene climatic optimum, the world's last major warming event similar to 6000 years ago. We show that climatically suitable breeding conditions could shift, contract and decline over the next 70 years, with 66-83% of species losing the majority of currently suitable area. This exceeds, in rate and magnitude, the impact of the mid-Holocene climatic optimum. Suitable climatic conditions are predicted to decline acutely in the most species rich region, Beringia (western Alaska and eastern Russia), and become concentrated in the Eurasian and Canadian Arctic islands. These predicted spatial shifts of breeding grounds could affect the species composition of the world's major flyways. Encouragingly, protected area coverage of current and future climatically suitable breeding conditions generally meets target levels; however, there is a lack of protected areas within the Canadian Arctic where resource exploitation is a growing threat. Given that already there are rapid declines of many populations of Arctic migratory birds, our results emphasize the urgency of mitigating climate change and protecting Arctic biodiversity.

AB  - Introduction of exotic plant species in the tropics has occurred since the colonial period, and has mostly been for timber production. However, due to uncontrolled distribution and lack of awareness, many of these species became invasive, and have been increasingly reported as a source of threats to native ecosystems. We investigated the exotic species richness, their traits, and biogeographic origin in the Satchari Forest in the north-eastern region of Bangladesh, one of the very few intact terrestrial ecosystems remaining in the country. Boosted Regression Trees and Detrended Correspondence Analysis were performed to determine the contribution of various environmental attributes, protection regimes, and disturbances to explain the distribution of exotic species within Satchari Forest. Among the environmental variables, native species richness, elevation gradient, and soil nutrient parameters were found as good predictors of both exotic species' presence and richness in the area. In our analysis, number of exotic species showed a unimodal relationship with native species in the reserved forest, where the relationship was negative in the surrounding area. An increase in exotic species with the presence of higher anthropogenic disturbance events, thereby with lower conservation restrictions as well as with lower protection status, was also evident. Our study suggests that enforcing greater protection status and preventing human use can be the best ways to protect native species composition in forest ecosystems with greater conservation values in tropical developing countries.

AB  - Translocation is a recognized means of rescuing imperiled species but the evidence for the long-term success of translocations is limited. We report the successful translocation of reproductive individuals of a critically endangered shrub Otostegia bucharica from a site facing imminent habitat destruction into a nearby natural population of the species. The relocated plants were visited the year after planting and 13 years later to assess short- and long-term plant survival. Significant percentage of plants that survived transplanting shock and very dry spring following transplanting (around 36%), and further decrease of this number in the next 12 years by only 14%, indicated that O. bucharica is amenable to translocation using reproductive plants. Based on results of species distribution modeling, and failed attempts of ex situ cultivation, we propose introduction of this species into areas with suitable climatic and soil conditions. However, because there is currently no nature reserve in Uzbekistan having suitable conditions for the species under the present climate and that expected in the near future, and because all known habitats of O. bucharica are exposed to the very strong anthropogenic pressure, establishment of a new protected area, awareness building and involvement of local community in conservation activities are required to prevent extinction of this extremely rare species.

AB  - Introduction: The Black-headed Bushmaster (Lachesis melanocephala) is a large venomous snake that inhabits tropical moist forest, wet forest, montane and premontane wet forest in Southwestern Costa Rica and extreme Western Panama. Objective: We assign a neotype for the species due to the loss of the original holotype and update the information on its geographical distribution, natural history, and conservation status. Methods: To determine the conservation status of L. inelanocephala, we modeled its potential distribution using the species' locality records and distribution modeling analysis implemented in MaxEnt. Based on the species' potential distribution, we evaluate the loss of its original habitat and estimate the percentage of its distribution area that is currently protected by the country's protected area system. Results: The potential distribution of the species was estimated at 10 139 km(2), including areas where the species currently occurs and historical areas where the species has been registered but is nowadays considered locally extinct. About 29 % of that potential distribution overlaps with protected wild areas, so less than a third of the potential distribution of the species is under protection. Conclusions: During the last decade, accelerated habitat loss and growing evidence of declining natural populations indicate the need for urgent protective measures to prevent the extinction of this species in the foreseeable future.

AB  - Current global warming causes range changes and affects the distribution of species. Microendemics are the first affected and the most threatened by climate change. Here, we model the potential range of the rupestrian grassland biome (campos rupestres) in a neotropical, endemic-rich mountain range to project changes in its distribution and biodiversity. Our approach is based on the distribution of 42 asclepiad species endemic to the Espinhago Range, southeastern Brazil. Models were produced for the present and for 2020, 2050 and 2080, under two different scenarios of CO2 emission, by implementing a maximum entropy machine-learning algorithm (maxent). The area suitable for campos rupestres was projected to be smaller in the future, and in 2080 would represent approximately half of the current area, most of which would be restricted to the southern portion of the Espinhaco Range. According to our models, by the end of the century, the area suitable for campos rupestres in the northern portion of the Espinhago Range (Chapada Diamantina) would be reduced to only 1.7%, restricted to two small fragments that are not yet protected by the current reserves. This habitat loss corresponds to an estimated 56% richness loss and the likely extinction of 328 (97%) microendemic species of angiosperms. Our results highlight the importance of approaches at local and regional scales for conservation planning in a world undergoing anthropogenic climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - The discipline of ecosystem oceanography provides a framework for assessing the role of mesoscale physical processes on the formation and occurrence of biological hotspots. We used shipboard surveys over nine years to investigate environmental determinants of seabird hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula, a region experiencing rapid climate change and an expanding krill fishery. We hypothesize that seabird hotspots are structured by mesoscale ocean conditions that reflect differences in prey distribution within oceanic and coastal waters. We used generalized additive models to quantify functional relationships of seabird hotspots with krill biomass, and a suite of remotely sensed environmental variables, such as eddy kinetic energy. The spatial organization, changes in intensity, and distribution shifts of seabird hotspots indicate different environmental drivers within coastal and oceanic domains and reflect the seasonal variability of the ecosystem. Our results indicate at least eight mesoscale hotspot zones that represent ecologically important areas where significant krill and predator biomass may be concentrated. Our ecosystem assessment of seabird hotspots identified critical foraging habitat and provided reference points to benefit research on estimating their trophic impacts on Antarctic ecosystems and potential effects from the krill fishery. Our approach is generally applicable to other pelagic ecosystems that are structured by hydrographic fronts and eddies, and containing schooling forage species shared by multiple wide-ranging predators. Furthermore, identification of biological hotspots is useful for the designation of marine protected areas most critical to potentially endangered wildlife and fisheries resources.

AB  - In this study we examined abiotic and biotic factors that could potentially influence the presence of a non-indigenous seaweed, Eucheuma denticulatum, in two locations, one outside (Kane'ohe Bay, Hawai'i, USA) and one within (Mafia Island, Tanzania) its natural geographical range. We hypothesized that the availability of hard substrate and the amount of wave exposure would explain distribution patterns, and that higher abundance of herbivorous fishes in Tanzania would exert stronger top-down control than in Hawai'i. To address these hypotheses, we surveyed E. denticulatum in sites subjected to different environmental conditions and used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to identify predictors of E. denticulatum presence. We also estimated grazing intensity on E. denticulatum by surveying the type and the amount of grazing scars. Finally, we used molecular tools to distinguish between indigenous and non-indigenous strains of E. denticulatum on Mafia Island. In Kane'ohe Bay, the likelihood of finding E. denticulatum increased with wave exposure, whereas on Mafia Island, the likelihood increased with cover of coral rubble, and decreased with distance from areas of introduction (AOI), but this decrease was less pronounced in the presence of coral rubble. Grazing intensity was higher in Kane'ohe Bay than on Mafia Island. However, we still suggest that efforts to reduce non-indigenous E. denticulatum should include protection of important herbivores in both sites because of the high levels of grazing close to AOI. Moreover, we recommend that areas with hard substrate and high structural complexity should be avoided when farming non-indigenous strains of E. denticulatum.

AB  - The Singapore freshwater crab Johora singaporensis is known only from three streams in Singapore and is among the top 100 most threatened species in the world. It is the only member of the genus Johora, endemic to the Malay Peninsula, to be categorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Extensive surveys conducted over 1 year to determine the extent of the species' distribution revealed that the population has declined significantly at its type locality in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Singapore Island's oldest protected forest area. The species remains extant in two unprotected streams in Bukit Batok and Bukit Gombak, which are located outside the nature reserve. Acidification of streams as a result of acid precipitation may be a factor in the decline of the species. If so, this will be the first documented instance of a species being affected negatively by anthropogenic acidification of a tropical freshwater system. The occurrence of this threatened species in a protected area has not, therefore, guaranteed its survival. There is a need for long-term and continuous monitoring of species of high conservation value, together with other measures that focus on habitat protection. Conservation efforts by the National Parks Board of Singapore in collaboration with other government agencies are ongoing in an effort to ensure the survival of this important species.

AB  - The impacts of human-induced disturbance on birds have been studied in growing extent, but there are relatively few studies about the effects of recreation on forest bird communities in protected areas. In this paper, the relative importance of recreation as well as environmental variables on bird communities in Oulanka National Park, in northeastern Finland, was investigated using general additive models (GAM). Bird data collected using the line transect method along hiking trails and in undisturbed control areas were related to number of visits, area of tourism infrastructure, and habitat variables. We further examined the impact of spatial autocorrelation by calculating an autocovariate term for GAMs. Our results indicate that number of visits affects the occurrence and composition of bird communities, but it had no impact on total species richness. Open-cup nesters breeding on the ground showed strongest negative response to visitor pressure, whereas the open-cup nesters nesting in trees and shrubs were more tolerant. For cavity-nesting species, recreation had no significant impact. The contribution of the number of visits was generally low also in models in which it was selected, and the occurrence of birds was mainly determined by habitat characteristics of the area. However, our results show that the recreation-induced disturbance with relatively low visitor pressure can have negative impacts on some bird species and groups of species and should be considered in management of protected areas with recreational activities.

AB  - In the southwestern Gulf of California one of the most successful marine protected areas (MPA) worldwide is found: Cabo Pulmo National Park (CPNP). Due to the level of protection and availability of prey, a large population of bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) exists in this MPA. Historical records about the abundance and distribution of these sharks in the park are scarce. Here we describe the movement patterns of 32 bull sharks within CPNP using a passive acoustic telemetry array (N = 13) located along the park to examine how the residency of the species change spatially and temporally. Environmental variables were taken in situ (HOBOs) and complemented with satellite information (MODIS aqua). The mean residence index (RI) was 0.365 (SD +/- 0.2143). Sharks were resident from December to May, whereas they were absent from August to October. Most bull sharks preferred water temperatures below 28 oC and depths as shallow as 14 m as well as deeper waters ranging from 70 to 160 m. They thus occupy a wide range of habitats with diverse prey, from shallow to mesophotic reefs. Differences in the residency of males and females occur in response to temperature during the different seasons, resulting in sexual segregation. Our results suggest that females segregate from males probably for reproductive reasons (pupping in another area) or to feed on more energy-rich prey resulting in increased growth rates. This study provides information germane to the protection and management of bull sharks in CPNP.

AB  - Landscape transformation and subsequent habitat loss locally extirpate populations and threaten ecosystem health. Timber plantations are a major threat to grassland ecosystems globally. An effective mitigation measure is the instigation of webs of large conservation corridors as ecological networks in plantation mosaics. These ecological networks incorporate natural water courses along with their matrices of natural grassland. Dragonflies are highly sensitive to habitat condition and are effective bioindicators of water quality. Here, we compare dragonfly diversity in conservation corridors, with nearby protected areas as controls, to determine the effectiveness of ecological networks for maintaining river ecosystem integrity, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa. We also investigate the effect of ecological network corridor width on dragonfly assemblages. Lastly, we explore the importance of 18 environmental variables as drivers of dragonfly diversity. Dragonfly abundance, species richness, and Dragonfly Biotic Index scores (a scoring system based on dragonfly range of extent, threat status, and environmental sensitivity) did not differ between ecological network and protected area sites. Dragonfly abundance and species richness were positively correlated with ecological network corridor width. Landscape and water variables were the most important drivers of dragonfly assemblage composition in both ecological networks and protected areas. Management variables and those related to anthropogenic disturbance were not as important. This highlights the conservation success of these well-managed ecological networks for maintaining dragonfly biodiversity in forestry plantations, provided that corridors are wide enough. Implementation of ecological networks as a mitigation measure for plantation forestry is highly effective for lotic systems, and should be implemented more widely in environmental protection plans for transformed landscapes.

AB  - Invasion of native communities by exotic species has been among the most perverse ecological problems in recent years. In the present study, we predicted the probable distribution of two invasive plant species Mimosa diplotricha Sauvalle and Mikania micrantha Kunth in a protected tropical grassland of Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park, Assam, Northeast India using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. We found that about 30-40% (25-30 km(2)) area of the protected area (78.8 km(2)) have high chances of being invaded by both the invasive plants that are prime habitat to the greater one horned Rhinoceros and other important grassland dwellers. Both the models have an accuracy of AUC >0.99. Precipitation in warmest quarters played a major role among the environmental variables in spread of both the invasive plants. The findings of the present study will help the management authority to take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of the invasive plant species. The probable areas most likely to be invaded by the invasive plant species have to be monitored regularly, and intervention like manual uprooting needs to be scheduled during the early stage of its life cycle and before flowering. The frontline staffs of the national park need to be apprised about the ecology and impact of invasive plants for better monitoring and eradication of these detrimental plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A distance-based multivariate control chart is a useftil tool for ecological monitoring to detect changes in biological community resulting from natural or anthropogenic disturbances at permanent monitoring sites. It is based on a matrix of any distances or dissimilarities among observations obtained from species composition and abundance data, and bootstrapping techniques are used to set upper confidence bounds that trigger an alarm for further investigations. We extended the use of multivariate control charts to stratified random sampling and analyzed reef fish monitoring data collected annually on shallow (<= 30 m) reefs across the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), part of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. Fish assemblages in the NWHI were mostly stable, with exceptions in the south region (Mhoa, Mokumanamana and French Frigate Shoals) in 2012 and 2015 where changes in the assemblage structure exceeded the upper confidence bounds of multivariate control charts. However, these were due to changes in relative abundances of native species, and potentially related to the small numbers of survey sites and relatively low coral covers at the sites, particularly in 2015. The present study showed that multivariate control charts can be used to evaluate the status of biological communities in a very large protected area. Future monitoring of fish assemblages in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument should be accompanied by specific habitat or environmental variables that are related to potential threats to its shallow-water ecosystems. This should allow for more detailed investigations into potential causes and mechanisms of changes in fish assemblages when a multivariate control chart triggers an alarm.

AB  - Seagrasses are an important coastal habitat worldwide and are indicative of environmental health at the critical land-sea interface. In many parts of the world, seagrasses are not well known, although they provide crucial functions and values to the world's oceans and to human populations dwelling along the coast. Established in 2001, SeagrassNet, a monitoring program for seagrasses worldwide, uses a standardized protocol for detecting change in seagrass habitat to capture both seagrass parameters and environmental variables. SeagrassNet is designed to statistically detect change over a relatively short time frame (1-2 years) through quarterly monitoring of permanent plots. Currently, SeagrassNet operates in 18 countries at 48 sites; at each site, a permanent transect is established and a team of people from the area collects data which is sent to the SeagrassNet database for analysis. We present five case studies based on SeagrassNet data from across the Americas (two sites in the USA, one in Belize, and two in Brazil) which have a common theme of seagrass decline; the study represents a first latitudinal comparison across a hemisphere using a common methodology. In two cases, rapid loss of seagrass was related to eutrophication, in two cases losses related to climate change, and in one case, the loss is attributed to a complex trophic interaction resulting from the presence of a marine protected area. SeagrassNet results provide documentation of seagrass change over time and allow us to make scientifically supported statements about the status of seagrass habitat and the extent of need for management action.

AB  - Finfish composition and seasonal abundance was studied in the world largest arid mangrove ecosystem of the Indus Delta, Pakistan. Sampling was done from February 2010 to July 2011 in a narrow creek with thick mangrove forest and in a wide creek with sporadic patches of mangrove forest along its banks. The sampling revealed 84 fish species, corresponding to 2,274 individuals in 60 genera and 29 families, weighing a total of 217kg. A minimum of 8 species were recorded in December 2010 while a maximum of 32 species were recorded in April 2010 (average 21 +/- 5.8). The most speciose families were the Mugilidae (9) followed bythe Sciaenidae (8) and the Ariidae (7), the remaining 26 families being represented by 1-5 species. The average sizes of 28 dominant species in the collection ranged from 76.9 to 284.6mm (SL), consisting mostly of juveniles. Relative abundance (%) and relative biomass (%) of species was between 0.04 and 9.1 and 0.01-12.14, respectively. The Pearson correlation of 0.52 (r(2) 0.27) was observed among the environmental parameters and found significant between temperature and dissolved oxygen (p<0.03). The canonical correspondence analysis showed strong relationships of different salinity and temperature ranges with the diversity and biomass composition. The species occurrence frequency was 69% in the wide creek and 31% in the narrow creek. We conclude that the Indus Delta is a highly productive zone in terms of fish diversity, providing ideal habitat for a nursery rather than a fishing ground and propose it to be a marine protected area (MPA).

AB  - Effective coastal conservation requires a better understanding of how human activities on land may directly and indirectly affect adjacent marine communities. However, the relationship between terrestrial and marine systems has rarely been considered in terrestrial and marine reserve design. Seagrasses are affected by land-based activities due to their proximity to terrestrial systems and sensitivity to fluxes of terrestrially-derived organic and inorganic material. Our study examines how land use patterns adjacent to seagrass meadows influence the ecological integrity of seagrass using a suite of seagrass condition metrics on a landscape level across the Philippine archipelago. Using canonical correlation analysis, we measured the association between environmental variables (land use and seagrass abiotic conditions) with biotic variables (seagrass species richness and abundance). Terrestrial protection adjacent to seagrass meadows, defined as the absence of various anthropogenic land use perturbations, had significant positive effects on seagrass condition. The watershed area, and area of farmland and human development, had the most negative effect on seagrass condition. Using analysis of covariance and regression, we examined how marine protected area (MPA) establishment, size, and age, affected seagrass biotic conditions while holding environmental conditions constant. The relationship between biological and environmental canonical factors did not vary as a function of an MPA. This study provides evidence that land use is more important than marine protection for tropical seagrass condition. Our results demonstrate the complementary connection between land and sea, justifying the 'ridge-to-reef approach in coastal conservation. Proper management of seagrasses should account for stewardship of the adjacent watersheds. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The structure of demersal fish assemblages of commercial interest was studied at 51 sites on La Palma Island (Canary Islands, northeastern Atlantic). On this island, demersal fish populations are limited and independent from other islands. As deep water separates the islands and the shallow sublittoral platforms are not continuous, adult inter-island migrations are not possible except between the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. Otherwise, each island functions as a closed system, and the status of an island fish assemblage depends on local environmental conditions and activities performed in situ by the islanders. These circumstances provide a unique opportunity to test the intrainsular variability of fish assemblages. With this background, environmental parameters, fishing pressure and distance to the MPA were considered to identify the main factors explaining the spatial variation of fish assemblages off La Palma Island. Twenty-six fish species were recorded, but 60% of the total fish biomass was represented by only five species (Sparisoma cretense, Pomadasys incisus, Canthidermis sufflamen, Diplodus cervinus cervinus and Bodianus scrofa). However, the structure of assemblages was heterogeneous in response to different variables and showed substantial spatial variation. The assemblages were strongly modified by the presence of upright seaweed cover, fishing activities, and certain environmental variables. Differences were more pronounced in species that occupied the higher trophic levels. The most disturbed assemblages were those located in areas with lower upright seaweed cover and with higher fishing pressure, whereas the best-preserved assemblages corresponded to sites with controlled fishing activities, located within the MPA.

AB  - Anthropogenic and climatic factors are important determinants of algal distribution in aquatic systems. This study aimed to identify temporary pond-groups of phytoplankton assemblages and to establish the interactions between environmental variables and phytoplankton structure. Phytoplankton samples were collected and preserved with 5% formalin; water samples for chemical analysis were taken in August and September 2007, 2008, and 2009 in 86 ponds randomly selected in the Sahelian sector and the Sudanian sector (protected and unprotected areas) of Burkina Faso. Plankton species were examined using light microscopy and identified using standard methods. A Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber was used for algal cell counting. NMDS ordination, indicator species analysis and canonical analysis were performed using Pc-Ord and CANOCO. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests using the software Statistica were performed to compare parameters between pond-groups. Three pond-groups were identified: the Sahelian pond-group, dominated by Lyngbya martensiana and Pseudanabaena constricta; the protected area pond-group, dominated by Euglena caudata and Trachelomonas raciborskii; and the unprotected area pond-group, dominated by Closterium venus and Euglena proxima. At P < 0.05, species composition and abundance in algal groups were mostly associated with nitrate, pH, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity. The Sahelian and the Sudanian sectors were different in pH, water transparency, and species richness. Univariate and multivariate analyses illustrate that variations in the physicochemical properties of water and algal structure followed climatic and anthropogenic gradients. The classification of ponds into algal associations demonstrated that algal assemblages may be used as reliable indicators of habitat conditions.

AB  - Cetaceans are top-level predators that serve as sentinels of the health and status of lower trophic levels in the marine ecosystem. For this reason they attract significant attention in marine conservation planning and often have been used to promote designation of reserve areas in many countries (e.g., Ligurian Sea, Moray Firth, Hawaiian Islands, The Gully, Wadden Sea, Banks Peninsula, and Golfo San Jos,). Many policies are designed to protect cetaceans. For example, the Habitat Directive requires member states to select, designate, and protect sites that support certain natural habitats or species, such as the bottlenose dolphin, as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) that aim to create a network of protected areas across the European Union known as Natura 2000. The boundaries of protected areas for cetacean species must be defined for management purposes. In recent years, many techniques have been developed to define the distribution of cetaceans in relation to habitat preferences. Although these models can provide an understanding of the ecological processes that determine species distribution, their application requires prior knowledge of the variables that should be included in the model, the interactions among these variables, and their effects on species distribution. Thus, the lack of available data in understudied areas precludes the application of these types of models. As an alternative, we describe a geostatistical approach to identifying areas that potentially should be designated as marine protected areas for cetaceans. We illustrate the application of the kriging algorithm to the bottlenose dolphin population that resides in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The data derived from a 7-year survey were used. The encounter rate is the only variable required for this method, making it very easy to apply. The resulting georeferenced and high resolution map includes areas most visited by bottlenose dolphins, which are called core areas. Core areas are helpful for establishing the boundaries of marine reserves for the protection of the species. The approach described herein is accurate, precise, unbiased, replicable to all highly mobile species and easy to understand by both researchers and policy makers.

AB  - Including the distance species are able to move in predictive models improves conservation practice. Bird inventory projects carried out from 1993 to 2004 in Taiwan provide an opportunity to investigate the relationships among species distribution, movement distance, and the environment. We compared projected distributions of 17 Taiwanese endemic bird species using what we called the Standard Method (i.e. movement distance is zero) and what we called the Buffer Met hod (i.e. movement distance is longer than zero) in three presence-only models (GARP, MAXENT and LIVES). The Standard Method used species original occurrence records directly while the Buffer Method expanded the occurrence of species to areas 1 km(2) around each recorded location. We first tested the efficacy of the Buffer Method using ten common species of the 17, and then applied the method to two rare species of the 17. For both the common and rare species, the distributions predicted by the two methods showed slight but important differences. The Buffer Method for all species had a higher average predictive probability, while the Standard Method had a higher maximum predictive probability. Most of the values for the area under the curve (AUC) were over 0.8 with the exceptions of Taiwan Barbet (Megalaima nuchalis) and Taiwan Hwamei (Garrulax taewanus), which have recently separated from Indochinese Barbet (Megalaima annamensis) and Chinese Hwamei (Garrulax canorus), and since 2008 and 2006 have been regarded as species endemic to the study area. Kappa values showed good performance for all species using both methods. The Buffer Method, however, resulted in significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy values for all models of species (p < 0.05). We conclude that when modeling species distribution including the area where the species was censused along with areas within the minimum movement areas better defines the surrounding areas that might supplement core habitat requirements. Therefore, using the Buffer Method, species surrounding distribution can be obtained which provides a better understanding of the species distributions. Given that distribution size is a key to the conservation of species, we suggest the Buffer Method can be used in conservation planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a booming area of research that has had an exponential increase in use and development in recent years. We performed a search of scientific literature and found 5,533 documents published from 1993 to 2018 using SDM, representing a global network of 4,329 collaborating institutions from 155 countries, with Brazil and Mexico being in the top 10 of the most prolific countries globally. National Autonomous University of Mexico, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Kansas, and U.S. Geological Survey are the most prolific institutions worldwide. Latin American institutions (n = 556) participated in 1,000 (18% of global productivity) documents published in collaboration with 591 institutions outside Latin American countries, from which the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Federal University of Goias, Institute of Ecology A.C., National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, University of Sic, Paulo, and University of Brasilia were the most productive. From this body of literature, the most frequently modeled taxonomic groups were Chordata and Insecta, and the most common realms of application were conservation planning and management, climate change, species conservation, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, and biological invasions. From the 36 modeling methods identified to generate SDMs, MaxEnt is used in 73.5% of the papers, followed by Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) with 18.7%, and just 7.4% of the papers compared between 3 and 10 modeling methods. In Latin American countries, productivity in SDM research could be improved as the network of collaborations diversifies and connects with other productive countries (such as United Kingdom, China, Spain, Germany, Australia, and France). The scientific collaboration between Latin American countries should be increased, as the most prolific countries (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia) share less than 10% of its productivity. Some of the main challenges for SDM development in Latin America include bridging the gaps from (a) software use to research productivity and (b) translation to decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose to strengthen communities of practice where modelers, species experts, and decision-makers come together to discuss and develop SDM to shift and enhance current paradigms on how science and decision-making are linked.

AB  - LiDAR remote sensing has been used to examine relationships between vertebrate diversity and environmental characteristics, but its application to invertebrates has been limited. Our objectives were to determine whether LiDAR-derived variables could be used to accurately describe single-species distributions and community characteristics of spiders in remote forested and mountainous terrain. We collected over 5300 spiders across multiple transects in the Bavarian National Park (Germany) using pitfall traps. We examined spider community characteristics (species richness, the Shannon index, the Simpson index, community composition, mean body size, and abundance) and single-species distribution and abundance with LiDAR variables and ground-based measurements. We used the R-2 and partial R-2 provided by variance partitioning to evaluate the predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables compared to ground measurements for each of the community characteristics. The total adjusted R-2 for species richness, the Shannon index, community species composition, and body size had a range of 25-57%. LiDAR variables and ground measurements both contributed >80% to the total predictive power. For species composition, the explained variance was similar to 32%, which was significantly greater than expected by chance. The predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables was comparable or superior to that of the ground-based variables for examinations of single-species distributions, and it explained up to 55% of the variance. The predictability of species distributions was higher for species that had strong associations with shade in open-forest habitats, and this niche position has been well documented across the European continent for spider species. The similar statistical performance between LiDAR and ground-based measures at our field sites indicated that deriving spider community and species distribution information using LiDAR data can provide not only high predictive power at relatively low cost, but may also allow unprecedented mapping of community-and species-level spider information at scales ranging from stands to landscapes. Therefore, LiDAR is a viable tool to assist species-specific conservation as well as broader biodiversity planning efforts not only for a growing list of vertebrates, but for invertebrates as well.

AB  - Urbanization deletes and degrades natural ecosystems, threatens biodiversity, and alienates people from the experience of nature. Nature-based solutions (NbS) that are inspired and supported by nature have the potential to deliver multifunctional environmental and social benefits to address these challenges in urban areas under context-specific conditions. NbS implementation often relies on a one-size-fits-all approach, although interventions that maximize one benefit (e.g., biodiversity conservation) may have no influence on, or even negatively affect, others (e.g., social justice). Furthermore, the current pathways from NbS to various benefits do not rely on a deep understanding of the underlying processes, prohibiting the identification of optimal solutions that maximize synergies across pathways. We present a comprehensive socio-ecological framework that addresses these issues by recognizing that cities are human-dominated environments that are foremost built and maintained to support humans. Our framework demonstrates how we can use experiments and niche species models to understand and predict where species will be and where people will be healthy and happy in a comparable manner. This knowledge can then be integrated into decision support tools that use optimization algorithms to understand trade-offs, identify synergies, and provide planners with the tools needed to tailor context-specific NbS to yield greener, more resilient cities with happier people and reduced inequality.

AB  - Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies to conserve them. The last three decades have seen exponential growth in the number of studies evaluating how, how much, why, when, and where species will be impacted by climate change. We provide an overview of the rapidly developing field of climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) and describe key concepts, terms, steps and considerations. We stress the importance of identifying the full range of pressures, impacts and their associated mechanisms that species face and using this as a basis for selecting the appropriate assessment approaches for quantifying vulnerability. We outline four CCVA assessment approaches, namely trait-based, correlative, mechanistic and combined approaches and discuss their use. Since any assessment can deliver unreliable or even misleading results when incorrect data and parameters are applied, we discuss finding, selecting, and applying input data and provide examples of open-access resources. Because rare, small-range, and declining-range species are often of particular conservation concern while also posing significant challenges for CCVA, we describe alternative ways to assess them. We also describe how CCVAs can be used to inform IUCN Red List assessments of extinction risk. Finally, we suggest future directions in this field and propose areas where research efforts may be particularly valuable.

AB  - Plant invasion has been widely recognized as an agent of global change that has the potential to have severe impacts under climate change. The challenges posed by invasive alien plant species (IAPS) on biodiversity and ecosystem stability is growing and not adequately studied, especially in developing countries. Defining climate suitability for multiple invasive plants establishment is important for early and strategic interventions to control and manage plant invasions. We modeled priority IAPS in Sri Lanka to identify the areas of greatest climatic suitability for their establishment and observed how these areas could be altered under projected climate change. We used Maximum Entropy method to model 14 nationally significant IAPS under representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5 for 2050 and 2070. The combined climate suitability map produced by summing up climatic suitability of 14 IAPS was further classified into five classes in ArcMap as very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. South and west parts of Sri Lanka are projected to have potentially higher climatic suitability for a larger number of IAPS. We observed suitable area changes (gains and losses) in all five classes of which two were significant enough to make an overall negative impact i.e., (i) contraction of the very low class and (ii) expansion of the moderate class. Both these changes trigger the potential risk from IAPS in Sri Lanka in the future.

AB  - Conservation genetics provides wildlife managers powerful tools to assist conservation planning, being recognized as an important biodiversity component. Nevertheless, communication between wildlife conservation actors is still not effective. Furthermore, wildlife conservation funds are often allocated to conservation actions incompatible with thorough long-term genetic research. In the Neotropics, the political organization of the territory, the complex socio-economic context, and the environmental heterogeneity impose additional challenges to the use of genetics for wildlife conservation. Here we present an assessment of the state-of-the-art on the conservation genetics of the giant anteater, as a study case. We use this species to discuss key wildlife threats and challenges along nine major Neotropical biomes. We review the main scientific research on the species, comprising and analyzing genetic data, and focusing on each biome and its region-specific threats. Our genetic meta-analysis reveals low levels of genetic diversity for the species, signs of population differentiation and dissimilar demographic trends per biome. Large-scale investigations are needed to disclose between hypotheses of panmixia, population structure and local adaptation, and to better assess the species demography. The limited information available for a known Vulnerable species perfectly illustrates the need for greater and internationally concerted investment in genetic/genomic research in the Neotropics. Finally, we describe the main wildlife conservation challenges per biome assessed, and present open research questions to which genetics could be of paramount importance.

AB  - To conserve threatened farmland species requires an estimate of the representation of their habitats within protected areas, especially in countries with inadequate mechanisms for protecting and managing habitats outside of protected areas. We conducted a gap analysis to evaluate the conservation status of suitable habitats for two threatened farmland bird species - corncrake (Crex crex) and lesser grey shrike (Lanius minor) - within the networks of national protected areas (NPAs) and important bird areas (IBAs) in Serbia. We determined the distribution of suitable habitats using MaxEnt based on climate, topography and land-cover variables. We found that the proportion of suitable habitats within the NPAs is very low (12.31% and 2.04% for the corncrake and lesser grey shrike, respectively), although it is significantly higher for both species within IBAs (25.86% and 9.91%, respectively). Upland farmland habitats (preferred by corncrake) are better represented within both networks (especially IBAs) than lowland habitats (preferred by lesser grey shrike). Our spatially explicit distribution models identify suitable habitats within and beyond the NPAs and IBAs that require monitoring and appropriate conservation measures. The low representation of suitable habitats within these networks is an obstacle to the conservation of both species and other farmland birds in Serbia.

AB  - An improved knowledge of habitat utilization by demersal species is a pre-requisite for their spatial management. Based on scientific survey data collected over the period 1994-2010, the present study investigates relationships between 4 environmental factors and 10 demersal species in the Gulf of Lions (northwestern Mediterranean Sea). Generalized linear models provided statistically satisfying results in terms of both model explanatory and predictive powers. The 'biological zone' factors, based on the percentage of light penetration to the sea bottom and bottom temperature, were the most important factors, while sediments and benthic macrofauna were only significant for a few species. The type of associations varied among species, resulting in different spatial predictions among species. The spatial structures of species distributions appeared to be due more to habitat preferences that are spatially auto-correlated than to intra-specific population dynamics. The use of a spatial optimization procedure on the predicted species distributions allowed the detection of a set of 7 zones covering 17% of the studied region, that included at least 20% of each species' abundance and that reflected the diversity of the species' habitats. This preliminary result illustrates the potential of further analyses on Marine Protected Areas as a tool for the conservation of the demersal community in this region.

AB  - Knowledge about the dynamics of regional diversity patterns is a foundation on which measures aimed to protect diversity dimensions in the light of climate change can be constructed. Here, we describe taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity patterns of amphibians in the Yucatan Peninsula and their representation in the current protected area system. We stacked current and future potential distribution models to estimate taxonomic diversity and, based on the most recent amphibian phylogeny and nine functional traits, we measured phylogenetic and functional diversity. Independent phylogenetic and functional metrics were obtained by applying null models that allowed us to identify the presumably signature mechanisms underlying assemblage formation. We evaluated the effectiveness of the protected areas in protecting diversity dimensions across scenarios. We found phylogenetic and functional clustering as a result of environmental filters that have allowed only recently diverged species with converged functional traits to establish. Nevertheless, random assemblages are more widespread possibly due to the opposite directions in which competition and environmental filtering are acting. Overall, a decrease in all diversity dimensions is projected under future climate change scenarios compared with the current time. None of the protected areas evaluated were effective in protecting diversity dimensions, stressing the need to complete the existing protected areas network.

AB  - An ecologically representative, well-connected, and effectively managed system of marine protected areas (MPAs) has positive ecological and environmental effects as well as social and economic benefits. Although progress in expanding the coverage of MPAs has been made, the application of management tools has not yet been implemented in most of these areas. In this work, distribution models were applied to nine benthic habitats on a Mediterranean seamount within an MPA for conservation purposes. Benthic habitat occurrences were identified from 55 remotely operated vehicle (ROV) transects, at depths from 76 to 700 m, and data derived from multibeam bathymetry. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were applied to link the presence of each benthic habitat to local environmental proxies (depth, slope, backscatter, aspect, and bathymetric position index, BPI). The main environmental drivers of habitat distribution were depth, slope, and BPI. Based on this result, five different geomorphological areas were distinguished. A full coverage map indicating the potential benthic habitat distribution on the seamount was obtained to inform spatial management. The distribution of those habitats identified as vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) was used to make recommendations on zonation for developing the management plan of the MPA. This process reveals itself as an appropriate methodological approach that can be developed in other areas of the Natura 2000 marine network.

AB  - Stocks of commercially valuable sea cucumber species have declined in most tropical countries, which supply majority of the global demand. This work aimed to locate priority sites for the management of Holothuria scabra and Stichopus horrens in the western central Philippines. A passive larval dispersal model was run under four monsoonal regimes (Northeast monsoon, dry-transition, Southwest monsoon, and early Northeast monsoon), and the results subjected to the Infomap network detection algorithm. Three clusters of closely related geographical nodes were identified [southeastern Palawan (Group I), western Panay and eastern Mindoro (Group II), and northern and western Palawan with western Mindoro (Group III)]. Remotely sensed habitat data were used to parameterize the degree of connectivity observed among sites (H. scabra spawning and settlement requires the presence of seagrass and mangrove, while S. horrens requires corals and seagrass). Local retention, self-recruitment, settlement success and sink diversity were then calculated for each node with suitable habitat. The locations were ranked according to each metric and those with higher larval export rates, a higher diversity of larval sources and a high degree of successful larval contribution to other sites were deemed crucial for the management of wild populations. Sixteen high-priority sites were identified, distributed mainly along northern Palawan and western Panay. Six sites were common for both species at different seasons, and no single location fulfilled all stated criteria across the four seasons and both sea cucumber species considered. The priority sites for management could serve as broodstock selection and juvenile restocking areas for aquaculture production clusters, which when properly implemented, could lead to an increase in sea cucumber production and contribute to natural populations. On a broader scale, the designation of closely related clusters and incorporation of habitat requirements to dispersal data provided critical input for the delineation of ecologically meaningful management units for sea cucumbers within the region.

TI  - Surveys of wintering Little Bustards Tetrax tetrax in central Spain: distribution and population estimates at a regional scale

KW  - BIRDS
AB  - Developing a standardized survey methodology to census and estimate the size of wintering populations is a main conservation priority for the endangered Little Bustard. We present a standard and repeatable methodology to census wintering Little Bustard populations at a regional scale, and the first statistically reliable population estimate of a Little Bustard wintering population in Spain. We carried out two surveys, in 2003 and 2004, using UTM 10 km x 10 km squares as census units, which were subjected to stratified sampling over the species' potential distribution range in the region of Madrid (Central Spain). Only the areas of potentially suitable habitat within squares of known winter presence of the species were considered. The species' winter distribution in Madrid was fairly constant between years, showing a fragmented pattern in three main nuclei. The number of Little Bustards observed was consistent between surveys (752 and 786 birds, respectively), with birds grouped in an average of 32 flocks (1 to 350 birds, mean = 27.9 birds). No between-winter differences in flock size were observed, although differences between sectors were significant. The highest densities were observed in the Tagus valley (mean density = 2.9 birds km(-2), 293 birds), followed by north-eastern farmland (mean density = 0.6 bird km(-2), 269 birds). The estimated size of the Little Bustard population wintering in the Madrid region was 1,051 (95% CI = 1,043-1,231). This calculation was based on recorded population density, measured as the number of birds per square kilometre, and considers the potential habitats available in each sector. We propose this methodology as adequate for surveying any Little Bustard wintering area, at both regional and smaller spatial scales. Survey results are consistent with previous tentative estimates for the region of Madrid, and with available information on Little Bustard movements. Sixty-five per cent of squares with Little Bustard presence were outside any protected area, which makes the wintering Little Bustard population of Madrid highly vulnerable to habitat disappearance and may affect the viability of breeding nuclei whose individuals winter in the region.

AB  - American pikas (Ochotona princeps) have been heralded as indicators of montane-mammal response to contemporary climate change. Pikas no longer occupy the driest and lowest-elevation sites in numerous parts of their geographic range. Conversely, pikas have exhibited higher rates of occupancy and persistence in Rocky Mountain and Sierra Nevada montane 'mainlands'. Research and monitoring efforts on pikas across the western USA have collectively shown the nuance and complexity with which climate will often act on species in diverse topographic and climatic contexts. However, to date no studies have investigated habitat, distribution, and abundance of pikas across hundreds of sites within a remote wilderness area. Additionally, relatively little is known about whether climate acts most strongly on pikas through direct or indirect (e.g., vegetation-mediated) mechanisms. During 2007-2009, we collectively hiked > 16,000 km throughout the 410,077-ha Glacier National Park, Montana, USA, in an effort to identify topographic, microrefugial, and vegetative characteristics predictive of pika abundance. We identified 411 apparently pika-suitable habitat patches with binoculars (in situ), and surveyed 314 of them for pika signs. Ranking of alternative logistic-regression models based on AIC(c) scores revealed that short-term pika abundances were positively associated with intermediate elevations, greater cover of mosses, and taller forbs, and decreased each year, for a total decline of 68% during the three-year study; whereas longer-term abundances were associated only with static variables (longitude, elevation, gradient) and were lower on north-facing slopes. Earlier Julian date and time of day of the survey (i.e., midday vs. not) were associated with lower observed pika abundance. We recommend that wildlife monitoring account for this seasonal and diel variation when surveying pikas. Broad-scale information on status and abundance determinants of montane mammals, especially for remote protected areas, is crucial for land and wildlife-resource managers trying to anticipate mammalian responses to climate change.

AB  - 1. Historically, the overlap zones of wild equids were small in Africa but extensive for Przewalski's horses Equus ferus przewalskii and Asiatic wild asses Equus hemionus in Asia. Currently, the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area in south-western Mongolia is the only place where sympatric, free-ranging populations of these equids occur. This provides a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that Przewalski's horses are primarily adapted to mesic steppes and Asiatic wild asses to arid desert steppes and semi-deserts. Understanding the spatial needs and habitat requirements of these little-studied species is a pre-requisite for setting aside and managing protected areas and planning future re-introductions.
   2. From 2001 to 2005, we followed nine Przewalski's horses and seven Asiatic wild asses using satellite telemetry and direct observations to assess differences in their resource selection strategies and social organization.
   3. Przewalski's horses had non-exclusive home ranges of 152-826 km(2), selected for the most productive plant communities and formed stable harems groups.
   4. Asiatic wild asses had non-exclusive home ranges of 4449-6835 km(2), showed little preferences for any plant community and seemed to live in fission-fusion groups.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide evidence for different resource selection strategies in two sympatric equid species. Our findings indicate that the Gobi areas provide an edge, rather than an optimal habitat for Przewalski's horses. Consequently, only small and isolated pockets of suitable habitat remain for future re-introductions. Asiatic wild asses, on the other hand, need access to large tracts of land to cope with the unpredictable resource distribution of the Gobi. Managers should be aware that protecting habitat where Asiatic wild asses occur does not necessarily benefit Przewalski's horse restoration, whereas setting aside habitat for the conservation of Przewalski's horses will only locally benefit Asiatic wild asses.

AB  - Aim We examined the influences of regional climate and land-use variables on mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis) and pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps) abundances to inform conservation planning in the Prairie Pothole Region of the United States.
   Location The US portion of Bird Conservation Region 11 (US-BCR11, the Prairie Potholes), which encompasses six states within the United States: Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa.
   Methods We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (NABBS), the National Land Cover Data Set, and the National Climatic Data Center to model the effects of environmental variables on waterbird abundance. We evaluated land-use covariates at three logarithmically related spatial scales (1000, 10,000 and 100,000 ha), and constructed hierarchical spatial count models a priori using information from published habitat associations. Model fitting was performed using a hierarchical modelling approach within a Bayesian framework.
   Results Models with the same variables expressed at different scales were often in the best model subset, indicating that the influence of spatial scale was small. Both land-use and climate variables contributed strongly to predicting waterbird abundance in US-BCR11. The strongest positive influences on waterbird abundance were the percentage of wetland area across all three spatial scales, herbaceous vegetation and precipitation variables. Other variables that we included in our models did not appear to influence waterbirds in this study.
   Main conclusions Understanding the relationships of waterbird abundance to climate and land use may allow us to make predictions of future distribution and abundance as environmental factors change. Additionally, results from this study can suggest locations where conservation and management efforts should be focused.

AB  - Throughout North America, bird population declines may be attributable to loss of habitat on the breeding grounds. Human land uses such as residential development, greatly impact landscapes and biota, particularly breeding birds. Riparian areas, which are essential to breeding birds, are particularly vulnerable to development pressures. In North America, most studies have focused on eastern birds and it is unclear how western bird assemblages respond to the effects of residential development. We sampled bird community parameters and habitat variables at three spatial scales (microhabitat, macrohabitat, and landscape) along a residential development gradient within the Snake River riparian corridor in Jackson Hole, WY, USA. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression statistical tests were used to determine the effects of housing densities on avian community parameters, guilds, individual species distributions, and environmental variables. Landscape-level features were most affected by residential development and trends associated with increasing housing densities, such as anthropogenic habitat fragmentation primarily structured local bird communities. Overall species richness and diversity declined with increasing residential development. Neotropical migrant species were most negatively impacted and consistently declined in proportional representation on forested plots as residential development densities increased. Food generalists, ground gleaners, and avian nest predators all increased with increasing residential development. Brood parasites, on the other hand, did not increase with increasing housing densities and their distribution may reflect the availability of nest host species. These results suggest that residential development within riparian habitats may be exerting a strong negative influence on western bird communities and at high densities may lead to a depauperate avian biota. The results of our study indicate that preserving forest structure may benefit certain species but will not likely conserve as diverse and rich an avian assemblage as minimizing fragmentation associated with residential development.

AB  - Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) is a highly productive system and hosts a high fish diversity and is of paramount importance for sustaining protein supply for over 15 million Cambodians. Nevertheless, the ecology and factors influencing the spatial distribution of many fishes within the lake remain poorly understood. Using commercial fishing lot catch data from 1994/1995 to 1999/2000, fishing seasons and environmental data (land cover and bioclimatic variables), we describe spatial distribution of the eight most commercially important fish species, and investigate the effects of environmental factors on their distributions in the TSL. We found a strong variability in fish biomass across areas and between species. Specifically, Channa micropeltes was most abundant in the southern and northern sections of the TSL. Channa striata and Trichopodus microlepis were more common in the northern part of the TSL. Cyclocheilos enoplos, Barbonymus gonionotus, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, and Gymnostomus spp. were abundant in the southern areas of the TSL while Phalacronotus spp. were abundant in few areas in both the north and the south. Flooded forest positively explained the variation in the biomass of P.hypophthalmus, C. striata, C. enopolos, and Phalacronotus spp. Likewise, the lake's open water positively affects the biomass of P.hypophthalmus, C. enopolos, and Phalacronotus spp., while the agricultural field negatively impacts Gymnostomus spp. biomass distribution. We also found that some areas consistently hosted high fish biomass (e.g., lot 2, Kampong Thom; lot 6, Pursat; lot 2, Battambang, etc.). We, therefore, suggest that fisheries management and conservation planning focus on those areas, considering those areas significance as core fish habitat and important for catching fish.

AB  - Japan's only native crayfish species Cambaroides japonicus has been declining dramatically in the past few decades. For the purpose of conservation planning, twenty-two coastal streams were surveyed to investigate summer distributions of crayfish in relation to stream and riparian environment. Classification and regression trees were used to predict the occurrence and abundance of crayfish. The classification tree model with stream variables as predictors showed that crayfish would occur in swift or high gradient streams (correct classification rate = 91%). Within those streams, however, crayfish only inhabited depositional microhabitats, in which the areas are limited in availability. Crayfish were not found in gentle, low gradient streams containing abundant depositional microhabitats. This paradoxical distribution pattern was attributed to availability of boulder substrates in swift or high gradient streams. The regression tree model indicated that crayfish abundance was determined primarily by the percentage of boulder substrates and the presence of fish (observed vs. predicted r = 0.64).
   The classification tree model using only riparian variables indicated that the total woody plant (mainly broadleaf species) density followed by the percentage of early successional species such as alder and willow determined the splits of the tree model (correct classification rate = 95%). A leaf processing experiment on 10 riparian plant species suggested that crayfish preferred high nitrogen (or low C/N) leaves.
   These results suggest that swift or high gradient fishless streams associated with abundant cover in dense broadleaf forest serve conservation areas for this endangered crayfish, and that consideration of riparian composition may facilitate conservation efforts.

AB  - We analyzed and predicted spatial patterns of turnover in macroalgal community composition (beta diversity) that accounted for broad-scale environmental gradients using two contrasting community modelling methods, Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM) and Gradient Forest Modelling (GFM). Percentage cover data from underwater macroalgal surveys of subtidal rocky reefs along the southeastern coastline of continental Australia and northern coastline of Tasmania were combined with 0.01 degrees-resolution gridded environmental variables, to develop statistical models of beta diversity. GDM, a statistical approach based on a matrix regression, and GFM, a machine learning approach based on ensemble tree based methods, were used to fit models and generate predictions of beta diversity within unsurveyed areas across the region of interest. Patterns of macroalgal beta diversity predicted by both methods were remarkably congruent and showed a similar and striking change in community composition from eastern South Australia to western Victoria and northern Tasmania. Macroalgal communities differed markedly in predicted composition between the open coast and inshore locations. A distinct algal community was predicted for the enclosed Port Philip Bay in Victoria. Sea surface temperature standard deviation and average contributed most to changes in beta diversity for both the GDM and GFM models; changes in wave exposure and oxygen also influenced beta diversity in the GDM model, while salinity and exposure contributed substantially to the GFM model. The GDM and GFM analyses allowed us to model and predict spatial patterns of beta diversity in macroalgal communities comprising > 180 species over 6600 km of coastline. These outputs advance regional-scale conservation management by allowing planners to interpolate from point source ecological data to assess the distribution of biodiversity across their full domain of interest. The congruence between methods suggests that strong environmental gradients related to temperature and exposure are the common drivers of community change in this region.

AB  - Forests are already and will continue to experience a rapid and extreme change in climatic conditions in the future. The distributions of forests are expected to shift northward and to higher altitudes based on the results of species distribution modelling (SDM). Although SDM is criticized for lack of biotic interactions and natural migration mechanisms, it is still an important tool for understanding the influence of climate change on forest distributions at a landscape scale. We hypothesize that based on extant forest cover, distribution of protected areas and understanding on seed dispersal mechanisms, the suitable range of forest tree species will decline, and certain species might be driven to extinction in the absence of suitable space for migrations in a rapidly changing climate. To assess this scenario, we modelled the current and future potential distribution of 18 Castanopsis species in Asia using MaxENT. Mild (RCP-4.5) and severe (RCP-8.5) climate change sce-narios from 17 climate change models were assessed. Three groups of current Castanopsis distribution were identified and they responded differently under climate change. One-third of the species will experience potential range reductions while two-third will have potential range expansions. However, when we overlaid the results with forest cover and protected area coverage, range expansions are unlikely to happen due to fragmented forest cover and lack of efficient seed dispersal mechanisms. Natural species migrations and local adaptation are not likely to happen for Castanopsis and therefore immediate adaptive strategies should be considered in forest management. This situation was particularly severe in the marginal tropical zones across coastal South China and the Northern Indo-China region.

AB  - Aim To examine whether at a subcontinental-scale ecotonal areas of transition between vegetation communities are at higher risk of plant invasion. Location South Africa and Lesotho. Methods Using plant data on native and established alien species in South Africa, we examined the relationship between plant richness (native and alien) in each grid cell (quarter-degree resolution) in the study area and the distance of the grid cell to the nearest ecotone between vegetation communities. We used a residual analysis to estimate each grid cell's relative invasibility (i.e. susceptibility to invasion) relative to its ecotone distance. We further explored the relative importance of ecotones in relation to large-scale environmental variation, and the importance of ecotonal spatial heterogeneity, in structuring alien species richness patterns. Results Both alien and native richness patterns become higher with declining distance to ecotones, suggesting that transitional environments are more susceptible to invasion than areas located farther away; however, levels of invasibility vary across South Africa. The negative relationship between ecotone distance and alien species richness remained negative and significant for the whole of South Africa, grassland and Nama-Karoo, after controlling for environmental variables. Several sources of environmental heterogeneity, which were shown here to be associated with ecotones, were also found to be important determinants of alien species richness. Main conclusions While most of the current conservation efforts at the regional and global scales are currently directed to distinct ecosystems, our results suggest that much more effort should be directed to the transitions between them, which are small in size and have high native richness, but are also under greater threat from invasive alien species. Understanding how alien species richness and invasibility change across transitions and sharp gradients, where environmental heterogeneity is high, is important for ongoing conservation planning in a biogeographical context.

AB  - Climate change is a major threat to global biodiversity that will produce a range of new selection pressures. Understanding species responses to climate change requires an interdisciplinary perspective, combining ecological, molecular and environmental approaches. We propose an applied integrated framework to identify populations under threat from climate change based on their extent of exposure, inherent sensitivity due to adaptive and neutral genetic variation and range shift potential. We consider intraspecific vulnerability and population-level responses, an important but often neglected conservation research priority. We demonstrate how this framework can be applied to vertebrates with limited dispersal abilities using empirical data for the bat Plecotus austriacus. We use ecological niche modelling and environmental dissimilarity analysis to locate areas at high risk of exposure to future changes. Combining outlier tests with genotype-environment association analysis, we identify potential climate-adaptive SNPs in our genomic data set and differences in the frequency of adaptive and neutral variation between populations. We assess landscape connectivity and show that changing environmental suitability may limit the future movement of individuals, thus affecting both the ability of populations to shift their distribution to climatically suitable areas and the probability of evolutionary rescue through the spread of adaptive genetic variation among populations. Therefore, a better understanding of movement ecology and landscape connectivity is needed for predicting population persistence under climate change. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating genomic data to determine sensitivity, adaptive potential and range shift potential, instead of relying solely on exposure to guide species vulnerability assessments and conservation planning.

AB  - The current understanding of the status of the vegetation in Lebanon is largely derived from herbarium data and associated floristic studies produced by early 20th century field botanists. In common with other areas in the Mediterranean, the Lebanese coastline is highly threatened by unregulated development, yet current patterns of species richness along the Lebanese coastal zone are little studied. The objective of this study was to assess the floristic richness of the Lebanese coastal zone and to provide baseline information for conservation planning. For this purpose, permanent sample plots (6 m x 100 m) were established in 26 selected vegetation communities in coastal habitats. Monthly field collections of plant specimens were undertaken between October 1999 and July 2000. A total of 441 species were collected and identified. None of the recorded species are currently considered globally threatened, but two are Lebanese endemics (Matthiola crassifolia Boiss. & Gaill., Origanum ehrenbergii Boiss.). Species richness varied between communities, ranging from six species in a littoral limestone pavement community to 113 in an abandoned terrace community. The similarity between communities, based on Sorensen indices, was low and a large number of species were recorded only once. Cluster analysis showed a grouping of different communities within locations in some instances and the clustering of similar community types regardless of location in others. Species richness in riparian and littoral communities consisted mostly of habitat non-specific species. The low community similarity, patchy species distribution, and predominance of habitat non-specific species all point to the need to complement in situ conservation measures with ex situ conservation.

AB  - The debate about whether proactive (focused on irreplaceable species) or reactive (focused on vulnerable species) conservation is more effective usually focuses on the global or multinational scale and knowledge of how these principles interact on-the-ground is lacking. Here we use the first long-term dataset on an entire oak-living beetle community in hollow oaks (Quercus spp.) to ask whether policy-driven conservation actions aimed at vulnerable species can also be proactive for unthreatened, but irreplaceable species. Hollow oaks are vital keystone structures that are rich in both vulnerable and irreplaceable wood-living beetles. We sampled in excess of 23,000 individuals from 307 species over four seasons, across the oak range in Norway. We assessed the importance of key environmental variables for vulnerable, irreplaceable and generalist species. We show that simple management actions taken to benefit vulnerable species in hollow trees could also contribute to preventing the decline of important, irreplaceable species. Clearing regrowth is predicted to increase vulnerable species richness by 75-100%, specialist richness by 65%, and to benefit two generalist species. Regrowth clearance is likely to be similarly beneficial in all oak-based habitats with hollow trees across Europe and North America. Increased oak circumference and local habitat quantity were also beneficial for species richness and influenced species composition. Based on this we provide advice for targeting conservation action. We suggest economic, carbon and recreational benefits of clearance that could increase the attractiveness of conservation for policy-makers. We show the importance of examining large-scale conservation planning principles at a local scale to elicit how they work on the ground where conservation actually happens. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Climate change poses a great challenge for biodiversity conservation. Several studies exist regarding climate change's impacts on European plants, yet none has investigated how climate change will affect the extinction risk of the entire endemic flora of an island biodiversity hotspot, with intense human disturbance. Our aim is to assess climate change's impacts on the biodiversity patterns of the endemic plants of Crete (S Aegean) and provide a case-study upon which a climate-smart conservation planning strategy might be set. We employed a variety of macroecological analyses and estimated the current and future biodiversity, conservation and extinction hotspots in Crete. We evaluated the effectiveness of climatic refugia and the Natura 2000 network of protected areas (PAs) for protecting the most vulnerable species and identified the taxa of conservation priority based on the Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) index. The results revealed that high altitude areas of Cretan mountains constitute biodiversity hotspots and areas of high conservation and evolutionary value. Due to the "escalator to extinction" phenomenon, these areas are projected to become diversity "death-zones" and should thus be prioritised. Conservation efforts should be targeted at areas with overlaps among PAs and climatic refugia, characterised by high diversity and EDGE scores. This conservation-prioritisation planning will allow the preservation of evolutionary heritage, trait diversity and future ecosystem services for human well-being and acts as a pilot for similar regions worldwide.

AB  - AimAdult dragonflies are renowned for being good bioindicators of anthropogenic change, but their response to the heterogeneity of undisturbed river systems has received little investigation. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) has had a long lineage of natural selection which has honed life stages to the fine grain of the river systems. This leads to the intriguing question: How sensitive are the aerial adults to the in-water conditions?
   LocationRivers of the CFR, in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, are naturally heterogeneous and complex ecosystems running across a geologically ancient landscape. The CFR is a significant centre of local endemism for many taxa, including dragonflies.
   MethodsWe investigated dragonfly assemblages and 20 environmental variables along untransformed reaches of three CFR rivers.
   ResultsWe found that each river has its own particular signature' dragonfly assemblage. We also found that certain in-water parameters were the most important factors driving adult dragonfly assemblages, and not variables associated with substrate or riparian vegetation under these historic, natural conditions. This responsiveness to a heterogeneous range of in-water variables was similar from one river to the next, and also was independent of species turnover among the different dragonfly assemblages.
   Main conclusionsFrom a conservation perspective, the natural variation in certain water parameters, particularly in-water conditions, is essential for supporting the full suite of adult dragonfly species. Challenging but important for conservation planning is that each river has its own biotic merit. Addressing this challenge also means that maintenance and restoration of historic, heterogeneous, in-water conditions in addition to the removal of alien invasive trees which are already known to be highly detrimental to this largely irreplaceable dragonfly fauna. Prioritizing which rivers to conserve can be achieved through using indices involving dragonflies.

AB  - Aim An understanding of how biotic communities are spatially organized is necessary to identify and prioritize habitats within landscape-scale biodiversity conservation. Local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) identifies individual habitats that make a significant contribution to beta diversity and may have important practical implications, particularly for conservation of habitat networks. In this study, we develop and apply a conservation prioritization approach based on LCBD in aquatic invertebrate communities from 132 ponds.
   Location Five urban settlements in the UK: Halton, Loughborough, Stockport, Birmingham and Huddersfield.
   Methods We partition LCBD into richness difference (nestedness: RichDiffLCBD) and species replacement (turnover: ReplLCBD) and identify key environmental variables driving LCBD. We examine LCBD at two scales relevant to conservation planning: within urban settlements and nationally across the UK.
   Results Significant differences in LCBD values were recorded among the five settlements. In four of the five urban settlements studied, pond sites with the greatest LCBD values typically showed high replacement values. Significant LCBD sites and sites with high taxonomic diversity together supported more of the regional species pool (70%-97%) than sites with high taxonomic diversity alone (54%-94%) or what could be protected by the random selection of sites. LCBD was significantly associated with vegetation shading, surface area, altitude and macrophyte cover.
   Main conclusions Conservation prioritization that incorporates LCBD and sites with high taxonomic diversity improves the effectiveness of conservation actions within pond habitat networks, ensures sites supporting high biodiversity are protected and provides a method to define a spatial network of protected sites. Identifying new, effective conservation approaches, particularly in urban areas where resources may be scarce and conflicts regarding land use exist, is essential to ensure biodiversity is fully supported, and detrimental anthropogenic effects are reduced.

AB  - In Mediterranean countries, inventories of many animal groups particularly insects, are incomplete or nonexistent. Hence, a feasible spatial picture of unequally surveyed areas is required to ascertain which faunistic surveys are good enough to produce reliable estimates of species richness. We used generalized linear models to build a multiple-regression function through which we predicted the distribution of Iberian dung beetle species richness. Given the scarcity and unevenness of the species-richness spatial distribution, the number of records of a dung beetle database (BANDASCA), falling within each of the 50 x 50 km grid squares, was chosen as a measure of the sampling effort for that square. Examining the asymptotic relationship between the number of dung-beetle species and database records for each physioclimatic Iberian subregion, we found that 82 grid squares (32% of the total) were adequately sampled. Dung-beetle species richness was related in each of these 82 cells to 24 explanatory variables. Curvilinear functions, interaction terms, and the significant third-degree polynomial terms of latitude and longitude were included to model species-richness distribution. The final model accounted for 62.4% of the total deviance after we eliminated seven outlier squares, with maximum elevation, grassland area, land-use diversity, forest area, geological diversity, interaction of terrestrial area and maximum elevation, and interaction between calcareous rock, and geological diversity and latitude being the most significant independent variables. The residuals of the function were not spatially autocorrelated, and we validated the final model by a jackknife procedure. Large and environmentally complex hotspots in the Iberian Central, Baetic, and Subbaetic mountain ranges stand out from the emerging map of species richness. Further detailed research is required to determine the complementarity of the faunas of these two main hotspots, the key question in conservation planning for a dung-feeding beetle.

AB  - Grasslands are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Spatial prioritization of high quality habitat in agricultural landscapes is needed to protect grassland biodiversity. Within this context, we focused on European ground squirrel, a keystone species in steppe and salt steppe ecosystems. Using historical data and habitat field mapping, this study evaluates species distribution and site occupancy along the southern margin of the species range (Serbia) and identifies priority conservation zones in an intensively used landscape. Using gap analysis to evaluate changes in distribution over time and land protection status of the occupied area, we found that the regional species range has been constricted by 70%, and that 43% of mapped areas were outside of conservation networks. We also used a landscape structure model and multivariate analysis to identify the effects of spatial heterogeneity on occupancy. After mapping potential conservation zones with a buffer radius of 4.6 km-the scale with significant effects on occupancy-we identified 19 potential agro-ecological zones that cover the full range of mapped species habitats. The proposed agro-ecological zones differ in percentage of occupancy, which was found to increase with the overall landscape heterogeneity. This study contributes to the ongoing effort to broaden the understanding of the ecology and conservation of the European ground squirrel and the grasslands they rely on. Conservation planning should be designed to protect grasslands occupied by ground squirrels, ensure that the agricultural matrix is permeable, and to sustain or enhance landscape heterogeneity.

AB  - River banks are naturally disturbed habitats, in which local flood events and the landscape structure are expected to govern riparian species assemblages. Not solely effects of flooding per se, but also related changes in vegetation structure will affect species distribution. By elucidating the relationships between species occurrences and multivariate habitat conditions on a restricted spatial scale, insight into conservation strategies to preserve riparian species is gained. Ordination and grouping methods revealed important environmental and functional trait constraints on the composition of predatory riparian arthropods. Mainly flooding disturbance appeared to affect spider and carabid beetle assemblages. Habitat affinity and dispersal ability were retained as important traits explaining similarity between arthropod assemblages. River banks similar in species composition differed in absolute and functional group species richness. Furthermore, Poisson regressions demonstrated the importance of variation in discharge regime, sediment composition and vegetation structure for the preservation of rare riparian arthropods. Xerothermophilic specialists were disfavoured by increased flooding disturbance, whereas hygrophilic species benefited from increased vegetation cover. In contrast to flight-active riparian carabids, occurring throughout the river system, especially cursorial spiders are expected to go extinct under increased anthropogenic alterations of discharge regimes. In general, river restoration should generate the required heterogeneity in environmental conditions (e.g. dynamic processes) at the river bank level, thereby increasing the sustainability of dynamic riverine landscapes and the conservation of vulnerable riparian arthropods. Moreover, we argue that the understanding of functional responses towards environmental factors on a local scale results in general and widely applicable guiding concepts for species conservation and ecosystem management.

AB  - Plant endemism in the European Alps is clustered into particular geographic areas. Two contrasted and non exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain these hotspots of endemism: (i) those areas were glacial refugia, where endemism reflects survival-recolonisation dynamics since the onset of Pleistocene glaciations, (ii) those are high elevation mountain areas, where endemism was fostered by local speciation events due to geographic isolation and harsh environmental niches, or by low dispersal ability of inhabiting species.
   Here, we quantitatively compared these two hypotheses using data of species distribution in the European Alps (IntraBioDiv database), species phylogenetic relationships, and species ecological and biological characteristics. We developed a spatially and phylogenetically explicit modelling framework to analyze spatial patterns of endemism and the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages. Moreover, we analyzed interrelations between species trait syndromes and endemism.
   We found that high endemism occurrs in potential glacial refugia, but only those on calcareous bedrock, and also in areas with high elevation. Plant assemblages in calcareous refugia showed phylogenetic overdispersion a signature of non-selective conservation forces, whereas those located in high mountain areas showed phylogenetic clustering - a signature of recent diversification and environmental filtering. Endemic species were either stress-tolerant, poorly dispersing species, or high elevation specialists with a wide distribution within the European Alps.
   While both calcareous refugia and high-elevation hotspots harbour a large portion of plant endemism in the European Alps, the species they host have substantially different characteristics. Our results suggest that hotspots of endemism in calcareous refugia are more important for nature conservation planning, as they host many range restricted endemic species and rather isolated evolutionary lineages.

AB  - In many arid landscapes, springs provide the only reliable source of water. Accordingly, both native species and human land uses, including diversion of water, livestock grazing, and recreation, tend to concentrate around springs and spring-fed riparian areas. We examined whether species richness and composition of aquatic macroinvertebrates at 45 springs in the Spring Mountains, an isolated mountain range in the eastern Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA), could be predicted using readily measured environmental gradients and estimates of disturbance intensity. The Spring Mountains is a focus of regional conservation planning, and managers are charged with prioritizing its springs for conservation and rehabilitation. Our results suggested that species richness of aquatic macroinvertebrates in the Spring Mountains system may be greatest at intermediate levels of natural and human disturbance. Discharge and springbrook length appeared to be only weakly correlated with species richness, whereas neither elevation, nor water temperature, nor electrical conductance was significantly associated with species richness. Nestedness analyses demonstrated that species present in relatively depauperate locations tended to be subsets of the species present in locations that were richer in species, but that pattern did not appear to be driven by either disturbance intensity or by the environmental variables we measured. Disturbance intensity was not associated with the extent to which species presences and absences were predictable. Although our results should not be interpreted to mean that major environmental gradients and disturbance intensity have no effect on distributional patterns of aquatic invertebrates in the Spring Mountains, the ability of these variables to serve as predictors of species richness and composition may be relatively low. Springs and other wetlands in arid landscapes are characterized by isolation and unpredictable disturbances, and faunal responses to environmental gradients may tend to be individualistic and taxon-specific.

AB  - Aim: Although the effects of life history traits on population density have been investigated widely, how spatial environmental variation influences population density for a large range of organisms and at a broad spatial scale is poorly known. Filling this knowledge gap is crucial for global species management and conservation planning and to understand the potential impact of environmental changes on multiple species.
   Location: Global.
   Time period: Present.
   Major taxa studied: Terrestrial amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.
   Methods: We collected population density estimates for a range of terrestrial vertebrates, including 364 estimates for amphibians, 850 for reptiles, 5,667 for birds and 7,651 for mammals. We contrasted the importance of life history traits and environmental predictors using mixed models and tested different hypotheses to explain the variation in population density for the four groups. We assessed the predictive accuracy of models through cross-validation and mapped the partial response of vertebrate population density to environmental variables globally.
   Results: Amphibians were more abundant in wet areas with high productivity levels, whereas reptiles showed relatively higher densities in arid areas with low productivity and stable temperatures. The density of birds and mammals was typically high in temperate wet areas with intermediate levels of productivity. The models showed good predictive abilities, with pseudo-R-2 ranging between 0.68 (birds) and 0.83 (reptiles).
   Main conclusions: Traits determine most of the variation in population density across species, whereas environmental conditions explain the intraspecific variation across populations. Species traits, resource availability and climatic stability have a different influence on the population density of the four groups. These models can be used to predict the average species population density over large areas and be used to explore macroecological patterns and inform conservation analyses.

AB  - There is pressing need to anticipate the impacts of climate change on species and their functional contributions to ecosystem processes. Our objective is to evaluate the potential bee response to climate change considering (1) response traits-body size, nest site, and sociality; (2) contributions to ecosystem services (effect trait)-crop pollination; and (3) bees' size of current occurrence area. We analyzed 216 species occurring at the Carajas National Forest (Eastern Amazon, Para, Brazil), using two different algorithms and geographically explicit data. We modeled the current occurrence area of bees and projected their range shift under future climate change scenarios through species distribution modeling. We then tested the relationship of potential loss of occurrence area with bee traits and current occurrence area. Our projections show that 95% of bee species will face a decline in their total occurrence area, and only 15 to 4% will find climatically suitable habitats in Carajas. The results indicate an overall reduction in suitable areas for all traits analyzed. Bees presenting medium and restricted geographic distributions, as well as vital crop pollinators, will experience significantly higher losses in occurrence area. The potentially remaining species will be the wide-range habitat generalists, and the decline in crop-pollinator species will probably pose negative impact on pollination service. The north of Para presented the greatest future climatic suitability and can be considered for conservation purposes. These findings emphasize the detrimental effects on biodiversity and agricultural production by climate change and provide data to support conservation planning.

AB  - Although birds are among the best studied taxa, many of the globally threatened species lack the information required to fully assess their conservation status and needs. One such species is the Anjouan Scops Owl Otus capnodes which was presumed extinct until its rediscovery to science in 1992. Based on the limited extent and decline of the moist forests in the highlands of Anjouan in the Comoro Islands, a population size of only 100-200 pairs was estimated and the species was classified as 'Critically Endangered'. The current study is the first comprehensive survey ever conducted on this species, and aimed to establish the current distribution and population size. Point counts with distance sampling were conducted across the agroforestry and forest zones of Anjouan in both a dry and wet season. A niche suitability model predicted the species distribution to be wider than expected with owls observed as low as 300 m altitude and in highly modified agroforestry habitats. However, the encounter rate in natural relatively undisturbed forest was significantly greater than in other habitats. The wider than expected geographic range of O. capnodes supports a possible downlisting of this species on the IUCN Red List to 'Endangered'. Population size was found to be far greater than previously thought, at approximately 3,450 individual owls in the dry season and 5,450 in the wet season. These results show the importance of investing in robust surveys of poorly known and cryptic bird species, and provide up to date and important information for landscape scale conservation planning in the Comoros Islands.

AB  - 1. Assessing species richness (SR) and diversity along environmental gradients is important to see whether abiotic differences alter patterns of species distribution and composition.
   2. We examined distributions of odonate SR, average taxonomic distinctness (ATD) and functional diversity (FD) (using the Shannon Index on proportions of plant-dependent and non-dependent species) with elevation and slope provided from an exploratory survey along a transect in the Sierra de Coalcoman Mountains, Michoacan State, Mexico. Adults were collected along both sides of a 500 m stream segment for 6 h day(-1) site(-1) in each of eight sites, and these species lists were complemented by collecting mature larvae.
   3. Species richness and FD declined with elevation among windward sites, while ATD increased. Among leeward sites, SR peaked at mid-elevation, and there was no trend for FD or ATD with elevation. Leeward sites were similar in species composition, whereas windward sites were dissimilar. Slope was correlated with elevation among windward sites, and influenced most variables, but not among leeward sites. FD was negatively correlated with ATD among sites along both aspects. Mean values of SR, ATD and FD between aspects were similar.
   4. The Energy-Richness Hypothesis best explained the species distributions along the windward aspect. Local abiotic influences appeared more important in community assembly among windward sites. Among leeward sites, the potential for Mid-Domain and Rapoport Effects suggest interspecies interactions control community assembly; providing greater potential for expansion of species elevational ranges, and an increase in range expansion of alien and non-endemic species along this aspect.

AB  - 1. The Sunda gharial Tomistoma schlegelii is, with 2500-3000 remaining specimens, one of the least studied and at the same time most endangered crocodile species. Inhabiting peat swamps in Southeast Asia, threats affecting the species are mainly associated with habitat loss and illegal hunting.
   2. The effectiveness of the existing reserve network in Southeast Asia for the protection of the Sunda garial was assessed by combining spatially explicit habitat analyses derived from land cover information with species distribution modelling. Subsequently, possible improvements of the existing reserve network are derived from the habitat availability analyses.
   3. The results of the spatially explicit analyses indicate that suitable habitats for the Sunda gharial in Southeast Asia, i.e. peat swamps and riverine forests, are highly fragmented. Spatial coverage of remaining habitats with protected areas fulfilling IUCN standards generally varies among regions and is best in Indonesia. However, large, currently unprotected suitable areas remain in Sumatra. Establishment of 10 additional, already proposed reserves may improve the protection of major parts of the remaining suitable habitats of the Sunda gharial.
   4. According to the results of this study, the reserve network protecting this species could be significantly improved by expanding it to include seven national reserves not currently listed by the IUCN and an additional 10 reserves that have recently been proposed. Improvements and extensions of the existing reserve networks in Southeast Asia are pivotal to guarantee the long-term survival of the Sunda gharial. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The ever-increasing requirement of land for food production causes habitat loss and biodiversity decline. Human activities like agriculture are responsible for increases in global temperature, which may preclude species' survival if they cannot adapt to new climatic conditions or track suitable ones. Although negative impacts of climate change may act in synergy with agriculture when dispersion routes are blocked by croplands, agriculture is important to local economies. Therefore, the demand for land conversion causes conflict among stakeholders and decision makers. But can we benefit both economy and environment? Here we propose an approach to help find a balance between agriculture expansion and biodiversity conservation. We used suitable areas for agriculture to identify priority places to implement monocultures. We modeled species distributions to avoid sites with high conservation value and used species dispersal ability to minimize the distance between present-day and future suitable areas for species persistence. We used a decision-support tool to find a balance between economic development and species conservation, and we conclude that land use conversion is a threat for species persistence given that negative impacts caused by crops could be exacerbated by climate change. Unguided agriculture expansion into future species distribution areas is possible due to severe decreases in the areas for species to persist in the future. Facing this scenario, applying ecological knowledge to guide agriculture expansion is urgent if we want to spare species future distribution area in the Cerrado.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are among the most widely used strategy to protect marine ecosystems and are typically designed to protect specific habitats rather than a single and/or multiple species. To inform the conservation of species of conservation concern there is the need to assess whether existing and proposed MPA designs provide protection to these species. For this, information on species spatial distribution and exposure to threats is necessary. However, this information if often lacking, particularly for mobile migratory species, such as marine turtles. To highlight the importance of this information when designing MPAs and for assessments of their effectiveness, we identified high use areas of post-nesting hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in Brazil as a case study and assessed the effectiveness of Brazilian MPAs to protect important habitat for this group based on exposure to threats. Most (88%) of high use areas were found to be exposed to threats (78% to artisanal fishery and 76.7% to marine traffic), where 88.1% were not protected by MPAs, for which 86% are exposed to threats. This mismatch is driven by a lack of explicit conservation goals and targets for turtles in MPA management plans, limited spatial information on species' distribution and threats, and a mismatch in the scale of conservation initiatives. To inform future assessments and design of MPAs for species of conservation concern we suggest that managers: clearly state and make their goals and targets tangible, consider ecological scales instead of political boundaries, and use adaptative management as new information become available.

AB  - The karst landform in southern China is renowned for its high levels of species diversity and endemism. Globally, karst ecosystems are under threat from unsustainable anthropogenic disturbance and climate changes and are among the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. In this study, we used the typical karst endemic genus in southern China, Primulina Hance, as a model to identify areas within the karst landform with high diversity and to investigate congruence between phylogenetic and species-based measures of diversity. Using phylogenetic information and species distribution data, we measured geographical patterns of diversity with four metrics: species richness (SR), corrected weighted endemism (CWE), phylogenetic diversity (PD), and phylogenetic endemism (PE). Our results revealed a high spatial congruence among SR, PD, and PE, with hotspot areas identified in the Nanling Mountains (i.e., north Guangdong and northeast Guangxi) and southeast Yungui Plateau (i.e., north and southwest Guangxi), whereas the hotspots of CWE are comparatively uniform throughout the geographic extent. The categorical analysis of neo- and paleoendemism identified a pattern of mixed neo- and paleoendemism in numerous grid cells, suggesting that karst areas in southern China have acted as both "museums" and "cradles" of plant evolution. Conservation gap analysis of hotspots revealed that the majority of prioritized hotspots (>90%) of the genus are outside of protected areas, therefore indicating the limited effectiveness of national nature reserves for the karst flora. Overall, our results suggest that the karst flora merits more conservation attention and SR can be an effective surrogate to capture PD in conservation planning.

AB  - Background. This study investigates orbitally-forced range dynamics at a regional scale by exploring the evolutionary history of Nymania capensis (Meliaceae) across the deeply incised landscapes of the subescarpment coastal lowlands of South Africa; a region that is home to three biodiversity hotspots (Succulent Karoo, Fynbos, and MaputalandPondoland-Albany hotspots).
   Methods. A range of methods are used including: multilocus phylogeography (chloroplast and high- and low-copy nuclear DNA), molecular dating and species distribution modelling (SDM).
   Results. The results support an 'evolutionarily distinct catchment' hypothesis where: (1) different catchments contain genetically distinct lineages, (2) limited genetic structuring was detected within basins whilst high structuring was detected between basins, and (3) within primary catchment populations display a high degree of genealogical lineage sorting. In addition, the results support,la glacial refugia hypothesis as: (a) the timing of chloroplast lineage diversification is restricted to the Pleistocene in a landscape that has been relatively unchanged since the late Pliocene, and (b) the projected LGIVI distribution of suitable climate for N. capensis suggest fragmentation into refugia that correspond to the current phylogeographic populations.
   Discussion. This study highlights the interaction of topography and subtle Pleistocene climate variations as drivers limiting both seed and pollen flow along these lowlands. This lends support to the region's large-scale conservation planning efforts, which used catchments as foundational units for conservation as these are likely to be evolutionarily significant units.

AB  - Angel sharks are among the most threatened species of sharks globally. Twenty-two species have been identified globally so far, with three species being present in the Mediterranean Sea: Squatina aculeata, Squatina oculata, and Squatina squatina. The Mediterranean populations of all three species have been assessed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to the steep decline of their populations as a result of their historical and current overexploitation by demersal fisheries. Therefore, currently there is an ongoing increasing effort for advancing the conservation of the species in the basin. Recently, in the context of the Regional Action Plan for Mediterranean Angel Sharks, the Aegean Sea and Crete have been identified as critical areas for all three species. This study provides the first predictive distribution map of the three angel shark species in the basin, while critical areas for the conservation of the species were identified through a systematic spatial conservation planning analysis. Our analysis revealed low overlapping between the existing MPA network and critical areas for the distribution of the species primarily in Greece and then Turkey, while 20% of the critical areas for the distribution of the species overlaps with Fisheries Restricted Areas of the region. This highlights the need for creating MPAs focusing on shark conservation within the Mediterranean that are currently completely absent. In addition, we provide policy recommendations that can secure better protection of angel sharks through the enforcement of the current legislations and the engagement of all relevant stakeholders.

AB  - Species distribution data are essential to understanding and protecting biodiversity against current human threats. However, biodiversity knowledge is unevenly distributed geographically and needs to be evaluated to target deficient knowledge locations and support conservation planning. In this study, we intend to assess the inventory completeness of the vascular epiphytes from the Atlantic Forest, in addition to: comparing the sampling effort between (i) phytophysiognomies, (ii) epiphyte taxa, and quantifying (iii) spatial and (iv) environmental biases. We used the average of the last 10% of Species Accumulation Curves (SAC) as the inventory completeness and quantified their spatial biases using Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) models. We evaluated the environmental biases using the Mann-Whitney U test. We found that most epiphyte inventories in the Atlantic Forest are undersampled, with well-sampled inventories concentrated on the southeastern coast; thus, Ombrophilous forests are better sampled than other phytophysiognomies. These well-sampled inventories are spatially biased mainly in large forest cover, protected and low agricultural coverage areas. In addition, epiphytes were more collected in regions environmentally associated with high diversity, such as areas with low temperature, high rainfall and altitudes. More conspicuous and richer groups had the highest sampling coverage, but the lowest effort when compared to poor groups. In order to reduce the gaps, we suggest that future inventories focus on the continental portion of the Atlantic Forest, since these areas are already highly threatened by land-use and have large Wallacean shortfalls for all epiphyte taxa. Therefore, enabling future researchers to propose efficient conservation actions in these priority areas.

AB  - Observed species richness (OSR) is a widely used and well-studied biodiversity metric. However, non-observed species in favorable ecosystems are also relevant. Two metrics that include observed and potential species were recently defined: potential biodiversity (hereafter potential species richness-PSR) and geometric mean of favorabilities (GMF). We used these metrics to evaluate the national park network of mainland Spain at two time periods (2002 and 2015), using terrestrial mammals on a UTM 100-km(2) grid. PSR and GMF are based on the favorability function, a species distribution model that assesses how favorable an area is for the presence of a species, over and above its prevalence in the study area. For each park and for the whole network, we calculated the mean and sum of OSR, PSR, and GMF in each time period, as well as changes between periods. OSR and PSR were higher inside than outside the park network in both time periods. Thus, although the network covers a very small proportion of the country, it performs well for the representation of mammal species and their favorable areas. However, mean PSR was lower in 2015 than in 2002 inside the national park network, whereas the opposite was the case outside the network. Mountainous Parks generally not only concentrated highly favorable areas for mammals, but they also showed less favorable areas in 2015 compared to 2002, although the reduction was moderate to low. This is a result to consider for future analyses because if the tendency increases, it may have consequences for the conservation of mammals and for the adequacy of the national park network.

AB  - Detailed information on potentially suitable habitats and forecasted alterations thereof under climate change scenarios are critical for the conservation planning of endangered taxa, in particular those with small distribution ranges. The Huu Lien Tiger Gecko, Goniurosaurus huuliensis, is a is a micro-endemic species in northern Vietnam. The species is listed in the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered and in CITES Appendix II due to habitat loss and overexploitation for the international pet trade. Climate change has been globally acknowledged to impact on many species and it likely has negative influences on G. huuliensis. In this study, an ensemble modeling technique is employed, trained with climate and vegetation cover conditions, to identify the contemporary potential distribution of this species and assess its alterations under different climate change scenarios. Our predictions suggest that the current potential distribution of G. huuliensis mostly covers the known sites of occurrence and their surroundings. These areas will narrow significantly and/or shift towards higher latitudes under novel climate conditions as can be expected according to future IPCC scenarios. To safe-guard in-situ populations of G. huuliensis in the context of the potentially severe impacts, we provide a core refugia map that identifies key regions for priority conservation measures, including Lang Son Province and small sites in Bac Giang and Thai Nguyen Provinces, northern Vietnam. We highly recommend that the Huu Lien Nature Reserve be selected as a "centre" to kick-off conservation actions for the target species.

AB  - Reliable species distribution data are important for valid scientific conclusions and effective conservation planning. Mismatch between survey timing and animal behaviors that influence detection may result in false absences that can lead to poorly informed management decisions. Birds exhibit a diversity of diel vocalization patterns, but many large-scale multispecies surveys are based on the songbird dawn chorus, indicating the potential for bias to detect birds with other diel vocalization patterns. In this study, we quantified bias in point counts and morning acoustic recordings to measure the number of occupied sites detected for a set of dawn chorusing birds (songbirds) and irregularly vocalizing wetland birds (waterfowl) relative to estimates obtained from 10-min acoustic recordings conducted hourly throughout 24-h periods for three consecutive days. Furthermore, we investigated which revisitation schedule-same day or different day sampling, as well as increased sampling effort-best minimized false-negative detections for songbirds and waterfowl. Morning surveys significantly underestimated the number of occupied sites for 10 of 13 species. No differences were found between same-day and between-day revisitation schedules with identical sampling effort, regardless of whether birds exhibited a dawn chorus or irregular vocalization patterns. Detection improved with increased sampling effort. Subsampled recordings captured the majority of occupied sites for songbirds (up to 87% of occupied sites detected), but less so for waterfowl (up to 60% of occupied sites detected). Accurate detection for irregularly vocalizing species such as waterfowl will require more intensive sampling effort (likely throughout 24-h periods) when using acoustic recordings.

AB  - Aim Chorological relationships describe the patterns of distributional overlap among species. In addition to revealing biogeographical structure, the resulting clusters of species with similar geographical distributions can serve as natural units in conservation planning. Here, we assess the extent to which temporal, methodological and taxonomical differences in the source of species distribution data can affect the relationships that are found. Location Western Europe. Methods We used two data sets the Atlas of European mammals and polygon range maps from the IUCN Global Mammal Assessment both as presenceabsence data for UTM 50 km x 50 km squares. We performed pairwise comparisons among 156 species for each data set to build matrices of the similarity in distribution across species, using both Jaccards and Baroni-Urbani & Busers indices. We then compared these similarity matrices (chorological relationships), as well as the species richness and occurrence patterns from the two data sets. Results As expected, range maps increased both the mean prevalence per species and mean species richness per grid cell in comparison to atlas data, reflecting the general view that these data types respectively over- and underestimate species occurrence. However, species richness and occurrence patterns in atlas and range map data were positively associated and, most importantly, the chorological relationships underlying the two data sets were highly similar. Main conclusions Despite many methodological, temporal and taxonomical differences between atlas data and range maps, the chorological relationships encountered between species were similar for both data sets. Chorological analyses can thus be robust to the data source used and provide a solid basis for analytical biogeographical studies, even over broad spatial scales.

AB  - The Natura 2000 (N2k) is a network of protected areas, established to implement the Birds and the Habitats Directives of the European Union (EU) with the goal of conservation irrespective of national boundaries. We provide the first assessment of the whole terrestrial N2k using spatial prioritizations, and high-resolution vertebrate species distribution data. First, we quantified species' representation in the network, and compared it against outcomes of hypothetical optimal planning scenarios at the EU, member state, and biogeographical levels. Second, we examined the spatial configuration of N2k sites and same-sized hypothetical top priority sites based on the three planning scenarios. We found that N2k covered all vertebrate directive species, and the coverage was significantly better than with a random allocation of sites. We observed substantial differences in representation between taxa, followed by the fact that N2k succeeded better in covering threatened and directive species than non-directive species. The current species representation in N2k was closer to optimal allocations done at member states' or biogeographical levels than the EU-wide allocation. Furthermore, the N2k sites overlapped more with the EU-wide allocation and they were more evenly distributed across the EU compared to sites in all hypothetical optimal allocations. Finally, we found that the biogeographical scenario covered well the ranges of habitats directive species, following the biogeographical approach taken by the EU in the Habitats Directive. Our results show that despite N2k being moderately successful, there is substantial effectiveness to be gained from member state collaboration via potential expansions or complementary conservation policies.

AB  - Information regarding the oceanic environment is crucial for determining species distributions and their habitat preferences. However, in studies on crustaceans, especially swimming crabs, such information remains poorly utilized, and its effects on crab communities in the Taiwan Strait (TS) has not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between the catch rates of three swimming crab species and environmental factors in the TS. We fitted generalized additive models (GAMs) to logbooks and voyage data recorder data from Taiwanese crab vessels (2011-2015), developed a species distribution model, and predicted catch rates for these three swimming crab species based on the GAM output. The chlorophyll-a(Chl-a) concentration was related to the high catch rates ofChrybdis feriatusandPortunus sanguinolentus, whereas bottom temperature (BT) was related to high catch rates ofPortunus pelagicus. The variance percentages for each crab species indicated that high catch rates ofC. feriatusandP. sanguinolentusoccurred in a Chl-aconcentration > 0.5 mg/m(3), whereasP. pelagicuscatch rates exhibited negative correlations with BTs > 25 degrees C. The model predicted high catch rates ofC. feriatusin the north of the TS during autumn and winter, whereasP. pelagicuswas observed to the south during summer and autumn.P. sanguinolentuswas predicted to be widely distributed around the TS and distributed further to the northern area during autumn and winter. These findings revealed that each species responds to spatiotemporal environmental variations. Understanding the distributions and habitats of these three crabs is vital in fisheries resource management and conservation planning.

AB  - Islands are of high interest for conservationists, due to their great biodiversity within discrete territories. Nonetheless, several mechanisms of plant diversity patterns are unknown, especially for continental islands. In this paper, we explored how endemic and alien vascular plant species richness and the compositional dissimilarity of small Mediterranean continental islands vary according to factors related to human activities, geography/landscape, and climate. Actions for endemic plant conservation were also prioritised according to both endemic and alien components. To this aim, data of endemic and alien plant species for forty islands of Sardinia were considered. Species-area residuals, which express the actual species composition free of area-effects, were modelled using 19 variables related to anthropogenic, geographic/landscape and climatic domains (group of factors). The geographic/landscape domain appeared to be important for both endemic and alien species richness and compositional dissimilarity, while the climatic one was especially relevant for alien species richness. The anthropogenic domain was mostly important for the compositional dissimilarity of aliens and for the endemic species richness. Actions for endemic plant conservation were of high priority for 14 islands; 11 of which are located off the northwest coast of Sardinia. Our research confirms that the Mediterranean small islands of Sardinia are plant endemism hotspots prone to alien invasion. Our findings suggest that removing anthropogenic disturbances is not sufficient to prevent plant invasions. Other factors related to climatic and geographic/landscape domains are as or more important in determining endemic and alien plant composition.

AB  - Plant endemism in the European Alps is clustered into particular geographic areas. Two contrasted and non exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain these hotspots of endemism: (i) those areas were glacial refugia, where endemism reflects survival-recolonisation dynamics since the onset of Pleistocene glaciations, (ii) those are high elevation mountain areas, where endemism was fostered by local speciation events due to geographic isolation and harsh environmental niches, or by low dispersal ability of inhabiting species.
   Here, we quantitatively compared these two hypotheses using data of species distribution in the European Alps (IntraBioDiv database), species phylogenetic relationships, and species ecological and biological characteristics. We developed a spatially and phylogenetically explicit modeling framework to analyze spatial patterns of endemism and the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages. Moreover, we analyzed interrelations between species trait syndromes and endemism.
   We found that high endemism occurrs in potential glacial refugia, but only those on calcareous bedrock, and also in areas with high elevation. Plant assemblages in calcareous refugia showed phylogenetic overdispersion - a signature of non-selective conservation forces, whereas those located in high mountain areas showed phylogenetic clustering -a signature of recent diversification and environmental filtering. Endemic species were either stress-tolerant, poorly dispersing species, or high elevation specialists with a wide distribution within the European Alps.
   While both calcareous refugia and high-elevation hotspots harbour a large portion of plant endemism in the European Alps, the species they host have substantially different characteristics. Our results suggest that hotspots of endemism in calcareous refugia are more important for nature conservation planning, as they host many range restricted endemic species and rather isolated evolutionary lineages.'

AB  - Clinus cottoides is a fish endemic to the coast of South Africa, predominantly inhabiting rock pools. All South African clinids are viviparous, but probably breed throughout the year; as such, their dispersal may be limited, unlike species with pelagic larval stages. We analysed 343 fish from 14 localities on the west, south and east coasts using two mitochondrial genes and the second intron of the S7 ribosomal gene. Mitochondrial DNA analyses recovered significant genetic differentiation between fish populations from the east coast and other sampling locations, with a second break found between Gansbaai and Cape Agulhas on the south coast. Nuclear DNA recovered shallower, but significant, levels of population structure. Coalescent analyses suggested remarkably asymmetrical gene flow between sampling locations, suggesting that the cold Atlantic Benguela Current and Indian Ocean Agulhas counter-current play important roles in facilitating dispersal. There was no gene flow between the east coast and the other sites, suggesting that these populations are effectively isolated. Divergence times between them were estimated to at least 68 000 years. Neutrality tests and mismatch distributions suggest recent population expansions, with the exception of peripheral western and eastern populations (possibly a consequence of environmental extremes at the edge of the species distribution). Analyses of the current South African marine protected areas network show that it is not connected and that De Hoop, one of South Africa's largest marine reserves, appears to be an important source population of recruits to both the south and southwest coasts.

AB  - Climate change and biological invasions are rapidly reshuffling species distribution, restructuring the biological communities of many ecosystems worldwide. Tracking these transformations in the marine environment is crucial, but our understanding of climate change effects and invasive species dynamics is often hampered by the practical challenge of surveying large geographical areas. Here, we focus on the Mediterranean Sea, a hot spot for climate change and biological invasions to investigate recent spatiotemporal changes in fish abundances and distribution. To this end, we accessed the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of small-scale and recreational fishers, reconstructing the dynamics of fish perceived as "new" or increasing in different fishing areas. Over 500 fishers across 95 locations and nine different countries were interviewed, and semiquantitative information on yearly changes in species abundance was collected. Overall, 75 species were mentioned by the respondents, mostly warm-adapted species of both native and exotic origin. Respondents belonging to the same biogeographic sectors described coherent spatial and temporal patterns, and gradients along latitudinal and longitudinal axes were revealed. This information provides a more complete understanding of the shifting distribution of Mediterranean fishes and it also demonstrates that adequately structured LEK methodology might be applied successfully beyond the local scale, across national borders and jurisdictions. Acknowledging this potential through macroregional coordination could pave the way for future large-scale aggregations of individual observations, increasing our potential for integrated monitoring and conservation planning at the regional or even global level. This might help local communities to better understand, manage, and adapt to the ongoing biotic transformations driven by climate change and biological invaders.

AB  - Cedrela balansae C.DC. is a native tree species in Argentina, severely exploited for its timber features. We performed a molecular analysis to understand the genetic diversity and its distribution in eight remaining populations, which are distributed within the species' range in the Argentine Yungas Rainforest. We used two molecular markers: (i) seven SSRs, selected from forty-five SSRs developed for phylogenetically close species belonging to the Meliaceae family and (ii) 382 polymorphic AFLPs. The He was 0.643 and 0.222 for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively. The moderate levels of genetic diversity were related to the limited size of the species' distribution area, the latitudinal position of populations, the impacts of logging and the species' spatial distribution pattern. Genetic differentiation among populations was low for both markers (4.9% and 4.1% for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively). Four genetic clusters homogeneously distributed were distinguished. These observations may relate to the considerable historical gene flow measured (3.71 and 4.47 for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively). To safeguard the currently existing genetic base in the species, we identify four priority populations for conservation. To date only one of these is located in a protected area. Therefore, it is urgent to apply additional conservation measures for the remaining populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Species are predicted to shift their geographic range with climate change, which increases the need for good conservation planning and management practices. Not only may climate change increase the number of invasive species in parts of the world, it may also lead to some species becoming invasive under new, more preferable, climatic conditions. This study investigates whether climate change may enhance the spread of alien species by another alien species. I use the interaction between the alien slender-billed nutcracker and alien, potentially invasive, stone pines as a case-study and specifically aim to quantify to which extent the potential spread of stone pine species in Sweden in a warming climate is augmented by its dispersal agent: the slender-billed nutcracker. I found that accounting for the future climatic niche of the slender-billed nutcracker, and therefore for its potential presence, significantly augmented the increase of the predicted future range of the stone pines under climate change. This result does not only stress the importance of accounting for species interactions when assessing the impact of climate change on species' future geographic ranges, it also stresses the need for nature conservationists and managers to incorporate species interactions and climate change when designing appropriate plans with regard to invasive species. Although the implications of the predicted future spread of the slender-billed nutcracker might be limited, since the very similar thick-billed nutcracker is native to Sweden, the effects of the stone pines should not be neglected. They are currently classified as potentially invasive in parts of the Nordic region.

AB  - The success of marine spatial management and, in particular, the zonation of marine protected areas (MPAs), largely depends on the good understanding of species' distribution and habitat preferences. Yet, detailed knowledge of fish abundance is often reduced to a few sampled locations and a reliable prediction of this information across broader geographical areas is of major relevance. Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to describe species-environment relationships and identify environmental parameters that determine the abundance or presence-absence of 11 reef fishes with contrasting life histories in shallow habitats of the Azores islands, Northeast Atlantic. Predictive models were mapped and visualised in a geographic information system (GIS) and areas with potential single or multi-species habitat hotspots were identified. Schooling, pelagic species typically required presence-absence models, whereas abundance models performed well for benthic species. Depth and distance to sediment significantly described the distribution for nearly all species, whereas the influence of exposure to swell or currents and slope of the seafloor depended on their trophic ecology. Potential presence of single species was widespread across the study area but much reduced for multiple species. There were no habitats shared by high abundances of all species in a given trophic group, and areas shared by minimal abundances were smaller than expected. Potential habitat hotspots should be considered as priority sites for conservation, but were only partially included in the existing MPA network. These findings highlight the potential of this methodology to support scientifically sound conservation planning, including but not restricted to fragmented and constrained habitats, such as those of oceanic archipelagos.

AB  - Climate change has been influencing bird species in different ways. Some documented changes include reduction in geographic range, decline in abundance and changes in the seasonality of migratory bird species in spring after overwintering in the tropics. We undertook a study on two species of high-elevation dependant, restricted-range flycatchers: Black-and orange Flycatcher (BOF) Ficedula nigrorufa (Jerdon, 1839) and Nilgiri Flycatcher (NIF) Eumyias albicaudatus (Jerdon, 1840), to determine how they respond to the predicted climate change scenarios. We used 194 and 300 independent occurrence points for BOF and NIF to develop climate models and understand the species responses to climate change scenarios using MaxEnt algorithm. We also used isothermality, mean temperature of coldest quarter and slope for developing the BOF model. For NIF, we used isothermality, mean temperature of coldest quarter, precipitation of driest month, precipitation of warmest quarter, slope and enhanced vegetation index. The mean temperature of coldest quarter (BIO 11) was the most crucial variable influencing climate suitability for both the species. The model predicted the current extent of occurrence of 6532 sq. km as suitable for BOF and 12,707 sq. km for NIF, within their ranges. However, only 27% and 24% of the existing suitable area of BOF and NIF respectively, falls within the protected area network in the Western Ghats. Future predictions suggest suitable area loss to the tune of 20-31% for BOF and 36-46% for NIF by 2050.

AB  - Estimating relationships between landscape variables and the presence of a species via occupancy modeling is common practice for many animal species. However, estimating these relationships can be difficult for specie: where availability for detection is driven by factors that match the traditional primary sampling period. WW present a new hierarchical formulation of the occupancy model to estimate these relationships in the presence o among-year variation in availability for detection for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) There were large swings in apparent annual proportion of area occupied ranging from 0.19 to 0.66, with year-to year changes in the apparent annual proportion ranging from - 25.7% to 230.2%. The model estimated the true latent proportion of area occupied was 0.57 (95% Cr.I. 0.51-0.631). The predictive raster surface developer from the novel model formulation validated well using an independent data set (Pearson's r = 0.948), witl radio-telemetered desert tortoises spending disproportionately more time in higher predicted probability o occurrence portions of the study area. The coefficients from the model, and more specifically the occupance probability predictive raster surface developed from them, can be used by land managers to guide future surve3 efforts and to spatially prioritize restoration actions across a 35,000 ha conservation reserve. In general, ac knowledging the challenge of confounding availability for detection with apparent annual occupancy and using the modeling framework presented here can be used to determine fundamental relationships between landscape configuration and latent occupancy for a variety of heretofore unaddressed species.

AB  - This synthesis analyses the use and limitations of the distributional atlases data for applied nature conservation studies. From the gaps and opportunities observed in France, we suggest a set of practical and scientific recommendations in order to strengthen their use in systematic conservation planning for terrestrial biodiversity (protected networks, green infrastructure and land settlement). The two main advices are to adopt an iterative approach between field survey and data analysis, and the selection of the species groups to inventory. The iterative process consists of regularly using available valid data to identify spatial and taxonomic gaps in the inventory, to model the potential distribution of each species and to estimate their ecological niche. During the distribution inventory project, this information can enable the sorting of new data according to their plausibility (data validation process) and should be used to identify priority areas for new field surveys. As scientific literature concludes that there is low consistency of biodiversity congruence relationship, we suggest increasing taxonomic representation in new atlases projects in order to provide a more complete view of species distribution for nature conservation initiatives. Ideally, the species groups should be rich in restricted range and low mobility species, or rich in habitat specialist species or contain species playing a recognized role in ecosystem functioning. Taking into account practical and technical criteria, a list of taxa is proposed for new distribution atlases. This proposal would cover about 20 % of known terrestrial species compared to current 5 %, with more effort on invertebrates, plants and fungi.

AB  - The effects of anthropogenic habitat modification are evident on tropical Pacific islands where forests have been extensively converted to plantations of Coconut Palm (Cocos nucifera). We evaluated resource selection in the critically endangered Tuamotu Kingfisher (Todiramphus gambieri gertrudae), which is confined to a single population on the low-elevation island of Niau Atoll in French Polynesia. Our analyses indicate that resources associated with foraging underlie space use and habitat selection of Tuamotu Kingfishers at multiple spatial scales. At the island scale, the occurrence of the species was best predicted by habitat features associated with foraging opportunities, including agricultural coconut forest with open understory, hunting perches, and exposed ground. Conversely, the species' distribution was negatively associated with undisturbed vegetation, including primary feo forest and fallow coconut plantation. At the home-range scale, utilization distributions of radiomarked Tuamotu Kingfishers also indicated that birds selected agricultural coconut forest and least preferred native feo forest. Observations further indicated that foraging birds selected coconut plantations managed with prescribed burning for hunting. The Tuamotu Kingfisher is a rare example of a threatened tropical species that likely benefits from agricultural management, and our findings provide support for conservation strategies based on establishing rescue populations on other islands with coconut plantations. We suggest that incorporating agricultural coconut forests into conservation planning could help prevent the extinction of several kingfisher species that historically relied on the natural broadleaf habitats that are now almost entirely absent from insular Pacific Oceania.

AB  - Predictive modelling of species' distributions has been successfully applied in conservation ecology, but effective conservation requires predictive and accurate models. The combination of different scales to build habitat models might improve their predictive ability and hence their usefulness for conservation, but this approach has rarely been evaluated. We developed habitat-occupancy models combining scales from nest-site to landscape for a key population at the northwestern edge of the distribution of the globally endangered Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus). We used generalised linear models (GLM) and an information-theoretic approach to identify the best combination of scales and resolutions for explaining occurrence. Those models that combined nest-site and landscape scales improved the predictive ability compared with the scale-specific ones. The best combined model had a very high predictive ability when used against an independent dataset (92% correct classifications). Egyptian vultures preferred to nest in caves with vegetation at the entrance that were situated at the base of long cliffs, provided that these cliffs are embedded within low-lying, heterogeneous areas with little topographic irregularity and with little human disturbance. The density of sheep around the nest positively influenced Egyptian Vulture presence. Conservation of the studied population should focus on minimising human disturbance and on promoting sustainable development through conservation of traditional pastoralism. Our findings highlight the importance of developing region-specific multiscale models in order to design effective conservation strategies. The approach described here may be applied similarly in other Populations and species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rare plant species of the tropical forests in the Yucatan Peninsula have not been evaluated as a group. We selected a set of rare woody plant species (RWPS) and we estimated rare species richness by using the species distribution maps of each species. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between rare species richness and Natural Protected Areas (NPA's) of the Peninsula. We identified 3 levels of rarity-low, medium and high-in terms of the species frequency, habitat specificity and range of distribution of the selected species. We also, identified 4 regions with a greater number of rare species. All the regions included species with the lowest level of rarity, 3 regions included species with the medium level and only one region contained extremely rare woody species (high level). This last region was unprotected. Number of RWPS was positively associated with the area of NPA's. This study represents the first effort for identifying the RWPS of the Peninsula, estimating patterns of distribution of rare species richness and evaluating the current protection status of such species. Our results suggest that the current NPA's may preserve the richness of RWPS of the low and medium levels of rarity, but not that of the rarest woody species. Therefore, it is a priority to establish a protected area in the region that could harbor the highest richness of the rarest species, which are particularly vulnerable to extinction.

AB  - As anthropogenic pressure on the landscape increases, invasive alien species (IAS) pose a growing threat to areas designed to protect high biodiversity habitats. In order to assess the present danger of IAS spread, we examined 23 Czech sites of community importance (SCI) within Natura 2000 protected areas (PA) over 2015 and mapped the occurrence of four IAS: Solidago spp. (goldenrod), Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam), Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) and Fallopia spp. (Japanese knotweed). The model areas were divided into five monitoring zones, graded by conservation importance and habitat disturbance level (core area [A], broader core area [B], semi-natural habitat [C], anthropogenically affected habitat [D], anthropogenically degraded habitat [E]). Despite a high number of IAS occurrences (3222 localities), habitats of European importance (zone A) showed a relatively low level of invasion (< 0.3% total area). Highest IAS occurrence number was in SCI border areas and disturbed habitats (zones C and E). There was a significant positive correlation between level of invasion inside and outside SCIs, related to human activities such as logging and urbanisation. A strong effect for watercourse vicinity was noted for the occurrence of I. glandulifera and Fallopia spp.; but not for H. mantegazzianum and Solidago spp. A stratified management approach, employing zones delimitation to assess what threat pose IAS to the PA objects of conservation, can be useful to prioritize control measures in IAS local action plans.

AB  - Background and aims: Acrostichum danaeifolium is a widely distributed species in the Neotropics, growing in freshwater or saltwater habitats. In Argentina and Paraguay are scarce records cited by previous papers. The objective of this work is to study A. danaeifolium for Argentina and Paraguay, emphasizing the review of its distribution and the history of the botanical collections of the species.
   M&M: Specimens deposited in national and international herbaria and collected during monitoring tasks in the Rio Pilcomayo National Park (Formosa, Argentina) were studied. Also, records were consulted in the GBIF and iNaturalist databases. The analysis of the diagnostic characters was carried out under a stereoscopic magnifying glass.
   Results and Conclusions: The diagnostic characters of A. danaeifolium are illustrated, and a map of the species distribution in Argentina and Paraguay is provided. We corroborate that the A. danaeifolium populations registered to date for both countries are scarce and are restricted to the Chaco Oriental district, where they grow associated with floodplains such as river banks and freshwater lagoons. The specimens found in the Rio Pilcomayo National Park represent the first record of the species in a protected area, the first record in Formosa province, the most boreal record of Argentina and the first collection in the country in 70 years. Due to the intense deforestation recorded in the Chaco Oriental district in recent decades, the RPNP takes on special relevance for the conservation of the species.

AB  - Many freshwater non-indigenous species (NISs) are stocked for recreational fishing, in some cases illegally in protected areas. In this study, fish communities were monitored using environmental DNA, electrofishing and anglers' catches as the sources of samples in a mountainous Biosphere Reserve in Asturias (northern Spain), where stocking is forbidden. Three NISs have been introduced illegally in the protected area and have shown increasing populations in the last two decades. Two species used as fishing bait, Squalius carolitertii (chub) and Phoxinus phoxinus (minnow), are expanding in running waters. Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) was also detected and is likely to have been introduced for angling or from fish farm escapes. The results suggest that sustained illegal stocking contributed to the increase of the three NISs. In contrast, Salmo trutta (brown trout) of northern European lineages, identified from *90 alleles at the LDH-C1 locus, and formerly legally stocked for angling, is decreasing, most likely as a result of climate change. Climate change could also contribute to the expansion of the two non-indigenous cyprinids to colder upstream areas. Through the application of a social survey, it was found that unlike other population groups, anglers in the region significantly preferred stocking over environmental improvement for the management of fish populations. The results obtained suggest that raising the awareness of anglers about the importance of safeguarding native fish species could help to prevent the spread of NISs in protected areas.

AB  - Understanding species distribution and behavior is essential for conservation programs of migratory species with recovering populations. The critically endangered Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) was heavily exploited during the whaling era. Because of their low numbers, highly migratory behavior, and occurrence in remote areas, their distribution and range are not fully understood, particularly in the southwest Pacific Ocean. This is the first Antarctic blue whale study covering the southwest Pacific Ocean region from temperate to tropical waters (32 degrees S to 15 degrees S). Passive acoustic data were recorded between 2010 and 2011 across the southwest Pacific (SWPO) and southeast Indian (SEIO) oceans. We detected Antarctic blue whale calls in previously undocumented SWPO locations off eastern Australia (32 degrees S, 152 degrees E) and within the Lau Basin (20 degrees S, 176 degrees W and 15 degrees S, 173 degrees W), and SEIO off northwest Australia (19 degrees S, 115 degrees E).In temperate waters, adjacent ocean basins had similar seasonal occurrence, in that calling Antarctic blue whales were present for long periods, almost year round in some areas. In northern tropical waters, calling whales were mostly present during the austral winter. Clarifying the occurrence and distribution of critically endangered species is fundamental for monitoring population recovery, marine protected area planning, and in mitigating anthropogenic threats.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a powerful tool for conserving marine biodiversity when designed using ecological information and conservation goals and targets. Dugongs (Dugong dugon) were not an explicit target in the design of the network of MPAs in New Caledonia, despite being one of the region's World Heritage values. Our study retrospectively assessed the capacity of the New Caledonia MPA network to protect dugongs from anthropogenic threats. We developed a spatially explicit model of dugong distribution and relative density based on information collected from 10 years of aerial surveys. We quantified the amount of overlap between areas supporting high densities of dugongs and MPAs. We found that most of the important dugong habitats of New Caledonia had a low coverage of MPAs that provide high levels of restriction on anthropogenic activities. We identified several important dugong habitats along the west and the north-east coast that were not covered by MPAs and should be a priority for future management. The spatial mismatch between MPAs and dugongs was likely caused by weaknesses in the planning process, including the: (1) lack of explicit conservation goals and targets; (2) omission of spatial information on species' distribution; (3) mismatch of spatial scales; (4) cost considerations; and (5) incorrect application of the IUCN protected area categories. We provide guidance on how these shortcomings can be avoided for marine species of conservation concern in New Caledonia and other regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary The mara is a large endemic rodent, which major threats are habitat loss, hunting, and overgrazing. Maras live in arid and semiarid areas of Argentina. We studied the influence of environment variables and tourist activity on mara's habitat use. We used different ecological approaches, from plant communities to floristic composition, in order to know at which level we can better detect the tourism effects on mara's habitat use. We counted feces of maras as a habitat use index and recorded environmental variables along 80 samples in two plant communities, near and away-from the tourist circuit. To evaluate habitat use, we made statistical models using plant communities, plant strata, cover of trees, shrubs, and grasses, and plant species abundance as explaining factors. We detected the tourism effects on habitat use utilizing cover of trees, shrubs, and grasses, and cover of more abundant plant species, but not plant communities and plant strata, as explicative factors. Maras also selected areas with low bare soil with few pebbles on it. We found complex interactions between abiotic, biotic, and anthropic variables, studying maras' preferred places near tourism activities, which they probably perceive as safer from predators. The mara is a large endemic rodent, which presents a marked decline in its populations, mainly because of habitat loss, hunting, and overgrazing. The Ischigualasto Provincial Park is a hyper-arid protected area at the Monte Desert of Argentina with an overall low plant cover. Our objective was to determine the influence of environmental variables and tourist activities on mara's habitat use. We used different biological levels to explain it, from plant community to floristic composition, in order to know at which level we can better detect the effects of tourist activities. We registered fresh feces and habitat variables along 80 transects in two communities, near and far away from the tourist circuit. To evaluate habitat use, we fitted models at different biological levels: plant community, plant strata, plant biological forms, and floristic composition. At the community and plant strata levels, we could not detect any tourism effects on habitat use. However, we detected effects of tourist activities on mara's habitat use at the plant strata and floristic composition levels. Maras also selected areas with a low proportion of both bare soil and pebbles cover. We found complex interactions between abiotic, biotic variables and tourism, studying mara's places near tourism activities, probably because they perceive those places as predator-safe areas.

AB  - Simple Summary The broad adoption of camera traps in wildlife monitoring leads to a better understanding of the distribution and activity patterns of wild animals. In this study, two endangered wild animals distributed in the Gongga Mountain National Nature Reserve, the tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor), were investigated for habitat suitability and rhythm activity patterns based on 9-year (2012-2021) camera-trap data. The results revealed that the suitable range of the major environmental factors and the distribution range of tufted deer in the reserve were greater than those of sambar. The daily activity peaks in tufted deer and sambar were both at dusk and dawn, but sambar stayed active during the evening. Clarifying the distribution pattern and overlapping relationship of sympatric relative species in the spatio-temporal niche is of great significance to the basic theory of community ecology and integrated management of multi-species habitats in the same landscape. In this study, based on a 9-year dataset (2012-2021) from 493 camera-trap sites in the Gongga Mountain National Nature Reserve, we analyzed the habitat distributions and activity patterns of tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor). (1) Combined with 235 and 153 valid presence sites of tufted deer and sambar, the MaxEnt model was used to analyze the distribution of the two species based on 11 ecological factors. The distribution areas of the two species were 1038.40 km(2) and 692.67 km(2), respectively, with an overlapping area of 656.67 km(2). Additionally, the overlap indexes Schoener's D (D) and Hellinger's-based I (I) were 0.703 and 0.930, respectively. (2) Based on 10,437 and 5203 independent captures of tufted deer and sambar, their daily activity rhythms were calculated by using the kernel density estimation. The results showed that the daily activity peak in the two species appeared at dawn and dusk; however, the activity peak in tufted deer at dawn and dusk was later and earlier than sambar, respectively. Our findings revealed the spatio-temporal niche relationship between tufted deer and sambar, contributing to a further understanding of the coexistence mechanism and providing scientific information for effective wild animal conservation in the reserve and other areas in the southeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - The predictive modeling of plant species distribution has wide applications in vegetation studies. This study attempts to assess three modeling approaches to predict the plant distribution in the dry (precipitation 128-275 mm) mountainous (altitude 1129-2260 m a.s.l.) scrub vegetation on the example of the rangelands of northeastern Semnan, Iran. The vegetation of the study area belongs to the communities of Artemisia, Astralagus, Eurotia and other scrub species. The main objective of this study is to compare the predictive ability of three habitat models, and to find the most effective environmental factors for predicting the plant species occurrence. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), Logistic Regression (LR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were chosen to model the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation communities. Plant density and cover, soil texture, available moisture, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter, lime, gravel and gypsum contents and topography (elevation, slope and aspect) are those variables that have been sampled using the randomized systematic method. Within each vegetation type, the samples were collected using 15 quadrates placed at an interval of 50 m along three 750 m transects. As a necessary step, the maps of all factors affecting the predictive capability of the models were generated. The results showed that the predictive models using the LR and ANN methods are more suitable to predict the distribution of individual species. In opposite, the CCA method is more suitable to predict the distribution of the all studied species together. Using the finalized models, maps of individual species (for different species) or for all the species were generated in the GIS environment. To evaluate the predictive ability of the models, the accuracy of the predicted maps was compared against real-world vegetation maps using the Kappa statistic. The Kappa (kappa) statistic was also used to evaluate the adequacy of vegetation mapping. The comparison between the vegetation cover of a map generated using the CCA application and its corresponding actual map showed a good agreement (i.e. kappa = 0.58). The results also revealed that maps generated using the LR and ANN models for Astragalus spp., Halocnemum strobilaceum, Zygophyllum eurypterum and Seidlitzia rosmarinus species have a high accordance with their corresponding actual maps of the study area. Due to the high level of adaptability of Artemisia sieberi, allowing this specie to grow in most parts of the study area with relatively different habitat conditions, a predictive model for this species could not be fixed. In such cases, a set of predictive models may be used to formulate the environment-vegetation relationship. Finally, the predictive ability of the LR and ANN models for mapping Astragalus spp. was determined as kappa = 0.86 and kappa = 0.91 respectively, implying a very good agreement between predictions and observations.
   It is concluded that the combination of modelling of the local species distribution constitutes a promising future research area, which has the potentiality to enhance assessments and conservation planning of vegetation (like rangelands) based on predictive species models.

AB  - 1. Predictive models of species' distributions are used increasingly in ecological studies investigating features as varied as biodiversity, habitat selection and interspecific competition. In a pilot study, we based a successful model for the great bustard Otis tarda on advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data, which offer attractive predictor variables because of the global coverage, high temporal frequency of overpasses and low cost. We wished to assess whether the approach could be applied at very large spatial scales, and whether the coarse resolution of the imagery (1 km(2)) would limit application to those bird species with large home ranges or to simple recognition of broad habitat types.
   2. We modelled the distributions of three agricultural steppe birds over the whole of Spain using a common set of predictor variables, including AVHRR imagery. The species, great bustard, little bustard Tetrax tetrax and calandra lark Melanocorhypha calandra, have similar habitat requirements but differently sized home ranges, and are all species of conservation concern. Good models would reveal differences in distribution between the species and have high predictive power despite the large geographical extent covered.
   3. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were built with the presence-absence of the species as the response variable. Individual species' responses to the habitat variables were identified using partial fits and compared with each other. We found that this modelling framework could successfully distinguish the habitats selected by the three species, while the response curves indicated how the habitats differed. Model fits and cross-validations assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots showed the models to be successful and robust.
   4. We overlaid the predictive maps to identify key areas for agricultural steppe birds in Spain and compared these with the present network of protected sites in two sample regions. In Castilla Leon the provision of protected sites appears appropriate, but in Castilla La Mancha large areas of apparently suitable habitat have no protection.
   5. These results confirm that large-scale models are able to increase our understanding of species' ecology and provide data for conservation planning. AVHRR imagery, in combination with other variables, has sufficient resolution to model a range of bird species, and GAMs have the flexibility to model subtle species-habitat responses.

AB  - Suitable habitat for the Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) has been reduced markedly over the past 100 years. The remaining habitat is widely used for petroleum exploration and extraction, cattle grazing, power line easements, and the generation of electricity. Given the tenuous status of the species and recent demands on land use in remaining habitat, it is imperative that Lesser Prairie-Chicken avoidance behavior of anthropogenic features be quantified for impact assessment and conservation planning. We examined the relationship of several anthropogenic features as they pertained to habitat use of radiomarked female Lesser Prairie-Chickens (n = 226) in southwestern Kansas from 1997 to 2002. We used Poisson rate regression and contingency tables to examine spatial use patterns of monthly home ranges (95% fixed kernels, n = 539) and estimated the likelihood that anthropogenic features (i.e., power lines, wells, roads, and buildings) occurred within aggregates of all monthly home ranges (monthly use ranges). We calculated the distance from the centroids of home ranges to anthropogenic features and, using Monte Carlo simulations, evaluated whether or not they were farther than would be expected at random. There was temporal variation in the average odds of each feature occurring within monthly use ranges, but generally there was a pattern of avoidance. Monte Carlo simulations of expected distances indicated that the nearest 90% of Lesser Prairie-Chicken centers of use were farther from anthropogenic features than would be expected at random. We also had the opportunity to evaluate changes in habitat use (or avoidance behavior) 1 year post-construction of a power line using a Before-After-Control-Impact design. Post-power line construction analysis indicated that Lesser Prairie-Chicken monthly use areas were less likely to include power lines than non-use areas. However, centers of use were closer to power lines than would be expected at random in the impact area. The discrepancies between short-and long-term results suggest a lag period between power line construction and avoidance by Lesser Prairie-Chickens, possibly due to site fidelity of the species. Our study provides some minimum behavioral avoidance distances for mitigating energy developments in Lesser Prairie-Chicken habitats, and we recommend clustering these features to maximize available habitats.

KW  - REINTRODUCTION
AB  - Metapopulation dynamics are influenced by spatial parameters including the amount and arrangement of suitable habitat, yet these parameters may be uncertain when deciding how to manage species or their habitats. Sensitivity analyses of population viability analysis (PVA) models can help measure relative parameter influences on predictions, identify research priorities for reducing uncertainty, and evaluate management strategies. Few spatial PVAs, however, include sensitivity analyses of both spatial and nonspatial parameters, perhaps because computationally efficient tools for such analyses are lacking or inaccessible. We developed GRIP, a program to facilitate sensitivity analysis of spatial and nonspatial input parameters for PVAs created in RAMAS Metapop, a widely applied software program. GRIP creates random sets of input files by varying parameters specified in the PVA model including vital rates and their correlations among populations, the number and configuration of populations, dispersal rates, dispersal survival, initial population abundances, carrying capacities, and the probability, intensity, and spatial extent of catastrophes, while drawing on specified parameter distributions. We evaluated GRIP's performance as a tool for sensitivity analysis of spatial PVAs and explored the consequences of varying spatial input parameters for predictions of a published PVA model of the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis). We used GRIP output to generate standardized regression coefficients (SRCs) and nonparametric correlation coefficients as indices of the relative sensitivity of predicted conservation status to input parameters. GRIP performed well; with a single analysis we were able to rank the relative influence of input parameters identified as influential by the PVA's original author, S. A. Berglind, who used three separate forms of sensitivity analysis. Our analysis, however, also underscored the value of exploring the relative influence of spatial parameters on PVA predictions; both SRCs and correlation coefficients indicated that the most influential parameters in the sand lizard model were spatial in nature. We provide annotated code so that GRIP may be modified to reflect particular species biology, customized for more complex spatial PVA models, upgraded to incorporate features added in newer versions of RAMAS Metapop, used as a template to develop similar programs, or used as it is for computationally efficient sensitivity analyses in support of conservation planning.

AB  - Context Changing global environmental conditions, especially at northern latitudes, are threatening to shift species distributions and alter wildlife communities.
   Objective We aimed to establish current distributions and community arrangements of small mammals to provide important baselines for monitoring and conserving biodiversity into the future.
   Methods We used 4,408 archived museum and open-access records and the machine learning algorithm, RandomForests, to create high-resolution spatial niche models for 17 species of rodents and shrews in Alaska. Models were validated using independent trapping results from 20 locations stratified along statewide mega-transects, and an average species richness curve was calculated for field samples. Community cluster analyses (varclus) identified geographic patterns of sympatry among species. Species models were summed to create the first small-mammal species richness map for Alaska.
   Results Species richness increased logarithmically to a mean of 3.3 species per location over 1,500 trapnights. Distribution models yielded mean accuracies of 71 % (45-90 %), and maps correctly predicted a mean of 75 % (60-95 %) of occurrences correctly in the field. Top predictors included Soil Type, Eco-region, Landfire Land-cover, December Sea Ice, and July Temperature at the geographic scale. Cluster analysis delineated five community groups (3-4 species/group), and species richness was highest (11-13 species) over the Yukon-Tanana Uplands.
   Conclusions Models presented here provide spatial predictions of current small mammal biodiversity in Alaska and an initial framework for mapping and monitoring wildlife distributions across broad landscapes into the future.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is essential in biodiversity conservation because of its ability to reduce the effect of habitat fragmentation; furthermore is a key property in adapting to climate change. Potential distribution models and landscape connectivity studies have increased with regard to their utility to prioritizing areas for conservation. The objective of this study was to model the potential distribution of Mountain cloud forests in the Transversal Volcanic System, Michoacan and to analyze the role of these areas in maintaining landscape connectivity. Potential distribution was modeled for the Mountain cloud forests based on the maximum entropy approach using 95 occurrence points and 17 ecological variables at 30 m spatial resolution. Potential connectivity was then evaluated by using a probability of connectivity index based on graph theory. The percentage of variation (dPCk) was used to identify the individual contribution of each potential area of Mountain cloud forests in overall connectivity. The different ways in which the potential areas of Mountain cloud forests can contribute to connectivity were evaluated by using the three fractions derived from dPCk (dPCintrak, dPCfluxk, and dPCconnectork). We determined that 37,567 ha of the TVSMich are optimal for the presence of Mountain cloud forests. The contribution of said area in the maintenance of connectivity was low. The conservation of Mountain cloud forests is indispensable, however, in providing or receiving dispersal flows through TVSMich because of its role as a connector element between another habitat types. The knowledge of the potential capacity of Mountain cloud forests to promote structural and functional landscape connectivity is key in the prioritization of conservation areas.

AB  - Background: Conservation planning and the design of marine protected areas (MPAs) requires spatially explicit information on the distribution of ecological features. Most species of marine mammals range over large areas and across multiple planning regions. The spatial distributions of marine mammals are difficult to predict using habitat modelling at ecological scales because of insufficient understanding of their habitat needs, however, relevant information may be available from surveys conducted to inform mandatory stock assessments.
   Methodology and Results: We use a 20-year time series of systematic aerial surveys of dugong (Dugong dugong) abundance to create spatially-explicit models of dugong distribution and relative density at the scale of the coastal waters of northeast Australia (similar to 136,000 km(2)). We interpolated the corrected data at the scale of 2 km * 2 km planning units using geostatistics. Planning units were classified as low, medium, high and very high dugong density on the basis of the relative density of dugongs estimated from the models and a frequency analysis. Torres Strait was identified as the most significant dugong habitat in northeast Australia and the most globally significant habitat known for any member of the Order Sirenia. The models are used by local, State and Federal agencies to inform management decisions related to the Indigenous harvest of dugongs, gill-net fisheries and Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas.
   Conclusion/Significance: In this paper we demonstrate that spatially-explicit population models add value to data collected for stock assessments, provide a robust alternative to predictive habitat distribution models, and inform species conservation at multiple scales.

AB  - Habitat loss is widely regarded as one of the most destructive factors threatening native biodiversity. Because migratory waterbirds include some of the most globally endangered species, information on their sensitivity to landscape would benefit their conservation. While citizen science data on waterbird species occurrence are subjected to various biases, their appropriate interpretation can provide information of benefit to species conservation. We apply a bootstrapping procedure to citizen science data to reduce sampling biases and report the relative sensitivity of waterbird species to natural versus human-dominated landscapes. Analyses are performed on 30,491 data records for 69 waterbird species referred to five functional groups observed in China between 2000 and 2018. Of these taxa, 30 species (43.5%) are significantly associated with natural landscapes, more so for cranes, geese, and ducks than for shorebirds and herons. The relationship between land association and the threat status of waterbirds is significant when the range size of species is considered as the mediator, and the higher the land association, the higher the threat status. Sensitive species significantly associated with natural landscapes are eight times more likely to be classified as National Protected Species (NPS) Classes I or II than less sensitive species significantly associated with human-dominated landscapes. We demonstrate the potential for citizen science data to assist in conservation planning in the context of landscape changes. Our methods might assist others to obtain information to help relieve species decline and extinction.

AB  - Intact forest landscapes (IFLs) are globally important for maintaining functional ecosystems. Ebo forest (similar to 1400 km(2)) in Cameroon is one of the largest remaining IFLs in the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forest ecoregion and harbours several IUCN Red-Listed threatened mammal species. We evaluated the status, trends, and distribution of mammals >= 0.5 kg in the Ebo forest over 12 years using guided recce and camera trap monitoring surveys, as well as local knowledge to inform future land use and conservation planning. Recce monitoring of six taxa (blue duiker Philantomba monticola, chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis, putty-nosed monkey Cercopithecus nictitans, medium sized duikers Cephalophus spp., and red river hog Potamochoerus porcus) showed that some are stable or increasing. Indeed, our recent camera trap data confirmed breeding Gorilla gorilla (western gorilla) and elephant. Distribution models for chimpanzees and elephants showed that their populations are concentrated in the centre of the forest, away from human pressure. Some other species, however, including red colobus Piliocolobus preussi, leopard Panthera pardus, African golden cat Caracal aurata, and forest buffalo Syncerus caffer nanus are either close to extirpation or have been extirpated within living memory. We conclude that the Ebo intact forest landscape retains an important mammal community, despite no formal legal protection. Ebo's future is uncertain, with two commercial logging concessions announced by Cameroon in 2020 and later suspended in response to national and international pressure. It is crucial to maintain Ebo's integrity to protect the biodiversity and function of this important part of the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forest ecoregion.

AB  - Climate change poses a major threat to the survival of alpine mammals living in fragmented habitats with poor dispersal abilities. Among these important prey species, pikas are considered especially vulnerable to rising temperatures that would impede their surface activity and dispersal. We investigated how climatic regimes influence the niche of the Royle's pika (Ochotona roylei), and which climatic drivers and change trajectories may threaten the species' future sustenance, thereby prioritizing areas for future conservation of this species across its distribution range. We used Royle's pika presence locations in the MaxEnt framework, along with biologically relevant climatic and topographical variables, to model the present (2010) and the future (2050, 2070) climatic niche under different future scenarios projected by CCSM4 climatic models. Subsequently, we estimated the climatic niche loss across the elevation gradient, longitudinal gradient, and both inside and outside protected areas for all countries within the species' range. Niche suitability of the Royle's pika was substantially determined by precipitation of the coldest quarter (~snow cover) and wettest quarter (~monsoon rainfall). As these parameters are known to be vulnerable to global climatic change, our projection revealed significant loss (102 km(2)/year) in the species niche availability across all future scenarios, particularly in non-protected low-elevation regions. By identifying areas where species survival may be threatened, we confirmed that the distribution of Royle's pika, an important prey species, might be reduced by climate change. Our findings can aid in conservation planning strategies for this species and other alpine fauna and contribute to ongoing efforts to monitor change in the Himalaya.

AB  - Forecasting future species distributions under climate change scenarios using Ecological Niche Models (ENM) is common practice. Typically, these projections do not account for landscape connectivity and species dispersal abilities. When they do account for these factors, they are based on either rather simplistic or overly complex and data-hungry approaches. Here we apply a new approach for predicting species range shifts under different climate change and landscape connectivity scenarios that balances data requirements and output quality. The approach builds on the metapopulation concept to produce a dispersal model based on repeated simulations of stochastic extinction-colonization dynamics across multiple landscapes of variable connectivity. The model is then combined with an ENM to produce more realistic predictions of species range shifts under environmental change. Using the near-threatened Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) as a model species and considering two contrasting climate change scenarios (B2 and Al b) and three scenarios of increasing landscape connectivity, we confirmed that model predictions based solely on ENM overestimated future range sizes (2050 and 2080) in relation to predictions incorporating both future climates and landscape connectivity constraints. This supports the idea that landscape change critically affects species range shifts in addition to climate change, and that models disregarding landscape connectivity tend to produce overly optimistic predictions, particularly for species with low dispersal abilities. We suggest that our empirically-based simulation modelling approach provides a useful framework to improve range shift predictions for a broad range of species, which is essential for the conservation planning of metapopulations under climate and landscape change.

AB  - The Mediterranean basin, and the Iberian Peninsula in particular, represent an outstanding "hotspot" of biological diversity with a long history of integration between natural ecosystems and human activities. Using deductive distribution models, and considering both Spain and Portugal, we downscaled traditional range maps for terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, breeding birds, mammals and reptiles) to the finest possible resolution with the data at hand, and we identified hotspots based on three criteria: i) species richness; ii) vulnerability, and iii) endemism. We also provided a first evaluation of the conservation status of biodiversity hotspots based on these three criteria considering both existing and proposed protected areas (i.e., Natura 2000). For the identification of hotspots, we used a method based on the cumulative distribution functions of species richness values. We found no clear surrogacy among the different types of hotspots in the Iberian Peninsula. The most important hotspots (considering all criteria) are located in the western and southwestern portions of the study area, in the Mediterranean biogeographical region. Existing protected areas are not specifically concentrated in areas of high species richness, with only 5.2% of the hotspots of total richness being currently protected. The Natura 2000 network can potentially constitute an important baseline for protecting vertebrate diversity in the Iberian Peninsula although further improvements are needed. We suggest taking a step forward in conservation planning in the Mediterranean basin, explicitly considering the history of the region as well as its present environmental context. This would allow moving from traditional reserve networks (conservation focused on "patterns") to considerations about the "processes" that generated present biodiversity.

AB  - There has been uncertainty in the national gap analysis program about including non-breeding birds in distribution models because of concerns that distributions of migrant and winter birds are difficult to predict and are not necessary to assess biodiversity patterns. New Mexico gap analysis included migrant and non-breeding birds assuming that distributions could be predicted using habitat associations, and that excluding non-breeding bird habitat from avian richness projections potentially underestimates community types important to birds. We compared biodiversity estimates including non-breeding birds (inclusive estimate-324 species) to estimates including only breeding birds (breeding bird estimate-257 species) in terms of estimated patterns of species richness. Inclusive and breeding bird richness estimates agreed about general locations of some species-rich areas and the most species-poor areas in the state, but were less comparable for intermediate al:eas of bird occurrence. We found < 50% agreement between the two estimates about areas with highest species richness. When non-breeding birds were included, over 2,000,000 ha of short grass steppe shifted to a higher richness category and another 11,600 ha moved into the highest richness category. Graminoid wetlands, playa lakes, and waters in eastern New Mexico also showed elevated richness levels in the inclusive estimate. Our analyses indicate that only assessing breeding distribution does not reliably predict relative importance of areas used by birds throughout New Mexico and should not be used exclusively to identify potential gaps in conservation for land-use evaluation and planning.

AB  - Understanding biodiversity patterns depends on data collection, which in marine environments can be prohibitively expensive. Transferable predictive models could therefore provide time- and cost-effective tools for understanding biodiversity-environment relationships. We used fish species counts and spatial and environmental predictors to develop predictive models of fish species richness (S) for two major coral reefs located in separate ocean basins: Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR; Queensland) and Ningaloo Reef (NR; Western Australia). We tested the ability of the GBR model to predict S at NR (its transferability) under various scenarios using different sampling durations, years sampled and transect sizes. Based on R-2, the GBR model poorly predicted S at NR (R-2<16%) with few predicted values strongly correlated with observations. However, comparable spatial patterns in S across NR were predicted by both the NR and the GBR models when calibrated at similar spatio-temporal scales. This result suggests that poor validation of the transferred models may indicate low deviance explained by the predictors in the new system (where other predictors not included might have a more direct effect on the response) and that in some situations, model transferability may be considerably improved by using data sets of similar spatio-temporal scales. Therefore, data filtering by time and space may be required prior to transferring models.Policy implications. Transferable models can provide initial estimates of fish species richness patterns in poorly sampled systems, and thereby guide the design of better and more efficient sampling programs. Further improvements in model transferability will increase their predictive power and utility in conservation planning and management.

AB  - Amphibians are the most threatened Class of vertebrate, with wetland-associated anurans in particular suffering high levels of habitat loss. We used predictive modelling to better understand the distribution of a critically endangered South African endemic (Hyperolius pickersgilli) and to guide conservation action. MaxEnt distribution models were produced based on limited occurrence data. Predicted localities with probability of occurrence >= 60% were surveyed. Ten new sub-populations were discovered. The mean probability of occurrence for the species at wetlands where it was detected was greater than that at wetlands where it was not detected or absent. In addition, 17 known historical localities were re-visited and the species deemed absent at 8 of these. The total number of localities at which the species is now known to occur is 18, which is an increase in the known extant sub-populations of six. We recalculate the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence for the species as 108 km(2) and 2081.5 km(2), respectively; both increases on previous estimates. Implications of these changes on the IUCN Red List status of H. pickersgilliare discussed. A friction map was created to identify possible linkages between sub-populations, which can be used to guide habitat restoration and population repatriation. Given the degree of isolation of subpopulations and the potentially severe threats to most of these, urgent conservation action for H. pickersgilli remains crucial. This study provides a method for use in conservation planning for wetland-breeding amphibians in eastern coastal regions of Africa and elsewhere. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate warming challenges our approach to building systems of protected areas because it is likely to drive accelerating shifts in species distributions, and the projections of those future species distributions are uncertain. There are several important sources of uncertainty intrinsic to using species occurrence projections for reserve system design including uncertainty in the number of occurrences captured by any reserve selection solution, and uncertainty arising from the different approaches used to fit predictive models. Here we used the present and future predicted distributions of Iberian herptiles to analyze how dynamics and uncertainty in species distributions may affect decisions about resource allocation for conservation in space and time. We identified priority areas maximizing coverage of current and future (2020 and 2080) predicted distributions of 65 species, under "Mild" and "Severe" uncertainty. Next, we applied a return-on-investment analysis to quantify and make explicit trade-offs between investing in areas selected when optimizing for different times and with different uncertainty levels. Areas identified as important for conservation in every time frame and uncertainty level were the ones considered to be robust climate adaptation investments, and included chiefly already protected areas. Areas identified only under "Mild" uncertainty were considered good candidates for investment if extra resources are available and were mainly located in northern Iberia. However, areas selected only in the "Severe" uncertainty case should not be completely disregarded as they may become climatic refugia for some species. Our study provides an objective methodology to deliver "no regrets" conservation investments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological niche models (ENMs) have multiple applications in ecology, evolution and conservation planning. They relate the known locations of a species to characteristics of its environment (usually climate) over its geographical range. Most ENMs are trained using standard 30-year (1961-1990) or 50-year (1951-2000) baselines to represent current climate conditions. Species occurrence records used as input to the models, however, are frequently collected from time periods that differ from those from which the climate is derived. Since climate variability can be significant within and outside baselines, and the distributions of some plants and animals (e.g., annual plants, insects) can adjust to environmental conditions on much shorter time scales, this mismatch between collection records and climatic baselines may affect the utility and accuracy of model outputs. We investigated how the choice of baseline periods influenced modelling efforts, anticipating that climate baselines derived from the same temporal period as the species records would yield improved ENMs. Ten simulated species' distributions were modelled using an ENM (Maxent) for (a) occurrences and climates within the same temporal period, based on eighteen 10-year baselines within the 20th century and (b) all available samples and climate baselines from 1951-2000 and 1961-1990. Each model was projected onto all the available 10-year climate scenarios and compared to the models trained on the corresponding scenario. We show that temporal mismatches of species occurrences and climate baselines can result in significantly poorer distribution models. Such temporal mismatch may be unavoidable for many studies, but we emphasize here the need to match the time range of samples and climate data whenever possible. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of protected areas in Benin for the conservation of favourable and priority habitats for the following tree species of socio-economic importance: Afzelia africana, Anogeissus leiocarpa, Burkea africana, Daniellia oliveri, Detarium microcarpum, Prosopis africana and Khaya senegalensis. We combined maximum entropy (Maxent) techniques with GIS to predict potentially favourable areas for cultivating and conserving these species. Zonation software was used to model priority habitats. Data points where the species were present were collected and linked to bioclimatic variables derived from monthly temperature and rainfall figures from the Africlim database and to edaphic (soil) variables. In term of environmental determinism, the most favourable areas were predicted by bioclimatic variables such as mean diurnal temperature range (Bio2), mean annual rainfall (Bio12), potential evapotranspiration (PET) and a biophysical ground variable. The most favourable protected areas for the seven tree species extended northwards from the Ketou listed forest (7 degrees 43'N) in the Guinean zone, from the Agoua listed forest (8 degrees 30'N) in the Sudano-Guinean zone and from the Pendjari National Park area (10 degrees 35'N) in the Sudanian zone. Gap analysis of habitat conservation showed that the protected area network was effective in the Sudanian zone (9 degrees 75'-12 degrees 27'N), minimally effective in the Guinean zone (6 degrees 50'-7 degrees 40'N) and not effective at all in the Sudano-Guinean zone.

AB  - The role of natural (non-plantation) production forests is increasingly recognized in conservation of forest biodiversity globally. Government and other forest stakeholders in Nepal are, however, still reluctant to promote active management of production forests for fear of negative impacts on forest biodiversity. Moreover, Nepal's government is converting production forests into protected areas thus restricting the area available for multiple uses. To assess the implications of forest management practices on forest biodiversity at landscape level, we compared the richness and composition of tree species among regularly harvested community forests, irregularly harvested community forests, protected area and national forests in sub-tropical forested landscape of Nepal using tree species inventory and assessment of key environmental variables. Results showed that regularly harvested community forests could be effective in supporting tree species richness and composition compared to other management regimes. Results supported the hypothesis that high forest disturbance and no disturbance do not support tree species diversity and composition. In addition, this study found that regularly managed community forests also protect ecologically important and vulnerable tree species. Some possible explanations for the better performance of these community forests could be tenure security, frequency and regularity of silvicultural operations and sensitivity of forest users to the ecological aspects of forest management. Our study reaffirmed the need for active forest management at the local level to contribute to global conservation initiatives such as sustainable forest management, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) and biodiversity conservation. Better compliance with forest management plans and capacity development of local forestry stakeholders in forest management operations are suggested for managing forests outside protected areas that is, in national and community forests.

AB  - Farmland ponds represent habitats with a high conservation value that make a significant contribution to regional biodiversity. Understanding the influence of plant species composition and environmental variables in driving variations in animal species composition in ponds is an important issue in the fields of ecological research and conservation biology. Using variance partitioning techniques to quantify independent effects, we examined how plant species composition, local-landscape configuration and physicochemical variables interact in influencing aquatic insect and amphibian community composition. The ponds investigated in this study were located in the Site of Community Importance - Special Protected Area (Natura 2000 Network) "Monte Labbro - Alta Valle dell'Albegna" (Tuscany, central Italy). Our results showed that: (i) plant community composition (such as Carex hirta, Glicerya fluitans, Potamogeton natans, Typha latifolia) is a good predictor for amphibian but not for aquatic insect species composition; (ii) aquatic insect species composition was more strongly affected by the landscape context, whereas for amphibians the local characteristics of the ponds were determining; (iii) the physicochemical context is a poor predictor for these animal taxa; (iv) lastly, and notably, the explanatory variables explained a high proportion of the total variation in amphibian and aquatic insect species composition. Our results have important implications with respect to the creation of new ponds, which should preferentially take place close to semi-natural grasslands and other wetlands, in order to maintain greater connectivity, and away from urban areas. Moreover, larger ponds are preferable for the preservation of pond biodiversity. The management and conservation of ponds is necessary to ensure the protection of habitats, the survival of individual species and overall pond biodiversity.

AB  - The relationship between the distribution of the whale shark Rhincodon typus and hydrobiological variables in the Caribbean Sea during 2005-2009 was analysed. Monthly trips were made to the R. typus aggregation area during the months when this species is present in the region (May to September) to record sightings and hydrological data and to collect samples to determine nutrients, chlorophyll a (Chl a) and zooplankton biomass. A total of 2104 R. typus were counted and three zones of high abundance were identified: Cabo-Catoche, Contoy (both within the Whale Shark Biosphere Reserve, WSBR) and the zone knows as Afuera. The zones of greatest R. typus density within the WSBR were characterized by high Chl a concentrations (median: 11 mg m(-3), interpercentile range: 05-18 mg m(-3)) and high nutrient concentrations, such as ammonium (median: 25 mu mol l(-1), interpercentile range: 05-64 mu mol l(-1)), due to the influence of local upwelling. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to explore the relationship between R. typus distribution and the environmental variables inside WSBR. Zooplankton biomass was the most influential environmental variable, supporting the close relationship between R. typus distribution and biological productivity. Copepods were the dominant zooplankton group within the WSBR. In the Afuera zone, there were large R. typus aggregations (>80 individuals) associated with zooplankton dominated by fish eggs and significantly higher mean +/- s.d. biomass (33561 +/- 19608 mg m(-3)) compared with that recorded inside the WSBR (1035 +/- 572 mg m(-3)). The differences among zones generated changes in R. typus distribution patterns and provided opportunities to develop local management strategies for this species.

AB  - Manta rays forage for zooplankton in tropical and subtropical marine environments, which are generally nutrient-poor. Feeding often occurs at predictable locations where these large, mobile cartilaginous fishes congregate to exploit ephemeral productivity hotspots. Investigating the zooplankton dynamics that lead to such feeding aggregations remains a key question for understanding their movement ecology. The aim of this study is to investigate the feeding environment at the largest known aggregation for reef manta rays Mobula alfredi in the world. We sampled zooplankton throughout the tidal cycle, and recorded M. alfredi activity and behaviour, alongside environmental variables at Hanifaru Bay, Maldives. We constructed generalised linear models to investigate possible relationships between zooplankton dynamics, environmental parameters, and how they influenced M. alfredi abundance, behaviour, and foraging strategies. Zooplankton biomass changed rapidly throughout the tidal cycle, and M. alfredi feeding events were significantly related to high zooplankton biomass. Mobula alfredi switched from non-feeding to feeding behaviour at a prey density threshold of 53.7 mg dry mass m -3 ; more than double the calculated density estimates needed to theoretically meet their metabolic requirements. The highest numbers of M. alfredi observed in Hanifaru Bay corresponded to when they were engaged in feeding behaviour. The community composition of zooplankton was different when M. alfredi was feeding (dominated by copepods and crustaceans) compared to when present but not feeding (more gelatinous species present than in feeding samples). The dominant zooplankton species recorded was Undinula vulgaris. This is a large-bodied calanoid copepod species that blooms in oceanic waters, suggesting offshore influences at the site. Here, we have characterised aspects of the feeding environment for M. alfredi in Hanifaru Bay and identified some of the conditions that may result in large aggregations of this threatened planktivore, and this information can help inform management of this economically important marine protected area.

AB  - The effects of fishing have been documented across coral reefs worldwide. No-take marine reserves do not only act as a conservation tool but also allow an opportunity to study impacts of fishing, by acting as control sites. In addition, well-planned and well-managed no-take marine reserves (NTRs) provide conservation benefits that are essential to marine biodiversity and ecosystem-based management. The Abrolhos Marine National Park, off the tropical Brazilian coast, protects part of the largest coral reef system in the South Atlantic. To investigate the effects of fishing on reef fish richness, abundance, biomass, and functional diversity of the fish assemblage, we compared sites across two protection levels considering the variation in habitats (Fringing Reefs-Protected; Pinnacles Reefs-Protected; and Coastal Reefs-Open Access), using Baited Remote Underwater Stereo-Video systems (stereo-BRUVs). We adjusted generalized additive mixed models of fish assemblage characteristics with protection levels and environmental variables, such as topographic complexity (mean relief and relief variation), visibility, and benthic cover percentage. Inside NTRs, we found higher total biomass and biomass of fishery target species and carnivores, specifically for the Carcharhinidae (sharks) and Epinephelidae (groupers) families, indicating direct fisheries effects on these groups. In contrast, the ecological parameters of non-target fish were positively correlated with habitat characteristics, including mean relief and variance of relief. Moreover, fish functional diversity was higher within NTRs, demonstrating an even distribution of functional entities. The presence of large mobile predators and the overall higher biomass of carnivores inside the NTR indicate the effect of fishing exclusion. Our results point to the value of NTRs to study the effects of fishing and achieve biodiversity conservation and suggest the importance of using remote sampling methods to assess large mobile predators.

AB  - Northern Australia has been the focus of recent marine biodiversity research to support natural resource management for both industry and conservation, including management of the Oceanic Shoals Australian Marine Park (AMP). Much of this research has targeted habitat-forming sessile invertebrates and charismatic megafauna, but smaller macrofauna and infauna may also be important because of their roles in ecosystem functions. In this study we characterised the biodiversity of polychaetes collected from four marine surveys to the Oceanic Shoals AMP between 2009 and 2012 from which sediment samples were elutriated (500 mm) to separate macrofauna. We used this species-level inventory to examine several questions related to marine management, namely: (1) do polychaete assemblages vary among surveys; (2) can environmental variables or geomorphology explain differences in community structure; and (3) how do ecological patterns change according to taxonomic resolution (species, family) and functional group (feeding, habitat, mobility)? A total of 2561 individual polychaetes were collected from 266 samples, representing 368 species and 43 families, including new species and genera, as well as new family records for Australia (Iospilidae, Lacydoniidae). Polychaete species assemblages and functional groups showed variation among the surveys, but this was not observed at the family level. Species and family assemblages were weakly related to environmental factors, but functional groups showed stronger relationships. Plains and banks each supported distinct polychaete assemblages, although the latter showed temporal variation. The results provide baseline biodiversity and ecological data about polychaetes on the northern Australian shelf, and these are discussed in relation to marine management strategies. Notably, intersurvey and environmental patterns differ from those of larger sessile fauna (sponges) collected on the same surveys, highlighting the need to consider small macrofauna in monitoring programs of marine protected areas.

AB  - Increased efforts to analyze the spatial and human dimensions of anglers are necessary to improve fisheries management. Fishing quality is considered to be important in angler site choice. This paper provides a geospatial framework for assessing and mapping fishing quality in recreational fisheries. The framework relies on three main components: 1) experimental angling records for calculating fishing quality metrics, 2) spatial modeling for making predictions at unsampled locations, and 3) angler preference information for generating an integrated fishing quality index. We applied this framework to a mixed-species recreational fishery in a marine temperate ecosystem dominated by seagrass in Palma Bay (NW Mediterranean). We calculated different fishing quality metrics (i.e., catch per unit effort, yield per unit effort, mean fish size, price per unit effort, and fish diversity) using fishery-independent experimental surveys. We then used regression models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models) to predict and map these metrics based on environmental and angler-related variables. Lastly, we combined Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi-criteria Analysis (MCA) to integrate all metrics into a single index, considering alternative consumptive orientation profiles (ie., generic, consumptive and trophy anglers). Our results demonstrate that spatially explicit environmental variables (i.e., slope, bathymetry, benthic habitat and coastal protection) can predict the spatial distribution of fishing quality metrics. In addition, we found a significant effect of a marine protected area (MPA) on price, providing insight into the role of partial protection for recreational fisheries management. Mapping and modeling fishing quality will increase our understanding of angler site choice and the factors underlying spatial patterns in the fishing effort. The geospatial framework presented here can be used to inform ecosystem-based fisheries management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Changes in land use trigger environmental changes that can lead to decreased biodiversity and species loss. The liver is an essential detoxification organ that reflects systemic physiological responses to environmental changes. Here, we tested whether contrasting land use patterns influence the amount of substances from the hepatic cellular catabolism and melanomacrophages (MMs) of five anuran species in the Brazilian Cerrado.
   Methods: We collected the same five species of pond-dwelling frogs in one protected area and in an area with intense agricultural activity. We used routine histological and histochemical techniques to quantify the area occupied by lipofuscin, melanin, and hemosiderin in the liver of two frogs Leptodactylus fuscus, Physalaemus cuvieri, and three tree-frogs Dendropsophus minutus, Scinax fuscomarginatus, and Boana albopunctata. We classified land use types in a buffer around each pond based on satellite images. We then used a double-constrained Correspondence Analysis, a recently developed ecological method to relate functional traits to environmental variables, to test the effect of each land use type on the area of each liver pigment.
   Results: There was an increase in the amount of melanin in environments with high proportion of agriculture, as well as variation in the amount of lipofuscin and hemosiderin. Liver pigments of P. cuvieri and B. albopunctata varied more strongly in response to land use types, suggesting they could be good indicator species. Therefore, the area of MMs in the liver and the metabolic products in their cytoplasm can be used as biomarkers of environmental changes in regions with intense agricultural activities. Our results add a new perspective to the influence of land use patterns on environmental health by highlighting the effect of environmental changes on internal morphological aspects of animals.

Based on 10 Global Positioning System-collared wolves in a protected area of central Italy, we investigated wolf responses to anthropogenic features such as roads and settlements by using Step and Resource Selection Functions. We revealed that responses by wolves to anthropogenic features varied according to behavioural state (travelling vs. resting) and social affiliation (pack members vs. floaters), while accounting for seasonal and circadian effects. During summer, pack members strongly avoided roads and settlements throughout all day, both when travelling and resting, and complemented this response by selecting forested areas and shrublands. Conversely, during fall and winter, pack members relaxed the avoidance towards anthropogenic features by travelling closer to main roads and settlements, but they still selected resting sites farther from anthropogenic features and located them in denser cover and along steeper slopes. Compared to pack members, floaters, when travelling, showed a weaker avoidance of main roads and settlements and did not show any selection pattern towards environmental variables. When resting, contrary to pack members, floaters selected sites closer to main roads and settlements, even though these were still located along denser cover and steeper slopes. Our findings suggest that wolves living in human-modified landscapes adapt behaviourally to the spatial and temporal distribution of perceived interference by humans and that their response is complementary to the expected seasonal and circadian variation in human activity. These adaptations appear to be aided by the selection of habitat features that enhance security and allow segregation from humans. Maintenance of such habitat characteristics appears of critical importance to ensure the functionality of behavioural adaptations by wolves living in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - Depth and habitat are important predictors of fish assemblage structure, yet current no-take marine protected area (MPA) networks are generally limited to providing refuge for fish species that inhabit shallow waters and may exclude deep habitats essential to exploited populations. To ensure MPA efficacy at the design, uptake and management levels, baseline data on fish populations associated with deep nearshore reefs are needed. This study employed baited remote underwater stereo-video systems to investigate fish habitat associations at shallow (11-25 m) and deep (45-75 m) reef sites in the Tsitsikamma National Park MPA, South Africa. The compositions of fish assemblages at shallow and deep reef sites were significantly different. Specifically, rare species, juveniles and low trophic level species dominated the shallow reef, while deep reef assemblages were characterised by large, sexually mature and predatory fish. The body size of abundant species was also correlated with depth, with larger individuals being more abundant on deeper reefs. Habitat types were identified according to a habitat classification system established in a previous study, which resulted in four broad depth separated habitat types (defined by macrobenthos and environmental variables). Canonical analysis of principle coordinates (CAP) indicated that habitat type was a good categorical predictor of the observed fish assemblages. The CAP analysis determined that 86 % of the samples were correctly assigned to the habitat type from which they were collected, indicating that specific fish assemblages were associated with distinct habitat types. This study highlights the importance of protecting both shallow and deep reefs, not only to ensure the conservation of particular fish assemblages, but also to provide protection for all stages of the life cycle of fish species.

AB  - Hunting and deforestation are the two biggest threats to vertebrates in Southeast Asia. In the last 50 years, monoculture rubber plantations replaced large areas of tropical rainforests in Xishuangbanna, southwest China. We set up camera traps at 109 stations (57 in forest reserves and 52 in rubber plantations) to determine the distribution of mammal species in Menglun, Xishuangbanna. We also interviewed 37 experienced hunters (mean age: 54) in the study area to understand their perceptions of species abundance trends. We used hierarchical multispecies occupancy modelling to determine the effect of distance to village, distance to forest edge and elevation on mammal occupancy after accounting for imperfect detection. We used non-parametric tests for the rank data to evaluate perceived species trends. Using a combination of historical literature (1954-1985), hunter interviews, direct observations and camera-trap surveys, we only recorded 56% (15 out of 27) of the medium-to-large sized (>1 kg) mammal species known previously from the study region. Interviews suggested that current population densities of all extant mammal species are below historical levels. Our camera traps captured 11 mammal species in the forest reserve and only two species in rubber plantations. Low capture rates (10 captures) in rubber mean we could only determine mammal occupancy in forests. Environmental variables did not affect community level mammal occupancy in forests, but common muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) and the northern pig-tailed macaque (Macaca leonina) avoided forest edges. At the time of the survey, hunting was still prevalent in the region. Therefore, conservation interventions that end both hunting and deforestation are urgently needed to stabilize and increase mammal populations in the region.

AB  - As global landscapes continue to change, the sustainability of the ecosystem services they support are increasingly coming into question. In the rapidly changing neotropics, multiple-use plants epitomize sources of ecosystem services. To sustain the relationship that exists between such plants and human populations, a sound understanding of their well-being is required.
   Density data on multiple-use plants were compared across forest types and land tenure classes to understand the implications of these two spatial frames of reference for landscape sustainability.
   The density of an aggregate sample of seventeen multiple-use and a sub-sample of five species were examined relative to forest type and land tenure class across fourteen Rupununi, Southern Guyana, study sites. The examination of plant density based on the two sample sizes was used to make inferences on how the two frames of reference may impact landscape sustainability.
   The mean density of the aggregate sample was highest in three of six forest types, but showed no statistical difference across land tenure classes. When individual species were considered mean densities showed no statistical difference across land tenure classes, but differences were observed for three species across forest types. Mean densities were highest in forest types within which swidden agriculture occurs and in the protected area where logging is prohibited.
   Our findings suggested that in changing tropical landscapes plant species distribution can be predicted by forest types, but land tenure classes may provide clearer signals as to where a species well-being and hence ecosystem services may be compromised.

AB  - Reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) are one of the ocean's largest and most charismatic species. Pressure from targeted and bycatch fisheries coupled with their conservative life-history traits including slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity has led to catastrophic declines of the global population. The species is now listed as Vulnerable to Extinction on IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
   The global M. alfredi population is widely distributed in highly fragmented subpopulations. The Maldives supports the world's largest known subpopulation that undergoes seasonal migrations which are thought to be linked to peaks in ocean productivity induced by the South Asian Monsoon. Although the species is protected from targeted fisheries in the region, increasing pressures from habitat degradation and unsustainable tourism activities mean their effective conservation relies upon knowledge of the species' habitat use, seasonal distribution, and the environmental influences on such movements.
   Photo-ID sighting records collected between 2005 and 2017 were used to identify key aggregation sites throughout the archipelago, and multiple linear regression and prediction analysis identified the environmental variables affecting variations in the intra-annual sighting frequency of M. alfredi.
   Mobula alfredi were recorded at 273 different sites, 48 of which, with >100 sightings at each, were classified as key areas of habitat use. South-west monsoon winds and chlorophyll-a concentration predominantly affected the monthly percentage of M. alfredi sighted on the down-current side of the atolls.
   In a country where climate change and touristic pressure are increasingly threatening this species and its habitat, the identification of key areas of habitat use and temporal changes in the use of these sites highlight the areas that should be prioritized for protection enabling more effective conservation management.

AB  - Urban areas are being affected by rapidly increasing human-made pressures that can strongly homogenize biodiversity, reduce habitat heterogeneity, and facilitate the invasion of alien species. One of the key concerns in invaded urban areas is comparing the trait-environment relationships between alien and native species, to determine the underlying causes of invasiveness. In the current study, we used a trait-environment dataset of 130 native plants and 33 alien plants, recorded in 100 plots covering 50 urban areas and 50 non-urban ones in an urbanization gradient in the arid mountainous Saint-Katherine protected area in Egypt. We measured eleven morphological plant traits for each plant species and ten environmental variables in each plot, including soil resources and human-made pressures, to construct trait-environment associations using a fourth-corner analysis. In addition, we measured the mean functional and phylogenetic distances between the two species groups along an urbanization gradient. Our results revealed strongly significant relationships of alien species traits with human-made pressures and soil resources in urban areas. However, in non-urban areas, alien species traits showed weak and non-significant associations with the environment. Simultaneously, native plants showed consistency in their trait-environment relationships in urban and non-urban areas. In line with these results, the functional and phylogenetic distances declined between the aliens and natives in urban areas, indicating biotic homogenization with increasing urbanization, and increased in non-urban areas, indicating greater divergence between the two species groups. Thereby, this study provided evidence that urbanization can reveal the plasticity of alien species and can also be the leading cause of homogenization in an arid urban area. Future urban studies should investigate the potential causes of taxonomic, genetic, and functional homogenization in species composition in formerly more diverse urbanized areas.

AB  - Most studies of cetacean habitat use do not consider the influence of anthropogenic activities. We investigated the influence of environmental and anthropogenic variables on habitat use by humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and Bryde's whales Balaenoptera brydei off the coast of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. Although there are 2 marine protected areas (MPAs) in this area, few data are available on cetacean habitat use or on the overlap of different cetacean species within these MPAs. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of the MPAs and propose a buffer zone to better protect the biodiversity of the study area. We conducted systematic surveys and developed spatial eigenvector generalized linear models to characterize habitat use by the species in the study area. Habitat use by humpback whales was influenced only by depth, whereas for Bryde's whales there was the additional influence of anthropogenic variables. For Bryde's whales, which use the area for feeding, sea surface temperature and the distance to anchorages had a major influence on habitat use. We also showed that neither of the MPAs in the study area adequately protects the hotspots of either whale species. Most of the humpback whale grid cells with high sighting predictions were located within 2 km of the MPAs, while areas of high sighting prediction of Bryde's whales were located up to 5 km from the MPAs, closer to beaches. Our findings provide important insights for the delimitation of protected areas and zoning of the MPAs.

AB  - We examined the effects of climate change on the future distribution patterns of 20 species of Cactaceae in a protected area of Mexico. Our study area was the biosphere reserve of Tehuacan-Cuicatlan in central Mexico. Cactaceae species in the reserve were selected because they are often the dominant elements of the communities and play an important social role as a source of food, construction, and fuel. We used a floristic database and a bioclimatic modeling approach to examine 19 climatic parameters and to obtain the current potential distribution pattern of each species. Three different future climate scenarios were selected, on the basis of the predictions of several authors about future climate change. We considered the following three future scenarios: (1) +1degreesC and -10% rainfall; (2) +2degreesC and -10% rainfall; (3) +2degreesC and -15% rainfall. Each scenario implies different potential distribution patterns for the species involved; these patterns were analyzed in relationship to the reserve boundaries. In particular, the third scenario indicated three distinct possibilities: (1) a drastic distribution contraction in which most of the remaining populations will inhabit restricted areas out of reserve boundaries or will became extinct; (2) restriction of remaining populations mainly within reserve boundaries; and (3) contraction of species distribution pattern but populations remaining within and outside the reserve boundaries. Our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of possible future climate changes on the selection of conservation areas. Accordingly, we believe that our bioclimatic modeling approach represents a useful tool with which to make decisions about the definition of protected areas, once the current potential distribution pattern of some selected species is known.

AB  - Context Spatial conservation prioritization (SCP) has most often been applied to the design of reserve network expansion. In addition to occurrences of species and habitats inside protected area candidate sites, one may also be interested about network-level connectivity considerations. Objectives We applied SCP to the identification of ecological networks to inform the development of a new regional plan for the region of Uusimaa (South-Finland, including the Finnish capital district). Methods Input data were 59 high-quality layers of biotope and species distribution data. We identified ecological networks based on a combination of a Zonation balanced priority ranking map and a weighted range size rarity map, to account for both relative and absolute conservation values in the process. We also identified ecological corridors between protected areas and other ecologically high-priority areas using the corridor retention method of Zonation. Furthermore, we identified candidate sites for habitat restoration. Results We found seven large ecological networks (132-1201 km(2)) which stand out from their surrounding landscape in terms of ecological value and have clear connectivity bottlenecks between them. Highest restoration needs were found between large high-priority sites that are connected via remnant habitat fragments in comparatively highly modified areas. Conclusions Land conversion should be avoided in areas of highest ecological priorities and network-level connectivity. Restoration should be considered for connectivity bottlenecks. Methods described here can be applied in any location where relevant spatial data are available. The present results are actively used by the regional council and municipalities in the region of Uusimaa.

AB  - Mammalian carnivores are affected by various anthropogenic disturbances near urban environments. Urban expansion and increased anthropogenic activity near and in preserved habitats may cause shifts in the current spatial distributions of those species. To predict the effects of future land-use changes on mammalian carnivores, we modeled their current occurrence across former Fort Ord Army Base as a function of urban proximity and road/trail density. We collected detection/nondetection data for domestic dogs, coyotes (Canis latrans), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and bobcats (Lynx rufus) using scent stations. We analyzed our data with likelihood-based occupancy modeling and used evidence ratios based on Akaike information criterion weights to infer the effect of each variable on occurrence and detection probabilities for each species. We used the estimated weighted model coefficients of the predictive variables to create current and future species distribution maps given proposed landscape changes in the study area. Domestic dogs were more likely to use areas closer to the urban edge, while gray foxes showed a preference toward inland areas. Detection probability was highest in areas closer to the urban edge for striped skunks and in areas with high road/trail densities for raccoons. Our results suggest that the distribution of domestic dogs will most likely expand with future development, while those of gray foxes will contract. We predict that future land-use changes outside of preserved areas will have an adverse effect on gray foxes within the protected areas.

AB  - Amphibians contribute to Mexico being considered a megadiverse country, due to its high endemism close to 60 %. At least 174 species (48 %) of Mexican amphibians are threatened or critically threatened mainly by anthropogenic factors. The objective of the present work was to describe richness, diversity, distribution patterns, and to identify the microhabitat preferences of anuran species in the Sierra de Quila Protected Natural Area. Field trips were made every two weeks between June and September from 2016 to 2018 to identify anurans watched or listened along the trips. Trails located in six vegetation types were used. Species and microhabitat location of each organism were recorded. A total of 24 species was recorded, being richness and diversity greater at the tropical deciduous forest and gallery forest, nevertheless, some species that have a strong preference for more temperate forests thus generating an important species turnover among vegetation types of the area. Anurans use eight types of microhabitats being the ground the most frequent space (16 species), however, only seven of the 24 species exhibited a significant preference for just one microhabitat. This information will be useful for support and lead the amphibian conservation effort at this Natural Protected Area specifying data about species distribution and their habitat use that serves as a reference for both future scientific and educational studies, focused on the conservation, and understanding of their ecology and distribution.

AB  - To facilitate the adaptive management of subalpine ecosystems in the Korean Peninsula under climate change conditions, we identified the climatic factors that determine the distribution of two dominant subalpine firs (Abies koreana and A. nephrolepis). We also identified sustainable and vulnerable habitats for these species inside and outside of current protected areas under climate change scenarios. The minimum temperature of the coldest month, and the amount of precipitation in the warmest quarter were the most important climatic variables that determined the distribution of these two Abies species. Potential habitats for A. koreana and A. nephrolepis were predicted to decrease to 3.3% and 36.4% of the current areas due to climate change, irrespective of whether inside or outside the protected areas. It was predicted that the potential habitats for A. nephrolepis would be maintained in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula, and sustainable potential habitats outside the protected areas were predicted in central parts of the Korean Peninsula. The potential habitats for A. koreana were predicted to disappear from Is. Jeju and shrink significantly in the Korean Peninsula. These results suggest that, in central parts of the Korean Peninsula, revision of protected areas would be effective in preserving A. nephrolepis under conditions of future climate change. In contrast, revision of protected areas would be insufficient to conserve A. koreana due to their high vulnerability and limited populations. Active management is required to ensure the survival of A. koreana under future climate conditions.

AB  - Climate change can have many negative impacts on wildlife species, and species with narrow distributions are more likely to be significantly affected. In this study, we used ecological niche modeling for species (MaxEnt software) as well as species occurrence data and climate variables to assess the impacts of climate change on the distribution of the grey-shanked douc-an endemic and rare primate species of Vietnam. We used climate data at the current time and two future times (2050 and 2070). Climate data were generated for two climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, together with three climate models ACCESS1-0, GFDL-CM3, and MPI-ESM-LR. We predicted that the distribution of the grey-shanked douc would be sharply reduced by the effects of climate change. The species' suitable distribution range in the future tended to shift toward the center of their current range and to higher mountainous areas. A larger suitable area, in particular highly suitable areas to the north and west of its current potential distribution range, would become less suitable or even unsuitable in 2050 and 2070. Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve and Kon Ka Kinh National Park should be given priority in conservation of the grey-shanked douc because they now support important populations of the species and are in the highly suitable area remaining for the species in the future. The establishment of a new protected area for grey-shanked douc conservation should be considered in Kon Plong District, Kom Tum Province, which will be the center of the species distribution range.

AB  - Peruvian yellow-tailed woolly monkeys (Oreonax flavicauda) are considered Critically Endangered (IUCN Categories A4c). The International Primatological Society also considers them one of the world's 25 most endangered primate species and therefore a conservation priority. However, there is little concerted conservation action, and the existing protected area network may be inadequate to protect this species from extinction. Until recently this species has been the focus of few studies and its distributional limits remain unknown. I present results of a range-wide survey of Oreonax flavicauda in northeastern Peru. I conducted 53 presence/absence field surveys at 43 sites between March 2007 and March 2010, with data collected for an additional 7 sites from other researchers. I chose sites where the species was previously reported or following suggestions from predictive GIS modeling. Oreonax flavicauda was present at 35 sites, all presence records were in Ficus spp.-dominated cloud forests between 1500 and 2650 m above sea level. I give the geographical limits of this species distribution throughout the north, east, and west of its range; the exact extent of its range to the south requires further investigation. Oreonax flavicauda continues to be threatened throughout its range. The major threats I identified at the survey locations were the continued conversion of forests to cattle pasture, opening of new access routes into virgin areas, and both commercial and subsistence hunting. My results suggest that existing conservation measures may be inadequate at protecting this species but that substantial opportunities do exist. Further surveys need to be made in the southern distribution of this species to determine more accurately extant habitat.

AB  - The insect fauna of the Galapagos Islands is considered among the most pristine in the world and is well-studied in the preserved areas. However, introduced species are numerous and damaging, particularly in disturbed areas such as agricultural zones. In this study, we examined the arthropod diversity in two agricultural sites on Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos; a shaded mixed coffee plantation and an abandoned avocado plantation. We combined three sampling techniques to obtain a detailed picture of the invertebrate fauna in the leaf litter and in the lower arbustive zone. We then compared the two sites to assess the variation in arthropod fauna depending on the degree of disturbance. During the study, we collected individuals belonging to 96 taxa within the classes Arachnida, Insecta, Malacostracea and Diplopoda. More than half of the species were either endemic or native, but introduced species constituted the great majority (83.5%) of the sampled specimens. The invasive fire ant Solenopsis geminata Fabricius, 1804 was present in the majority of the samples and constituted almost half of the specimens collected. Although the faunal composition and species richness was similar in both sites, the evenness of species distribution was lower in the more disturbed avocado plantation. The same site hosted more S. geminata, fewer native species, and fewer predatory species than the shaded coffee plantation. We discuss these results by stressing the potential importance of non-intensive agricultural zones for the conservation of biodiversity and the possible impacts of S. geminata on native invertebrates in the Galapagos Islands.

AB  - One of the main aims of protected areas is to be effective in the conservation of target species, i.e. those of the highest conservation concern. The Natura 2000 network (N2000) of protected areas is the main pillar of European action to halt biodiversity loss. Within N2000, special areas of conservation (SACs) are designated to protect habitats and species of the highest conservation interest, i.e. habitats from Annex I and species (other than birds) listed in Annex II of the Habitat Directive. Thus, a critical and urgent task is to assess the effectiveness of N2000 in the protection of these species. Here, we used distribution data for Spanish bats to test whether the species included in Annex II are better represented in N2000 than the remaining bats found in Spain, since SAC sites were specifically designated to protect the former species. In general, we found significantly high overlapping values between species distribution and N2000 sites (both groups of species are in general over-represented in N2000). However, contrary to our expectations, N2000 (even when only SACs were considered) did not offer higher representation values for the species listed in Annex II than for other species. We found that N2000 performed well even for non-target species, and that species from Annex II could have acted as effective umbrella species for the remaining bat species. Finally, the usefulness of including a species in Annex II is discussed, and guidelines to improve the efficiency of the N2000 for bat conservation are offered.

AB  - The Caatinga of north-eastern Brazil is the largest and most diverse seasonally dry tropical forest in the Americas and is home to numerous endemic species. However, only 1.2% of the area is under full protection, and given the ongoing decline of this biome there is an urgent need to expand the protected area network. The Endangered Caatinga howler monkey Alouatta ululata is almost endemic to the Caatinga, and is a potential umbrella species for the protection of its biodiversity. Using all available distribution data and our own surveys we applied Maxent and Zonation spatial modelling to identify the range of A. ululata, and priority conservation areas for the species, maximizing habitat quality and connectivity, and minimizing conservation constraints. The top 10% priority areas cover 34,400 km(2) and mostly coincide with good remnants of Caatinga. Only priority areas in the northern part of the species' range are protected, so it is essential to create new protected areas in the centre and south of the range. Maxent modelling indicates that the species depends on good tree cover, but even inside protected areas we observed recent deforestation, illustrating the urgency to improve management. Maxent also indicated that aridity limits the species' range, and therefore the ongoing aridification of the Caatinga is a threat to its future. The protection of A. ululata requires establishing new protected areas in priority locations and improving management of existing protected areas. Preservation of priority areas for the Caatinga howler monkey also represents an opportunity for the conservation of other important biodiversity in the region.

AB  - Background: Succulents are characteristic species of dry ecosystems. Of the environmental characters of the site, the slopes are runoff areas and they tend to be even drier. On the slopes succulent species of economic and ecological importance are established.
   Hypothesis: There are no differences in the floristic composition and ecological attributes of succulents on the slopes of different orientation at the Yagul Natural Monument.
   Data description: density, coverage and frequency; edaphic variables.
   Study site: Yagul, Tlacolula, Oaxaca a 1,600 m asl. Geographical coordinates 16 degrees 58' 26 '' y 16 degrees 55' 56 '' N, 96 degrees 28' 17 '' y 96 degrees 25' 51 '' W.
   Methods: Calculation of importance values. Through multivariate methods the floristic similarity among slopes was compared, and topographic and edaphic variables related to the species distribution were analyzed.
   Results: The richness of succulents in Yagul was 21 species; those with the highest IVI were Opuntia pubescens present in all slope orientations, Hechtia pringlei on the north slope, O. pilifera in the south and Myrtillocactus schenckii on the east and west slopes. The north-facing slopes showed the greatest floristic difference from the rest. The most important edaphic variables in the distribution of populations were the content of organic matter and phosphorus.
   Conclusions: There is a difference in the floristic composition between slopes; the sites on the northern slope have the lowest richness and differ from the rest. The sites of the southern slope have a higher content of organic matter and phosphorus, which favors species such as Stenocereus treleasei and S. stellatus.

AB  - France has always enjoyed a rich ichthyological history, with major changes in populations, especially in the last two hundred years. As it stands, France's current freshwater fish communities is the result of many past and present phenomena still taking place within various time scales. Studying the changes from the late Tertiary to the current period is essential if one is to conserve and manage this ichthyofauna.
   For example, many problems, or even conflicts, resulting from species introductions can take on a different character when the specificity and the history of the catchment area concerned are taken into account.
   This work investigates therefore what contribution studies in biogeography, palaeontology, archaeoichthyology, ecology and history can make towards a better understanding of the evolution of fish communities in France.
   It focuses first on Tertiary fossils and fish remains from the Quaternary, setting those in a European and national context, followed by a study on ancient and current distributions of the various species, using specific tools.
   This work puts forward certain reference communities for the main catchment areas in France thus defining a reference state and making it possible to compare the current state of species distribution with this reference state, in order to measure the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors on the changes in communities in the last 5000 years.
   Taking these changes in distributions and populations into account, this work draws up the list of threatened species and puts forward conservation measures based on their ecology, while suggesting action plans for each species; it also analyses the part played by the protected area in the conservation of the ichthyofauna.

AB  - The roan antelope Hippotragus equinus, Africa's second largest antelope species, is widely distributed throughout Africa. Many populations are isolated, occur at low densities, and are declining. The species' interactions with and adaptations to the diverse environmental conditions throughout its geographic range remain largely unknown. Most studies have taken place in southern Africa, near the range limit for the species; few studies have been conducted on the historically large Central and West African populations. We reviewed available published and accessible unpublished data related to the ecology of roan antelope. We aim to: 1) review available taxonomic, abundance, distribution, and population trend data; 2) describe the threats faced by the roan antelope, and establish whether sufficient data exist to describe its ecological requirements; and 3) highlight the relevance of conserving this species throughout Africa and suggest where research on survival requirements should be focussed. Roan antelope populations throughout Africa are declining due to natural and anthropogenic threats. Methodological irregularities result in uncertainty and non-comparable population data between studies. Large gaps exist in our knowledge of roan antelope diet and regional movements. Information on the population genetics of roan antelope is needed in order to assess the connectedness of different populations. Data deficiency severely impedes our ability to employ powerful analytical methods aimed at understanding and predicting population persistence and viability, and to model envisaged threats from impending climate change. A unified approach to fundamental ecological research is required to inform the conservation and management of large rare mammalian ungulates such as the roan antelope in Africa.

AB  - Feeding wildlife for the purpose of tourism is a contentious issue with for and against arguments being raised by tour operators, non-governmental organisations, researchers, and managers. Despite this situation, there is a growing trend in the feeding of marine wildlife to guarantee visitors an exciting up-close experience. This review investigates the scope and key findings of research conducted on the impacts and social aspects of tourism related wild fish feeding. This systematic quantitative literature review identified 58 peer-reviewed articles on feeding wild fish for tourism. Of those articles, 35 (60%) reported on ecological impacts on the fish. Only 14 articles explored fish feeding tourism from a social perspective, and of those only 9 (15%) investigated the perspectives of visitors. This review highlights that the impacts and management of complex human-wildlife interactions, such as feeding wild fish, are case and species specific. The impacts of feeding wild fish for tourism include changes in species distribution and behaviour, negative health effects, increased predation of some fish species, and risk of injury to tourists. There is less research on social aspects such as visitor attitudes and satisfaction with fish feeding operations. Further studies are required on visitor demand and interests, and the ecological implications of provisioning to ensure the scenarios in which fish feeding occur are sustainable, maximizing the tourism experience while minimizing negative impacts on fish populations. It is important that progress is made towards developing appropriate codes of conduct and nationally and internationally accredited standards of practice.

AB  - Identifying well suited sites for spatial conservation measures to protect mobile species is a challenging task. Intraand interannual movements of individuals due to foraging, reproduction and environmental change make it difficult to identify the best placed locations. This study presents a generic approach for determining a species' consistent core areas in space and time by using point abundance data from annual surveys. For this approach no statistical modelling is required and thereby it is well suited to obtain distribution maps for all surveyed species without knowledge on environmental predictors, thereby ignoring any issues related to data availability, quality and model confidence. Generating distribution maps for a suite of demersal fish species by using data from a scientific fisheries survey allowed to identify consistent core areas for 53 species in winter and summer over a period of 21 years (1998-2018). By overlaying single species' distribution maps, hotspots of fish diversity could be compared to designated sites of marine protected areas (MPA) within the European Natura 2000 network. A majority of the identified diversity hotspots as well as the core areas of threatened and endangered species are currently not overlapping with the designated Natura 2000 MPAs. These MPAs might therefore not contribute sufficiently to the protection of marine demersal fish as an important component of marine ecosystems. Alter native spatial management options and tools implemented through other marine policies are needed to amend the Natura 2000 MPA network for the effective conservation of demersal fish in the North Sea.

AB  - Global biodiversity is declining rapidly, posing a severe threat to ecosystem functions and services. Protected Areas (PAs) can be extremely effective in protecting biodiversity, but conservation gaps arise as a result of poor consideration of land-use change and its impacts, and of integrated planning based on representative ecological indicators. New approaches are available to identify conservation priorities for new comprehensive PAs and ensure that endangered species are effectively protected, we used the Habitat Quality module in the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, and the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model to assess a protected area in Xishuangbanna tropical area, China. The results revealed unprotected biodiversity hotspots occupying a total area of 4669.60 km(2), or 24.37% of the total area of Xishuangbanna, including a key conservation gap of 1228.85 km(2) (6.08% of total area). The conservation priorities outside PAs were mainly distributed in north-east Xishuangbanna, followed by the south-east (scattered distribution). This indicates that existing PAs do not offer adequate protection for local biodiversity. Our combined modeling (MaxEnt-InVEST) framework proved successful in creating maps of conservation gaps of biodiversity hotspots based on actual species distribution data and can consider current land uses. For well-targeted organized planning in local PAs, obligations and objectives of international agreements need to be met and scientific interventions for protecting key habitats of the endangered species need to be delineated. We also identified a need for incorporating reliable monitoring and management networks into global biodiversity assessment and conservation.

AB  - Bridging information gaps in an animal's habitat configuration is an explicit challenge in planning habitat protection actions (HPAs) for marine megafauna species near sites of intense anthropogenic activity. This challenge is further complicated by inadequate field survey designs and data manipulation that likely bias habitat configuration baselines. In this study, the likely habitat configuration of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, in the Chinese provinces of Fujian and Guangdong was projected using species distribution modeling (SDM). The influence of inadequate survey design and data manipulation of the baseline presentation was explored by comparing the SDM results from different datasets with current knowledge of humpback dolphin distributions in Chinese waters. Only the SDM based on data from systematically designed surveys projected a habitat configuration matching the current humpback dolphin distribution in China. The likely habitat configuration of humpback dolphins was characterized by high primary productivity and a shallow water depth. This study showed that ecosystem service losses, indexed by CO2 absorption, due to coastal alteration activities need to be factored into environmental impact assessments. Sound HPA practices include sharing information between research teams, mitigating the adverse impacts of anthropogenic activities, associating protected area networking with regional maritime spatial planning, monitoring coastal landscapes and seascape baselines, reducing land-based pollution, restoring degraded habitats for aquatic biota, and recovering land-to-sea connectivity. These measures require comprehensive coordination and collaboration between scientific research teams, policy representatives, NGOs/NPOs and stakeholder groups.

AB  - Fishing cat populations appear to have declined significantly in recent years due to the loss and fragmentation of inland and coastal wetland habitats. Moreover, there are still large gaps in data on population and density estimates, and threat evaluation, which are vital for conservation assessments. This research aimed to help fill these critical knowledge gaps. Our study is the first density estimate for fishing cat from mainland Southeast Asia. We conducted a camera-trap survey and used a spatially-explicit capture-recapture analytical framework to estimate the abundance of fishing cats in and around Khao Sam Roi Yot area (KSRY), which hosts an isolated, threatened population of the felid in Thailand. We also conducted interviews among adjacent communities to better understand local perspectives toward fishing cats, conflict with local people, and as a consequence of both, anthropogenic threats to the population. Over 6966 trap-days, we identified at least 33 individual adult cats and based on our top model (g0 similar to bk, sigma similar to h2), we estimated fishing cat density to be 18 +/- SE 6 individuals/100 km(2) (95% CI 10 - 33). Among 80 interviewees, we recorded 25 incidents of conflict, most relating to raids on poultry (n = 18) and damage to fishing gear in pursuit of fish (n = 5). Land use type, land use change, and human activity, did not significantly affect fishing cat density and movements. Our findings further suggest that a proposed tax policy governing land use may force landowners to convert suitable fishing cat habitat to unsuitable areas, resulting in the loss of up to 30% of existing suitable habitat from our study area. We also found that local communities would support either an exemption for landowners not wishing to develop suitable fishing cat habitat, and/or an additional policies that incentivize the maintenance and/or preservation of areas suitable for fishing cats. Finally, we conclude that the official presence of park officers in communities beyond the protected area would be beneficial, as would the implementation of public outreach programming to mitigate negative attitudes toward fishing cats, and provide recommendations on strategies for coexisting with them.

AB  - Understanding the area use requirements of species targeted for protection by marine protected areas (MPAs) is critical to the future conservation efforts of economically important fish species. Knowledge of home range size and site fidelity is essential in determining whether species will benefit from the protection offered by a MPA, the size of the area needed to protect individuals, and the extent to which surrounding unprotected areas may be supplemented through post-recruitment movement or "spillover". We utilized a traditional mark and recapture approach, along with GIS spatial analysis to investigate the site fidelity, home range, and homing behavior of the economically important fish species cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus) on the south central coast of California. In collaboration with members of the commercial live-fish fishery, a total of 1240 sub-adult and adult cabezon were tagged during 10 days of fishing from September to December of 2004 along similar to 18 km of coastline. A public awareness and reward program resulted in 330 total recaptures from 290 different individuals (23% recapture rate) with recaptured individuals at liberty up to 1000 days after initial tagging. A majority of individuals displayed high site fidelity, with 81% of recapture events occurring within 100 m of their initial capture locations, and only 9 individuals (.03%) recaptured greater than 1 km. Most individuals (64%) displayed home ranges less than 1000 m(2). Ten individuals recaptured after experiencing translocation of up to 5.3 km displayed strong homing behavior, returning to within 14 m of their initial capture locations. Findings suggest that under circumstances where suitable habitat is available in nearby unprotected areas, that adult "spillover" will likely be limited to areas within 100 m from MPA boundaries. In addition, the size of the area needed to protect individual cabezon, should be at least 1000 m(2). Findings from this study demonstrate many of the potential benefits of scientists and fishers working together to investigate area use patterns of economically important fish species to facilitate future design and assessment of MPAs.

AB  - Taxonomic and geographic biases in ecological research are widely recognised. In addition, information bias within a species can impact our understanding of their biology. This can lead to an underestimation of potential intra-or inter-population level variation and plasticity, and incomplete inferences about species response curves across environmental gradients. The consequences of these 'species stereotypes' are misestimation of the potential niche and narrow, potentially biased, views of habitat and diet preferences. For example, species may be characterised as ecologically static, or a habitat, diet, or prey 'specialist'. Several factors can contribute to the formation of a 'stereotype', including a focus on extant populations, or a subset of them, that only partially represent the full historical distribution of a species, and an emphasis on species interactions derived from a small number of potential communities. Such species stereotypes are likely widespread and impact on many taxa. These misconceptions can have knock-on effects for conservation programmes and lead to ineffective or harmful conservation interventions such as actively managing species in marginal habitats, not identifying key threats and incorrect predictions of vulnerability to environmental change. Recognising biases is vital to addressing these potential problems and providing accurate information for conservation programmes. Biases can be identified by evaluating historical distributions, translocations within historical distributions, developing mechanistic distribution models and assessing traditional ecological knowledge. We suggest that explicit assessment of biases and potential stereotypes are included in red listing or species assessments, biodiversity action plans, and protected area network design and evaluation.

AB  - Unprecedented poaching levels triggered by demand for ivory in Far East Asia are threatening the persistence of African elephant Loxodonta africana. Southern African countries make an important contribution to elephant conservation and could soon become the last stronghold of elephant conservation in Africa. While the ecological factors affecting elephant distribution and densities have extensively been accounted for, there is a need to understand which socioeconomic factors affect elephant numbers in order to prevent conflict over limited space and resources with humans. We used elephant count data from aerial surveys for seven years in a generalized linear model, which accounted for temporal correlation, to investigate the effect of six socioeconomic and ecological variables on the number of elephant at the country level in the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area (GMTFCA). Important factors in predicting elephant numbers were the proportion of total land surface under cultivation, human population density and the number of tourists visiting the country. Specifically, elephant numbers were higher where the proportion of total land surface under cultivation was the lowest; where population density was the lowest and where tourist numbers had increased over the years. Our results confirm that human disturbance is affecting elephant numbers, but highlight that the benefits provided by ecotourism could help enhance elephant conservation. While future studies should include larger areas and more detailed data at the site level, we stress that the development of coordinated legislation and policies to improve land-use planning are needed to reduce the impact of increasing human populations and agriculture on elephant.

AB  - Climate change impacts are important in shaping large ecotones, such as the transition zone between the Cerrado and Amazon rainforest (CAT) biogeographical domains. The accelerating rate of conversion of native vegetation, the most important factor for biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene, compounded by projected climate change impacts, requires a review of the effectiveness of existing designated protected areas (PA) and indigenous land (IL), where low-intensity and low-impact land use prevails. We identified priority tree species for conservation and quantified changes in their projected spatial distribution in future climate scenarios to estimate the conservation effectiveness of the current network of PA and IL in the CAT. Applying niche-based models to compare the geographical range of species in current and future climates, we estimated the displacement of species from their current distribution owing to projected climate change. We used four different IPCC emission scenarios for 2050 and quantified the losses or gains in species richness in PA and IL. All species were projected to suffer a reduction of climatically suitable area and a consequent range reduction. Inside both PA and IL there was a projected decrease in richness of the target species under climate change. The current PA network and designated IL in the CAT do not appear to safeguard future conservation of the species they currently contain. The future 'climate refugia' that our work identified could form the basis of plans to expand the protected area network in a region that remains under ever increasing pressure of deforestation in Brazil.

AB  - The biodiversity data typically available for fitting distributional models in the tropics come from museum and scientific collections which are often incomplete and prone to sampling and environmental biases. Nevertheless, most studies undertaken in tropical regions assume that collection data offers a satisfactory environmental coverage without any quantitative assessment. In this study, we investigate the effects of differences in environmental bias and coverage provided by distributional data when aggregated into different grid cell sizes, on the performance of species richness-environment models and predictions. We use an extensive data compilation, including national and regional collections, on the distribution of amphibians, reptiles and fishes in the hydrologic region of the Usumacinta River as a case study. General additive models and environmental variables are used to construct predictive models at 40, 20, 10 and 5 km grid resolutions, based on well-sampled cells. The best multivariate models included nonparametric interaction terms for the effects of precipitation and temperature and suggested an altitudinal shift in the relative importance of energy and water in determining the distribution of species richness. For fishes, geomorphology accounted for fine scale variation in species richness along the hydrologic network, indicated by peaks in species diversity at the junction of the major rivers where major accumulation of water and sediments occurs. For all taxonomic groups, we found that sampling biases deviated most from the mean bias at the extremes of gradients accounting for important environmental factors. The pattern of environmental bias changed with grid size, with the form and amount of change being casespecific. Biases affected distribution predictions when compared with unbiased datasets. Moreover, not all models resulted best at coarser resolution as it is commonly assumed. Our results demonstrate that bias in the available data must be evaluated before mapping biodiversity distributions, irrespective of the choice of scale.

AB  - Aim: Biodiversity loss is a major driver of ecosystem change, yet the ecological data required to detect and mitigate losses are often lacking. Recently, camera trap surveys have been suggested as a method for sampling local wildlife communities, because these observations can be collated into a global monitoring network. To demonstrate the potential of camera traps for global monitoring, we assembled data from multiple local camera trap surveys to evaluate the interchange between fine- and broad-scale processes impacting mammalian carnivore communities.
   Location: Argentina, Belize, Botswana, Canada, Indonesia, Iran, Madagascar, Nepal, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and the U.S.A.
   Methods: We gathered camera trap data, totalling >100,000 trap nights, from across five continents. To analyse local and species-specific responses to anthropogenic and environmental variables, we fitted multispecies occurrence models to each study area. To analyse global-level responses, we then fitted a multispecies, multi-area occurrence model.
   Results: We recorded 4,805 detections of 96 mammalian carnivore species photographed across 1,714 camera stations located in 12 countries. At the global level, our models revealed that carnivore richness and occupancy within study areas was positively associated with prey availability. Occupancy within study areas also tended to increase with greater protection and greater distances to roads. The strength of these relationships, however, differed among countries.
   Main conclusions: We developed a research framework for leveraging global camera trap data to evaluate patterns of mammalian carnivore occurrence and richness across multiple spatial scales. Our research highlights the importance of intact prey populations and protected areas in conserving carnivore communities. Our research also highlights the potential of camera traps for monitoring wildlife communities and provides a case study for how this can be achieved on a global scale. We encourage greater integration and standardization among camera trap studies worldwide, which would help inform effective conservation planning for wildlife populations both locally and globally.

AB  - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) often have dual goals of protecting biodiversity and increasing sustainability of fisheries. To understand how MPAs are performing at these goals, evaluation of fish biomass outcomes against management targets is needed. However, the evaluation of performance should consider multiple biophysical and social drivers that vary over the seascape to inform spatially explicit targets for fish biomass. Including spatial variation when evaluating MPA performance is particularly important for MPA networks because it enables managers to set more realistic expectations for MPA outcomes and adapt management across individual areas. Here we develop a modelling approach to predict how fishing pressure and biophysical conditions affect expected recovery of fish biomass. We apply the approach to model herbivore and predator biomass at 57 sites for two MPAs in Raja Ampat, Indonesia. We then use this model to predict biomass recovery towards reference sites indicative of low-fishing pressure. We found that historical fishing pressure, wave exposure and proximity to coastal habitats were all important determinants of pre-MPA fish biomass. Our predictions therefore, indicated the implemented MPA no-take zones should have some of the highest reef fish biomass based on both their location within the MPA, and the removal of fishing pressure. We also identify sites that may be underperforming and warrant further management, for instance, further investigation of poaching as a cause of poor recovery trends. We suggest that evaluation of MPA performance needs to consider the link to historical fishing pressure and biophysical conditions with biodiversity outcomes.

AB  - Aim To assess the scale of variation for major environmental gradients in Norway. To obtain a step-less model for this variation and to use this model to evaluate the extent to which the consensus expert classification of Norway into vegetation regions can be predicted from environmental variables. To discuss the potential of step-less models for understanding natural variation at regional scales, for stratification and for predictive modelling of species distributions and land-cover types.
   Location The mainland of Norway.
   Methods Fifty-four climatic, topographical, hydrological and geological variables were recorded for grid cells with spatial resolution (grain size) of 1 x 1, 5 x 5 and 10 x 10 km, spanning the entire mainland of Norway. Principal components analyses (PCA) were used to summarize variation in three primary data matrices and three random subsets of these.
   Results The first four principal components explained between 75% and 85% of the variation in the data sets. All PCAs revealed four consistent environmental gradients, in order of decreasing importance: (1) regional variation (gradient) from coast to inland and from oceanic/humid to continental areas; (2) regional variation from north to south and from high to low altitudes; (3) regional variation from north to south and from inland to coast, related to solar radiation; and (4) topographic (terrain relief) variation on finer scales than (1-3). The first two PCA axes corresponded to the two bioclimatic gradients used in expert classifications of Norway into biogeographical regions: vegetation sections (from highly oceanic to slightly continental) and vegetation zones (from nemoral to alpine).
   Main conclusions Our PCA analyses substantiate the current view of bioclimatic regional vegetation variation in Norway, provide an explicit characterization of this variation in terms of climatic variables, and show that environmental variability can be reproduced as GIS layers in step-less models. These models have the potential to become important tools for future predictive modelling within resource management, conservation planning and biogeographical (and other ecological) research.

AB  - Questions: Environmental filtering and niche differences influence assembly of tree communities at multiple spatial scales. At regional scales, determining the environmental variables that primarily influence compositional variation in species assemblages reveals ecologically relevant habitat types for conservation. Strength of species' association with these habitats and differences in species occurrence along environmental gradients lend credence to niche-based assembly and help estimate responses of tree communities to natural or human-mediated environmental change.
   Location: Western Ghats, India.
   Methods: We analysed an openly available data set of ca. 62 000 trees (>10 cm DBH) in 96 1-ha plots across a 22 000 km(2) landscape, using multivariate regression trees (MRT) to identify compositional groups related to combinations of temperature, rainfall and soil type. Next, we conducted indicator species analysis to assess species associations with habitats. We then compared species richness and diversity among habitats. Finally, to discern niche overlap we assessed pair-wise differences between species in their abundance distributions along environmental gradients.
   Results: Environmental gradients clearly influenced landscape-scale tree assemblages in this region. Nine ecological habitat types were identified: annual rainfall was the most important variable driving compositional differences, followed by temperature, seasonality and soils. Approximately 17% of 398 species tested were associated with single habitats. Number of species associations and local diversity varied significantly among habitats. Between 29 and 50% of species pairs showed significant differences in their distributions along environmental gradients considered.
   Conclusions: Relating compositionally defined tree assemblages to combinations of abiotic variables allows ecologically robust recognition of habitat types for conservation planning. Compositional differences structured by annual rainfall and temperature suggests that climate change can impact species persistence and tree community composition in the Western Ghats. Specifically, future research should assess drought response of forests by examining recruitment and survival of species in different combinations of rainfall, temperature and human disturbances.

AB  - Predictive models are frequently used to define the most suitable areas for species protection or reintroduction. Land-cover variables can be used in different ways for distribution modelling. The surface area of a set of land-cover classes is often used, each land-cover presence/absence or the distance to them from any point of the study area can be preferred; multiple types of landcover variables may be combined to produce a single model. This paper assesses whether different approaches to using land-cover variables may lead to different ecological conclusions when interpreted for conservation by focusing on the distribution of the salamader Salamandra salamandra longirostris, an endangered amphibian subspecies in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Twenty-eight land-cover classes and another 42 environmental variables were used to construct four different models. Three models used a unique type of land-cover variable: either the presence of each class, the surface area of each class or the distance to each class, with all three variable types jointly entered in a fourth model. All models attained acceptable scores according to some criteria (discrimination, descriptive and predictive capacities, classification accuracy and parsimony); however most of the assessment parameters computed indicated a better performance of the models using either the surface area of land classes or the distance to them from every sampled square, compared to the model using class presences. The best scores were obtained with the fourth model, which combined different types of land-cover variables. This model suggested that oak forest fragmentation in favour of herbaceous crops and pastures may have negative effects on the distribution of S. s. longirostris. This was only partially suggested by the first three models, which considered a single type of land-cover variable, demonstrating the importance of considering a multi-variable analysis for conservation planning.

AB  - Surveys that record the presence or absence of fauna are used widely in wildlife management and research. A false absence occurs when an observer fails to record a resident species. There is a growing appreciation of the importance of false absences in wildlife surveys and its influence on impact assessment, monitoring, habitat analyses, and population modeling. Very few studies explicitly quantify the rate of these errors. Quantifying the rate of false absences provides a basis for estimating the survey effort necessary to assert that a species is absent with a pre-specified degree of confidence and allows uncertainty arising from false absences to be incorporated in inference. We estimated the rate of false absences for 2 species of forest owl and 4 species of arboreal marsupial based on 8 repeat visits to 50 survey locations in south-eastern Australia. We obtained estimates using a generalized zero-inflated binomial model. We presented detectability curves for each species to convey the number of visits required to achieve a specified level of confidence that resident species will be detected. The observation error rates we calculated were substantial but varied between species. For the least detectable species, the powerful owl (Ninox strenua), our standard surveys returned false absences on 87% of visits. However, our surveys of the more detectable sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) returned a 45% false absence rate. We predict that approximately 18 visits would be required to be 90% sure of detecting resident owls and approximately 5 visits would provide 90% confidence of detecting resident sugar gliders. We fitted hierarchical logistic regression models to the data to describe the variation in detection rates explained by environmental variables. We found that temperature, rainfall, and habitat quality influenced the detectability of most species. Consideration of observation error rates could result in important changes to resource management and conservation planning.

AB  - Oases are common in desert regions of northwestern China and are major sites for human settlement. The implementation of oasis conservation planning has led to afforestation with appropriate shrubs and trees in the native grasslands surrounding inhabited oases. However, little is known about how this Land use change from native grassland to shrub and tree plantations influences the composition of ground-dwelling arthropod communities and the performance of their different trophic groups. To address this, we measured activity density, taxon richness, and relative abundance of four different ground arthropod trophic groups (spiders, beetle predators, beetle herbivores, and beetle detritivores) and several environmental variables affecting arthropod distributions (vegetation cover, ground temperature, soil moisture, soil properties, and leaf litter) along an experimentally established land use change gradient of a mature shrub (Haloxylon ammodendron) planation, a mature poplar (Populus gansuensis) plantation and a mature pine (Pinus sylvestris) plantation, as well as a native grassland from which all cultivated systems were converted. We found that converted shrub plantation had much lower activity density of predatory, herbivorous, and detritivorous beetles; similar activity density of spiders; and similar taxa richness of all four trophic groups relative to the native grassland. However, converted forest plantations regardless of tree species had much higher activity density of spiders, lower activity density of the three beetle groups, much higher richness of predatory beetles, and lower richness of herbivorous and detritivorous beetles. We also found a change in the composition of the ground arthropod community that was largely driven by changes in ground temperature and leaf litter mass. We conclude that conversion of native grassland to shrub and tree plantations can significantly affect ground-dwelling arthropod communities, reducing the activity of ground-dwelling beetle assemblages while increasing that of ground-dwelling spider assemblages. These findings are important for conserving native arthropod diversity in desert ecosystems.

AB  - The geographic distribution of Bornean orang-utans and its overlap with existing land-use categories (protected areas, logging and plantation concessions) is a necessary foundation to prioritize conservation planning. Based on an extensive orang-utan survey dataset and a number of environmental variables, we modelled an orang-utan distribution map. The modelled orang-utan distribution map covers 155,106 km(2) (21% of Borneo's landmass) and reveals four distinct distribution areas. The most important environmental predictors are annual rainfall and land cover. The overlap of the orang-utan distribution with land-use categories reveals that only 22% of the distribution lies in protected areas, but that 29% lies in natural forest concessions. A further 19% and 6% occurs in largely undeveloped oil palm and tree plantation concessions, respectively. The remaining 24% of the orang-utan distribution range occurs outside of protected areas and outside of concessions. An estimated 49% of the orang-utan distribution will be lost if all forest outside of protected areas and logging concessions is lost. To avoid this potential decline plantation development in orang-utan habitats must be halted because it infringes on national laws of species protection. Further growth of the plantation sector should be achieved through increasing yields in existing plantations and expansion of new plantations into areas that have already been deforested. To reach this goal a large scale island-wide land-use masterplan is needed that clarifies which possible land uses and managements are allowed in the landscape and provides new standardized strategic conservation policies. Such a process should make much better use of non-market values of ecosystem services of forests such as water provision, flood control, carbon sequestration, and sources of livelihood for rural communities. Presently land use planning is more driven by vested interests and direct and immediate economic gains, rather than by approaches that take into consideration social equity and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Objectives: We quantify spatial turnover in communities of 1939 plant and 59 mammal species at 2.5 km resolution across a topographically heterogeneous region in south-eastern Australia to identify distributional breaks and low turnover zones where multiple species distributions overlap. Environmental turnover is measured to determine how climate, topography and geology influence biotic turnover differently across a variety of biogeographic breaks and overlaps. We identify the genera driving turnover and confirm the versatility of this approach across spatial scales and locations.
   Methods: Directional moving window analyses, rotated through 360 degrees, were used to measure spatial turnover variation in different directions between gridded cells containing georeferenced plant and mammal occurrences and environmental variables. Generalised linear models were used to compare taxic turnover results with equivalent analyses for geology, regolith weathering, elevation, slope, solar radiation, annual precipitation and annual mean temperature, both uniformly across the entire study area and by stratifying it into zones of high and low turnover. Identified breaks and transitions were compared to a conservation bioregionalisation framework widely used in Australia.
   Results/Significance: Detailed delineations of plant and mammal turnover zones with gradational boundaries denoted subtle variation in species assemblages. Turnover patterns often diverged from bioregion boundaries, though plant turnover adhered most closely. A prominent break zone contained either comparable or greater numbers of unique genera than adjacent overlaps, but these were concentrated in a small subsection relatively under-protected by conservation reserves. The environmental correlates of biotic turnover varied for different turnover zones in different subsections of the study area. Topography and temperature showed much stronger relationships with plant turnover in a topographically complex overlap, relative to a lowland overlap where weathering was most predictive. This method can quantify transitional turnover patterns from small to broad extents, at different resolutions for any location, and complements broad-scale bioregionalisation schemes in conservation planning.

AB  - Species occurrence and abundance models are important tools that can be used in biodiversity conservation, and can be applied to predict or plan actions needed to mitigate the environmental impacts of hydropower dams. In this study our objectives were: (i) to model the occurrence and abundance of threatened plant species, (ii) to verify the relationship between predicted occurrence and true abundance, and (iii) to assess whether models based on abundance are more effective in predicting species occurrence than those based on presence-absence data. Individual representatives of nine species were counted within 388 randomly georeferenced plots (10 m x 50 m) around the Barra Grande hydropower dam reservoir in southern Brazil. We modelled their relationship with 15 environmental variables using both occurrence (Generalised Linear Models) and abundance data (Hurdle and Zero-Inflated models). Overall, occurrence models were more accurate than abundance models. For all species, observed abundance was significantly, although not strongly, correlated with the probability of occurrence. This correlation lost significance when zero-abundance (absence) sites were excluded from analysis, but only when this entailed a substantial drop in sample size. The same occurred when analysing relationships between abundance and probability of occurrence from previously published studies on a range of different species, suggesting that future studies could potentially use probability of occurrence as an approximate indicator of abundance when the latter is not possible to obtain. This possibility might, however, depend on life history traits of the species in question, with some traits favouring a relationship between occurrence and abundance. Reconstructing species abundance patterns from occurrence could be an important tool for conservation planning and the management of threatened species, allowing scientists to indicate the best areas for collection and reintroduction of plant germplasm or choose conservation areas most likely to maintain viable populations.

AB  - Background
   Species traits affect how a species interacts with the environment and other species and thus determine the role of the species in an ecosystem. They affect not only population dynamics of a species across space and over time, but also community structure and function through their key role in the community assembly processes. Information on species traits is also highly relevant for conservation planning as they determine the adaptive ability of a species in the face of environmental changes. However, information on species traits is usually scarce and sparsely distributed amongst diverse types of literature and sources. Difficulty in accessing comprehensive information on species traits has formed an essential knowledge gap, limiting our understanding of biodiversity patterns and ecosystem functioning and preventing effective conservation. Even for birds, a well-studied taxon, comprehensive trait information is still unavailable or distributed across different sources for many species.
   New information
   In this study, we compiled information from a variety of sources on 23 traits for all breeding birds, including 157 resident and 14 summer visiting species, in Taiwan and surrounding islands. The 23 traits include those related to the movement patterns, morphology, geographic distributions, activity patterns, feeding behaviour, habitat use, and breeding behaviour and strategies of the species. The trait information was obtained, not only from published literature and datasets, but also from unpublished banding records and specimen measurements. The dataset also contains derived traits, including the elevation and temperature boundaries of species distribution ranges in Taiwan. In addition, structured information on nest characters, which is seldom compiled in trait datasets, has been made available, for the first time, for the breeding birds in Taiwan. Therefore, the most comprehensive trait dataset to date on breeding birds in Taiwan will allow trait-based research and applications in diverse topics and thus enhance our understanding of the patterns and dynamics of breeding bird diversity and its functions in Taiwan.

AB  - As freshwater habitats are among the most endangered, there is an urgent need to identify critical areas for conservation, especially those that are home to endangered species. The Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) is a semi-aquatic mammal whose basic ecological requirements are largely unknown, hindering adequate conservation planning even though it is considered as a threatened species. Species distribution modelling is challenging for freshwater species. Indeed, the complexity of aquatic ecosystems (e.g., linear and hierarchical ordering) must be taken into account as well as imperfect sampling. High-quality and relevant hydrological descriptors should also be used. To understand the influence of environmental covariates on the occupancy and detection of the Pyrenean desman, we combine both a robust sign-survey data set (i.e. with genetic validation ensuring true presence information) and a hydrological model to simulate the flow regime across a whole catchment. Markovian site-occupancy analysis, taking into account sign detection and based on spatially adjacent replicates, indicated a positive influence of heterogeneity of substrate and shelters, and a negative influence of flow variability on Pyrenean desman detection. This valuable information should help to improve monitoring programs for this endangered species. Our results also highlighted a spatially clustered distribution and a positive influence of stream flow and number of tributaries on occupancy. Hence, modifications of flow regime (e.g. hydropower production, irrigation, climate change) and habitat fragmentation appear to be major threats for this species, altering the connectivity between tributaries and the mainstream river as well as between adjacent sub-catchments.

AB  - AimThe study of areas of sympatry of species with predominantly parapatric distributions can provide valuable insights into their evolutionary history and the factors shaping patterns of species co-occurrence. This information is key in biogeography, evolutionary biology and conservation planning. In this study we analyse the distributions of two pairs of partially co-occurring congeneric amphibian species: tree frogs (Hyla molleri and H. meridionalis) and midwife toads (Alytes obstetricans and A. cisternasii).
   LocationIberian Peninsula (SW Europe).
   MethodsWe obtained distribution data from the herpetological atlases of Portugal and Spain, consisting of presences and absences on UTM 10x10km grid cells. We built an environmental favourability model for each species, using 24 potential predictor variables representative of physiography, climate and human activity. Variables were selected for each model using both information and significance criteria. Models were evaluated using both calibration and discrimination measures. Models were then combined using fuzzy intersection, and compared using correlation analysis (accounting for spatial autocorrelation), niche comparison metrics and fuzzy similarity indices.
   ResultsWe found significant dissimilarity between the favourability patterns for A. obstetricans and A. cisternasii, indicating environmental segregation of these two midwife toad species. In tree frogs, we found significant similarity between favourability for H. meridionalis and for its co-occurrence with H. molleri - that is, sympatry occurs mainly in areas that are favourable for H. meridionalis.
   Main conclusionsThese results provide clues to understand the evolutionary history of these four species, including the evolution of reproductive isolation, and suggest that conservation efforts for tree frogs may be focused on the areas that are favourable for both species, whereas midwife toads will require specific measures tailored for each species.

AB  - Species restricted to archipelagos are often range-restricted, dispersal limited, and persist as disjunct populations. These attributes can make island populations especially vulnerable to extinction from natural or anthropogenic processes. Ascertaining causes of habitat use, population impact, and range loss is fundamental to guiding effective conservation actions. The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) is an endangered, island-endemic species with a highly restricted range distribution limited to a small number of islands in Eastern Indonesia. Flores Island is the largest island (13,540 km(2)) within the species distribution. However, with relatively few and small-protected areas, alongside a much higher incidence of human-related habitat use, Komodo dragon habitat occupancy is suspected to decrease on Flores. Here over five years, we conducted systematic surveys to evaluate Komodo dragon habitat occupancy at 346 camera monitoring stations (CMS) distributed along the Flores coastline. We successfully detected Komodo dragons at 85 of the 346 CMS on Flores. The pattern of Komodo dragon site presence indicated their distribution was confined to three isolated and highly restricted habitat areas on the west, northwestern, and northern coastal regions of Flores. Ranking of competing models indicated that proximity to farms and villages had the strongest negative effects on Komodo dragon habitat occupancy. The current predicted Komodo dragon range distribution appeared to have undergone significant range area contraction (similar to 44%) at multiple coastal areas known to be occupied by the Komodo dragon detected in previous decades (i.e., 1970-2000). We attribute decreased Komodo dragon habitat use and range loss to multiple and cascading human activities. To address these threats, we advocate a range of land use planning and community conservation actions to avoid a potential Komodo dragon extirpation on the largest island habitat within their distribution.

AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding geographic distributions of species is a crucial step in spatial planning for biodiversity conservation, particularly as regards changes in response to global climate change. This information is especially important for species of global conservation concern that are susceptible to the effects of habitat loss and climate change. In this study, we used ecological niche modeling to assess the current and future geographic distributional potential of White-breasted Guineafowl (Agelastes meleagrides) (Vulnerable) across West Africa. MethodsWe used primary occurrence data obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and national parks in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and two independent environmental datasets (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index at 250m spatial resolution, and Worldclim climate data at 2.5 spatial resolution for two representative concentration pathway emissions scenarios and 27 general circulation models for 2050) to build ecological niche models in Maxent.ResultsFrom the projections, White-breasted Guineafowl showed a broader potential distribution across the region compared to the current IUCN range estimate for the species. Suitable areas were concentrated in the Gola rainforests in northwestern Liberia and southeastern Sierra Leone, the Tai-Sapo corridor in southeastern Liberia and southwestern Cote d'Ivoire, and the Nimba Mountains in northern Liberia, southeastern Guinea, and northwestern Cote d'Ivoire. Future climate-driven projections anticipated minimal range shifts in response to climate change.ConclusionsBy combining remotely sensed data and climatic data, our results suggest that forest cover, rather than climate is the major driver of the species' current distribution. Thus, conservation efforts should prioritize forest protection and mitigation of other anthropogenic threats (e.g. hunting pressure) affecting the species.

AB  - The tropical rain forests of Central Africa contain high levels of species diversity. Paleovegetation or bio-diversity patterns suggested successive contraction/expansion phases on this rain forest cover during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Consequently, the hypothesis of the existence of refugia e.g. habitat stability that harbored populations during adverse climatic periods has been proposed. Understory species are tightly associated to forest cover and consequently are ideal markers of forest dynamics. Here, we used two central African rain forest understory species of the palm genus, Podococcus, to assess the role of past climate variation on their distribution and genetic diversity. Species distribution modeling in the present and at the LGM was used to estimate areas of climatic stability. Genetic diversity and phylogeography were estimated by sequencing near complete plastomes for over 120 individuals. Areas of climatic stability were mainly located in mountainous areas like the Monts de Cristal and Monts Doudou in Gabon, but also lowland coastal forests in southeast Cameroon and northeast Gabon. Genetic diversity analyses shows a clear North-South structure of genetic diversity within one species. This divide was estimated to have originated some 500,000 years ago. We show that, in Central Africa, high and unique genetic diversity is strongly correlated with inferred areas of climatic stability since the LGM. Our results further highlight the importance of coastal lowland rain forests in Central Africa as harboring not only high species diversity but also important high levels of unique genetic diversity. In the context of strong human pressure on coastal land use and destruction, such unique diversity hotspots need to be considered in future conservation planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim: Mycorrhizas are among the most common symbioses on Earth, impacting plant community structure and ecosystem functioning, yet little landscape-scale data linking mycorrhizal fungal diversity to biotic and abiotic properties exist to inform conservation. We examined arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity in tropical and temperate locations and identified potential drivers of species distributions and diversity for use as proxy indicators in biodiversity conservation.
   Location: AM fungal communities were documented at 60 sites in the Colorado Plateau in south-western United States and La Gran Sabana in south-eastern Venezuela.
   Methods: Communities of plants and AM fungi and abiotic variables were measured along 50-m transects in three vegetation types (shrublands, forests, and traditional agricultural fields). Model selection and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate environmental predictors of AM fungal diversity and community structure.
   Results: AM fungal species richness (alpha diversity) and community structure, but not among-site turnover (beta diversity), differed between tropical and temperate locations; only 15% of taxa were present in both locations. In unmanaged sites, AM fungal richness was not correlated with plant richness, but instead predicted by soil pH and temperature (temperate) or precipitation and latitude (tropics). The structure of AM fungal communities was influenced by plant identity but not plant diversity in both locations. Traditional, sedentary Hopi agriculture influenced AM fungal communities on the Colorado Plateau, but Pemon shifting slash-and-burn agriculture did not alter AM fungal communities at La Gran Sabana. At both locations, AM fungal community structure was linked to soil texture and nitrogen.
   Main conclusions: Our study demonstrates similarity between tropical and temperate regions in the biotic and abiotic drivers of landscape-scale AM fungal species distributions. Soil and climate as well as habitat heterogeneity may serve as proxy indicators of AM fungal communities for use in conservation planning to preserve the ecosystem functions and services of mycorrhizas.

AB  - 1. Regions of the world with highest biodiversity and greatest conservation needs are often simultaneously data poor. An effective surrogate strategy would be invaluable for conservation prioritization in such regions. Large-scale environmental data are readily available, but the effectiveness of environmental surrogate strategies for conservation planning has not been confirmed. In this study, we compare a range of such strategies.
   2. Environmental surrogacy is based on the idea that by covering a wide range of different environmental conditions, one also achieves high species representation. The effectiveness of this strategy may be enhanced by using community-level modelling techniques, in conjunction with best-available biological (species distribution) data, to calibrate the relationship between environmental gradients and community richness and composition. We develop a novel approach, called maximization of complementary richness, which accounts for gradients in species richness and non-constant turnover rates of community composition in environmental space.
   3. We show that our novel technique can achieve notably higher species representation than what is achieved using past approaches. Simple strategies, such as direct use of environmental data only or environmental clustering, achieved species representation only slightly better than random selection of sites. P-median selection from ordinations of community composition had intermediate performance. Performance of our new maximization of complementary richness technique was closer to the representation levels of optimal reserve networks than to random selection of sites.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We found that there are three critical components that are relevant for success: a good model for community turnover (compositional dissimilarity), a good model for species richness, and a selection procedure that appropriately utilizes both turnover and richness information. By taking these into account, one can achieve reasonable levels of species representation. We conclude that using surrogates based on community-level modelling is a highly promising strategy for cost-effective conservation prioritization.

AB  - Mapping of biodiversity elements to expose gaps in conservation networks has become a common strategy in nature-reserve design. We review a set of critical assumptions and issues that influence the interpretation and implementation of gap analysis, including: (1) the assumption that a subset of taxa can be used to indicate overall diversity patterns, and (2) the impact of uncertainty and error propagation in reserve design. We focus our review on species diversity patterns and use data from peer-reviewed literature or extant state-level databases to test specific predictions implied by these assumptions. Support for the biodiversity indicator assumption was varied. Patterns of diversity as reflected in species counts, coincidence of hot spots, and representativeness were not generally concordant among different taxa, with the degree of concordance depending on the measure of diversity used, the taxa examined, and the scale of analysis. Simulated errors in predicting the occurrence of individual species indicated that substantial differences in reserve-boundary recommendations could occur when uncertainty is incorporated into the analysis. Furthermore, focusing exclusively on vegetation and species distribution patterns in conservation planning will contribute to reserve-design uncertainty unless the processes behind the patterns are understood. To deal with these issues, reserve planners should base reserve design on the best available, albeit incomplete, data; should attempt to define those ecological circumstances when the indicator assumption is defensible; should incorporate uncertainty explicitly in mapped displays of biodiversity elements; and should simultaneously consider pattern and process in reserve-design problems.

AB  - Aim: Ecological niche modelling (ENM) is widely used in biogeography and conservation studies. The performance of ENM is influenced by the quality of species' presence and absence datasets. Presences may include marginal localities, and absences are usually difficult to collect. We evaluated the use of species' physiological limits to improve selection of presences and absences for ENM in a virtual species framework with defined response functions as surrogates for physiological knowledge.
   Location: The lower 48 states in USA.
   Methods: We generated physiologically informed absences based on either complete or incomplete knowledge of species' physiology. With the same physiological knowledge, we reduced noise (incorrect or marginal locations) from presence datasets, completely or incompletely. We compared (i) models based on physiologically informed absences and random background points, (ii) models based on presences with and without noise and (iii) models obtained with and without incorporating physiological knowledge in absence and presence datasets.
   Results: Only absences based on complete physiological information produced better performing models than random background points. Model improvement was positively correlated with the percentage of noise being removed from the presence data, and best--performing models were obtained with true presences (all noise removed). Manipulating both absences and presences led to better models than manipulating only presences when all or majority of physiological limits were known.
   Main conclusions: The benefit of incorporating physiological information into ENM datasets largely depends on completeness of physiological knowledge, but in reality incomplete understanding of species' physiology is the norm. We found that applying incomplete physiological knowledge to absences may bias ENM, and thus, use of random background points is recommended; on the other hand, removing noise from species' presence datasets based on incomplete physiological limits increases model performance, thus this approach could potentially improve the effectiveness of ENM applications in conservation planning and invasive species management.

AB  - Species abundance is often spatially structured such that, within a species' distribution, abundance peaks at one or more areas and declines from those points. Abundance may also increase or decrease over time, but the spatial structure of temporal changes in abundance has been infrequently examined. Here we use count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to describe the spatial structure of yearly changes in abundance across the distributions of 135 species of land birds. For each species, we calculated the difference in the logarithms of the number of birds counted from one year to the next at survey routes within their distributions. We assessed the spatial structure of yearly changes in abundance using Moran's I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation. For comparison, we also calculated Moran's I for abundance, i.e., the logarithm of the number of birds counted on survey routes in each year. As expected, abundance was positively spatially autocorrelated (i.e. closer routes were more similar than expected by chance) at distances of up to a few hundred kilometers for most species. In contrast, changes in abundance showed little to no spatial autocorrelation. Resident species exhibited greater spatial structure in abundance than migrant species; however, the two groups did not differ in the degree of spatial structure in change in abundance. Variation in abundance over multiple years was mostly unrelated to the distance from the abundance-weighted center of species' distributions. Temporal changes in abundance can occur at fine spatial scales for many species, but understanding the causes of such changes is challenging. These results fill a gap in the ecological literature and may have important implications for conservation planning.

AB  - With the accelerating pace of global change, it is imperative that we obtain rapid inventories of the status and distribution of wildlife for ecological inferences and conservation planning. To address this challenge, we launched the SNAPSHOT USA project, a collaborative survey of terrestrial wildlife populations using camera traps across the United States. For our first annual survey, we compiled data across all 50 states during a 14-week period (17 August-24 November of 2019). We sampled wildlife at 1,509 camera trap sites from 110 camera trap arrays covering 12 different ecoregions across four development zones. This effort resulted in 166,036 unique detections of 83 species of mammals and 17 species of birds. All images were processed through the Smithsonian's eMammal camera trap data repository and included an expert review phase to ensure taxonomic accuracy of data, resulting in each picture being reviewed at least twice. The results represent a timely and standardized camera trap survey of the United States. All of the 2019 survey data are made available herein. We are currently repeating surveys in fall 2020, opening up the opportunity to other institutions and cooperators to expand coverage of all the urban-wild gradients and ecophysiographic regions of the country. Future data will be available as the database is updated at eMammal.si.edu/snapshot-usa, as will future data paper submissions. These data will be useful for local and macroecological research including the examination of community assembly, effects of environmental and anthropogenic landscape variables, effects of fragmentation and extinction debt dynamics, as well as species-specific population dynamics and conservation action plans. There are no copyright restrictions; please cite this paper when using the data for publication.

AB  - Distinguishing tree species is relevant in many contexts of remote sensing assisted forest inventory. Accurate tree species maps support management and conservation planning, pest and disease control and biomass estimation. This study evaluated the performance of applying ensemble techniques with the goal of automatically distinguishing Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus uncinata Mill. Ex Mirb within a 1.3 km(2) mountainous area in Barcelonnette (France). Three modelling schemes were examined, based on: (1) high-density LiDAR data (160 returns m(-2)), (2) Worldview-2 multispectral imagery, and (3) Worldview-2 and LiDAR in combination. Variables related to the crown structure and height of individual trees were extracted from the normalized LiDAR point cloud at individual-tree level, after performing individual tree crown (ITC) delineation. Vegetation indices and the Haralick texture indices were derived from Worldview-2 images and served as independent spectral variables. Selection of the best predictor subset was done after a comparison of three variable selection procedures: (1) Random Forests with cross validation (AUCREcv), (2) Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and (3) Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). To classify the species, 9 regression techniques were combined using ensemble models. Predictions were evaluated using cross validation and an independent dataset. Integration of datasets and models improved individual tree species classification (True Skills Statistic, TSS; from 0.67 to 0.81) over individual techniques and maintained strong predictive power (Relative Operating Characteristic, ROC = 0.91). Assemblage of regression models and integration of the datasets provided more reliable species distribution maps and associated tree-scale mapping uncertainties. Our study highlights the potential of model and data assemblage at improving species classifications needed in present-day forest planning and management.

AB  - The Australasian fucoid, Hormosira banksii, commonly known as 'Neptune's necklace' or 'bubbleweed' is regarded as an autogenic ecosystem engineer with no functional equivalents. Population declines resulting from climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances pose significant threats to intertidal biodiversity. For effective conservation strategies, patterns of gene flow and population genetic structure across the species distribution need to be clearly understood. We developed a suite of 15 polymorphic microsatellite markers using next generation sequencing of 53-55 individuals from two sites (south-western Victoria and central New South Wales, Australia) and a replicated spatially hierarchical sampling design. We observed low to moderate genetic variation across most loci (mean number of alleles per locus =3.26; mean expected heterozygosity =0.38) with no evidence of individual loci deviating significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Marker independence was confirmed with tests for linkage disequilibrium, and analyses indicated no evidence of null alleles across loci. Independent spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed for each site using multilocus genotypes and different relatedness measures. Both analyses indicated no significant patterns between relatedness and geographic distance, complemented by non-significant Hardy-Weinberg estimates (P < 0.05), suggesting that individuals from each site represent a randomly mating, outcrossing population. A preliminary investigation of population structure indicates that gene flow among sites is limited (F (ST) = 0.49), however more comprehensive sampling is needed to determine the extent of population structure across the species range (> 10,000 km). The genetic markers described provide a valuable resource for future population genetic assessments that will help guide conservation planning for H. banksii and the associated intertidal communities.

AB  - Despite some populations of European wildcat Felis silvestris in central Europe are stable or increasing, the Iberian subpopulation is in decline and is listed as 'vulnerable'. In Portugal, little is known about wildcat populations, making conservation policies extremely difficult to define. Furthermore, the secretive behaviour of these mammals, along with low population densities, make data collection complicated. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical tools to interpret existing data for this species. In this study, we determine the home-range size and environmental factors related to wildcat spatial ecology in a Mediterranean ecosystem using a combined analysis of habitat selection and maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling. Simultaneously, we test the feasibility of using radio-tracking locations to construct an ecologically meaningful distribution model. Six wildcats were captured and tracked. The average home-range size (MCP95) was 2.28 km(2) for females and 13.71 km(2) for one male. The Maxent model built from radio-tracking locations indicated that the abundance of the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and limited human disturbance were the most important correlates of wildcat presence. Habitat selection analysis revealed that wildcats tend to use scrubland areas significantly more than expected by chance. A mosaic of scrublands and agricultural areas, with a higher proportion of the former, benefits wildcat presence in the study area; however, species distribution is mainly constrained by availability of prey and resting sites. The Maxent model validation with camera-trapping data indicated that highly adequate model performance. This technique may prove useful for recovering small radio-tracking datasets as it provides a new alternative for handling data and maximizing the ecological information on a target population, which can then be used for conservation planning.

AB  - Aim Ecological data collected by the general public are valuable for addressing a wide range of ecological research and conservation planning, and there has been a rapid increase in the scope and volume of data available. However, data from eBird or other large-scale projects with volunteer observers typically present several challenges that can impede robust ecological inferences. These challenges include spatial bias, variation in effort and species reporting bias.
   Innovation We use the example of estimating species distributions with data from eBird, a community science or citizen science (CS) project. We estimate two widely used metrics of species distributions: encounter rate and occupancy probability. For each metric, we critically assess the impact of data processing steps that either degrade or refine the data used in the analyses. CS data density varies widely across the globe, so we also test whether differences in model performance are robust to sample size.
   Main conclusions Model performance improved when data processing and analytical methods addressed the challenges arising from CS data; however, the degree of improvement varied with species and data density. The largest gains we observed in model performance were achieved with 1) the use of complete checklists (where observers report all the species they detect and identify, allowing non-detections to be inferred) and 2) the use of covariates describing variation in effort and detectability for each checklist. Occupancy models were more robust to a lack of complete checklists. Improvements in model performance with data refinement were more evident with larger sample sizes. In general, we found that the value of each refinement varied by situation and we encourage researchers to assess the benefits in other scenarios. These approaches will enable researchers to more effectively harness the vast ecological knowledge that exists within CS data for conservation and basic research.

AB  - The upper Colorado River basin contains one of the most imperiled fish faunas in North America. Anthropogenic land use and nonnative species impacts are considered among the top reasons for imperilment. We determined the association of anthropogenic land use intensity (road density, percentage of converted land, and oil and gas well density), relative abundance of nonnative white suckers Catostomus commersonii and their hybrids, and natural landscape features with the occurrences of three native fishes in the Colorado River basin, Wyoming, that have declined throughout their ranges: flannelmouth sucker C. latipinnis, bluehead sucker C. discobolus, and roundtail chub Gila robusta. We found that flannelmouth suckers occurred more frequently in large, low-gradient stream reaches, but their occurrence was not associated with land use intensity or the relative abundance of white suckers and hybrid suckers. In contrast, bluehead sucker occurrence decreased with increasing intensity of each land use type within a 0.5-km stream buffer, which suggests that localized land use disturbances have negatively affected the species' distribution. Roundtail chub occurred more frequently in low-gradient stream segments with more riparian vegetation, but associations with land uses were more complex. Roundtail chub were negatively associated with road density in a 0.5-km buffer, but in contrast to our expectations they were positively associated with road density in the contributing watershed and with local oil and gas well density. We think that rocky substrates and pools-habitats preferred by roundtail chub and sometimes associated with oil and gas infrastructure-have concentrated the remaining individuals within their currently reduced distribution. The associations we identified highlight the potential role of land use in distributional declines and can help managers to determine whether proposed land use changes may affect existing populations. Spatial predictions of occurrence have already been used in regional fish conservation planning efforts in Wyoming.

AB  - Hummingbirds are one of the most threatened bird groups in the world. However, the extent to which global climate change (GCC) and habitat loss compromise their conservation status remains unclear. Herein, we proposed to: (1) assess how predicted GCC impacts the distribution of non-migrant hummingbirds according to their conservation status, degree of restriction and habitat specificity; and (2) delineate priority conservation areas where species could persist in the face of both threats. We estimated the potential distributions of 49 species under current and future climates (year 2040, 2060, and 2080), analyzing the effects of current habitat loss and the importance of existing Protected Areas (PAs) on the species' ranges and hummingbird hotspot areas in Mexico. Our projections were consistent in the identity of the species that are most vulnerable to GCC: while 10.2% of species will have potentially habitat gains/stability ("winners"), the remaining 89.8% of species ("losers") will face habitat reductions under new climate conditions. These changes were mostly related to temperature increases (>2 degrees C) and rainfall decreases (<50 mm). The combined impacts of GCC and habitat loss may represent a higher risk, leading to an average reduction of 26-59% in species' ranges. Already-established Mexican PAs cover 12% of the hummingbirds' current ranges, but showed an important reduction of surface across the species distribution (on average >15%) and hotspot areas (>60%) for future. We identified highly resilient priority areas across southern Mexico, in Oaxaca and Guerrero. Ambitious conservation actions by decision-makers are now crucial to avoid losing these highly-vulnerable taxa. (C) 2021 Associac , ao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservaca.

AB  - Spatial relationships between distribution patterns of many species and vegetated habitats over multiple scales have been used in terrestrial ecosystems to help identify and map important areas for conservation and management. This approach is not widely used in characterizing habitat use of nekton species in estuaries, but it has great potential because these systems contain fairly discrete vegetated habitat types, and the distribution of nekton species can be influenced by the spatial arrangement of habitat. We examined the spatial relationships between estuarine habitats and nekton species to help map estuarine nekton communities for use in conservation planning. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), we measured area (m(2)) and edge density (m km(-2)) of estuarine habitats over multiple scales in Charlotte Harbor, Florida (USA). We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to examine spatial patterns of nekton community composition, habitat, and local habitat characteristics. RDA revealed that spatial patterns in nekton community composition were most highly correlated with distance from the nearest pass to the Gulf of Mexico (r = -0.97) and with salinity (r = 0.94) and area of continuous seagrass habitat (r = 0.91). We used GIS maps of 2 variables (distance from the nearest pass and area of continuous seagrass habitat) to model spatial patterns in nekton community composition and the distribution of several juveniles of fishery species (red drum Sciaenops ocellatus, gray snapper Lutjanus griseus, lane snapper L. synagris, sand seatrout Cynoscion arenarius, and spotted seatrout C. nebulosus). The results suggest that incorporating measures of habitat area (over multiple scales) and spatial position into spatial models of nekton distribution is useful in conservation and management planning.

AB  - Throughout the 1800s and the 1900s, woodland caribou disappeared from much of the central and southern portions of British Columbia, Canada. Conversely, moose populations expanded during the 1900s and rapidly colonized forested areas formerly occupied by caribou. Although the general trend in range recession and expansion is documented, the processes, timing, and spatial extent of overlap between these two ungulates are uncertain. Such details have implications for our understanding of the ecology of these species and the conservation of woodland caribou. Using historical-ecological methods, we documented the distribution and abundance of caribou and moose over a 150-year period. Also, we evaluated three general sources of evidence for documenting long-term changes in the distribution of hunted or trapped fauna: (1) semi-structured interviews with Aboriginal and non-aboriginal residents; (2) journals of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC); and (3) primary written sources. The findings of this study suggested that caribou were relatively wide-spread throughout the study area until the late 1800s when their distribution began to decline. The first recorded sighting of moose in the study area was 1832, although consensus among sources suggested that moose expanded into the area at the end of the 1800s becoming abundant in the 1920s and 1930s. Proposed causes of decline of caribou included climatic change during the 1800s and habitat loss, hunting, and altered predator-prey dynamics through the early 1900s. Our analysis of three sources of historical information and knowledge confirmed the value of Local and Traditional Ecological Knowledge in documenting and explaining long-term historical distribution of hunted species. Alternatively, HBC journals and other written sources provided good temporal specificity, but few recorded locations of caribou or moose. Documenting changes in the long-term distribution of both species can enlighten conservation planning for woodland caribou.

AB  - A framework called "Targets-Plans-Decision" (TPD) was established for identifying the size of adequate protected areas (PAs) based on the combination of species distribution probability prediction method, systematic conservation planning (SCP) theory, and protection efficiency analysis, to achieve a balance between ecological protection and economic development. The first step of the framework is to determine the protection targets. In this study, the protection targets were defined as important habitats and important ecosystems. The second step is to identify the PAs plans of different sizes. We adopted a SCP method, which takes into account costeffectiveness while delineating the PAs. The third step is to determine the optimal size of the PAs through ecological protection efficiency analysis. We constructed the protection efficiency index (PEI), which is the protection cost per unit area. Then we used Kaya identity (a structural decomposition method) to decompose PEI. The decomposed PEI included value density (ecological value per unit area) and value cost (cost to realize unit ecological value). By analyzing the changes of the two, the optimal size of the PAs can be determined. We took Nanchang as an example to conduct an empirical study to verify the usability of the TPD framework. The result shows the TPD framework proposed in this study can effectively identify the optimal size of PAs and contribute to forming a cost-effective ecological protection plan. When the size of PAs was set to 70% of the important habitats and important ecosystems, it was most beneficial for ecological protection. Furthermore, the optimal protection efficiency plan recommended by the TPD framework improved the efficiency of ecological protection. The TPD framework can serve as a basis for the size identification of PAs and also support the delineation of PAs worldwide.

AB  - Global climate change affects the distributions of ectotherms and may be the cause of several conservation problems, such as great displacement of climatic suitable spaces for species and, consequently, important reductions of the extent of liveable places, threatening the existence of many of them. Species exposure (and hence vulnerability) to global climate change is linked to features of their climatic niches (such as the relative position of the inhabited localities of each species in the climatic space), and therefore to characteristics of their geographic ranges (such as the extent of the distributions or altitudinal range inhabited by the species). In order to analyze the pattern of response of Argentine reptiles to global climate change, we ran phylogenetic generalized least squares models using species exposure to global climate change as a response variable, and (i) niche properties (breadth and position of the species in the climate space) and (ii) general features of the distribution of species (maximum latitude, altitudinal range, maximum elevation, distributional range and proximity to the most important dispersal barrier) as predictors. Our results suggest that the best way to explain climate change exposure is by combining breadth and position of climatic niche of the species or combining geographic features that are indicators of both niche characteristics. Our best model shows that in our study area, species with the narrowest distributional ranges that also inhabit the highest elevations are the most exposed to the effects of global climate change. In this sense, reptile species from Yungas, Puna and Andes ecoregions could be especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. We believe that these types of models may represent an interesting tool for determining species and places particularly threatened by the effects of global climate change, which should be strongly considered in conservation planning.

AB  - We undertook a gap analysis of how protected areas represent the tree-species diversity within the Canadian boreal forest, as measured from Forest Resource Inventory (FRI) maps. We used a new compilation of Forest Resource Inventory designed to support ecological analyses over large areas and across jurisdictional boundaries. The analysis was stratified into four analytical regions determined by terrestrial ecozones. We calculated the relative abundance of species within regions, developed rarity criteria, and evaluated the relative abundances and prevalence of rare species. We characterized representation gaps when the abundance of a tree species in protected areas within an analytical region differed markedly (by more than a factor of 2) from the expectation, calculated as the product of regional abundance and the proportional area protected. Most species were well represented in the most species diverse region (n = 33), the Boreal Shield in eastern Canada, due apparently to a large number of relatively small protected areas in the southern part of the region. Some marked gaps existed in the more species-depauperate western zones, notably for montane conifers in the Boreal Plains. As is common for species abundance distributions, as few as five species accounted for 90% of total abundance in each zone. Relatively rare species were more numerous. Mostly associated with southern temperate or hemiboreal forests, these reached their highest prevalence and abundance in the managed forests of the Boreal Shield. Our work identified some gaps in representation in the protected areas network of Canada in western Canada, substantiates the use of species distribution mapping based on FRI data to inform conservation planning -including the identification of high conservation biodiversity elements for forest certification-and demonstrates the need for improved vegetation mapping in National Parks.

AB  - Detecting and understanding recoveries of threatened species from past and recent presence/absence data is essential to improving conservation efforts. However, false positive trends may be reported because of false absences in past data, therefore appropriate testing is needed. We tested an expansion/recolonization of the otter (Lutra lutra) populations in Italy from a fragmented distribution outlined in the 1984-1985 period by using Monte Carlo simulations. Land-use changes, human depopulation and decrease in influence of anthropogenic features were investigated as potential drivers of recolonization by using GIS modeling. A survey of the entire Italian range of the otter, conducted in 2002-2004, recorded a 2.2-fold increase in the proportion of occupied 10-km squares and 49 local colonizations. The range size and proportion of urban land-use in the 1984-1985 distribution were smaller (P < 0.05) than those derived from simulated surveys based on 49 random false absences versus colonization events. The distribution range expanded southward and nearly reached the southern margins of the peninsula. Recolonization of moderately urbanized landscapes was not accompanied by human depopulation. According to partial logistic regressions, the pure effect of urban land proportion and industry proximity on otter occurrence probability declined by about 48%, suggesting a decreased impact on the stream habitat. Conversely, natural factors, increased in importance by about 116%. The absence of a significant northward expansion in the 20 year period suggests that northward habitat restoration should be planned to encourage further recolonization. On the other hand, potential urban threats in the newly occupied landscapes should be controlled.

AB  - Riparian vegetation provides important wildlife habitat in the southwestern United States, but limited distributions and spatial complexity often leads to inaccurate representation in maps used to guide conservation. We test the use of data conflation and aggregation on multiple vegetation/land-cover maps to improve the accuracy of habitat models for the threatened western yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis). We used species observations (n = 479) from a state-wide survey to develop habitat models from 1) three vegetation/land-cover maps produced at different geographic scales ranging from state to national, and 2) new aggregate maps defined by the spatial agreement of cover types, which were defined as high (agreement = all data sets), moderate (agreement > 2), and low (no agreement required). Model accuracies, predicted habitat locations, and total area of predicted habitat varied considerably, illustrating the effects of input data quality on habitat predictions and resulting potential impacts on conservation planning. Habitat models based on aggregated and conflated data were more accurate and had higher model sensitivity than original vegetation/land-cover, but this accuracy came at the cost of reduced geographic extent of predicted habitat. Using the highest performing models, we assessed cuckoo habitat preference and distribution in Arizona and found that major watersheds containing high-probably habitat are fragmented by a wide swath of low-probability habitat. Focus on riparian restoration in these areas could provide more breeding habitat for the threatened cuckoo, offset potential future habitat losses in adjacent watershed, and increase regional connectivity for other threatened vertebrates that also use riparian corridors.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the role of propagule pressure (P), abiotic (A), and biotic (B) factors (collectively indicated as PAB) on the suitability of the Mediterranean island of Sardinia (Italy) to be invaded by the tree Acacia saligna, recently included in the list of invasive alien species of European Union concern.
   To this aim, a binomial Generalized Linear Model was applied for disentangling the relationship between 432 A. saligna occurrence records and 10 thematic layers, at high-resolution (10 x10 m), used as proxies for the 3 categories of PAB variables. The 432 occurrence records of A. saligna were periodically monitored (period 20002018) to check the persistence of the populations and their invasive status. The predictive power of the model was evaluated by computing the mean of the AUC scores, through cross-fold validation. The model adequately described how the PAB factors influence the presence of A. saligna which is mainly shaped by abiotic factors such as topography, and biotic factors such as the presence of woody dune vegetation, and to a lesser extent by other predictors. The projection of the model to the whole island clearly shows that suitability varies at the landscape level due to the variation of the PAB across the territory. The probability of A. saligna occurrence near the coast is higher in sand dunes. In the internal areas of the island it occurs close to the roads and urban areas. This study and the tested methodology could represent a suitable tool to prioritize areas for the monitoring of A. saligna to meet the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No. 1143/2014 on Invasive Alien Species (the IAS Regulation).

AB  - 1. The eastern North American monarch butterfly is at risk of quasi-extinction due, in part, to the loss of breeding habitat in agricultural landscapes of the USA Midwest. Because adult females are not patch residents, egg abundance and distribution across the landscape are a function of their perceptual range, flight directionality and flight step lengths. Conservation actions that account for habitat use in agricultural landscapes can enhance functional connectivity.
   2. Field-captured females (n = 114) were released in a 64-ha area containing restored prairies, grass-dominated fields and crop fields in Floyd County, Iowa, USA, and two 1,000 m linear north-south sections of grass-dominated roadside along secondary roads (similar to 35 ha) with different proximity to prairie habitat in rural Story County, Iowa. Radio-tagged or untagged monarchs were released in areas with high density, low density and zero density of forage and oviposition resources, as well as on habitat edges between high- and zero-density habitats. Monarchs were observed for 1 hr. Radio-tagged individuals that flew beyond visual detection were relocated using handheld radiotelemetry.
   3. Monarchs moved within and between habitat classes and typically performed upwind search behaviour. Monarchs successfully located resources, with some flying over 500 m to find high-density areas, providing evidence that the monarch's perceptual distance is >100 m. Regardless of habitat class or field site, most step lengths were <50 m, and turn angles were directional. Large steps (>= 50 m) crossing habitat boundaries occurred with approximately half of the monarchs, which may indicate initiation of long-range searches for suitable habitat, consistent with their vagile behaviour. Establishing habitat patches 50 m apart in agricultural landscapes would facilitate efficient movement.
   4. Synthesis and applications. This study provides an extensive dataset of directly observed breeding-season monarch butterflies to assess the utilization of agricultural landscapes. Documentation of step lengths >50 m in complex, agricultural landscapes would not have been possible without the aid of radiotelemetry. Results provide improved estimates of perceptual range and flight patterns within and between habitat patches that support models that simulate natural population dynamics to enable conservation planning at a landscape scale.

AB  - In the face of human population growth that is transforming the Earth, scientists, land managers, and planners are working to prevent, mitigate, and reverse the consequent loss of species, ecosystems, and landscapes. Because of the need to act quickly with incomplete data, a number of shortcuts have been developed that rely on identifying key species for planning efforts. By developing conservation plans for a small set of carefully selected focal species, planners hope to create a protective umbrella for a wider array of species and functional landscapes. In an earlier paper, we described an approach for selecting a set of focal species. In this paper, we report a process for the rapid identification and verification of potential habitat for a focal species. Using the barred owl as an example, we present the process for a suburbanizing region of North Carolina, USA. The barred owl was selected to represent bottomland hardwood and forested wetland landscapes in the region. Using a geographic information system (GIS), we assembled data layers from readily available remotely sensed, conventional survey, and physiographic data to create a model of barred owl habitat. Barred owls occupy bottomland hardwood forests, which we identified using land cover, soils, and wetlands data. We eliminated from consideration bottomland forest habitat within 100 m of a road and within 60 m of open vegetative cover. Patches of the remaining bottomland forest larger than 86 ha in size were considered large enough to meet all barred owl habitat needs. Simple presence/absence surveys detected barred owls in approximately 65% of patches identified by our model as suitable habitat. We tested the barred owl's suitability as an umbrella for bottomland forest species using an existing database of rare and outstanding elements of natural diversity. Umbrella coverage for barred owl habitat (bottomland forest patches greater than or equal to 86 ha) varied with taxa from 0% for invertebrate species to 75% for vertebrate species. However, umbrella coverage for all bottomland forest, including patches <86 ha, was at or near 100% for all taxa. The relatively simple modeling and verification processes we used can be carried out with a minimal amount of data and time, making it an attractive tool in situations where time and resources are in short supply.

AB  - Knowledge of species' geographic distributions is critical for understanding and forecasting population dynamics, responses to environmental change, biodiversity patterns, and conservation planning. While many suggestive correlative occurrence models have been used to these ends, progress lies in understanding the underlying population biology that generates patterns of range dynamics. Here, we show how to use a limited quantity of demographic data to produce demographic distribution models (DDMs) using integral projection models for size-structured populations. By modeling survival, growth, and fecundity using regression, integral projection models can interpolate across missing size data and environmental conditions to compensate for limited data. To accommodate the uncertainty associated with limited data and model assumptions, we use Bayesian models to propagate uncertainty through all stages of model development to predictions. DDMs have a number of strengths: 1) DDMs allow a mechanistic understanding of spatial occurrence patterns; 2) DDMs can predict spatial and temporal variation in local population dynamics; 3) DDMs can facilitate extrapolation under altered environmental conditions because one can evaluate the consequences for individual vital rates. To illustrate these features, we construct DDMs for an overstory perennial shrub in the Proteaceae family in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. We find that the species' population growth rate is limited most strongly by adult survival throughout the range and by individual growth in higher rainfall regions. While the models predict higher population growth rates in the core of the range under projected climates for 2050, they also suggest that the species faces a threat along arid range margins from the interaction of more frequent fire and drying climate. The results (and uncertainties) are helpful for prioritizing additional sampling of particular demographic parameters along these gradients to iteratively refine projections. In the appendices, we provide fully functional R code to perform all analyses.

AB  - Disentangling the relative importance of different biodiversity drivers (i.e., climate, edaphic, historical factors, or human impact) to predict plant species richness at the local scale is one of the most important challenges in ecology. Biodiversity modelling is a key tool for the integration of these drivers and the predictions generated are essential, for example, for climate change forecast and conservation planning. However, the reliability of biodiversity models at the local scale remains poorly understood, especially in tropical species-rich areas, where they are required. We inventoried all woody plants with stems >= 2.5 cm in 397 plots across the Andes-Amazon gradient. We generated and mapped 19 uncorrelated biodiversity drivers at 90 m resolution, grouped into four categories: microclimatic, microtopographic, anthropic, and edaphic. In order to evaluate the importance of the different categories, we grouped biodiversity drivers into four different clusters by categories. For each of the four clusters of biodiversity drivers, we modelled the observed species richness using two statistical techniques (random forest and Bayesian inference) and two modelling procedures (including or excluding a spatial component). All the biodiversity models produced were evaluated by cross-validation. Species richness was accurately predicted by random forest (Spearman correlation up to 0.85 and explained variance up to 67%). The results suggest that precipitation and temperature are important driving forces of species richness in the region. Nonetheless, a spatial component should be considered to properly predict biodiversity. This could reflect macroevolutionary underlying forces not considered here, such as colonization time, dispersal capacities, or speciation rates. However, the proposed biodiversity modelling approach can predict accurately species richness at the local scale and detailed resolution (90 m) in tropical areas, something that previous works had found extremely challenging. The innovative methodology presented here could be employed in other areas with conservation needs.

AB  - AimConservation strategies must anticipate how climate change may alter the geographic distributions of limited food resources for highly specialized species. Here, we use bamboo as a case study to investigate climate change-induced changes in species diversity and discuss how to protect the critical food species for giant pandas.
   LocationGiant panda habitats.
   MethodsUsing a niche-based model and the most updated climate projections, we projected the current and future distribution of 16 bamboo species under no and universal dispersal assumptions. We then assessed the impact of climate change on bamboo forests and their alpha and beta diversities in the giant panda habitats and reserves.
   ResultsUnder both dispersal assumptions and three RCPs, six bamboo species are projected to vanish from panda habitats as climate change progresses, resulting in a great loss of the current bamboo forests. Although about half of the bamboo species may potentially colonize new climatically suitable areas under universal dispersal, the other species would experience significant habitat loss. Consequently, climate change would reduce both the alpha and beta diversity of bamboo species in panda habitats. Meanwhile, the proportion of single-species bamboo forests would significantly increase. The decline in bamboo forests and diversity would be most drastic in Qinling, Daxiangling and Qionglaishan Mountains, whereas those in the north-west of Minshan Mountains and Liangshan Mountains may increase.
   Main conclusionsClimate change-induced decline in bamboo habitats and species diversity would pose a severe challenge to the food availability of giant pandas. We posit that human-assisted adaptation and increasing bamboo species diversity are critical to ensuring food security of the giant panda in a changing climate. Our results indicate that conservation planning should not only incorporate species range shifts but also diversity patterns in communities under climate change.

AB  - Balancing society's competing needs of development and conservation requires careful consideration of tradeoffs. Renewable energy development and biodiversity conservation are often considered beneficial environmental goals. The direct footprint and disturbance of renewable energy, however, can displace species' habitat and negatively impact populations and natural communities if sited without ecological consideration. Offsets have emerged as a potentially useful tool to mitigate residual impacts after trying to avoid, minimize, or restore affected sites. Yet the problem of efficiently designing a set of offset sites becomes increasingly complex where many species or many sites are involved. Spatial conservation prioritization tools are designed to handle this problem, but have seen little application to offset siting and analysis. To address this need we designed an offset siting support tool for the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) of California, and present a case study of hypothetical impacts from solar development in the Western Mojave subsection. We compare two offset scenarios designed to mitigate a hypothetical 15,331 ha derived from proposed utility-scale solar energy development (USSED) projects. The first scenario prioritizes offsets based precisely on impacted features, while the second scenario offsets impacts to maximize biodiversity conservation gains in the region. The two methods only agree on 28% of their prioritized sites and differ in meeting species-specific offset goals. Differences between the two scenarios highlight the importance of clearly specifying choices and priorities for offset siting and mitigation in general. Similarly, the effects of background climate and land use change may lessen the durability or effectiveness of offsets if not considered. Our offset siting support tool was designed specifically for the DRECP area, but with minor code modification could work well in other offset analyses, and could provide continuing support for a potentially innovative mitigation solution to environmental impacts.

AB  - Artemia persimilis is the only species of the genus that is native to South America. Its biology has been studied in lakes in the arid diagonal in Argentina, which are affected by agricultural and livestock activities. The aim was to study biological aspects and their relations with environmental variables in a protected lake under conditions similar to those that existed before the increase in human influence on this area. From October 2014 to September 2015, samples were taken monthly from Este Lake (64 degrees 11' 04 '' W, 36 degrees 55' 18 '' S), which is in the intangible zone of Parque Luro Provincial Reserve. In situ water temperature, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, and pH were determined, and two quantitative zooplankton samples were taken. The maximum depth varied between 0.9 and 0.33 m, the mean salinity was 262.17 g/L (+/- 43.87), and Na+ and Cl- predominated. The water transparency was 0.56 m (+/- 0.21), and the concentration of phytoplankton chlorophyll-a was 6.19 mg/m(3) (+/- 8.17). The mean density and biomass of A. persimilis were 209.31 ind./L (+/- 214.04) and 7535.10 mu g/L (+/- 12 376.57), respectively, which exceeded those recorded in other lakes in the region. Nauplii and metanauplii were registered in every month except December and July, and they showed high percentages of total density. A correlation was found between density and temperature but not between density and salinity, which could indicate that the range in Este Lake is optimal for the species. Although it is difficult to prevent colonization by exotic anostracan species by zoochory, the existence of an abundant population of A. persimilis in a protected lake in the central Argentinean region is an optimal opportunity for the conservation of this species.

AB  - Eastern wolves (Canis lycaon) are a species of special concern in Canada and their geographic range appears to be restricted mainly to Algonquin Provincial Park (APP) in Ontario, Canada. Previous work showed pup survival was relatively low throughout portions of APP which may limit the extent to which this protected area can act as a source of dispersing individuals to adjacent areas. We modeled resource selection by wolves at dens and rendezvous sites to identify environmental variables that were selected and avoided in APP during pup-rearing. We also quantified differences in resource selection between den and rendezvous sites and investigated links between home-site selection and pup survival. Wolves selected dens closer to wetlands and water, farther from secondary roads, and on steeper slopes relative to rendezvous sites. When we modeled den and rendezvous sites separately, wolves selected wetlands, water, conifer forests and tertiary roads at dens, whereas they selected wetlands and conifer forests at rendezvous sites. Packs that lost pups to starvation and intraspecific strife avoided water and selected wetlands and mixed forests at home-sites more than packs that did not lose pups to these mortality agents. Previous research showed that pup starvation occurred for packs in APP with lower beaver density in their territories, and our results indicate that these packs selected habitats at dens and rendezvous sites associated with alternative prey (moose). Moose are likely more difficult prey than beavers to kill during summer which may contribute to the higher nutrition-related mortality of pups in packs with decreased access to beavers. Our results inform eastern wolf conservation efforts and should be considered during forest management and park planning activities in APP. More broadly, our research provides novel insight into temporal differences in home-site selection across the pup-rearing season and the relationship between resource selection and pup mortality.

AB  - Sound conservation plans for islands require understanding the processes underlying to the patterns of species richness and composition. Larger islands are often the targets of conservation assuming that the island area mainly determines species richness, and that species composition is nested across islands. However, in small-island these patterns could be altered because of stochastic processes, and species assemblages could be disharmonious. In addition, human impact could further modify the distribution pattern and diversity. Here we use the case of seven islands from the coastal system of Coquimbo as a model to address the role of environmental variables and human impacts on species richness and assembly rules of plants, birds, and mammals. We hypothesize (a) the existence of a small-island effect, and the prevalence of habitat diversity and anthropogenic impacts as main drivers of species richness, and (b) the existence of disharmonious assemblages, characterized by a low degree of nestedness and random patterns of species co-occurrence. Our results showed that (a) species richness is mainly correlated with habitat diversity, and only weakly related to island area supporting the 'small-island effect' and (b) species composition is highly structured, but that such structure may be the result of anthropogenic activities. Nestedness was observed in plants and landbirds, while co-occurrence patterns were only detected in plants. Assemblages in small-islands departed from the nestedness pattern and maintain rare species. Currently, only three of the seven islands are protected by national regulations, excluding the smaller ones that are subjected to human disturbance and invasive mammals. Our study suggests that it necessary to include all the islands in a major protected area to preserve both richness and species composition of a number of representative islands of the Humboldt current systems. We showed that conservation plans solely based on island area might not be robust.

AB  - Aim Global animal populations are in decline due to destruction and degradation of their natural habitat. Understanding the factors that determine the distribution and density of threatened animal populations is therefore now a crucial component of their study and conservation. The Cheirogaleidae are a diverse family of small-bodied, nocturnal lemurs that are widespread throughout the forests of Madagascar. However, many cheirogaleid lemurs are now highly threatened with extinction and the environmental factors that determine their distribution and population density are still little known. Here, I investigated the environmental drivers of Cheirogaleidae population density at genus level.
   Location Various forest sites across Madagascar.
   Methods I investigated how six environmental variables affect Cheirogaleidae population density at the genus level via random-effect meta-analyses. I then used a generalized linear mixed-effects model to identify the primary predictors of Cheirogaleidae population density. Finally, I investigated how the population density of this family of lemurs varies between protected and unprotected areas of Madagascar via a GLM analysis.
   Results My results indicate that the relationships between the tested environmental factors and population density are genus-specific among the Cheirogaleidae. Rather remarkably, the density of Microcebus appears to have a profoundly positive relationship with anthropogenic disturbance and a negative relationship with forest cover, a finding that is also reflected by larger population densities within unprotected areas in comparison with localities within Madagascar's protected area network.
   Main Conclusions The results of this study are highly encouraging for the conservation of the Cheirogaleidae and highlight the remarkable resilience of these lemurs to habitat degradation and anthropogenic activity. However, this study also outlines the dearth of knowledge that we have for many species, and why these data are urgently needed to understand the biogeography and ecology of threatened animal populations and implement successful conservation.

AB  - Large herbivore communities around the world have declined steeply in recent decades. Although excessive bushmeat harvesting is thought to be the primary cause of herbivore declines in many ecosystems, the direct effects of anthropogenic pressures on large herbivore populations remain poorly described in most of the systems experiencing decline. To test the extent to which large herbivores are impacted by ecological and anthropogenic factors in a protected area (PA) thought to be experiencing human-caused decline, we fit distance sampling models to seven years of data from systematic ground-based surveys in Kafue National Park (KNP) to estimate the population densities and distributions of 10 species of large herbivores, and to test what factors affect these parameters. Population densities of the ten most abundant large herbivores in KNP were substantially lower than those reported for an ecologically similar PA with less poaching pressure. Low densities were consistent across species and areas, though there was ecologically important variation among species and size classes. Densities of larger-bodied herbivores were greatly depressed relative to smaller species. This pattern has direct and indirect effects on large carnivore populations, with broad implications for the ecotourism and trophy hunting industries. Statistically and methodologically rigorous methods to test the effects of anthropogenic and environmental variables on density and distribution exist, but are rarely applied to large herbivores. To quantify trends in herbivore populations and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation actions, our results show that distance sampling with stratified ground-based monitoring is an efficient and effective method. In the Greater Kafue Ecosystem (GKE), continued increases in resource protection are needed to facilitate the recovery of an economically and ecologically important large herbivore guild. More broadly, our results confirm that anthropogenic effects on large herbivore distribution and abundance can be strong over wide areas for all species (particularly the larger members of the guild), even in very large PAs.

AB  - Arthropod assemblages were examined in Lama forest reserve, a protected area situated in the Dahomey gap, southern Benin, composed of plantations, degraded forest and remnants of natural forest. The objectives were to compare assemblages in relation to forest type and use, to elucidate the value of forest plantations for biodiversity conservation and to identify indicator species for specific forest habitats. Arthropods were collected over an 11-month period, using standardized sets of traps (pitfall, emergence, Malaise and flight intercept traps). Nine different habitats were studied, including natural and degraded forest, forest plantations (Tectona grandis and Senna siamea) of different age, and isolated forest fragments. Our analysis focused on detritivorous and xylophagous arthropods but also included ground beetles and heteropterans, totalling 393 species. We found no differences in species richness among natural and degraded forest habitats in the centre of the reserve (Noyau central). Outside of the Noyau central, species richness was highest in old teak plantations and isolated forest fragments and lowest in young teak and fuelwood plantations. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) separated three main groups: (1) natural forest, (2) degraded forest and young plantations, and (3) old plantations and isolated forest fragments. Multiple regression of DCA scores of the first two axes on environmental variables identified one natural and three disturbance-related predictors of arthropod assemblages in Lama forest: soil type (texture), canopy height, naturalness (proportion of Guineo-Congolian plant species) and understorey vegetation cover. We identified 15 indicator species for six different forest habitats. The highest numbers were found in abandoned settlements and old teak plantations. beta-diversity was similar among the three DCA ordination groups (degraded forest excluded). Values for beta-diversity were relatively high, suggesting that all major forest habitats contribute significantly to regional species pools and should therefore be protected. To enhance arthropod diversity, we propose that management practices in Lama forest should aim to encourage the development of species-rich understorey vegetation of the Guineo-Congolian phytogeographical region.

AB  - Endemic vertebrates are a crucial component of biodiversity, yet face disproportionally high extinction risk as climate and land-use changes drive habitat loss. Large protected areas are therefore deemed necessary to mitigate biodiversity loss. In 2021, China's Giant Panda National Park (GPNP, 27,134 km(2)) was established in one of the global endemism hotspots. In this study we ask the question whether this large national park is able to conserve the many threatened endemic vertebrates occurring in the region in the face of climate and land-use changes, in order to assess the long-term effectiveness of the GPNP. We used species distribution modeling techniques to project the distributions of 40 threatened terrestrial (and freshwater) endemic vertebrates under land-use and climate change scenarios SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 in 2081-2100, and assessed the extent to which their distributions are covered by the GPNP, now and in the future. We found that by 2081-2100, two thirds of the threatened endemic vertebrates are predicted to lose part (15-79%, N = 4) of or (nearly) their entire (80-100% loss, N = 23) range under all three climate and land-use change scenarios. Consequently, fewer species are predicted to occur in the GPNP than at present. Our findings confirm the high vulnerability of threatened endemic species to climate and land-use changes, despite protected areas. Habitat loss due to climate and land-use changes elevate extinction risk of species in endemism hotspots across the globe. Urgent, widespread and intensified mitigation measures and adaptation measures are required at a landscape scale for effective conservation efforts in the future.

AB  - Climate change has affected many animals, causing shifts in distributions across a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate species. Many primate species have small distributions with narrow ecological niches and are therefore sensitive to changes in the environment. However, there exists a lack of predictions with regards to how the distribution ranges of primate species might shift given future climate changes. In this study, we assessed the potential effects of climate change on the distribution of the black-shanked douc, Pygathrix nigripes (Milne-Edwards, 1871). We generated climatic conditions projected for 2050 and 2070 under the two scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, with three climate models, ACCESS1-0, GFDL-CM3, and MPI-ESM-LR. We predicted that the distribution of the black-shanked douc would be sharply reduced with 66.19% of the current distribution lost by 2070 under the RCP8.5 scenario. The species' suitable distributions were not projected to shift to higher latitudes but were instead expected to shift towards the centre of their current range. Under the context of climate change, higher priority in conservation efforts for the species should be given to the protected areas in the centre of the species' current distribution, especially in the north of Lam Dong, south of Dak Lak, and middle of Dak Nong provinces. Specifically, Bidoup-Nui Ba and Chu Yang Sin National Parks should receive the highest priority in teens of conservation attention for this species. Our study also indicated that more surveys should be conducted in several forested areas, both inside and outside the current protected area network, in order to gain a better understanding of the black-shanked douc langur populations and their distributions.

AB  - Following governments' policies to tackle global climate change, the development of offshore renewable energy sites is likely to increase substantially over coming years. All such developments interact with the seabed to some degree and so a key need exists for suitable methodology to monitor the impacts of large-scale Marine Renewable Energy Installations (MREIs). Many of these will be situated on mixed or rocky substrata, where conventional methods to characterise the habitat are unsuitable. Traditional destructive sampling is also inappropriate in conservation terms, particularly as safety zones around (MREIs) could function as Marine Protected Areas, with positive benefits for biodiversity. Here we describe a technique developed to effectively monitor the impact of MREIs and report the results of its field testing, enabling large areas to be surveyed accurately and cost-effectively. The methodology is based on a high-definition video camera, plus LED lights and laser scale markers, mounted on a "flying array" that maintains itself above the seabed grounded by a length of chain, thus causing minimal damage. Samples are taken by slow-speed tows of the gear behind a boat (200 m transects). The HD video and randomly selected frame grabs are analysed to quantify species distribution. The equipment was tested over two years in Lyme Bay, UK (25 m depth), then subsequently successfully deployed in demanding conditions at the deep (>50 m) high-energy Wave Hub site off Cornwall, UK, and a potential tidal stream energy site in Guernsey, Channel Islands (1.5 ms(-1) current), the first time remote samples from such a habitat have been achieved. The next stage in the monitoring development process is described, involving the use of Remote Operated Vehicles to survey the seabed post-deployment of MREI devices. The complete methodology provides the first quantitative, relatively non-destructive method for monitoring mixed-substrate benthic communities beneath MPAs and MREIs pre- and post-device deployment.

AB  - Ants form an important insect group in many terrestrial ecosystems. The research of ant species diversity is a relevant line of ecological and faunistic studies to completely reveal the biodiversity. Particular attention is given to Protected Areas where a high level of ant species diversity is known. The study of ant fauna and ant community structure was carried out in the Mordovia State Nature Reserve in 2014-2020. Material has been obtained using hand collecting, on census routes, and using carbohydrate and protein baits. The annotated list of ants in the Mordovia State Nature Reserve includes 42 species belonging to 11 genera and three subfamilies. Of them, 17 species are reported for the first time in this Protected Area. Most ant species belong to the genera of Formica, Lasius, and Myrmica, which amount to approximately 75% of the ant species richness in the Mordovia State Nature Reserve. The zoogeographical analysis of the ant fauna demonstrated seven geographical range types with a predominance of the European-West-Siberian and North-Palaearctic ranges. The ant diversity was analysed using the Renyi diversity profile based on census route data. The spatial distribution of ant species was estimated using detrended correspondence analysis. We found a high level of ant species diversity, conditioned by the effect of species evenness in the Mordovia State Nature Reserve. The most species-specific habitats were pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests with Convallaria majalis predominance in herb layer, linden (Tilia cordata) forests with participation of Betula pendula and Picea abies, dry Poa pratensis-dominated meadows, and moist meadows with predominance of Lupinus polyphyllus. The differences between the studied habitats were determined by microclimate conditions for specific ant species. On the model plots, the ant species density was about 7 species per 100 m(2) in average.

AB  - Many marine animals aggregate seasonally at predictable locations to exploit their prey in oligotrophic environments, making them vulnerable to human disturbance. The foraging strategies and habitats of manta rays andStenellaspp. in the Solor waters were largely unknown, despite the importance of this information for their effective management, e.g. through the establishment of marine protected areas in this region. Over the last few decades, the use of foraging habitat models in describing the foraging strategy and delineating the predicted habitats has grown in popularity. However, most of these studies have relied on remotely sensed data such as sea surface chlorophyll-ato estimate prey distribution. Very few studies have used the distribution ofin situprey, which is that closer to the trophic level of modelled species, although such a strategy would improve model performance. The study compares foraging habitat model performance for manta rays andStenellaspp. in the waters of Solor using remotely sensed sea surface chlorophyll-aconcentrations andin situzooplankton biomass as proxies for prey quantities and distribution. A Maximum Entropy model that integrated species sightings with environmental predictors was used to quantify the importance of predictors in explaining habitat preference and distribution of manta rays andStenellaspp. and to compare model performance and predict foraging habitats. Results indicate that the use of prey proxy closer to the trophic level of examined species improve model performance, ecological explanations, and spatial predictions. The zooplankton biomass distribution performed much better in explaining the manta rays' habitats compared to that ofStenellaspp., indicating that a trophic level gap might influence the zooplankton's ability to predict foraging habitats ofStenellaspp. This study highlights the importance of integrating foraging habitat models into marine protected area design to ensure the effectiveness of species management.

AB  - The factors that determine patterns of non-native species richness and abundance are context dependent in both time and space. Global change has significantly boosted plant invasions in mountains, therefore, understanding which factors determine the invasion and at what scale they operate are fundamental for decision-making in the conservation of mountain ecosystems. Although much evidence has been gathered on the patterns of non-native species in mountain ecosystems, little is known about what specific abiotic, biotic, or anthropogenic factors are driven such patterns. Here, we assessed the importance of anthropogenic, biotic, and abiotic factors at two spatial scales as drivers of plant invasions along three roads in south-central Chile. We sampled non-native plant richness and abundance, and each of these explanatory factors, in-situ in 60 transects in disturbed areas and adjacent undisturbed vegetation. Low elevation areas were the most invaded, with patterns of richness and abundance driven mainly by anthropogenic factors, explaining between 20 and 50% of the variance for the three roads. Only for the abundance of non-native species along the road in the Malalcahuello National Reserve, biotic factors were more important (45% of the variance). At the regional scale, the abundance of non-native species was again explained best by anthropogenic factors (24% of the variance), yet non-native richness was driven most strongly by abiotic factors such as soil nitrogen content and pH (15% of the variance). Our results confirm the conclusions from experimental studies that anthropogenic factors override abiotic factors and are important drivers of non-native species at local and regional scales and that non-native plant invasion in mountains is currently not strongly limited by climate.

AB  - The Horned Guan (Oreophasis derbianus) is a critically endangered cracid species endemic to Mexico and Guatemala; nevertheless, its population size has been poorly documented throughout most of its distributional range. In the Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, population density was estimated by visual and acoustic surveys in line transects, based on the distance sampling theory. Three transects (8 km total length) located in the cloud and mixed forest at "Las Cabanas" core area of the Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve in the Albores locality, Department of El Progreso were monthly surveyed to total up 72 km of sampling effort from April to December 2009. Estimated population density was 3.04 +/- 1.16 (+/- SE) ind/km(2), which was compared with other density estimates from different areas within the species distribution in Mexico and Guatemala. The distribution of density estimates seems to fit a biogeographic pattern where higher population densities are found at the center of the species distributional range tending to decrease towards the periphery. If this is the case, it may have important implications in the definition of the species conservation strategies. Nevertheless, human impacts, such as hunting and poaching, could also be the cause of differences in population density among sites. Most of the detections occurred in June, and a female with two chicks was observed in August. The Horned Guan was observed to use 22 plant species in the study area for feeding, vocalizing, and perching, of which three (Passiflora membranaceae, Prunus barbata, and Oreopanax hederaceum) were new records as food items. Hunting activity is reported within the core zone of the protected area, threating the viability of this population. Research on hunting pressure, habitat requirements, movement patterns, and genetic variability are key to further understand the biology of the Horned Guan and to establish appropriate conservation measures.

AB  - Overlap between wildlife living spaces and human activity spaces represents one of the main causes of human-wildlife conflict. It is therefore necessary to identify and adjust the spatial distribution of conflicts because climate change will modify the ranges and locations of species. The MaxEnt model was used to simulate the distribution of wildlife living spaces under current and future climatic conditions (RCP4.5 scenario) based on species distribution data and environmental data from the Three-River Source Region. Furthermore, the logistic-cellular automata model was used to simulate the changes in human activity spaces (construction land and arable land) by 2050. Areas of overlap between wildlife living spaces and human activity spaces were determined by overlay analysis. Then, the areas of construction and arable land that would conflict with wildlife were redistributed outside highly suitable wildlife living spaces. In addition, ecological corridors connecting current and future living spaces were planned for the migration of certain species in response to climate change based on the minimum cumulative resistance model. The results showed that the areas of highly suitable wildlife living spaces will decrease under the influence of climate change if global warming occurs. In the future, the area of overlap between highly suitable wildlife living spaces and construction land will be 125 km(2), and that between highly suitable wildlife living spaces and arable land will be 340 km(2). The redistribution of these areas will cause human activity spaces to become more concentrated. Moreover, 110 ecological corridors should be constructed across roads in the Three-River Source Region.

AB  - Background
   The North Caucasus is an extensive region with a multitude of landscapes and high biological diversity. Amongst various ecosystems, the xerophytic sub-Mediterranean forests of the Abrau Peninsula (Utrish State Nature Reserve) and its vicinity are unique but have been poorly studied. The diversity of diatoms in North Caucasian ecosystems have been studied partially and only little information is available about their presence and distribution on the Abrau Peninsula. Here, we present a comprehensive check-list of diatoms sampled during a July 2021 field campaign. Samples were collected in 67 sites, including 39 permanent streams, 21 temporal (puddles) and seven permanent waterbodies. Results of the current study contribute to improving the knowledge about diatoms in the north-western Caucasus and its sub-Mediterranean ecosystems in particular.
   New information
   Here, we provide a detailed dataset that contains 215 freshwater and brackish diatom occurrences collected during a field campaign in July 2021. A total of 88 diatom (Bacillariophyta) taxa which belong to 12 orders, 25 families and 39 genera were collected. The genera with the highest number of occurrences per site were Gomphonema (26), Nitzschia (22), Navicula (20), Cocconeis (14), Amphora (14), Achnanthidium (14) and Planothidium (11). The genera with the highest number of infrageneric taxa were Nitzschia (8), Navicula (7), Gomphonema (6) and Mastogloia (5). Navicula blazencicae, known as the endemic of the Lake Prespa (Levkov 2007) is found from two sites in our study. Three specimens of the genus Mastogloia could not be assigned to a known species and may represent new diatom species. Distribution and ecology data are provided for each taxa. Occurrence data are given. Statistical analysis of diatom communities showed a significant dependence on habitat type and their ecological conditions.

AB  - Multiple anthropogenic threats have caused vulture populations to decline globally, with serious ecological and socio-economic implications. The Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres) has declined throughout its range in southern Africa, recently being listed as extinct as a breeding species in Namibia. It has been suggested that climate change might have contributed to the decline of Cape vultures in northern parts of the range. To provide a first assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on the occurrence of Cape vultures, a presence-only environmental niche modelling method (Maxent) was used to predict the spatial occurrence patterns of wild vultures fitted with GPS tracking units in northern Namibia and northern South Africa, under current and future climatic conditions. The models showed high predictive power (AUC > 0.868 +/- 0.006), with precipitation seasonality identified as the most important variable for predicting Cape vulture presence. Of the area estimated to be suitable for Cape vultures under current conditions, 28-55% was predicted to become unsuitable under future climate conditions, with a pole-ward shift in the mean centre of the range of 151-333 km and significant range loss from the former breeding range in north-central Namibia and the core breeding range in northern South Africa. The total area of suitable range was predicted to increase in the future due to modelled expansions into grassland and cropland areas where the species has been absent historically. The coverage of suitable areas by protected areas was predicted to decrease from 5.8-7.9% to 2.8-3.8%, suggesting that private land will become increasingly important for Cape vulture conservation.

AB  - There is a clear need to refocus the way we prioritize conservation actions at a global scale to incorporate human systems. Anthromes have been suggested as one tool for integrating anthropogenic effects on ecosystems, but spatially explicit comparisons of biodiversity patterns are limited at a global extent. To address this gap, we used global data sets of anthromes and terrestrial vertebrate richness. We ranked anthromes by richness to all and threatened species at a global scale, temperate and tropical extents, and within major geographic regions. We tested for correlations between overall richness and count of threatened species, between taxonomic groups (birds, mammals, amphibians), and between taxa and conservation actions. At the global scale, there is high variation in vertebrate species richness by anthrome with low species richness in wildlands and higher richness in villages, rangelands, and woodlands. Threatened species distribution follows a similar pattern with high numbers of threatened species in village and remote seminatural woodland anthromes. Analyzes at temperate and tropical extents suggests unique opportunities in different regions, for example when considering the value of land sparing or sharing. There is clear heterogeneity across geographic regions. Richness in anthromes and hotspots are spatially aligned across all taxa but not for threatened taxa. Protection was negatively correlated with threatened bird richness. Human modified ecosystems provide opportunities for conservation and global and regional ranking of anthromes helps identify priorities that can complement biome and ecoregion-based prioritization. Currently, much of conservation research and prioritization is in wildlands or perceived natural landscapes, however this data shows a clear need to focus conservation efforts on seminatural, managed, and residential lands. These data would be helpful for global conservation organizations as an updated framework that can be used to prioritize global resource allocation while considering both ecological and social systems.

AB  - Ecological traps occur when areas preferentially selected by a species harbour an unknown increased mortality risk or reduced fitness for the individuals utilizing them. If animals continue to utilize these habitats, rapid declines may result that threaten the persistence of the population. Both black and white rhinoceroses are plagued by severe, targeted rhino poaching in South Africa that may have population and species-level consequences in the long term. Poaching can rapidly increase mortality and may create habitats that function as ecological traps for protected populations. We used spatially explicit data of live rhino and poached rhino carcasses in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, to define high- and low-risk states for both black and white rhino species. The proportion of area functioning as ecological trap was similar for both species (black: 37.73%, white: 35.51%), while the proportion of safe harbour was considerably lower for black rhino (black rhino: 32.01%, white rhino: 44.74%). Species-specific risk areas were condensed into management categories that reflect the actions most likely to be effective for overall rhino protection in those areas. 'Threat' area, representing ecological traps for both species, comprised 32.48% of southern Kruger; this represents the highest priority for anti-poaching interventions. A further 31.03% was identified as 'haven', representing safe harbours for both species, which may benefit most from continued rhino monitoring and surveillance. Using these categories, authorities can prioritize the distribution of limited resources and tailor anti-poaching and biological management actions according to the needs of each area for the concurrent protection of both rhino species. This work illustrates how the conservation of multiple species or taxa within a system can be simultaneously prioritized in vast areas where resources and/or capacity may be insufficient to undertake species-specific approaches.

AB  - Broad scale population estimates of declining species are desired for conservation efforts. However, for many secretive species including large carnivores, such estimates are often difficult. Based on published density estimates obtained through camera trapping, presence/absence data, and globally available predictive variables derived from satellite imagery, we modelled density and occurrence of a large carnivore, the jaguar, across the species' entire range. We then combined these models in a hierarchical framework to estimate the total population. Our models indicate that potential jaguar density is best predicted by measures of primary productivity, with the highest densities in the most productive tropical habitats and a clear declining gradient with distance from the equator. Jaguar distribution, in contrast, is determined by the combined effects of human impacts and environmental factors: probability of jaguar occurrence increased with forest cover, mean temperature, and annual precipitation and declined with increases in human foot print index and human density. Probability of occurrence was also significantly higher for protected areas than outside of them. We estimated the world's jaguar population at 173,000 (95% CI: 138,000-208,000) individuals, mostly concentrated in the Amazon Basin; elsewhere, populations tend to be small and fragmented. The high number of jaguars results from the large total area still occupied (almost 9 million km(2)) and low human densities (< 1 person/km(2)) coinciding with high primary productivity in the core area of jaguar range. Our results show the importance of protected areas for jaguar persistence. We conclude that combining modelling of density and distribution can reveal ecological patterns and processes at global scales, can provide robust estimates for use in species assessments, and can guide broad-scale conservation actions.

AB  - Gunung Ledang, or previously known as Mount Ophir is the highest highland in south Peninsular Malaysia, in the state of Johor. Along with its elevations, climate, and vegetation vary. These influence the distribution of flora and fauna such as butterfly. The objectives of this study were (i) to document the diversity of butterfly along elevational gradients and (ii) to analyze species diversity patterns based on faunistic aspect. To determine spatial distribution, this study was conducted at three different altitudes; 1 200 m, 800 m, and 400 m above sea level (a.s.1.). Samplings were conducted from May 2014 until Feb 2015. During the eight sampling occasions, two main methods were employed; manual collection using the aerial net and baited trapping using rotten fruits. A total of 635 individuals comprising 129 butterfly species from five families were recorded. The five families were Papilionidae, Pieridae, Nymphalidae, Lycaenidae, and Hesperiidae. Nymphalidae was the most well-represented family by 58.1 % species richness and 80.3 % abundance. At all elevations, eight species were consistently found. They were: Eurema hecabe, Euploea mulciber, Ideopsis gaura, Mycalesis maianeas, Ypthima pandocus, Cirrochroa malaya, Cirrochroa orissa, and Hypolimnas bolina. There were highly significant differences (p < 0.001) in the diversity of butterfly species between elevations. The values of Shannon Diversity Index (H') was highest, 4.179 at 400m and lowest, 1.792 at 1 200 m. Meanwhile, the Species Evenness Index (E') at 400 m was 0.660 and at 1 200 m was 0.162. These indicated that lowest altitude (400 m) would harbor higher species diversity and more even species distribution compared to the two higher altitudes. Spatially, the diversity of butterfly in a highland forest of Malaysia was established, providing a baseline data that would be useful for monitoring and conservation of a protected area such as Gunung Ledang National Park.

AB  - Of the roughly 12, 000 known plant species in Madagascar, only 3% are found in the IUCN (World Conservation Union) Red List of Threatened Species. We assigned preliminary IUCN categories of threat to the species of a comparatively well-known tribe, Coleeae (Bignoniaceae), which comprises an endemic, species-rich radiation in Madagascar Because the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria 3.1 discourage the use of the data-deficient category, we developed a novel method for differentiating between range-limited species and poorly sampled species. We used the Missouri Botanical Garden (MBG) gazetteer to determine where other collection efforts had taken place. We drew buffers around each Coleeae locality and determined how many times the surrounding area had been visited since the last sighting of the specimens by intersecting the buffers with all known botanical localities from the MBG gazetteer We determined that at least 54% of the Coleeae species are threatened with extinction. Assignments of species to this category were often due to predicted future decline within their current area of occupancy and their lack of inclusion within the protected-area network (only 42% of species are known to occur in protected areas). Three species were presumed extinct, and an additional 12 have not been seen in decades. Among the species threatened with extinction, we "rescued" six of them from the data-deficient category by considering both the sample dates and localities of places where they occurred in relation to additional collections that took place in the immediate area. Due to their recent discovery, 15 species remained in the data-deficient category. If Coleeae is representative of the Malagasy flora, or at least of other endemic-radiated plant groups, then species loss in Madagascar may be even more extreme than is realized.

AB  - The significance of edaphic factors in describing forest vegetation patterns is becoming more well acknowledged, with significant implications for the description of biogeographical regions and biome classification, as well as abundance and growth patterns at regional levels. The current study examines the vegetation association in the Zabarwan mountain range of the Western Himalayas and its association with edaphic factors. To collect data on forest types, we employed a systematic random sampling strategy in 60 plots (0.1 ha) across five forest types. We investigated data using ordination and cluster analysis approaches after calculating the important value index (henceforth IVI) for each plant species and edaphic data from forests. In total, 76 plant species from 39 different families were found in the area. The Rosaceae family was the most numerous, followed by Fabaceae and Asteraceae. Scrub forest types have lower diversity indices, while broad-leaved forest types have greater diversity indices. Two-way cluster analyses classified the forest vegetation of the Zabarwan mountain range into two plant communities on the basis of indicator plant species. The ordination analysis (canonical correspondence analysis) indicated that vegetation association tended to be influenced differently by distinct levels of soil parameters. The soil pH and calcium content were the main factors influencing the species distribution in the different forest types. The phytosociological features (basal area) were higher in coniferous forest type (74.49 m(2)ha(-1)) compared to broad-leaved (58.63 m(2)ha(-1)) and scrub forest type (15.4 m(2)ha(-1)). Overall, the goal of this research is to gain a better understanding of the impact of soil elements on forest composition and associations in order to develop scientifically based management options for forest ecosystem protection in the Himalayan region.

AB  - Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are reliant on Cladonia spp. ground lichens as a major component of their diet and lichen abundance could be an important indicator of habitat quality, particularly in winter. The boreal forest is typified by large, stand-replacing forest fires that consume ground lichens, which take decades to recover. The large spatial extent of caribou ranges and the mosaic of lichen availability created by fires make it challenging to track the abundance of ground lichens. Researchers have developed various techniques to map lichens across northern boreal and tundra landscapes, but it remains unclear which techniques are best suited for use in the continuous boreal forest, where many of the conflicts amongst caribou and human activities are most acute. In this study, we propose a two-stage regression modelling approach to map the abundance (biomass, kg/ha) of Cladonia spp. ground lichens in the boreal forest. Our study was conducted in Woodland Caribou Provincial Park, a wilderness-class protected area in northwestern Ontario, Canada. We used field sampling to characterize lichen abundance in 109 upland forest stands across the local time-since-fire continuum (2-119 years-since-fire). We then used generalized linear models to relate lichen presence and lichen abundance to forest structure, topographic and remote sensing attributes. Model selection indicated ground lichens were best predicted by ecosite, time-since-fire, and canopy closure. Lichen abundance was very low (<1000 kg/ha) across the time-since-fire continuum in upland forest stands with dense tree cover. Conversely, lichen abundance increased steadily across the time-since-fire continuum in upland forest stands with sparse tree cover, exceeding 3000 kg/ha in mature stands. We interpolated the best lichen presence and lichen abundance models to create spatial layers and combined them to generate a map that provides a reasonable estimation of lichen biomass (R-2 = 0.39) for our study area. We encourage researchers and managers to use our method as a basic framework to map the abundance of ground lichens across fire-prone, boreal caribou ranges. Mapping lichens will aid in the identification of suitable habitat and can be used in planning to ensure habitat is maintained in adequate supply in areas with multiple land-use objectives. We also encourage the use of lichen abundance maps to investigate questions that improve our understanding of caribou ecology.

AB  - Studies estimating species' distributions require information about animal locations in space and time. Location data can be collected using surveys within a predetermined frame of reference (i.e., Eulerian sampling) or from animal-borne tracking devices (i.e., Lagrangian sampling). Integration of observations obtained from Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives can provide insights into animal movement and habitat use. However, contemporaneous data from both perspectives are rarely available, making examination of biases associated with each sampling approach difficult. We compared distributions of a mobile seabird observed concurrently from ship, aerial, and satellite tag surveys during May, June, and July 2012 in the northern California Current. We calculated utilization distributions to quantify and compare variability in common murre (Uria aalge) space use and examine how sampling perspective and platform influence observed patterns. Spatial distributions of murres were similar in May, regardless of sampling perspective. Greatest densities occurred in coastal waters off southern Washington and northern Oregon, near large murre colonies and the mouth of the Columbia River. Density distributions of murres estimated from ship and aerial surveys in June and July were similar to those observed in May, whereas distributions of satellite-tagged murres in June and July indicated northward movement into British Columbia, Canada, resulting in different patterns observed from Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives. These results suggest that the population of murres observed in the northern California Current during spring and summer includes relatively stationary individuals attending breeding colonies and nonstationary, vagile adults and subadults. Given the expected growth of telemetry studies and advances in survey technology (e.g., unmanned aerial systems), these results highlight the importance of considering methodological approaches, spatial extent, and synopticity of distribution data sets prior to integrating data from different sampling perspectives.

AB  - 1. Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary along the Indo-Nepal border in India harbours a well-known breeding gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) population in its global distribution range together with a substantial population of breeding muggers (Crocodylus palustris). However, no systematic information on size and structure is available for either of the species' populations in the protected area.
   2. This study was undertaken in winter and the ensuing summer of 2010-2011 to estimate the relative population density and structure of the two crocodilian species and to examine the effect of various disturbance factors, with the main focus on the effects of tourism and illegal fishing on the behavioural attributes of the two species.
   3. Five daytime surveys were conducted from December 2010 to April 2011. Relative density based on encounter rate (number per 20km) was highest for gharial juveniles followed by gharial adults and gharial sub-adults in all the five surveys. Muggers, on the other hand, showed the opposite trend, with the lowest encounter rate being for juveniles, followed by sub-adults and adults. The encounter rate of both species declined with increase in the mean ambient temperature from December to April.
   4. The river habitat was divided into 2km segments and disturbance factors were recorded at intervals of 100m on both river banks. Wariness was taken as an indicator of response to disturbance caused by human beings and was measured from mechanized boats used for tourism and non-mechanized boats used for illegal fishing.
   5. Segments with sandbars, in spite of moderate to high disturbance rate, were preferred for basking by both species. In conclusion, with suitable habitat for basking, gharials and muggers were observed to tolerate moderate levels of disturbance. Wariness resulting from disturbances from the non-mechanized boats was higher than that from the mechanized boats. Gharials tend to avoid humans, possibly with age/size acquired experience and knowledge, whereas muggers become more tolerant to human presence with increased age/size.
   6. Despite many disturbance factors, the crocodilian population in Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary is doing relatively well compared with populations in other habitats in India. With the involvement of local stakeholders and strict implementation of forest laws, the habitat can be further improved and a healthy gharial population can be ensured.

AB  - Knowledge of the ecological requirements, the current extensions, and cover of a species is important for its management conservation, but this information is lacking for many species of Polylepis (ROSACEA). Here we use niche modeling to understand the ecological requirements of two Polylepis species natively found in sympatry within the Huascaran National Park (HNP) (Cordillera Blanca, Peru), Polylepis albicans and P. webebaueri, and produce species distribution maps restricted by forest cover to estimate each species' current cover within the park. Based on presence/absence data collected systematically throughout their local elevational distribution and analyzed using a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and generalized linear models (glm), the best models show that P. albicans and P. weberbaueri have different environmental niches and their occupation is maximized at different climatic ranges mainly associated with temperature (annual mean temperature and mean monthly temperature range) and solar radiation during the dry season. P. albicans occupies warmer and drier areas than P. weberbaueri, which leads to a spatial segregation that has implications for the conservation management of each species. However, it is necessary to evaluate if the models described here adequately capture the environmental niche of other populations of P. weberbaueri, or if these could be new species. Our results indicate that within the HNP, the extension of Polylepis forests (similar to 24,000 ha; 11,361 ha of P. albicans and 12,627 ha of P. weberbaueri) is significantly greater than that previously reported and confirm that this protected area harbors the greatest extensions of both species in Peru and its proper management is key for their conservation and that of the ecosystems they constitute.

AB  - Altered disturbance regimes in forest ecosystems can lead to the formation of dense, persistent understory vegetation composed of a small number of dominant species. This understory layer often limits tree seedling recruitment, decreases biodiversity, and can alter forest ecosystem structure and functioning. In the southern Appalachians - one of the most biodiverse regions in North America - pervasive logging in the 19th and early 20th centuries may have contributed to the formation of a dense understory shrub layer that suppresses plant diversity and tree recruitment, but the evidence for this idea has been mixed. To help clarify this issue, we tested whether (a) the two dominant understory shrub taxa (Kalmia latifolia and evergreen Rhododendron species) were more common or more abundant in areas with a history of intense logging than in areas undisturbed by logging, and (b) the relationships between the understory shrub layer and environmental gradients that drive regional biodiversity and plant distributions in the Southern Appalachians (e.g., climate, soils) differ in logged versus undisturbed areas. We used publicly available, extensive, and spatially explicit data on vegetation, climate, topography, soils, solar radiation, and logging history in Great Smoky Mountains National Park to build beta and binomial regression models of shrub frequency and cover as a function of logging history and environmental variables. Contrary to our expectation and speculations in the literature, we found that the dominant shrub taxa were more common (frequent) in areas with no logging history. However, we also found that logging history effects on shrub abundance (cover) varied along environmental gradients. For example, in topographically shaded landscape positions evergreen Rhododendron thickets exhibited greater cover in logged areas than in areas with no logging history. On the other hand, Rhododendron thickets exhibited lower cover in logged areas than in areas with no logging history at low elevations. Thus, conservation planning and forest management in topographically complex regions need to consider both landscape context (e.g., elevation, landscape position) and past logging as important interacting drivers that either facilitate or suppress local formation of dense shrub understories that can ultimately impact tree regeneration patterns, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Climate influences population genetic variation in marine species. Capturing these impacts remains challenging for marine fishes which disperse over large geographical scales spanning steep environmental gradients. It requires the extensive spatial sampling of individuals or populations, representative of seascape heterogeneity, combined with a set of highly informative molecular markers capable of revealing climatic-associated genetic variations. We explored how space, dispersal and environment shape the genomic patterns of two sympatric fish species in the Mediterranean Sea, which ranks among the oceanic basins most affected by climate change and human pressure. We hypothesized that the population structure and climate-associated genomic signatures of selection would be stronger in the less mobile species, as restricted gene flow tends to facilitate the fixation of locally adapted alleles. To test our hypothesis, we genotyped two species with contrasting dispersal abilities: the white seabream Diplodus sargus and the striped red mullet Mullus surmuletus. We collected 823 individuals and used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to detect 8,206 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the seabream and 2,794 for the mullet. For each species, we identified highly differentiated genomic regions (i.e. outliers) and disentangled the relative contribution of space, dispersal and environmental variables (climate, marine primary productivity) on the outliers' genetic structure to test the prevalence of gene flow and local adaptation. We observed contrasting patterns of gene flow and adaptive genetic variation between the two species. The seabream showed a distinct Alboran sea population and panmixia across the Mediterranean Sea. The mullet revealed additional differentiation within the Mediterranean Sea that was significantly correlated to summer and winter temperatures, as well as marine primary productivity. Functional annotation of the climate-associated outlier SNPs then identified candidate genes involved in heat tolerance that could be examined to further predict species' responses to climate change. Our results illustrate the key steps of a comparative seascape genomics study aiming to unravel the evolutionary processes at play in marine species, to better anticipate their response to climate change. Defining population adaptation capacities and environmental niches can then serve to incorporate evolutionary processes into species conservation planning.

AB  - Context. Species translocations are used in conservation globally. Although harvest for translocation may have negative impacts on source populations, translocation programs rarely explore ways of minimising those impacts. In fluctuating source populations, harvest timing may affect its impact because population size and trajectory vary among years.
   Aims. We explored whether the timing and scale of harvest can be altered to reduce its impact on a fluctuating source population of Mallee Emu-wrens, Stipiturus mallee; an endangered passerine in south-eastern Australia. Mallee Emuwren populations fluctuate with similar to 5-10-year drought-rain cycles.
   Methods. We used population viability analysis (PVA) to compare the impact of five harvest scales (no harvest, 100, 200, 300 or 500 individuals) under three population trajectories (increasing, stable or decreasing) and two initial population sizes (our model-based estimate of the population size and the lower 95% confidence interval of that estimate). To generate a model-based estimate of the population size, we surveyed 540 sites (9 ha), stratified according to environmental variables known to affect Mallee Emu-wren occurrence. We used an information-theoretic approach with N-mixture models to estimate Mallee Emu-wren density, and extrapolated results over all potential habitat.
   Key Results. We estimate that in spring 2019, the source population consisted of 6449 individuals, with a minimum of 1923 individuals (lower 95% confidence interval). Of 48 harvest scenarios, only seven showed no impact of harvest within 5 years (15%). Those seven all had increasing population trajectories and carrying capacity set to equal initial population size. Twenty-six populations showed no impact of harvest within 25 years (54%). These were either increasing populations that had reached carrying capacity or decreasing populations nearing extinction.
   Conclusions. Initial population size, carrying capacity, harvest scale and population trajectory were all determinants of harvest impact. Given the importance of carrying capacity, further research is required to determine its role in the Mallee Emu-wren source population.
   Implications. Harvesting Mallee Emu-wrens after high-rainfall years will have the least impact because source populations are likely to be large with increasing trajectories. For fluctuating source populations, flexibility in the timing of harvest can reduce its impact and should be considered during translocation planning.

AB  - British Columbia (BC), Canada, has a diverse landscape that provides breeding habitat for >300 avian species, and the recent development of the BC Breeding Bird Atlas data set presents key information for exploring the landscape conditions which lead to biological richness. We used the volunteer-collected raw breeding bird evidence data set to analyze the effects of sampling biases on spatial distribution of observed breeding bird species and implemented regression tree analysis (Random Forests) to examine the influence of productivity, ambient energy, and habitat heterogeneity on independently measured breeding bird richness. Results indicated that total breeding species richness is correlated with total survey effort (alpha < 0.001). By stratifying species richness by survey effort, we observed that ambient energy is the top-ranked environmental predictor of breeding bird richness across BC, which, when used in combination with a number of other environmental variables, explains similar to 40% of the variation in richness. Using our modeled relationships, we predicted breeding bird species richness in the areas of BC not presently surveyed between three and six hours. The majority of the productive Boreal Plains, the southern portion of the Taiga Plains region, the lowlands of the Southern and Central Interior, along the Rocky Mountain Trench, and the coastal areas of the Georgia Depression are predicted to have the highest categories of breeding richness (35-57 unique species). Our results support ongoing species diversity gradient research, which identifies ambient energy as an important factor influencing species diversity distributions in the Northern Hemisphere. By linking breeding bird richness to environmental data derived from remotely sensed data and systematically collected climate data, we demonstrate the potential to monitor shifts in ambient energy as a surrogate for vertebrate habitat condition affecting population levels. By analyzing the influence of survey effort on species richness metrics, we also highlight the need to consider adding attributes to the raw breeding bird data set to describe observer experience, such as hours or seasons spent surveying, and provide survey dates to allow greater flexibility for removing survey bias. These additions can increase the utility of atlas data for species richness studies useful for conservation planning.

AB  - 1.There has recently been increasing interest in patterns of beta diversity but we still lack a comprehensive understanding of these patterns in various regions (e.g. the tropics), ecosystems (e.g. streams) and organism groups (e.g. invertebrates). 2.Our aim was to investigate the patterns of beta diversity of stream macroinvertebrates in relation to key environmental (i.e. stream size, pH and habitat degradation) and geographical variables (i.e. latitude, longitude, altitude) in a tropical region. We surveyed a total of 810 riffle sites in each of 34 streams (altogether 337 riffle sites were sampled) in Peninsular Malaysia to examine variation in macroinvertebrate community composition at within-stream and among-stream scales. 3.Based on test of homogeneity of dispersion, we found that the streams studied differed significantly in within-stream variation in community composition (i.e. among-site variation of within stream beta diversity). The patterns were similar based on BrayCurtis coefficient on abundance data, Sorensen coefficient on presenceabsence data and Simpson coefficient on presenceabsence data. We also found that within-stream beta diversity was significantly related to stream size, pH and latitude, with each of these variables individually accounting for around 20% of the variation in beta diversity in simple regressions, while the total variation explained by the three significant variables amounted to around 50% in multiple regressions. By contrast, habitat degradation, longitude and altitude were not significantly related to beta diversity. We also found that the factor drainage basin accounted for much of the variation in beta diversity in general linear models, suppressing the effects of environmental variables. 4.We concluded that within-stream beta diversity is mainly related to a combination of the identity of a drainage basin and stream environmental factors. Our findings provide important background for stream environmental assessment and conservation planning by emphasising that (i) macroinvertebrate communities within streams are not homogeneous, but show considerable beta diversity, (ii) streams differ in their degree of within-stream beta diversity, (iii) stream size and water pH should be considered in applied contexts related to within-stream beta diversity and (iv) historical effects may be different in different drainage basins and may affect present-day patterns of within-stream beta diversity.

AB  - Aim Asian forests are becoming increasingly degraded and fragmented by the extensive intensification of anthropogenic activities; these activities threaten wildlife and ecosystem sustainability. Facing a defaunation crisis, managers need more information on species assemblages to guide conservation efforts. We tested the relative influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on mammalian species richness and occupancy in temperate forests in Northeast Asia.
   Location Northeast China.
   Methods Camera-trapping data and multispecies occupancy models were used to estimate the species richness of a terrestrial mammal community in a working landscape and assess community-, group-, and species-specific responses to natural and anthropogenic features while accounting for imperfect detection. Species were grouped based on body size, diet and activity pattern.
   Results We deployed 138 cameras and photographed 21 mammalian species over 22,976 trap days across the China-Russia border. Both natural and anthropogenic correlates varied in their importance in predicting the presence of different animals. Vegetation cover and cattle were found to have significantly positive and negative influences on community-level mammalian occupancy, respectively. The positive relationship with vegetation cover was most evident for large or diurnal species; the negative relationship with cattle was most evident for diurnal and wild ungulate species. Large species occupancy was also negatively associated with human settlements. The predicted richness across each station varied from 5 to 14 unique species, and species had a mean occupancy probability of 0.45 (95% credible interval = 0.09-0.86). Species richness was generally the lowest in livestock grazing areas and close to human settlements. Human influence is more important than the influences of vegetation and environmental variables.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight that livestock grazing was the primary human disturbance that had a negative impact on species occupancy and richness. Multispecies occupancy models helped to identify drivers of biodiversity declines and will inform conservation strategies in human-dominated landscapes in Northeast Asian forests. We suggest that landscape conservation planning seeks to maximize forest protection and ecosystem services such as biodiversity and carbon storage.

AB  - Climate change may limit integration of Underutilized Agroforestry Fruits Trees (UAFT) into formal cropping systems as a strategy to increase rural household income in Africa. The present study analyzed the potential impact of climate change on the geographical distribution of suitable areas for tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.), an economically important UAFT species. Presence records of the species were collected and combined with bioclimatic data derived from the Worldclim data base and from soil type data. The Maximum Entropy Modeling principle (MAXENT) was used in combination with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to forecast current and future (horizon 2050) suitable habitats for the cultivation and conservation of the species. Three different climate models were used for future predictions (the CCCMA, HadCM3 and CSIRO models) under IPCC scenario A2. Under current conditions, 65% of the national area and 87% of the national protected area network were found to be highly suitable for the cultivation and conservation of local tamarind ecotypes, respectively. It is possible that an increase in rainfall (CCCMA and HadCM3 models) will convert the currently highly suitable zones (semi-arid and subhumid dry) into poorly suitable areas at horizon 2050. A decline in precipitation (CSIRO model) could also convert the currently poorly suitable zones (sub-humid humid) into highly suitable zones. In the case of an aridification of the climate (CSIRO), cultivation and conservation of tamarind could become possible all over Benin and/or require the introduction of ecotypes from more arid areas. The predictive capacity of climatic models is constantly improving and it is therefore recommended that such studies be undertaken in order to better inform decision making for the optimum use of UAFT species.

We predict substantial differences between checklist and range map richness for smaller areas, where higher errors of commission from range maps are likely to occur. We also explore how discrepancies between species inventories and range maps may affect assessments of reserve prioritization and representation. Location Continental America and associated islands. Methods We obtained species numbers based on checklists for 619 protected areas from a variety of sources, including management plans, technical reports, environmental assessments, official websites, biodiversity databases and conservation agencies, and evaluated how these correlate with species richness estimates from geographical range map databases, also testing for an effect of reserve size on range map omission and commission errors. Results Species richness estimates obtained from checklists and range maps showed a significant positive relationship for all three groups of vertebrates, although for most protected areas, estimates of richness from range overlap maps tended to be overestimates, especially for amphibians and mammals in species-rich regions. Protected area size explained little of the discrepancies between checklist and range map richness. Species representation in protected areas based on checklists was in general lower than representation based on range maps. Main conclusions Our results suggest that range maps, although far from perfect, have the advantage of reducing geographical biases and filling gaps that exist in point locality data at least in species-rich protected areas, while most available checklists in these regions were extremely variable in quality and availability, lacking of basic information on survey design, reliability and completeness. However, range maps will likely overestimate species representation in protected areas and should thus be treated with caution in this context.

AB  - Protected areas are essential for both conservation of biodiversity and provisioning of dynamic ecosystem services. In recent years, invasive plant species have had devastating impacts on the sustenance of natural habitat for the in-situ conservation of threatened species. In the present study, we investigated the distribution pattern of Chromolaena odorata and Mikania micrantha and factors governing their spread in the grassland of Manas National Park. We carried out extensive field sampling and modeled the distribution of invasives using a suite of algorithms. Model predictions differed with respect to AUC, sensitivity, specificity and TSS range, largely in classification performance. Final risk maps were produced averaging the model outputs of Random Forest and MaxEnt for both the species. Subsequently, we also emphasized that the niche/SDM modelling studies should instigate by testing a suite of algorithms for predictive ability under the specific conditions of the study since no single optimization approach would be best under all circumstances. Proximity to the road and human settlement, elevation, fire occurrence and precipitation of driest quarter were the key predictors for both the invasive. The potential area invaded by the C. odorata was 74.87 sq. km and M. micarantha 81.82 sq. km, and a high degree of overlap found between the distributions of both the species. Invasion risk maps can be used as an early detection tool for the management of invasive species, which could help in minimizing the ecological significance and economic cost of invasions. The findings of the present study will help the forest authorities to manage, take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of invasive.

AB  - The effectiveness of conservation plans depends on environmental, ecological, and socioeconomic factors. Global change makes conservation decisions even more challenging. Among others, the components of most concern in modern-day conservation assessments are as follows: the magnitude of climate and land-use changes; species dispersal abilities; competition with harmful socioeconomic activities for land use; the number of threatened species to consider; and, relatedly, the available budget to act. Here, we provide a unified framework that quantifies the relative effects of those factors on conservation. We conducted an area-scheduling work plan in order to identify sets of areas along time in which the persistence expectancies of species are optimized. The approach was illustrated using data of potential distribution of ten nonvolant mammal species in Iberia Peninsula from current time up to 2080. Analyses were conducted considering possible setups among the factors that are likely to critically impact conservation success: three climate/land-use scenarios; four species' dispersal kernel curves; six land-use layer types; and two planning designs, in which assessments were made independently for each species, or joining all species in a single plan. We identified areas for an array of investments levels capable to circumvent the spatial conflicts with socioeconomic activities. The effect of each factor on the estimated species persistence scores was assessed using linear mixed models. Our results evidence that conservation success is highly reliant on the resources available to abate land-use conflicts. Nonetheless, under the same investment levels, planning design and climate change were the factors that most shaped species persistence scores. The persistence of five species was especially affected by the sole effect of planning design and consequently, larger conservation investments may retard climatic debts. For three species, the negative effects of a changing climate and of multiple-species planning designs added up, making these species especially at risk. Integrated assessments of the factors most likely to limit species persistence are pivotal to achieve effectiveness.

AB  - Aim To identify priority areas for in situ conservation and collection of germplasm for ex situ backup of crop wild relative (CWR) diversity in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region as part of an action plan for the conservation and use of the region's important CWR diversity. Location SADC region. Methods Diversity, gap and climate change analyses at species and ecogeographic diversity levels were undertaken for 113 regional priority CWR taxa. Results CWR hotspots were identified in Eswatini (former Swaziland), Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Twenty-one per cent of regionally priority CWR occur exclusively outside existing protected areas (PAs), 50% are not conserved ex situ, and 64% are predicted to be negatively impacted by climate change. A total of 120 existing PAs in 13 countries were identified as containing populations likely to persist in the future for 80% of CWR taxa and about 50% of the ecogeographic diversity of these taxa; remaining diversity can be conserved in an additional 151 complementary sites in 11 countries. Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, South Africa and Tanzania contain important areas for conserving CWR diversity in situ in which no negative climate change impact is predicted. Priority CWR diversity in the provinces of Bas-Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Cabinda (Angola) is threatened by climate change and should be collected urgently for ex situ conservation. Other areas rich in ecogeographic diversity that is not conserved ex situ are located in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Main conclusions We identified 120 PAs and 151 complementary sites outside of PAs in 13 SADC countries that could form the basis of the SADC Network for In Situ Conservation of CWR. We also selected priority areas for filling gaps in ex situ collections and for field survey.

AB  - Even though information on global biodiversity trends becomes increasingly available, large taxonomic and spatial data gaps persist at the scale relevant to planning conservation interventions. This is because data collectors are hesitant to share data with global repositories due to workload, lack of incentives, and perceived risk of losing intellectual property rights. In contrast, due to greater conceptual and methodological proximity, taxon-specific database initiatives can provide more direct benefits to data collectors through research collaborations and shared authorship. The IUCNSSC Ape Populations, Environments and Surveys (A.P.E.S.) database was created in 2005 as a repository for data on great apes and other primate taxa. It aims to acquire field survey data and make different types of data accessible, and provide up-to-date species status information. To support the current update of the conservation action plan for western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) we compiled field surveys for this taxon from IUCN SSC A.P.E.S., 75% of which were unpublished. We used spatial modeling to infer total population size, range-wide density distribution, population connectivity and landscape-scale metrics. We estimated a total abundance of 52 800 (95% CI 17 577-96 564) western chimpanzees, of which only 17% occurred in national parks. We also found that 10% of chimpanzees live within 25 km of four multi-national 'development corridors' currently planned for West Africa. These large infrastructure projects aim to promote economic integration and agriculture expansion, but are likely to cause further habitat loss and reduce population connectivity. We close by demonstrating the wealth of conservation-relevant information derivable from a taxon-specific database like IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. and propose that a network of many more such databases could be created to provide the essential information to conservation that can neither be supplied by one-off projects nor by global repositories, and thus are highly complementary to existing initiatives.

AB  - Research Highlights: Rare, or sparsely distributed, species drive the floristic diversity of upland, terra firme and seasonally flooded forests in the central Jurua-a remote and hitherto floristically poorly known area in the Brazilian Amazon. Background and Objectives: Floristic inventories are critical for modelling and understanding the role of Amazonian forests in climate regulation, for sustainable management of forest resources and efficient conservation planning. Yet, detailed information about the often complex spatial distributions of many Amazonian woody plants is limited. Here, we provide information about forest structure and species composition from a remote terra firme forest and an adjacent floodplain forest in the western Brazilian Amazon. More specifically, we ask (1) how floristically different are the terra firme and floodplain forests? and (2) how variable is species composition within the same forest type? Materials and Methods: Between September 2016 and October 2017, we inventoried 97 plots (each 0.1 ha; 100 x 10 m) placed at least 800 m apart, with 46 plots in terra firme forest and 51 in seasonally flooded forest. We included all trees, hemi-epiphytes and palms with diameter at breast height (dbh) > 10 cm and woody lianas > 5 cm dbh. We examine forest structure, family- and species-level floristic composition and species diversity within and between forest types using family and species importance values, rarefaction curves and dissimilarity matrices. Results: Terra firme forest and seasonally flooded forest woody plant communities differ both in structure and species composition, which was highly variable within forest types. Many species were shared between terra firme and seasonally flooded forests, but most species were forest type-specific. Whereas species richness was greatest in the terra firme forest, floodplain species richness was among the highest regionally. Conclusions: Floodplain forests are a crucial complement to terra firme forests in terms of Amazonian woody plant diversity.

AB  - Gridded historical climate products (GHCPs) are employed with increasing frequency when modeling ecological phenomena across large scales and predicting ecological responses to projected climate changes. Concurrently, there is an increasing acknowledgement of the need to account for uncertainty when employing climate projections from ensembles of global circulation models (GCMs) and emissions scenarios. Despite the growing usage and documented differences among GHCPs, uncertainty characterization has primarily focused on GCM and emissions scenario choice, while the consequences of using a single GHCP to make predictions over space and time have received less attention. Here we employ average July temperature data from observations and seven GHCPs to model plant canopy cover and tree basal area across central Alaska, USA. We first compare the fit of, and support for, models employing observed temperatures, GHCP temperatures, and GHCP temperatures with an elevation adjustment, finding (1) greater support for, and better fit using, elevation-adjusted vs. raw temperature models and (2) overall similar fits of elevation-adjusted models employing temperatures from observations or GHCPs. Focusing on basal area, we next compare predictions generated by elevation-adjusted models employing GHCP data under current conditions and a warming scenario of current temperatures plus 2 degrees C, finding good agreement among GHCPs though with between-GHCP differences and variation primarily at middle elevations (similar to 1,000 m). These differences were amplified under the warming scenario. Finally, using pooled indices of prediction variation and difference across GHCP models, we identify characteristics of areas most likely to exhibit prediction uncertainty under current and warming conditions. Despite (1) overall good performance of GHCP data relative to observations in models and (2) positive correlation among model predictions, variation in predictions across models, particularly in mid-elevation areas where the position of treeline may be changing, suggests researchers should exercise caution if selecting a single GHCP for use in models. We recommend the use of multiple GHCPs to provide additional uncertainty information beyond standard estimated prediction intervals, particularly when model predictions are employed in conservation planning.

AB  - Aim To map and interpret floristic and geoecological patterns across the Amazon basin by combining extensive field data with basin-wide Landsat imagery and climatic data. Location Amazonia. Taxon Ground truth data on ferns and lycophytes; remote sensing results reflect forest canopy properties. Methods We used field plot data to assess main ecological gradients across Amazonia and to relate floristic ordination axes to soil base cation concentration, Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas (CHELSA) climatic variables and reflectance values from a basin-wide Landsat image composite with generalized linear models. Ordination axes were then predicted across all Amazonia using Landsat and CHELSA, and a regional subdivision was obtained using k-medoid classification. Results The primary floristic gradient was strongly related to base cation concentration in the soil, and the secondary gradient to climatic variables. The Landsat image composite revealed a tapestry of broad-scale variation in canopy reflectance characteristics across Amazonia. Ordination axis scores predicted using Landsat and CHELSA variables produced spatial patterns consistent with existing knowledge on soils, geology and vegetation, but also suggested new floristic patterns. The clearest dichotomy was between central Amazonia and the peripheral areas, and the available data supported a classification into at least eight subregions. Main conclusions Landsat data are capable of predicting soil-related species compositional patterns of understorey ferns and lycophytes across the Amazon basin with surprisingly high accuracy. Although the exact floristic relationships may differ among plant groups, the observed ecological gradients must be relevant for other plants as well, since surface reflectance recorded by satellites is mostly influenced by the tree canopy. This opens exciting prospects for species distribution modelling, conservation planning, and biogeographical and ecological studies on Amazonian biota. Our maps provide a preliminary geoecological subdivision of Amazonia that can now be tested and refined using field data of other plant groups and from hitherto unsampled areas.

AB  - Shifts in species distributions are major fingerprint of climate change. Examining changes in species abundance structures at a continental scale enables robust evaluation of climate change influences, but few studies have conducted these evaluations due to limited data and methodological constraints. In this study, we estimate temporal changes in abundance from North American Breeding Bird Survey data at the scale of physiographic strata to examine the relative influence of different components of climatic factors and evaluate the hypothesis that shifting species distributions are multidirectional in resident bird species in North America. We quantify the direction and velocity of the abundance shifts of 57 permanent resident birds over 44 years using a centroid analysis. For species with significant abundance shifts in the centroid analysis, we conduct a more intensive correlative analysis to identify climate components most strongly associated with composite change of abundance within strata. Our analysis focus on two contrasts: the relative importance of climate extremes vs. averages, and of temperature vs. precipitation in strength of association with abundance change. Our study shows that 36 species had significant abundance shifts over the study period. The average velocity of the centroid is 5.89 km.yr(-1). The shifted distance on average covers 259 km, 9% of range extent. Our results strongly suggest that the climate change fingerprint in studied avian distributions is multidirectional. Among 6 directions with significant abundance shifts, the northwestward shift was observed in the largest number of species (n = 13). The temperature/average climate model consistently has greater predictive ability than the precipitation/extreme climate model in explaining strata-level abundance change. Our study shows heterogeneous avian responses to recent environmental changes. It highlights needs for more species-specific approaches to examine contributing factors to recent distributional changes and for comprehensive conservation planning for climate change adaptation.

However, much of Mexico's biodiversity is under threat due to a variety of factors, in particular, habitat loss. The Mexican legal standard (Norma Oficial Mexicana; NOM-ECOL-059-2010) uses four criteria to analyze species extinction risk at a national scale. However, when prioritizing areas for biodiversity conservation it is also important to incorporate knowledge of the conservation status of species at a more localized scale (regional, state, or municipal levels) for identifying possible risks associated with population declines. This paper focuses on Guerrero, which is the fourth most biologically diverse state in Mexico. The total extent of the conservation areas in Guerrero is low, amounting to 0.09% of its total area. We analyzed data for 582 terrestrial vertebrate species in Guerrero (53 amphibians, 115 reptiles, 334 birds and 80 mammals), modeling their potential distribution using a maximum entropy algorithm, and 114,555 occurrence records, and 23 predictive environmental (19 climatic and four topographical) variables. The portion of the potential distribution for each species including only remnant natural habitat was designated as its predicted distribution. The area of the predicted distribution was used to compute the fraction of natural habitat remaining for each species overlapping within decreed protected areas at the state and national levels, that is, for Guerrero and all of Mexico. Results show significant differences in the fraction of species' predicted distribution and species' potential distribution at different scales (state and national) and differences between the vertebrate groups analyzed. Because quantitative conservation targets are typically set for individual species, this exercise enables an analysis of the impact of the habitat lost on each species' distribution by assessing the fraction of its predicted distribution that coincides with protected areas. We conclude that this must be part of systematic conservation planning to prioritize areas for potential conservation in Guerrero. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives
   Detailed and reliable information about the spatial distribution of species provides important information for species conservation management, especially in the case of rare species of conservation interest. We aimed to study the consequences of climate change on geographical distributions of the tertiary rare tree species Thuja sutchuenensis Franch. (Cupressaceae) to provide reference for conservation management of this species, including priority area selection for introduction and cultivation of the species. We expect that this approach could be promising in predicting the potential distribution of other rare tree species, and as such can be an effective tool in rare tree species restoration and conservation planning, especially species with narrow distribution or raw presence-only occurrence data.
   Methods
   107 records covering the whole distribution range of T. sutchuenensis in the Daba Mountains were obtained during a 3-year field survey. The principle of maximum entropy (Maxent) was used to model the species' potential distribution area under paleoclimate, current and future climate background.
   Results
   The Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 0.998, which is higher than 0.5 of a null model; The location of the potential distribution for the last interglacial period is in southeastern China, with the largest optimal habitat area being only 1666 km(2). In other periods, the central location of the potential distribution is accordant with the real present distribution, but the model's predicted optimal habitat area is outside the current distribution.
   Conclusions
   Our findings can be applied in various ways such as the identification of additional localities where T. sutchuenensis may already exist, but has not yet been detected; the recognition of localities where it is likely to spread to; the priority selection area for introduction and cultivation and the conservation management of such rare tree species.

AB  - Identifying conservation priorities for an understudied species can be challenging, as the amount and type of data available to work with are often limited. Here, we demonstrate a flexible workflow for identifying priorities for such data-limited species, focusing on the little-studied Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) in mainland Tropical Asia. Using recent occurrence records, we modeled the golden cat's expected area of occurrence and identified remaining habitat strongholds (i.e., large intact areas with moderate-to-high expected occurrence). We then classified these strongholds by recent camera-trap survey status (from a literature review) and nearfuture threat status (based on publicly available forest loss projections and Bayesian Belief Network derived estimates of hunting-induced extirpation risk) to identify conservation priorities. Finally, we projected the species' expected area of occurrence in the year 2000, approximately three generations prior to today, to define past declines and better evaluate the species' current conservation status. Lower levels of hunting-induced extirpation risk and higher levels of closedcanopy forest cover were the strongest predictors of recent camera-trap records. Our projections suggest a 68% decline in area with moderate-to-high expected occurrence between 2000 and 2020, with a further 18% decline predicted over the next 20 years. Past and near-future declines were primarily driven by cumulatively increasing levels of hunting-induced extirpation risk, suggesting assessments of conservation status based solely on declines in habitat may underes-timate actual population declines. Of the 40 remaining habitat strongholds, 77.5% were seriously threatened by forest loss and hunting. Only 52% of threatened strongholds had at least one site surveyed, compared to 100% of low-to-moderate threat strongholds, thus highlighting an important knowledge gap concerning the species' current distribution and population status. Our results suggest the golden cat has experienced, and will likely continue to experience, consider-able population declines and should be considered for up-listing to a threatened category (i.e., VU/EN) under criteria A2c of the IUCN Red List.

AB  - Premise of research.Rain forest ecosystems globally are synonymous with biodiversity, yet these vegetation communities vary widely in structure and composition. Historical biogeography and environment are thought to have significantly impacted Australian rain forest diversity and composition. Rain forest in Australia is extensively fragmented, and detailed vegetation mapping is used as a tool for conservation and land management planning. In Queensland, a regional ecosystem (RE) vegetation classification scheme is used by land managers. However, there has been no assessment to date of how evenly rain forest RE types are conserved at a regional scale, whether those conserved are the best representatives of biodiversity, and whether there are significantly distinctive RE types that are relatively poorly conserved or not recognized for their significance to biodiversity conservation.Methodology.Our phylogeny for South East Queensland (SEQ) rain forest species, which encompasses 95% of rain forest species based on a unified three-marker DNA barcode, along with species lists were used for assessment of both species richness and phylogenetic diversity of RE types. We mapped the distribution of the most diverse and the most distinctive rain forest ecosystem types.Pivotal results.We found that there is enormous variation in phylogenetic diversity within and among rain forest RE types in SEQ, with some depauperate in species richness. We identified the rain forest RE types in SEQ containing the highest diversity as well as those significantly sampling a wide part of the SEQ rain forest species pool compared with other RE types with similar species richness.Conclusions.This study confirms that different RE types are not equivalent and so should not be considered as such in any conservation planning processes. Conservation assessment of ecosystems needs to take into account distinctiveness and diversity among types in order to gain better representativeness and complementarity across all RE types.

AB  - Aim To define priority sets of ecoregions that should be sufficiently covered in a reserve system to represent all Neotropical carnivores (Mammalia: Carnivora) under three distinct conservation scenarios.
   Location The Neotropical region.
   Methods We used broad-scale biogeographical data of species distribution to define priority sets of ecoregions for conservation of carnivores and mapped four species traits (phylogenetic diversity, body size, rarity and extinction risk), which were used as constraints in prioritization analyses, based on the complementarity concept. We proposed three scenarios: a very vulnerable one, one of species persistence and another of lower human impact. We used the simulated annealing algorithm to generate ecoregion-irreplaceability pattern and to find the combinations of ecoregions in each conservation scenario.
   Results We found that only 8% of Neotropical ecoregions are needed to represent all 64 carnivore species at least once. Rain forest ecoregions harbour a greater amount of carnivore phylogenetic diversity, whereas the tropical Andes hold large-bodied carnivores. Western and southern Neotropical ecoregions have more rare species as well as higher threat levels. In the lower human-impact set, 12 ecoregions were needed to represent all species. These coincide only partially with those attained by other prioritization scenarios. In the very vulnerable and in the species persistence scenario, 14 and 12 ecoregions were represented, respectively, and the congruence between either one and the lower human-impact set was fairly low. Shared ecoregions are located in Mexico, Costa Rica, northern Amazon and western Chile.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight areas of particular interest for the conservation of Neotropical carnivores. The inclusion of evolutionary and ecological traits in conservation assessments and planning helps to improve reserve networks and therefore to increase the effectiveness of proposed priority sets. We suggest that conservation action in the highlighted areas is likely to yield the best return of investments at the ecoregion scale.

AB  - Mitigating the negative impacts of agriculture on amphibians requires knowledge of how different land uses affect species distribution and community composition. In the case of frogs, there is currently insufficient information on their use of terrestrial habitats in cropping landscapes to inform conservation planning. We examined how four different farmland types (linear plantings, cereal crops, grazing paddocks and woody mulch) and crop harvesting influenced amphibian abundance, richness, body condition and movement. We found the abundance of frogs was significantly higher in linear plantings compared to grazing paddocks and adjacent patches of remnant woodland vegetation. However, species richness and abundance of three individual species did not vary significantly between farmland types. For the most common frog Uperoleia laevigata, body condition was higher at the edges of the woody debris treatment (coupled with higher abundance) and lower in farmland with debris and linear plantings. The body condition of Limnodynastes tasmaniensis and L. interioris was not influenced by farmland type. Frog abundance and condition was largely unaffected by crop harvesting. However, frogs were less common after harvesting at the edges of farmland and within remnant patches. Movement patterns did not suggest mass movement out of crops after harvest, where almost half of all individuals recaptured remained within the farmland. These results suggest that some generalist frog species may have an affinity for habitats within agricultural paddocks, particularly when key habitat features like plantings are present. However, we found overall frog richness was low and did not differ between remnant patches, edges and farmland which may be an indication of habitat degradation within terrestrial habitats across the landscape. Although protection of remnant native vegetation is important, conservation strategies for the protection of amphibians will be ineffective if they do not consider the variety of land uses and the relationships of different species and their microhabitats within and outside of patches.

AB  - 1. Climate change represents a major challenge for conservation in the future and undermines protection within reserve boundaries. Freshwater biodiversity is still under-represented within reserves world-wide, and connectivity among reserves will become increasingly crucial if species are to persist under climate change.
   2. We tested the likely benefits of including predicted species distributions in systematic reserve design for rivers under climate change and the impact of varying connectivity requirements on future representation.
   3. We used the modelled distribution of 126 east Australian Odonata to identify reserve networks using data for current or future (2055 and 2085) distributions either by filling gaps additively, or as separate targets in a single solution. We then assessed the potential improvements to species representation in the future using different types of connectivity penalties that emphasized either longitudinal riverine connections or connections to all neighbouring subcatchments.
   4. Solutions that did not include future distributions in the planning stages were 16 to 30% less likely to protect the same species by 2055 and 2085, respectively. Inclusion of species' future distributions in the design phase leads to short-term increases in cost, but in the longer term fewer additional areas are required to meet targets and this strategy is likely to be significantly more efficient than implementing systematic design in stages. In addition, solely targeting riverine connectivity was significantly less likely to protect current species in the future than if cross-catchment connections were included.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Where protected areas can be expanded to assist species adaptation to climate change, significant gains in efficiency are possible if longer term goals are considered when selecting sites. Furthermore, to improve the representation of species under future climates, reserve selection should consider inter-catchment connectivity, although the nature of optimal solutions will depend heavily on the range of taxa included, their dispersal capacity, and the availability of climatic refugia.

AB  - Drylands range across more than half of the global terrestrial area and harbour about a quarter of continental vertebrate species, many of them endemic. However, this fauna is being increasingly threatened, in particular the one that inhabits deserts, one of the last biomes on earth. This work tracks the most relevant global change drivers acting on drylands, especially in deserts and arid regions, the conservation actions being developed, and the research needs for vertebrate conservation, following IUCN standardised classification schemes. Using the Sahara-Sahel wetlands as case study, it is provided a detailed examination of these aspects to support regional biodiversity conservation and human welfare. Deserts and arid regions are threatened by the synergistic effects of increasing development of urban areas, agriculture, energy production, mining, transportation and service corridors, resulting in pollution, invasive species, human intrusions and disturbance, biological resource overuse and in general, natural system modifications. In addition, climate change together with social underdevelopment of many desert-range countries places the mitigation of threat factors in a large and complex web of global-local societal challenges. Conservation actions targeting land/water and species protection and management, as well as education, awareness, capacity building, and legislation measures to increase livelihood development, are being developed. Additional research efforts are need to enhance biodiversity conservation planning, monitoring biodiversity and land-degradation status (based on Essential Biodiversity Variables), and quantification of socioeconomic factors associated with sustainable use of natural resources and human development. Sahara-Sahel wetlands are important life-support systems for both humans and vertebrates, the last vulnerable to listed global threats. They offer framework scenario to revert current environmental and societal challenges in deserts. Long-term conservation of desert vertebrate biodiversity requires appropriate policy instruments to promote sustainable use of natural resources. Raising environmental alertness within local communities of uniqueness of desert biodiversity is needed to promote policy change.

AB  - Across North America, grassland songbirds have undergone steep population declines over recent decades, commonly attributed to agricultural intensification. Understanding the potential interactions between the impacts of climate change on the future distributions of these species and the availability of suitable vegetation for nesting can support improved risk assessments and conservation planning for this group of species. We used North American bioclimatic niche models to examine future changes in suitable breeding climate for 15 grassland songbird species at their current northern range limits along the boreal forest-prairie ecotone in Alberta, Canada. Our climate suitability projections, combined with the current distribution of native and tame pasture and cropland in Alberta, suggest that some climate-mediated range expansion of grassland songbirds in Alberta is possible. For six of the eight species projected to experience expansions of suitable climate area in Alberta, this suitable climate partly overlaps the current distribution of suitable land cover. Additionally, for more than half of the species examined, most of the area of currently suitable climate was projected to remain suitable to the end of the century, highlighting the importance of Alberta for the long-term persistence of these species. Some northern prairie-endemic species exhibited substantial projected northward shifts of both the northern and southern edges of the area of suitable climate. Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), both at-risk grassland specialists, are predicted to have limited climate stability within their current ranges, and their expansion into new areas of suitable climate may be limited by the availability of suitable land cover. Our results highlight the importance of the preservation and restoration of remaining suitable grassland habitat within areas of projected climate stability and beyond current northern range limits for the long-term persistence of many grassland songbird species in the face of climate change.

AB  - Drastic shifts in species distributions are a cause of concern for ecologists. Such shifts pose great threat to biodiversity especially under unprecedented anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Many studies have documented recent shifts in species distributions. However, most of these studies are limited to regional scales, and do not consider the abundance structure within species ranges. Developing methods to detect systematic changes in species distributions over their full ranges is critical for understanding the impact of changing environments and for successful conservation planning. Here, we demonstrate a centroid model for range-wide analysis of distribution shifts using the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The centroid model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework which models population change within physiographic strata while accounting for several factors affecting species detectability. Yearly abundance-weighted range centroids are estimated. As case studies, we derive annual centroids for the Carolina wren and house finch in their ranges in the U.S. We further evaluate the first-difference correlation between species' centroid movement and changes in winter severity, total population abundance. We also examined associations of change in centroids from sub-ranges. Change in full-range centroid movements of Carolina wren significantly correlate with snow cover days (r = - 0.58). For both species, the full-range centroid shifts also have strong correlation with total abundance (r = 0.65, and 0.51 respectively). The movements of the full-range centroids of the two species are correlated strongly (up to r = 0.76) with that of the sub-ranges with more drastic population changes. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of centroids for analyzing distribution changes in a two-dimensional spatial context. Particularly it highlights applications that associate the centroid with factors such as environmental stressors, population characteristics, and progression of invasive species. Routine monitoring of changes in centroid will provide useful insights into long-term avian responses to environmental changes.

AB  - Understanding where species occur and how difficult they are to detect during surveys is crucial for designing and evaluating monitoring programs, and has broader applications for conservation planning and management. In this study, we modelled occupancy and the effectiveness of six sampling methods at detecting vertebrates across the Top End of northern Australia. We fitted occupancy-detection models to 136 species (83 birds, 33 reptiles, 20 mammals) of 242 recorded during surveys of 333 sites in eight conservation reserves between 2011 and 2016. For modelled species, mean occupancy was highly variable: birds and reptiles ranged from 0.01-0.81 and 0.01-0.49, respectively, whereas mammal occupancy was lower, ranging from 0.02-0.30. Of the 11 environmental covariates considered as potential predictors of occupancy, topographic ruggedness, elevation, maximum temperature, and fire frequency were retained more readily in the top models. Using these models, we predicted species occupancy across the Top End of northern Australia (293,017 km(2)) and generated species richness maps for each species group. For mammals and reptiles, high richness was associated with rugged terrain, while bird richness was highest in coastal lowland woodlands. On average, detectability of diurnal birds was higher per day of surveys (0.33 +/- 0.09) compared with nocturnal birds per night of spotlighting (0.13 +/- 0.06). Detectability of reptiles was similar per day/night of pit trapping (0.30 +/- 0.09) as per night of spotlighting (0.29 +/- 0.11). On average, mammals were highly detectable using motion-sensor cameras for a week (0.36 +/- 0.06), with exception of smaller-bodied species. One night of Elliott trapping (0.20 +/- 0.06) and spotlighting (0.19 +/- 0.06) was more effective at detecting mammals than cage (0.08 +/- 0.03) and pit trapping (0.05 +/- 0.04). Our estimates of species occupancy and detectability will help inform decisions about how best to redesign a long-running vertebrate monitoring program in the Top End of northern Australia.

AB  - The nearshore fish assemblage structures and their seasonal changes were compared between two habitats (estuarine and surf zones) in three climatic regions (Tropical, 7 degrees S; Transition, 23 degrees S; and Warm Temperate, 32 degrees S) encompassing similar to 3200 km in the Brazilian coast. Regional patterns of species richness and taxonomic distinctiveness of the fish community were also described. We expected the highest richness and lowest seasonal variation in the assemblages structure in the Tropical region and the opposite pattern in the Warm Temperate region. The assemblage structures differed significantly among regions and habitats. In the estuarine habitats, species richness and taxonomic distinctiveness (AvTD) were highest in the Tropical (84 species, AvTD = 92.3) and lowest in the Temperate (31 species, AvTD = 73.9) region. However, in the surf zone the highest species richness and taxonomic distinctiveness were found in the Transition region (49 species, AvTD = 78.5) and the lowest in the Warm Temperate region (19 species, AvTD = 51.9). The two habitats (estuarine and surf zone) differed consistently in the three regions. No seasonal change was found in the structure for the fish assemblage in the Tropical and Transition regions. However, the assemblage structure differed significantly between the spring and summer and between the spring and autumn in the Warm Temperate region. The most significant predictors of the fish community structure were salinity for the Tropical region, temperature and salinity for the Transition region, and transparency and temperature for the Warm Temperate region. The marine fish communities presented low levels of species redundancy in the Warm Temperate region with few species fulfilling key functional roles. The data provided here are references against which to detect future ecological changes at the regional-scale patterns for the Brazilian nearshore fish community and it is important to better inform fisheries management and coastal conservation planning.

AB  - Aim: Ecosystems face numerous well-documented threats from climate change. The well-being of people also is threatened by climate change, most prominently by reduced food security. Human adaptation to food scarcity, including shifting agricultural zones, will create new threats for natural ecosystems. We investigated how shifts in crop suitability because of climate change may overlap currently protected areas (PAs) and priority sites for PA expansion in South Africa. Predicting the locations of suitable climate conditions for crop growth will assist conservationists and decision-makers in planning for climate change.
   Location: South Africa.
   Methods: We modelled climatic suitability in 2055 for maize and wheat cultivation, two extensively planted, staple crops, and overlaid projected changes with PAs and PA expansion priorities.
   Results: Changes in winter climate could make an additional 2 million ha of land suitable for wheat cultivation, while changes in summer climate could expand maize suitability by up to 3.5 million ha. Conversely, 3 million ha of lands currently suitable for wheat production are predicted to become climatically unsuitable, along with 13 million ha for maize. At least 328 of 834 (39%) PAs are projected to be affected by altered wheat or maize suitability in their buffer zones.
   Main conclusions: Reduced crop suitability and food scarcity in subsistence areas may lead to the exploitation of PAs for food and fuel. However, if reduced crop suitability leads to agricultural abandonment, this may afford opportunities for ecological restoration. Expanded crop suitability in PA buffer zones could lead to additional isolation of PAs if portions of newly suitable land are converted to agriculture. These results suggest that altered crop suitability will be widespread throughout South Africa, including within and around lands identified as conservation priorities. Assessing how climate change will affect crop suitability near PAs is a first step towards proactively identifying potential conflicts between human adaptation and conservation planning.

AB  - Aim Snow leopards are distributed across the mountains of 12 countries spread across 1.8 million km(2) in Central and South Asia. Previous efforts to map snow leopard distributions have relied on expert opinions and modelling of presence-only data. Expert opinion is subjective and its reliability is difficult to assess, while analyses of presence-only data have tended to ignore the imperfect detectability of this elusive species. The study was conducted to prepare the first ever probabilistic distribution map of snow leopards across Mongolia addressing the challenge of imperfect detection. Location We conducted sign-based occupancy surveys across 1,017 grid-cells covering 406,800 km(2) of Mongolia's potential snow leopard range. Methods Using a candidate model set of 31 ecologically meaningful models that used six site and seven sampling covariates, we estimate the probability of sites being used by snow leopards across the entire country. Results Occupancy probability increased with greater terrain ruggedness, with lower values of vegetation indices, with less forest cover, and were highest at intermediate altitudes. Detection probability was higher for segments walked on foot, and for those in more rugged terrain. Our results showed broad agreement with maps developed using expert opinion and presence-only data but also highlighted important differences, for example in northern areas of Mongolia deemed largely unfavourable by previous expert opinion and presence-only analyses. Main conclusions This study reports the first national-level occupancy survey of snow leopards in Mongolia and highlights methodological opportunities that can be taken to scale and support national-level conservation planning. Our assessments indicated that <12% of its entire land mass, and 42% of the potential snow leopard habitat in Mongolia has a high (>0.5) probability of being used by snow leopards. We emphasize the utility of occupancy modelling, which jointly models detection and site use, in achieving these goals.

AB  - Question: How can nearest-neighbour (NN) imputation be used to develop maps of multiple species and plant communities?
   Location: Western and central Oregon, USA, but methods are applicable anywhere.
   Methods: We demonstrate NN imputation by mapping woody plant communities for > 100 000 km(2) of diverse forests and woodlands. Species abundances on similar to 25 000 plots were related to spatial predictors (rasters) describing climate, topography, soil and geographic location using constrained ordination (CCA). Species data from the nearest plot in multi-dimensional CCA space were imputed to each map pixel. Maps of multiple individual species and community types were constructed from the single imputed surface. We computed a variety of diagnostics to characterize different qualities of the imputed (mapped) community data.
   Results: Community composition gradients were strongly associated with climate and elevation, and less so with topography and soil. Accuracy of the imputation model for presence/absence of 150 species varied widely (kappa 0.00 to 0.80). Omission error rates were higher than commission rates due to low species prevalence, and areal representation of species was only slightly inflated. A map of 78 community types was 41% correct and 78% fuzzy correct. Errors of omission and commission were balanced, and areal representation of both rare and abundant communities was accurate. Map accuracy may be lower for some species than with other methods, but areal representation of species and communities across large landscapes is preserved. Because imputed vegetation surfaces are developed for all species simultaneously, map units contain suites of species known to co-occur in nature. Maps of individual species, and of community types derived from them, will be internally consistent at map locations.
   Conclusions: NN imputation is a useful modelling approach where maps of multiple species and plant communities are needed, such as in natural resource management and conservation planning or models that project landscape change under alternative disturbance or climate scenarios. More research is needed to evaluate other ordination methods for NN imputation of plant communities.

AB  - Defining population neighbourhood boundaries provides a critical spatial framework for understanding ecological processes and informing species-specific conservation and restoration planning. The population neighbourhood boundary demarcates the total quantity of available habitat across life stages where specific ecological processes (e.g., breeding, foraging, migration) occur for all individuals within a population. For mobile species within dendritic freshwater networks, the population neighbourhood boundary can be defined by the upper limit of occurrence (ULO) of an individual within a population. We sought to define contemporary neighbourhood boundaries across a complex river network in southwestern Washington State, U.S.A. by: (1) identifying ULOs for three anadromous fish (Oncorhynchus spp.); and (2) quantifying the relationship of the ULO with landscape attributes and local features for these species of profound social and ecological importance. Extensive field surveys covering 669 river km across 2 years documented the ULOs for coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) as well as any local features, such as natural barriers, that influenced the ULOs. Generalised linear mixed models quantified the relationships between the ULOs and landscape attributes derived from remote sensing data. We identified the ULO for 115 coho salmon terminal streams, 97 steelhead streams, and 57 chum salmon streams. Natural barriers determined the ULO in just 5%-16% of the terminal streams, depending on species. Landscape attributes associated with the ULOs varied among species; however, drainage area, elevation, and geology were important landscape predictors for all species. Models for each species had good to excellent predictive performance (percent correct classification: 78%-89%; AUC: 0.87-0.96). We demonstrated that large-scale landscape attributes can accurately and consistently detect species-specific differences in population neighbourhoods across broad and diverse habitats. In comparison, local scale features (e.g., natural barriers) played a minor role in determining the neighbourhood boundaries in our study catchment. The modelled relationships between landscape attributes and the population neighbourhood provide a framework to guide conservation planning and predict benefits of habitat reconnections.

AB  - La R union Island has the largest area of intact vegetation of the islands in the Mascarene archipelago. Biological invasions are the primary threat to biodiversity in the intact habitats of the island (those not already transformed by agriculture and urbanization). Our study aimed to identify areas to prioritize in managing invasive alien plants for biodiversity conservation. We used extensive surveys of 238 distinct untransformed areas on La Reunion to define the current distribution patterns of all invasive species. Using expert knowledge, we compiled maps of the current distribution of the 46 most widespread/important invasive plants at the habitat scale (identified according to vegetation structure). Data from 440 botanical releves for the 20 most threatening invasive alien plant species across the island and climatic envelope models were used to derive climatic suitability surfaces; these were used to map potential distributions for these species. More than 10 species invade 16.7% of the remaining habitat. Five habitat types are invaded by 25 or more species, and eight have fewer than 10 invasive alien plant species. Cluster analysis based on presence/absence of species in the 18 habitat types produced eight groups of species that invade particular habitats. Potential distribution models show that some species have invaded large parts of their potential range (e.g. Fuchsia magellanica, Furcraea foetida, Hiptage benghalensis), whereas others have the potential to increase their range substantially (e.g. Clidemia hirta, Strobilanthes hamiltonianus, Ulex europaeus). Management implications are identified for both groups. Three broad groups of habitats were identified: (i) intact habitats with a low level of invasion (e.g. subalpine shrubland); (ii) moderately invaded habitats with varying levels of intactness (ranging from windward submountain rainforest to the Acacia heterophylla forest); and (iii) habitats with little remaining intact area and high levels of invasion (e.g. lowland rainforest). Different management interventions are appropriate for these three groups.

AB  - Spatial and temporal distribution of seabird transiting and foraging at sea is an important consideration for marine conservation planning. Using at-sea observations of seabirds (n = 317), collected during the breeding season from 2012 to 2016, we built boosted regression tree (BRT) models to identify relationships between numerically dominant seabird species (red-footed booby, brown noddy, white tern, and wedge-tailed shearwater), geomorphology, oceanographic variability, and climate oscillation in the Chagos Archipelago. We documented positive relationships between red-footed booby and wedge-tailed shearwater abundance with the strength in the Indian Ocean Dipole, as represented by the Dipole Mode Index (6.7% and 23.7% contribution, respectively). The abundance of red-footed boobies, brown noddies, and white terns declined abruptly with greater distance to island (17.6%, 34.1%, and 41.1% contribution, respectively). We further quantified the effects of proximity to rat-free and rat-invaded islands on seabird distribution at sea and identified breaking point distribution thresholds. We detected areas of increased abundance at sea and habitat use-age under a scenario where rats are eradicated from invaded nearby islands and recolonized by seabirds. Following rat eradication, abundance at sea of red-footed booby, brown noddy, and white terns increased by 14%, 17%, and 3%, respectively, with no important increase detected for shearwaters. Our results have implication for seabird conservation and island restoration. Climate oscillations may cause shifts in seabird distribution, possibly through changes in regional productivity and prey distribution. Invasive species eradications and subsequent island recolonization can lead to greater access for seabirds to areas at sea, due to increased foraging or transiting through, potentially leading to distribution gains and increased competition. Our approach predicting distribution after successful eradications enables anticipatory threat mitigation in these areas, minimizing competition between colonies and thereby maximizing the risk of success and the conservation impact of eradication programs.

AB  - Developing conservation strategies for threatened species increasingly requires understanding vulnerabilities to climate change, in terms of both demographic sensitivities to climatic and other environmental factors, and exposure to variability in those factors over time and space. We conducted a range-wide, spatially explicit climate change vulnerability assessment for Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), a declining endemic species in a region showing strong environmental change. Using active season and winter adult survival estimates derived from 17 data sets throughout the species' range, we identified demographic sensitivities to winter drought, maximum precipitation during the summer, and the proportion of the surrounding landscape dominated by agricultural and urban land cover. Each of these factors was negatively associated with active season adult survival rates in binomial generalized linear models. We then used these relationships to back-cast adult survival with dynamic climate variables from 1950 to 2008 using spatially explicit demographic models. Demographic models for 189 population locations predicted known extant and extirpated populations well (AUC = 0.75), and models based on climate and land cover variables were superior to models incorporating either of those effects independently. These results suggest that increasing frequencies and severities of extreme events, including drought and flooding, have been important drivers of the long-term spatiotemporal variation in a demographic rate. We provide evidence that this variation reflects nonadaptive sensitivity to climatic stressors, which are contributing to long-term demographic decline and range contraction for a species of high-conservation concern. Range-wide demographic modeling facilitated an understanding of spatial shifts in climatic suitability and exposure, allowing the identification of important climate refugia for a dispersal-limited species. Climate change vulnerability assessment provides a framework for linking demographic and distributional dynamics to environmental change, and can thereby provide unique information for conservation planning and management.

AB  - Although ecological restoration has entered the global agenda to reverse different anthropogenic disturbances, we still know little about how this solution interacts with other conservation strategies, to avoid the progressive loss of species and ecosystem services. Here we evaluate one of the pioneering restoration programs in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where the combination of conservation and restoration efforts has been carried out for 20 years. Specifically, we tested how landscape characteristics, restoration strategies and environmental characteristics affect the results of the restoration of pastures. We established 65 circular plots (total 4.0 ha) along restoration areas (3-10 years) and sampled trees and shrubs composing the canopy (DBH >= 5 cm) and understorey (DBH < 5 cm, height > 1.3 m). We analysed the landscape metrics (proportion of old-growth forests in 200, 500 and 1,000 m buffers around each plot; and area and distance of the nearest-neighbouring old-growth forests). We explored the multiple effects of landscape, restoration strategy (reforestation, natural regeneration) and environmental variables (soil, pasture grass types) on the species composition and multiple diversity metrics of restoration areas. The species composition was very similar among restoration ages and restoration strategies. We found positive and strong effects of old-growth forest (200 m buffer) proportion on the species richness and Shannon diversity (canopy and understorey), above-ground biomass (canopy) and functional diversity (understorey) of restoration areas. The restoration strategies affected forest structure, and, in general, the reforestation strategy increased above-ground biomass, Shannon, functional and phylogenetic diversities (in canopy), and percentage of endemic species and biomass (understorey), when compared to natural regeneration. The 20-year experience in the southern Atlantic Forest showed that programs focused on landscape conservation associated with a mixture of restoration strategies (i.e. natural regeneration in larger areas and active restoration in more disturbed sites), can be an efficient strategy to ensure biodiversity and ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. Synthesis and applications. To manage degraded tropical lands and achieve global targets for biodiversity and ecosystem services, it is necessary to first ensure the conservation of natural remnants and then use multiple restoration strategies in less resilient areas.

AB  - Numerous anthropogenic activities take place within or nearby ports, thereby increasing environmental pressure in coastal zone that become the final destination of many environmental contaminants. Thus, port areas are crucial to understand the possible long-term effects of contaminants on metazoans that are at the base of the food webs. The port of Vado Ligure is the outlet to the sea of one of the largest industrial areas of the West Liguria (NW Mediterranean). Sediment quality was evaluated in twenty-eight stations at increasing distance from the port. The nematode fauna was characterised (i.e., assemblage composition, taxonomic diversity and functional traits) and organic matter quantity and composition and contaminant concentrations (heavy-metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy, long-chain hydrocarbons) were measured. The area resulted mainly polluted by mercury, followed by arsenic, zinc, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The faunal distribution (both from a taxonomical and functional point of view) appeared influenced by the contamination, as well as by sediment granulometry and organic matter content and composition. According to nematode assemblages and environmental variables, two groups of stations showed the most marked differences: one located in front of the Vado Ligure port, characterised by the most contaminated stations, the highest organic matter content, and fine sediments, and the other one, close to Bergeggi Marine Protected Area, characterised by more pristine stations, low organic matter content and coarser sediments. A suite of nematode genera that may be considered as bioindicators of pollution and organic enrichment was selected. Maturity index (MI) resulted negatively affected by contamination, suggesting that the different proportion of the nematode life-strategies is useful in assessing the environmental quality of sediments. The ecological quality status of the sampled stations obtained using abiotic and biotic descriptors (i.e., contamination level, organic matter content and nematode diversity and maturity index) was compared. Both the abiotic and nematode variables showed a general consistency for the stations of the two groups characterised by the highest and the lowest levels of contamination and organic enrichment.

AB  - Many protected areas are now faced with increasing pressure from visitors and tourism development. There is thus an urgent need for conservation biologists to evaluate the full impact of human disturbance not only on individual responses, but also on the viability of protected populations, so that relevant management measures can be proposed.
   We studied the impact of tourism on the rare and endangered chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax on a protected French island to assess the relationship between visitor pressure, bird individual behaviour and fitness, and population viability. During 8 years, we monitored foraging behaviour and estimated monthly juvenile survival using mark-recapture data. Population viability was examined under different tourism scenarios, using a stochastic individual-based model that incorporated the impact of visitor numbers on juvenile survival.
   In summer, the foraging probability of choughs was negatively correlated with the number of visitors. As a result, the time allocated to foraging during peak tourist season, adjusted to day length and prey availability, was 50% lower than expected.
   Juvenile survival rates were lowest in August, the peak tourist season, and varied significantly across years. August survival rate and therefore annual survival were negatively correlated with the number of visitors on the island in August and, except for a minor negative effect of rainfall, were not influenced by other environmental variables.
   Stochastic simulations predicted a low probability of extinction of the protected population if the number of visitors remains constant in the future. However, short-term viability would be dramatically reduced if the current rate of increase in visitor numbers is maintained.
   Synthesis and applications. We show that a relatively minor human-induced disturbance (e.g. scaring individuals away) has dramatic effects on population viability in a protected area, even when breeding individuals are not directly affected. This suggests that the full impact of tourism in protected areas may be overlooked, and has direct consequences for the assessment of sustainable levels of human disturbance and the design of quantitative management options compatible with tourist activities in protected areas. We specifically emphasize the need for more integrative approaches combining research at individual and population levels.

AB  - Aim How historical and contemporary eco-evolutionary processes shape the patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation across species' distribution range remains an open question with strong conservation implications. Focusing on the orange stony coral, Astroides calycularis, we (a) characterized the pattern of neutral genetic diversity across the distribution range; (b) gave insights into the underlying processes; and (c) discussed conservation implications with emphasis on a national park located on a hotspot of genetic diversity. Location South Mediterranean Sea and Zembra National Park. Methods We combined new data from 12 microsatellites in 13 populations located in the Centre and in the Western Periphery of the distribution range with a published dataset including 16 populations from the Western and Eastern Peripheries. We analysed the relationship among parameters of genetic diversity (H (e), Ar ((g))) and structure (population-specific F (ST)) and two measures of geographic peripherality. We compared two estimators of pairwise genetic structure (G (ST), D (EST)) across the distribution range. The evolutionary and demographic history of the populations following the Last Glacial Maximum was reconstructed using approximate Bayesian computations and maximum-likelihood analyses. We inferred the contemporary connectivity among populations from Zembra National Park and with the neighbouring area of Cap Bon. Results We demonstrate a decrease in genetic diversity and an increase in genetic differentiation from the Centre to the Eastern and Western Peripheries of the distribution range. Populations from Zembra show the highest genetic diversity reported in the species. We identified a spillover effect towards Cap Bon. Main conclusions The patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation are most likely explained by "the postglacial range expansion hypothesis" rather than the "central-peripheral hypothesis." Enforcement of conservation measures should be considered to protect this genetic diversity pattern, in particular when considering the low effective population size inferred at many sites.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are a key element of global conservation strategies aiming to protect habitats and species from various threats such as non-natives species (NNS) with negative ecological impacts. Yet little is known about the mechanisms by which PAs are colonized by NNS, and more specifically the role of colonizing events from surrounding areas. Here, we compared terrestrial and freshwater non-native plants and animals recorded in Norwegian PAs and in 5-km belts around them, using the database of the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre Species Map Service. Our analysis included 1,602 NNS and 671 PAs. We found that NNS were recorded in only 23% of the PAs, despite the fact that 90% of the 5-km belts were colonized by at least one NNS. A Zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showed that the number of NNS in the 5-km belts was a strong explanatory variable of the NNS richness inside PAs. Other significant variables included the surface area of the PA, mean human population density in the PA, main type of habitat and accessibility of PAs. We also observed similarity in the species in and around the PAs, with, on average, two thirds of the NNS present in a specific PA also present in its 5-km belt. Furthermore, NNS were recorded in PAs on average 4.5 years after being recorded in the 0-5 km belts, suggesting a dynamic of rapid colonization from the belts to the PAs. Invasive NNS represented 12% of NNS in the belts but 40% in the PAs. This difference was related to the higher abundance of invasive NNS in the belts. Our results highlight the necessity of expanding the focus of NNS management in PAs beyond their boundaries, in particular to prevent incursions of NNS with high negative ecological impact.

AB  - Estimating and planning for the impacts of climate change on the biodiversity of protected areas is a major challenge for conservation managers. When these areas are topographically heterogenous and contain species' entire ranges, this challenge is exacerbated because the coarse spatial scales of Global Circulation Model projections provide limited information for within-park management. South Africa's Table Mountain National Park, home to three endemic amphibian species in just similar to 24,500 hectares, provides a case study for identifying conservation needs under climate change. Selecting the park's herpetofauna as pilot taxa, we identified life history and demographic characteristics believed to make species more sensitive and less able to adapt to climate change. We organized these into assessment frameworks and, through a combination of literature review and expert elicitation, reviewed and used them to assess climate change vulnerability of 18 amphibian and 41 reptile species. The assessment highlighted that 73% and 67% of the park's reptile and amphibian species, respectively, had at least one high-sensitivity and low-adaptive capacity trait. Using ordinal and additive scoring methods, we identified the species most vulnerable to climate change and highlight the park areas containing their highest concentrations. These areas will be used to inform landscape-scale management priorities and park use zones. The current IUCN Red List assessments for these species do not incorporate climate change vulnerability. Considering some species appear to be threatened by climate change, their conservation needs might be underestimated. Identifying the most vulnerable species and the mechanisms underpinning their vulnerability can guide the identification and prioritization of conservation needs, while the highlighted knowledge gaps inform priorities for monitoring and research. While comprehensive climate change adaptation planning for Table Mountain National Park requires additional assessment of other taxonomic groups, this trait-based assessment example highlights a viable tool for assessing climate change vulnerability in protected areas.

AB  - Marine conservation areas are an important tool for the sustainable management of multispecies, small-scale fisheries. Effective spatial management requires a proper understanding of the spatial distribution of target species and the identification of its environmental drivers. Small-scale fisheries, however, often face scarcity and low-quality of data. In these situations, approaches for the prioritization of conservation areas need to deal with scattered, biased, and short-term information and ideally should quantify data-and model-specific uncertainties for a better understanding of the risks related to management interventions. We used a Bayesian hierarchical species distribution modeling approach on annual landing data of the heavily exploited, small-scale, and data-poor fishery of Chwaka Bay (Zanzibar) in the Western Indian Ocean to understand the distribution of the key target species and identify potential areas for conservation. Few commonalities were found in the set of important habitat and environmental drivers among species, but temperature, depth, and seagrass cover affected the spatial distribution of three of the six analyzed species. A comparison of our results with information from ecological studies suggests that our approach predicts the distribution of the analyzed species reasonably well. Furthermore, the two main common areas of high relative abundance identified in our study have been previously suggested by the local fisher as important areas for spatial conservation. By using short-term, catch per unit of effort data in a Bayesian hierarchical framework, we quantify the associated uncertainties while accounting for spatial dependencies. More importantly, the use of accessible and interpretable tools, such as the here created spatial maps, can frame a better understanding of spatio-temporal management for local fishers. Our approach, thus, supports the operability of spatial management in small-scale fisheries suffering from a general lack of long-term fisheries information and fisheries independent data.

AB  - Mountain ecosystems are particularly sensitive to changes in climate and land cover, but at the same time, they can offer important refuges for species on the opposite of the more altered lowlands. To explore the potential role of mountain ecosystems in butterfly conservation and to mess the vulnerability of the alpine species, we analyzed the short-term changes (2006-2008 vs. 2012-2013) of butterflies' distribution along altitudinal gradients in the NW Italian Alps. We sampled butterfly communities once a month (62 sampling stations, 3 seasonal replicates per year, from June to August) by semi-quantitative sampling techniques. The monitored gradient ranges from the montane to the alpine belt (600-2700 m a.s.I.) within three protected areas: Gran Paradiso National Park (LTER, Sitecode: LTER_EU_IT_109), Orsiera Rocciavre Natural Park and Veglia Devero Natural Park. We investigated butterflies' temporal changes in accordance with a hierarchical approach to assess potential relationships between species and community level. As a first step, we characterized each species in terms of habitat requirements, elevational range and temperature preferences and we compared plot occupancy and altitudinal range changes between time periods (2006-2008 vs. 2012-2013). Secondly, we focused on community level, analyzing species richness and community composition temporal changes. The species level analysis highlighted a general increase in mean occupancy level and significant changes at both altitudinal boundaries. Looking at the ecological groups, we observed an increase of generalist and highly mobile species at the expense of the specialist and less mobile ones. For the community level, we noticed a significant increase in species richness, in the community temperature index and a tendency towards homogenization within communities. Besides the short time period considered, butterflies species distribution and communities changed considerably. In light of these results, it is fundamental to continue monitoring activities to understand if we are facing transient changes or first signals of an imminent trend.

AB  - Human activities have modified landscapes worldwide, promoting fragmentation and isolation of forest habitats. Such landscape modifications are responsible for changes in species composition due to extinction and colonization events. Forest species dynamism is usually affected by forest fragmentation when remaining fragments are small and isolated, but forest dynamism is usually more stable when forest fragments are large and connected. In this study we verified changes in bird composition during 23 years of bird monitoring at the Mata dos Godoy State Park (PEMG). We aimed to evaluate the avian community dynamism of this reserve, as well as its effectiveness in protecting biodiversity in an extremely fragmented landscape. We reviewed historical records of bird species composition and checked for any possible misidentifications, updated the list and created an annual data set of bird species occurrence. We used this list to evaluate species persistence, species loss, and colonization over the study period. Additionally, species were classified according to their guilds in order to determine which species traits were associated with local extinction. A total of 331 bird species were recorded in PEMG over 23 years of monitoring, 17 of which were considered locally extinct or possibly extinct, and 11 were recent local colonizations. This indicates that bird composition in PEMG has been relatively stable over the years. However, local extinction was more likely for large frugivores and insectivores, which are guilds already known to be more susceptible to local extinction. Colonizations, in turn, were associated with guilds of more open habitats, like edge insectivores. We suggest that extinctions and colonizations are also potentially related to species distribution ranges and climate change. Although local extinctions occurred, PEMG still maintains a significant fraction of its historical avifauna and may potentially maintain source populations for many bird species, thus making it an important reserve for the north of Parana.

AB  - Protected Areas in Borneo retain some of the best examples of biodiversity and are the last refuge for wildlife conservation in tropical rainforests. Therefore, understanding the species richness and composition in increasingly fragmented Protected Areas are crucial in wildlife monitoring and management. The recent road construction splitting the oldest wildlife sanctuary in Sarawak has warranted further investigation on the species distribution. Camera trap survey in Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), western Borneo resulted in 20 medium- to large-bodied mammals from 775 independent photos with 2001 camera trap nights from surveys done in 2013-2014 and 2019. SWS records the Endangered Nasalis larvatus and Cynogale bennettii in the current survey. Under the Sarawak Wild Life Protection Ordinance 1998, Nasalis larvatus was the only recorded species considered to be Totally Protected while 12 other species are listed as Protected and the remaining species were not listed. The most frequently recorded species were Tragulus spp. (n = 147 in 2013-2014 and n = 166 in 2019) followed by Macaca fascicularis in 2013-2014 with n = 109, and Sus barbatus (n = 93 in 2019). A similar species richness (n = 13) was recorded both near (< 1000 m) and further away from the road (> 1000 m). However, the mean species richness was higher further away from the road (> 1000 m). Herpestes brachyurus, Hemigalus derbyanus, and Echinosorex gymnura were only recorded near the road while Cynogale bennettii, Hystrix brachyura and Nasalis larvatus were only recorded further away from the road. Through the bipartite network analysis, the majority of the medium- to large-bodied mammals are distributed in the mixed dipterocarp forests. Species that have habitats within proximity to the road have a higher risk of mortality due to roadkill and other anthropogenic pressure. Encroachment is an issue in Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary and calls for immediate action; stricter enforcement, regular wide-coverage patrols along the river, and on the road to prevent illegal logging, commercial planting, and hunting.

AB  - Aim To quantify the consequences of major threats to biodiversity, such as climate and land-use change, it is important to use explicit measures of species persistence, such as extinction risk. The extinction risk of metapopulations can be approximated through simple models, providing a regional snapshot of the extinction probability of a species. We evaluated the extinction risk of three species under different climate change scenarios in three different regions of the Mexican cloud forest, a highly fragmented habitat that is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Location Cloud forests in Mexico. Methods Using Maxent, we estimated the potential distribution of cloud forest for three different time horizons (2030, 2050 and 2080) and their overlap with protected areas. Then, we calculated the extinction risk of three contrasting vertebrate species for two scenarios: (1) climate change only (all suitable areas of cloud forest through time) and (2) climate and land-use change (only suitable areas within a currently protected area), using an explicit patch-occupancy approximation model and calculating the joint probability of all populations becoming extinct when the number of remaining patches was less than five. Results Our results show that the extent of environmentally suitable areas for cloud forest in Mexico will sharply decline in the next 70years. We discovered that if all habitat outside protected areas is transformed, then only species with small area requirements are likely to persist. With habitat loss through climate change only, high dispersal rates are sufficient for persistence, but this requires protection of all remaining cloud forest areas. Main conclusions Even if high dispersal rates mitigate the extinction risk of species due to climate change, the synergistic impacts of changing climate and land use further threaten the persistence of species with higher area requirements. Our approach for assessing the impacts of threats on biodiversity is particularly useful when there is little time or data for detailed population viability analyses.

AB  - The presence of exotic predators in ecosystems across the world is a leading driver of native species' declines. Exotic predators largely influence native species through predation and harassment, which may cause native species to avoid them spatially. We used a camera trap dataset from seven sites in Madagascar's largest protected area complex to investigate spatial co-occurrence patterns between three exotic predators (free-ranging domestic dogs Canis familiaris and cats Felis silvestris, and small Indian civet Viverricula indica) and native ground-dwelling forest birds (n = 5) and small mammals (n = 4). We created 216 two-species occupancy models for 27 exotic predator-native species pairings to examine how habitat, exotic predator presence or both, influenced each native species' occupancy and/or detection. We found that native bird and small mammal occupancy and/or detection were strongly related to an exotic predator's presence 52% of the time (i.e. 14 of 27 exotic predator-native species pairings). Six of the 14 species pairings (i.e. 43%) had non-independent co-occurrence patterns, four of which were habitat-mediated. The effect of exotic predator presence on native species' detection was largely negative, depressing native species' detection in seven out of 12 instances (i.e. 58% of the time). The small Indian civet and free-ranging cats each strongly influenced the occupancy and/or detection of six species for a combined impact on seven native species, while domestic dogs strongly influenced two species. By including habitat covariates in two-species occupancy models, we gained deeper insight into the effect exotic predator presence has on native species' distribution. We also note that the strong effect of exotic predator presence on our ability to detect native species can hinder the ability of researchers to provide accurate parameter estimates. We recommend future research into the synergistic effects that habitat degradation and exotic species presence has on native species.

AB  - Primates are among the globally imperiled fauna requiring urgent conservation interventions to protect their habitat. Information on species distribution and factors influencing it are vital to species management and habitat protection. In this study, we assessed habitat occupancy of the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), bonnet macaque (M. radiata), and black-footed gray langur (Semnopithecus hypoleucos) that occur in the Kudremukh Wildlife Division, a large protected area network in the central Western Ghats. We examined the influence of habitat variables on the occupancy probability of these primates. We carried out four temporally replicated detection/non-detection surveys to assess detection probability and site occupancy of the primate species. We surveyed 244 sites of 5 Km(2), with each site surveyed for 4 days, to assess detection probability and site occupancy. Among the three species, the langur had the highest habitat occupancy estimate (0.66 +/- 0.05(SE)) and the lion-tailed macaque had the lowest estimate (0.28 +/- 0.08(SE)). The habitat occupancy estimate for the bonnet macaque was (0.56 +/- 0.05(SE))(.) Wet and semi-evergreen forest cover and mean elevation positively influenced the lion-tailed macaque's occurrence. Covariates influencing bonnet macaque's occurrence were plantations, semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests, and non-forest areas. Mean elevation negatively affected its occurrence. Wet evergreen forests and plantations positively influenced the occurrence of the langur. We examined spatial segregation between the species based on their site occupancy. Pairwise comparisons revealed a significant negative association between the bonnet macaque and the other two primates. However, we found a significant positive association between the lion-tailed macaque and the langur. We discuss these results and their implications for conservation of primates in the region. Given the cost-effectiveness of carrying out surveys at large spatial scales, we recommend occupancy surveys for future surveys of forest primates.

AB  - Context. Mapping the habitat and distribution of a species is critical for developing effective conservation plans. Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, Phascolarctidae) distribution is constrained by the nutritional and shelter requirements provided by a relatively small number of key tree species in any given area. Identifying these key species provides a practical foundation for mapping koala habitat and prioritising areas for conservation.
   Aims. To determine key tree species for koalas in Noosa Shire (south-eastern Queensland, Australia) as a basis for mapping koala habitat quality.
   Methods. We applied a faecal-pellet survey methodology in 1996/97 to assess evidence of use by koalas of 4031 trees from 96 randomly stratified survey sites across different eucalypt-forest and woodland communities. Results were compared with those from a later survey undertaken in 2001/02 involving 5535 trees from 195 sites that were distributed across broadly similar areas with the aim to investigate aspects of koala landscape ecology.
   Key results. A total of 66.7% of the 1996/97 survey sites contained koala faecal pellets, recorded under 953 eucalypt trees (14 species) and 1670 non-eucalypt trees (27 species). The proportion of trees at a given survey site that had koala faecal pellets at the base ranged from 2.2% to 94.7% (mean = 31.13 +/- 2.59% s.e.). For the 2001/02 dataset, koala pellets were found at 55.4% of sites, from 794 eucalypt and 2240 non-eucalypt trees. The proportion of trees with pellets ranged from 3% to 80% (mean = 21.07 +/- 1.77% s.e.). Both the 1996/97 and 2001/02 surveys identified the same three tree species (forest red gum, Eucalyptus tereticornis, swamp mahogany, E. robusta, and tallowwood, E. microcorys) as the highest-ranked for koala use in the study area. Three additional species (red mahogany, E. resinifera, small-fruited grey gum, E. propinqua, and grey ironbark, E. siderophloia) were identified in the 1996/97 surveys as key eucalypt species. Of the non-eucalypts in the 1996/97 dataset, coast cypress pine (Callitris columellaris) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia) ranked highest for use by koalas, followed by pink bloodwood (Corymbia intermedia) and brush box (Lophostemon confertus). White bottlebrush (Callistemon salignus), hard corkwood (Endiandra sieberi), M. quinquenervia and C. intermedia ranked highest in the 2001/02 dataset. The findings showed significantly greater use of larger eucalypts (i.e. 300-mm to >600-mm diameter at breast height).
   Conclusions. The identified key eucalypt species, being the critical limiting resource for koalas, were used to assign koala habitat-quality classes to mapped regional ecosystem types to create a Koala Habitat Atlas (KHA) for Noosa Shire. The combined two highest quality classes based on abundance of the key eucalypt species comprised only 15.7% of the total land area of the Shire.
   Implications. The KHA approach provides a practical and repeatable method for developing koala habitat-suitability mapping for national-, regional- and local-scale conservation and recovery planning purposes.

AB  - The description and classification of wetland vegetation is important for water resource management and biodiversity conservation as it provides an understanding of the wetland vegetation-environment relationships and information to interpret spatial variation in plant communities. This study discusses the vegetation of the palustrine wetlands of Lesotho based on a phytosociological approach. Data on vegetation and various environmental variables were collected using the Braun-Blanquet method and a standardised protocol developed for environmental information of wetlands in South Africa. The data were analysed mainly by clustering and ordination techniques. Twenty-two communities were found by the classification of the wetland vegetation. These communities were found to be diverse in terms of species richness. The ordination revealed that the wetland vegetation is mainly influenced by altitude, longitude, slope, soil parent material, landscape, inundation, potassium content, soil texture, total organic carbon, nitrogen, electrical conductivity and latitude. Regarding species composition and diversity, plant communities in the Highlands were more diverse and were distinctively different from those in the Lowlands. High-altitude communities were also found to be dominated mainly by C-3 plants, while those at low altitudes exhibited the dominance of C-4 species. Some communities were either restricted to the Highlands or Lowlands but others exhibited a wide ecological amplitude and occurred over an extensive altitudinal range. The diversity of most of the wetlands, coupled with their restricted habitat, distribution at high altitudes and their role in supplying ecosystem services that include water resources, highlights the high conservation value associated with these wetlands, particularly in the face of climate change and loss of biodiversity.
   Conservation implications: The study can be invaluable to wetland scientists, managers, biodiversity conservationists, water resource managers and planners and vegetation ecologists in Southern Africa. About 70% of Lesotho falls in the Maloti-Drakensberg, accounting for about 60% of the region, and this makes the study important in biodiversity conservation planning, particularly in the Highlands. The wetlands in Lesotho face severe anthropogenic pressures that include overgrazing and economic development. Given that the Lesotho Highlands as a water catchment is not only important for Lesotho, but also for South Africa and Namibia, the conservation of the associated wetlands and this critical water resource is indispensable.

AB  - This study aims to assess the macroinvertebrate communities, diversity and ecological quality (expressed as BMWP-Viet) of rivers on a tropical island. Environmental factors associated with macroinvertebrate communities, diversity and ecological quality were identified to assist conservation planning and management. Biological (macroinvertebrates), chemical, physical and hydromorphological characteristics of 85 river reaches were assessed in Leyte island, Philippines. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and multivariable linear regression (LRM) were performed to relate environmental variables and macroinvertebrates. Several taxa of snails, shrimps, dragonflies, beetles, bugs and caddisflies were found on the island. Although many sites had good to very good ecological quality and high diversity, about 41% had moderate to very bad ecological quality and low diversity. Based on CCA, we can conclude that macroinvertebrate communities were associated with velocity, sediment, conductivity and dissolved oxygen. Particularly, sensitive and tolerant taxa were encountered at high and low flow velocities, respectively. LRM indicated that macroinvertebrate diversity and ecological quality were associated with physical (turbidity), chemical (chlorophyll), hydromorphological characteristics (bank slope & pool/riffle class), habitat degradation (gravel/sand quarrying, erosion) and the presence of logs and twigs. Consequently, this study gives support to the use of invertebrates as indicators of certain environmental conditions and the results of this investigation can serve as a basis to set up dedicated experiments to further prove the causality of these discovered relations. Strikingly, organic pollution, as reflected by biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand, was in general weakly related to invertebrate composition, diversity and ecological quality. This might be linked to the low input in most sites and the relatively short rivers which are closely connected to the marine system. Thus, typical midstream and downstream systems were not encountered and the accumulation of these pollutants along the river is less likely. Although the island is situated in the western Pacific Ocean and encounters intensive natural disturbances (severe typhoons), the taxa (families) are similar to other tropical systems and the effects of the environmental conditions are comparable. Findings of this study are valuable in understanding tropical island systems and provide insights into the effects of environmental conditions on stream invertebrates, which aids in protecting and conserving tropical insular systems.

AB  - Aim We addressed four objectives: (1) Determine the regional responses of species, size classes and a vegetation type to climate and parent material predictors, including their distributions in environmental space and the relative contributions of the predictors to explained variation. (2) Determine whether size classes of a species respond similarly to climate and parent material. (3) Assess the extent to which the predicted regional distribution of a vegetation type can be approximated by the distribution of its diagnostic species and vice versa. The establishment of a consistent relationship between the distribution of a vegetation type and its diagnostic species would facilitate change detection, management and conservation planning by allowing the use of one distribution to generate the other when data availability is limited. (4) Examine landscape-scale environmental variability in predicted species and vegetation type distributions.
   Location South-western USA (Arizona, New Mexico and southern Colorado).
   Methods Ecological response surface models were developed using a data base of 1409 vegetation plots to analyse biotic-environmental relationships of (1) Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson and Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. Ex Hildebr. size classes, (2) P. ponderosa, A. concolor and Quercus gambelii Nutt. combined size classes, and (3) a P. ponderosa forest type widely distributed in the south-western USA.
   Results and main conclusions Pinus ponderosa and A. concolor models generally were judged to be successful. Quercus gambelii models were judged unsuccessful, which may result from the influence of variables not modelled, such as soil moisture, disturbance, biotic factors and other site limiting factors. Size classes differed in the range of environmental conditions associated with high occurrence probabilities within and between species, reflecting differences in the effects of climate variability and anthropogenic changes, such as fire suppression, on the distribution of each size class. Pinus ponderosa alliance was predicted to be distributed over a narrower range of environmental conditions than P. ponderosa species models, therefore limiting the use of this vegetation type as a surrogate for the distribution of the dominant species, and vice versa. Maps of combinations of environmental variables that produced a high probability of P. ponderosa occurrence showed that some landscapes predicted to contain the species exhibited diverse environmental conditions over short distances. The use of regional environmental relationships to characterize areas with high local environmental variability may facilitate identification of areas of potential rapid biotic change.

AB  - Earth-observing satellites are a major research tool for spatially explicit ecosystem nowcasting and forecasting. However, there are practical challenges when integrating satellite data into usable real-time products for stakeholders. The need of forecast immediacy and accuracy means that forecast systems must account for missing data and data latency while delivering a timely, accurate, and actionable product to stakeholders. This is especially true for species that have legal protection. Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus (Atlantic sturgeon) were listed under the United States Endangered Species Act in 2012, which triggered immediate management action to foster population recovery and increase conservation measures. Building upon an existing research occurrence model, we developed an Atlantic sturgeon forecast system in the Delaware Bay, USA. To overcome missing satellite data due to clouds and produce a 3-d forecast of ocean conditions, we implemented data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) on daily observed satellite data. We applied the Atlantic sturgeon research model to the DINEOF output and found that it correctly predicted Atlantic sturgeon telemetry occurrences over 90% of the time within a 3-d forecast. A similar framework has been utilized to forecast harmful algal blooms, but to our knowledge, this is the first time a species distribution model has been applied to DINEOF gap-filled data to produce a forecast product for fishes. To implement this product into an applied management setting, we worked with state and federal organizations to develop real-time and forecasted risk maps in the Delaware River Estuary for both state-level managers and commercial fishers. An automated system creates and distributes these risk maps to subscribers' mobile devices, highlighting areas that should be avoided to reduce interactions. Additionally, an interactive web interface allows users to plot historic, current, future, and climatological risk maps as well as the underlying model output of Atlantic sturgeon occurrence. The mobile system and web tool provide both stakeholders and managers real-time access to estimated occurrences of Atlantic sturgeon, enabling conservation planning and informing fisher behavior to reduce interactions with this endangered species while minimizing impacts to fisheries and other projects.

AB  - 1. Management decisions are increasingly based on matrix models intended to predict the long-term fate of endangered species. However, certain elements of these models, such as life-state transition probabilities (vital rates), are difficult to parameterize and their values may vary depending on external conditions such as weather. Details of how weather might influence population performance are rare, yet necessary to assess the effects of global climate change on a species' distribution.
   2. Based on a 26-year data set of a population of Himantoglossum hircinum in a nature reserve in Germany, variations of life-history traits and vital rates were studied. Matrix analysis was used to identify the most important life-state transitions for population growth. Multiple linear regression was used to quantify the response of population traits and vital rates to changing weather conditions.
   3. Population size increased exponentially and density effects could not be observed. Flowering plants and large plants had the highest and second highest reproductive value, respectively. The population's finite rate of increase fluctuated strongly among years; life-history traits varied strongly and were interlinked, thereby violating the assumptions of matrix modelling in a population viability analysis.
   4. Some vital rates and the population growth rate showed a trend over the total period. A certain and sometimes large amount of that variability could be attributed to variability of weather conditions, with warmer winter conditions favouring population performance. Prediction of population size was fairly accurate within a time frame of 10 years, but size class structure was not.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Matrix modelling proved to be unreliable for predicting long-term population dynamics, despite the long-term data set used for matrix construction. This can be explained by weather-dependent variability of vital rates driving population dynamics. A minimum study period of 4 years is necessary to produce relevant information for model development. Our study emphasizes the need for critical evaluation of management decisions based only on single short-term studies and for studies covering longer time intervals than 2-3 years.

AB  - We studied the non-marine reptile and amphibian species of the volcanic Comoro archipelago in the Western Indian Ocean, a poorly known island herpetofauna comprising numerous microendemic species of potentially high extinction risk and widespread, non-endemic and often invasive taxa. According to our data, the Comoro islands are inhabited by two amphibian species and at least 28 species of reptiles although ongoing genetic studies and unconfirmed historical records suggest an even higher species diversity. 14 of the 28 currently recognized species of terrestrial reptiles (50%) and the two amphibians are endemic to a single island or to the Comoro archipelago. The majority of species are most abundant at low elevation. However, a few endemic species, like the gekkonid lizards Paroedura sanctijohannis and Phelsuma nigristriata, are more common in or even confined to higher altitudes. We created habitat maps from remotely sensed data in combination with detailed species distribution maps produced using comprehensive data from field surveys between 2000 and 2010, literature, and historical locality records based on specimens in zoological collections. Using these data, we assessed the conservation status of the endemic terrestrial reptiles and amphibians according to the IUCN Red List criteria. Our results show that although little area of natural forest remains on the Comoros, many species are abundant in degraded forest or plantations. Competition and predation by invasive species appears to be the most important threat factor for the endemic herpetofauna, together with habitat degradation and destruction, which further favours invasive species. We propose the status Endangered for three species, Vulnerable for one species, Near Threatened for six species, Least Concern for four and Data Deficient for two species. The endemic subspecies Oplurus cuvieri comorensis is proposed for the status Critically Endangered. Based on the results of this study, seven areas of importance for reptile and amphibian conservation on the Comoros are identified. This study shows how remote sensing data can contribute to increasing accuracy and objectiveness of conservation assessments.

AB  - Species occur in sympatric assemblages, bound together by ecological relationships and interspecific interactions. Borneo and Sumatra host some of the richest assemblages of biota worldwide. The region, however, faces the highest global deforestation rates, which seriously threaten its unique biodiversity. We used a large camera trap dataset that recorded data for 70 terrestrial species of mammals and birds, to explore the drivers of regional species richness patterns. Using a multi-scale, multivariate modelling framework which quantified the main environmental factors associated with patterns of biodiversity, while simultaneously assessing individual relationships of each species, we determined the ecological drivers of sampled biodiversity, and their contributions to community assemblages. We then mapped predicted species richness, evaluated the effectiveness of protected areas in securing biodiversity hotspots, performed gap analysis to highlight biodiverse areas lacking protection and compared our predictions with species richness maps produced by using IUCN range layers. Finally, we investigated the performance of each species as an indicator of sampled biodiversity. We demonstrate that biodiversity in Borneo and Sumatra is primarily affected by gradients of ecological and anthropogenic factors, and only marginally by topographic and spatial factors. In both islands, species are primarily associated with elevational gradients in vegetation and climate, leading to altitudinal zonation in niche separation as a major factor characterizing the islands' biodiversity. Species richness was highest in north-eastern Borneo and in western Sumatra. We found that most predicted biodiversity hotspots are not formally protected in either island; only 9.2 and 18.2% of the modelled species richness occurred within protected areas in Borneo and Sumatra, respectively. We highlighted that our prediction for Borneo performed better than, and differed drastically from, the IUCN species richness layer, while for Sumatra our modelled species richness layer and the IUCN one were similar, and both showed low predictive power. Our analysis suggests that common and generalist carnivores are the most effective indicators of sampled biodiversity and have high potential as focal, umbrella or indicator species to assist multi-species vertebrate conservation planning. Understanding existing drivers and patterns of biodiversity is critical to support the development of effective community conservation strategies in this rapidly changing region.

AB  - Aim In recent years, novel approaches have been proposed to improve current bioregionalization methods, but these have not been thoroughly compared. We assessed the applicability of the recently developed network-based clustering method (Infomap algorithm) in bioregionalization analysis at regional spatial scales and compared the results with commonly used distance-based methods (hierarchical clustering algorithm). We also identified climate regions by using a model-based cluster analysis (Gaussian algorithm). Finally, we quantified the representation of climate regions and bioregions in current protected areas (PAs). Location Iran. Taxa Terrestrial mammals. Methods To define bioregions we used the Infomap algorithm and distance-based clustering methods based on species distribution data (over 14,000 occurrence records for 188 species). The Infomap algorithm was applied using the interactive web application "INFOMAP BIOREGIONS" and the distance-based clustering was based on unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA). To identify climate regions we used principal components analysis and a model-based cluster analysis both based on 15 climatic variables as well as a terrain ruggedness index. Results The Infomap algorithm detected nine biogeographical units: seven bioregions and two transition zones. The distance-based method suggested five bioregions. The identified bioregions differed between methods with some consistent spatial patterns across methods. Temperature and precipitation explained 85.8% of the environmental variation. Eight climate regions were identified. In general, climate variation and bioregional patterns are currently poorly represented in PAs (<25% coverage). Main conclusions The network-based method allowed identifying bioregions at regional scale and was apparently more sensitive than the conventional distance-based method. The detection of transition zones by the Infomap algorithm was an advantage, and stressed the fact that the distribution of Iranian mammalian fauna is complex, especially in the south-eastern part where contact areas between several bioregions are found. The identified bioregions (especially the distance-based bioregions) and climate regions tended to match well with previous bioregionalization studies and the global terrestrial ecoregions. When thoroughly compared and understood, bioregions and climate regions provide a framework for regional biodiversity conservation planning.

AB  - Public participatory mapping is a method of crowdsourcing where the lay public can contribute spatial information for a range of applications including conservation planning. When used to collect wildlife observation data, participatory mapping becomes a type of "geographic citizen science" that involves collaboration with members of the public. While the potential of crowdsourcing to assist in wildlife conservation appears to be large, the quality and validity of the observational data collected remain a key concern. In this study, we examined the quality and validity of spatial data collected in a public participatory mapping project implemented in northern New South Wales (Australia) in 2018 where the public was asked to identify and map the location and frequency of koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) sightings using an internet mapping application. The iconic koala is a nationally-listed threatened species and has wide public recognition, making it an ideal test of our approach to examining the value of citizen science for wildlife. We assessed the validity of koala observation data from two perspectives of validity-as-accuracy (positional accuracy and data completeness) and validity-as-credibility (characteristics of spatial data contributors). To assess validity-as-accuracy, we analysed the distribution of citizen observations of koala sightings compared to an expert-derived probability distribution of koalas (likelihood model). To assess validity-as-credibility, we analysed the survey data to determine which participant characteristics increased the credibility of observational data. We found significant spatial association between crowdsourced koala observations and the likelihood model to validate koala locations, but there was under-reporting in more rural, remote areas. Significant variables contributing to accuracy in koala observations included participant knowledge of koalas, age, length of residence, and formal education. We also compared the crowdsourced results to a field-based citizen science koala observation project implemented in the same region and found crowdsourced participatory mapping provided comparable, if not superior results. Crowdsourced koala observations can augment field-based koala research by covering large geographic areas while engaging a broader public in conservation efforts. However, effective geographic citizen science projects require a significant commitment of resources, including the creation of community partnerships, to obtain high quality spatial data.

AB  - The KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service is undertaking a long-term project to determine the value of untransformed land for biodiversity conservation, to map these areas in accordance with their relative values, and to identify and prioritize irreplaceable areas. The overall goal of the initial stage of the project was to use existing data and expertise to define areas of conservation importance in KwaZulu-Natal. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the procedures used to incorporate insect species and subspecies into the project, including those for identifying insects of conservation concern and for making a first assessment of their distribution and conservation status. A biodiversity hierarchy (from landscapes through ecosystems and communities to species and populations) forms the basis of the analysis. Information received from taxonomists working in South Africa in response to a questionnaire survey was used to choose the species for inclusion in the initial analysis, A total of thirty-seven species and subspecies endemic to the Province in certain families of Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Mecoptera and Odonata were included. Existing distribution data were collated and the potential distributions of the endemics were modelled at a scale of 4 ha. Factors that potentially influence the distributions of the endemics were gleaned from the literature. Database queries using distribution data with a spatial resolution of: 250 in and cartographic overlays formed the basis of the modelling procedure. Two areas with little or no statutory protection, the high-lying grasslands of the northwestern region and much of the central region of the Province, are predicted to have a relatively high diversity of endemic insects. Fifty-one percent of the insect species and subspecies in the analysis met the two conservation goals, i.e. 1) at least 10% of their present distributions under formal conservation management, and 2) three such protected areas with viable populations. A benefit of modelling the potential distributions of endemics is that searching for populations of these insects can be directed to areas where they are expected to occur. The data collected can then be used to improve the distribution models for these insects, some of which are poorly known. The distributions and their associated conservation targets form a vital component of the iterative systematic conservation planning project currently underway in the Province.

AB  - Sublittoral rocky reef habitats host important ecological communities in UK waters, but their ecological condition is difficult to monitor. Monitoring methods based on seabed imagery data are prone to inconsistencies in both the identification and enumeration of species, which is a major hurdle in detecting meaningful ecological change. To overcome this problem, our study used a single monitoring dataset, collected using one standard method at the Pisces Reef Marine Protected Area (MPA) in 2016. We identified which method of data extraction from seabed imagery is best able to detect change along a gradient of anthropogenic resuspended sediments, which represents a pressure on the epifaunal community. We modelled the spatial distribution of the pressure, caused by nearby fishing activity, using an approach based on individual Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) ping data, rather than spatially homogenised data aggregated to a grid cell. We found that up to 22% of the biological variability across the three reef areas within the MPA is explained by the measured and derived environmental variables. The response of the epibenthic community at Pisces Reef MPA to the resuspended sediments pressure gradient is masked by commonly used univariate metrics such as species diversity and abundance of individuals. Conversely, a Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) identifies community-level change caused by a low level of modelled resuspended sediments pressure. We found that a 0.05 decimal degree grid cell of seabed within 1 km of the MPA boundary, swept by demersal fishing gear as little as five times per year on average, can elicit such a community response. The data extraction metric best able to detect this change in the sublittoral rock community is the frequency of occurrence of taxa in images with an average field of view of 0.7 m2, using a 25-cell grid. More traditional metrics extracted from seabed imagery, such as raw counts and percentage cover estimates, are less sensitive to detecting such community change. The TITAN also identified taxon-level responses to the pressure gradient that could be considered for future monitoring programmes. The solitary coral genus Caryophyllia and cup-like sponges show a sharp and strong negative response to pressure exposure, and could represent a starting point for a future monitoring programme of UK sublittoral rock habitats. The implications for future monitoring are discussed, including survey design, environmental and biological data collection and improved pressure modelling.

AB  - Kelp forests are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. In combination with their close proximity to the shore, the productivity and biodiversity of these ecosystems generate a wide range of ecosystem services including supporting (e.g., primary production, habitat), regulating (e.g., water flow, coastal erosion), provisioning (e.g., commercial and recreational fisheries), and cultural (e.g., recreational, artisanal) services. For these reasons, kelp forests have long been the target of ecological studies. However, with few exceptions, these studies have been localized and short term (<5 years). In 1999, recognizing the importance of large-scale, long-term studies for understanding the structure, functioning, and dynamics of coastal marine ecosystems, and for informing policy, the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) designed and initiated a large-scale, long-term monitoring study of kelp forest ecosystems along 1400 km of coast stretching from southern California to southern Oregon, USA. The purpose of the study has been to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of kelp forest ecosystem structure and evaluate the relative contributions of biological and environmental variables derived from external sources (e.g., sea otter density, Chl-a concentration, sea surface temperature, wave energy) in explaining observed spatial and temporal patterns. For this purpose, the ecological community (i.e., density, percent cover, or biomass of conspicuous fishes, invertebrates, and macroalgae) and geomorphological attributes (bottom depth, substratum type, and vertical relief) of kelp forest ecosystems have been surveyed annually using SCUBA divers trained in both scientific diving and data collection techniques and the identification of kelp forest species. The study region spans distinct ecological and biogeographic provinces, which enables investigations of how variation in environmental drivers and distinctive species compositions influence community structure, and its response to climate-related environmental change across a portion of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. These data have been used to inform fisheries management, design and evaluate California's state-wide network of marine protected areas (MPAs), and assess the ecological consequences of climate change (e.g., marine heatwaves). Over time, the spatial and temporal design of the monitoring program was adapted to fill its role in evaluating the ecological responses to the establishment of MPAs.

AB  - Detailed field and modelling studies have been completed at different spatial scales for the endangered arboreal marsupial, Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri); a species virtually confined to the ash-type eucalypt forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. These forests are also subject to considerable pressure to produce timber and paper products. The studies of Leadbeater's Possum highlighted the factors influencing the distribution and abundance of the species ranging from broad distribution patterns, the occupancy of habitat patches at the landscape scale, and the use of individual den sites and the quality of trees that provide food within particular stands. These scales correspond to the entire known range of the species, sub-populations within a metapopulation occupying an ensemble of patches at the landscape scale, and colonies occupying den trees in individual stands. Information on the factors influencing the distribution of Leadbeater's Possum at one spatial scale were found to be important for informing processes at another. For example, an understanding of the species' habitat requirements informed the spatial distribution of habitat patches at the landscape level which, in turn, gave insights into predicted metapopulation dynamics. Each spatial scale of ecological investigation of Leadbeater's Possum had a corresponding scale of forest management, and they included: virtually the entire ash-type eucalypt resource in the region, the location of large reserves, the design of corridors and retained patches within production forest landscapes, silvicultural practices employed in individual stands, and the retention of individual trees and clusters of trees on logged sites. This range of forest management scales, and the corresponding-scaled array of ecological studies, have particular implications for the conservation of Leadbeater's Possum. The results of investigations to date have revealed that conservation efforts must focus on ash-type eucalypt forests in the Central Highlands of Victoria because populations of Leadbeater's Possum are virtually confined to these areas. Within the broadscale limits of the distribution of the species, the long-term conservation of Leadbeater's Possum will not only be dependent on large reserves, but also intermediate-scale reserves and corridors within wood production areas, as well changed silvicultural practices to better provide suitable habitat on logged sites. While each strategy will make a contribution to the persistence of Leadbeater's Possum, it also has important limitations; an outcome which highlights the need for a multi-scale approach to attempts to conserve the species. Notably, the overaching implications for the design of an array of different conservation strategies for Leadbeater's Possum could not have been derived from any single study at a particular spatial scale. Thus, the case study on Leadbeater's Possum suggests that consideration of factors at a range of scales should be an integral part of management and conservation planning, not only for this species, but for wildlife per se.

AB  - The presence of endemic species is among the fundamental criteria for characterizing the biodiversity of a territory. Analyzing species richness, extinction level and distribution drivers is an important preliminary step to set conservation priorities and test environmental policies. This study applied the concept of adaptive management to develop strategies for the conservation of endemic floras by considering, as a case study, Sicily, Malta and their neighboring small islands. Adaptive management can be defined as the systematic acquisition and application of reliable information to improve management over time. The development of adaptive conservation strategies aimed preliminary: (1) to quantify endemic plant diversity; (2) to assess the current IUCN knowledge; (3) to analyze the spatial patterns of species distribution in relation to number of colonized habitats, preferential habitats, altitudinal range, and bedrock; (4) to assess whether Natura 2000 network contributed significantly to increase the overlap between endemic distributional areas and protected surface. Strictly Sicilian endemics were 202 taxa amounting to 7.0 % of the whole native flora (c. 2900 taxa). The current picture of extinction risk is still incomplete because over 50 % of endemics were never assessed or assessed with old IUCN criteria. The spatial range size of endemics depended by 40 % on bedrock, and altitudinal and niche breadth. Habitat type did not influence the range size of endemics. The overlap between endemic distributional areas and protected surface increased from 41.3 to 63.3 % with Natura 2000. Adaptive management needs measurable goals to test the progressive improvement of conservation strategies over time, and the reduction in threatened species may be considered as an indicator of successful conservation outcomes. Feedback plays an important role in the periodic revision of biodiversity assessment, distribution modeling, and environmental management, which are fundamental to predict conservation outcomes in the face of extreme uncertainty. In particular, the exhaustive knowledge of the IUCN status is a primary step to implement adaptive measures of conservation, especially as regards endemic floras that are potentially more vulnerable to large-scale or unpredictable and stochastic threats.

AB  - The identification and monitoring of essential fishery habitat (EFH) is primary and important for the conservation of estuarine fishery habitat and sustainable fisheries management. However, mapping EFH of estuarine fishery species with generally statistical species distribution model (SDM) remains difficult due to their complex life histories and the extensive spatiotemporal variability of habitat variables. Thus, we proposed a mechanistic SDM by analyzing a more direct and certain relationship at a pre-selected suitable life stage with prior knowledge of species life history, not a rough statistical analysis of overlapping cause-effect relationships operating across multiple life history stages in reverse. Landsat data was used to describe the extensive spatiotemporal variability of estuarine habitat variables. A window filtration was contributed most to select the suitable life stage with a score scheme. As mapping EFH needs to feasibly locate the representative and essential habitats over large estuarine scale, we constructed two indicators to represent "habitat importance " and "descriptor predictability " in the score scheme, which was semi-quantified with three primary factors (habitat function, duration of life history stage, inversion limitation of critical descriptors from Landsat data). Through selecting the suitable life stage for the mechanistic SDM, the usage of Landsat archives could be extended, which is beneficial from a few optically / thermally active determinants. The applicability of the mechanistic SDM was tested by mapping EFH of Eriocheir sinensis in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE), China. The window filtration of E. sinensis' life history stages in the YRE showed that the berry stage was filtered as the suitable stage with the highest scores both in habitat importance and descriptors predictability. Then the distribution of E. sinensis was modelled, predicated, and assessed at berry stage by comparing outward in a generally statistical way and inward with other filter window. The mechanistic model at berry stage showed the best explanatory and predictive power in both occurrence and abundance models, validating that the optimized SDM had much stronger capability in model fit and prediction. The score scheme was also verified to set reasonably and effectively through the model comparisons at different filter window stages. With the predicated distribution of E. sinensis, the core ranges of EFH were mapped at berry stage, which were mostly distributed in sub-tidal areas neighbored to wetlands, showing the habitat requirement of shallow water for hiding. Meantime, the determinants' variance partitioning, in which dissolved oxygen (DO) and total suspended sediment (TSS) exceeded over 65%, complementally illustrated that core EFH may also require high water quality. The identification of EFH locations with our mechanistic SDM would provide spatial-explicit information and guidance to fishery habitat protection and fishery resources maintenance. Additionally, this study also explored a new way to utilize a few predictors from the extensively used Landsat data in an alternative way. This study could extend the limitations of SDM in EFH mapping and bridge gaps between spatiotemporal explicit modelling and remote sensing data accommodations, which is meaningful for fishery habitat conservation.

AB  - Through spatially explicit predictive models, knowledge of spatial patterns of biota can be generated for out-of-reach environments, where there is a paucity of survey data. This knowledge is invaluable for conservation decisions. We used distribution modeling to predict the occurrence of benthic biotopes, or megafaunal communities of the seabed, to support the spatial planning of a marine national park. Nine biotope classes were obtained prior to modeling from multivariate species data derived from point source, underwater imagery. Five map layers relating to depth and terrain were used as predictor variables. Biotope type was predicted on a pixel-by-pixel basis, where pixel size was 15315 m and total modeled area was 455 km(2).
   To choose a suitable modeling technique we compared the performance of five common models based on recursive partitioning: two types of classification and regression trees ([1] pruned by 10-fold cross-validation and [2] pruned by minimizing complexity), random forests, conditional inference (CI) trees, and CI forests. The selected model was a CI forest (an ensemble of CI trees), a machine-learning technique whose discriminatory power (class-byclass area under the curve [AUC] ranged from 0.75 to 0.86) and classification accuracy (72%) surpassed those of the other methods tested. Conditional inference trees are virtually new to the field of ecology. The final model's overall prediction error was 28%. Model predictions were also checked against a custom-built measure of dubiousness, calculated at the polygon level. Key factors other than the choice of modeling technique include: the use of a multinomial response, accounting for the heterogeneity of observations, and spatial autocorrelation. To illustrate how the model results can be implemented in spatial planning, representation of biodiversity in the national park was described and quantified.
   Given a goal of maximizing classification accuracy, we conclude that conditional inference trees are a promising tool to map biota. Species distribution modeling is presented as an ecological tool that can handle a wide variety of systems (e.g., the benthic system).

AB  - Boosted Regression Trees. Excellent for data-poor spatial management but hard to use
   Marine resource managers and scientists often advocate spatial approaches to manage data-poor species. Existing spatial prediction and management techniques are either insufficiently robust, struggle with sparse input data, or make suboptimal use of multiple explanatory variables. Boosted Regression Trees feature excellent performance and are well suited to modelling the distribution of data-limited species, but are extremely complicated and time-consuming to learn and use, hindering access for a wide potential user base and therefore limiting uptake and usage.
   BRTs automated and simplified for accessible general use with rich feature set
   We have built a software suite in R which integrates pre-existing functions with new tailor-made functions to automate the processing and predictive mapping of species abundance data: by automating and greatly simplifying Boosted Regression Tree spatial modelling, the gbm. auto R package suite makes this powerful statistical modelling technique more accessible to potential users in the ecological and modelling communities. The package and its documentation allow the user to generate maps of predicted abundance, visualise the representativeness of those abundance maps and to plot the relative influence of explanatory variables and their relationship to the response variables. Databases of the processed model objects and a report explaining all the steps taken within the model are also generated. The package includes a previously unavailable Decision Support Tool which combines estimated escapement biomass (the percentage of an exploited population which must be retained each year to conserve it) with the predicted abundance maps to generate maps showing the location and size of habitat that should be protected to conserve the target stocks (candidate MPAs), based on stakeholder priorities, such as the minimisation of fishing effort displacement.
   Gbm.auto for management in various settings
   By bridging the gap between advanced statistical methods for species distribution modelling and conservation science, management and policy, these tools can allow improved spatial abundance predictions, and therefore better management, decision-making, and conservation. Although this package was built to support spatial management of a data-limited marine elasmobranch fishery, it should be equally applicable to spatial abundance modelling, area protection, and stakeholder engagement in various scenarios.

AB  - To date, knowledge about the herpetological diversity and the species distribution in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains largely incomplete. In order to fill this gap, we carried out long-term and large-scale herpetological surveys to improve the knowledge about the herpetofauna occurrence and species composition data. Site scanning, visual encounter, transect and quadrat methods were used along with call recordings for identifying and locating amphibians on each survey site. Additional data were gathered from literature reviews and museum collections. The herpetological diversity was assessed on twenty-eight survey sites located in both Congo Basin and Albertine Rift ecoregions. All surveyed localities and sites were georeferenced in order to generate distribution maps by using QGIS 2.14.0 software. Herpetological diversity indices were generated using the PAST software. Using morphological characters and information provided by DNA analysis. species lists were produced per site and on national level. The results show that the rich Congolese herpetofauna is composed of 605 species, including 247 (40.83%) amphibians and 358 (59.17%) reptiles. There are 57 endemic amphibian species (23.1%) and of these, 19 (32.7%) are located in Protected Areas. There are 38 endemic reptile species (10.6%) and of these, twelve (31.5%) are found in Protected Areas. Furthermore, there are nine and seventeen threatened amphibian and reptile species respectively; but only 20% of these have been detected inside of national parks. Concerning this situation, it appears that, if no action is undertaken for fighting against the human pressure on habitat, there will be a decline in populations and species in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Based on relevant indices, including species richness, rarity, diversity, endemism, and presence of threatened species, and other objective criteria in respect to international standards, the following ten sites were identified as sites of priority for conservation: Marungu, Kabobo, Itombwe, Ituri, Tshopo, Mai Ndombe Tumba, Lualaba, Lukaya, Sankuru, and Ubangi Uele. These sites are proposed as new Protected Areas for reaching the government's national conservation targets of land preservation necessary for conserving the rich biodiversity.

AB  - Given the frequent socioeconomic, political and concomitant ecological failures of science-driven marine protected area (MPA) programmes, it is now important to design MPAs by integrating natural an social science research more comprehensively. This study shows how indigenous peoples assisted in the design of MPAs by identifying marine substrates and related resident taxa on aerial photos, information which was then incorporated into a geographical information system (GIS) database, along with dive survey data. Two questions were asked: (1) Is indigenous ecological knowledge accurate enough for mapping the benthos and associated taxa? (2) Is such an approach an appropriate way for assisting in the biological and social design of MPAs in Oceania? Conventional quadrat field dive surveys were used to measure the accuracy of substrate identification by local informants and a visual survey was used to test hypotheses formulated from local knowledge regarding the spatial distribution and relative abundance of non-cryptic species within certain benthic habitats. Equivalence rates between indigenous aerial photo interpretations of dominant benthic substrates and in situ dive surveys were 75-85% for a moderately detailed classification scheme of the benthos, which included nine locally-defined abiotic and biotic benthic classes for the MPA seabed. Similarly, the taxa inventory showed a strong correspondence between the qualitative predictions of local fisherfolk and the quantitative analysis of noncryptic species distribution, including their relative abundance and geophysical locations. Indigenous people's predictions about the presence or absence of fish in different benthic habitats corresponded 77% and 92% of the time (depending on scoring schema) with in situ visual measurements. These results demonstrate how incorporating local knowledge of benthic heterogeneity, existing biological communities, and particular spatio-temporal events of biological significance into a GIS database can corroborate the production of scientifically reliable base resource maps for designing MPAs in an environmentally and culturally sound fashion. This participatory approach was used to design and then establish MPAs in the Roviana and Vonavona region of the Western Solomon Islands. Under appropriate conditions, interdisciplinary work can complement the design of scientific fishery management and biodiversity conservation prescriptions for coastal Oceania.

AB  - Patch size (area) and isolation (inverse distance to source) are key variables of island biogeography, but their application in conservation planning has recently come under scrutiny. Based on animal distribution data in fragmented landscapes from around the world it was postulated that occupancy was poorly predicted by patch size and isolation. Do these findings also apply to arid areas and to plants?
   This question was investigated in four inselberg landscapes in the Namib Desert stretching over a 770 km climatic north-south gradient. Inselbergs (isolated mountains) are special habitats and can be considered 'islands' of more mesic conditions in an arid matrix. Species richness of inselberg specialists was used as an indicator and regressed against area, distance to nearest habitat and distance to 'mainland' (or source pool, which are proxies for level of isolation). Additionally, the influence of landscape geographic position, land use and rock types were studied. Responses of different life forms and individual plant species as well as possible dispersal limitations were also investigated.
   Whether patch size is more important than isolation in determining species richness on arid inselbergs could not be answered at a landscape level. However, when investigated on a functional and species level, isolation was of greater importance than patch size for trees and also for selected species such as Commiphora saxicola and Heliotropium steudneri. The effect of distance to source in this study is likely a function of spatial distance as well as a coast-inland moisture gradient. Inselberg specialist-richness was not affected by land use or the bioclimatic position. Yet rock type, which is a reflection of soil physical and chemical properties did affect species richness with granites and basalts supporting more species. Life forms of inselberg specialists were influenced by the investigated environmental variables, but dispersal limitations were not. Despite inconclusive results at a landscape level, functional groups and individual species provided more conclusive results. This points towards the necessity of additional investigations at a finer scale to gain an understanding of the factors driving species distributions. In future more detail regarding the 'matrix' surrounding 'patches', as well as evolutionary and vegetation historic factors should be explored. Phylogenetic studies would be one tool to help unravelling some of the presently unknown factors affecting species distributions on Namib inselbergs. This study also highlighted the importance of inselbergs in arid landscapes as 'hotspots' of species richness and species of conservation importance. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical countries suffer from a lack of financial resources to monitor and model sources and outcomes of soil degradation and, therefore, a scarcity of data. In this study it was tried to model superficial and subterranean water erosion based on basic environmental variables such as geological formation, soil type or vegetation cover - data which are potentially available even in developing countries. Different forms of water erosion and karst or pseudokarst formations in Tabasco, Southeastern Mexico were estimated. The study region (3500 km(2)) consists of plain and hilly areas with an annual precipitation ranging from 2000 to 4000 turn. Main land use form is rangeland. The area is geologically composed of sedimentary rocks, limestone, sandstone and conglomerates. Collecting data by field observations over the entire study area a cartography of different soil loss forms such as rill and gully erosion, mass movement, sinkholes and tunnels was created including field data from available maps of geological formation, soil type, precipitation and former land use 20 years ago. Additionally, data collected in the field such as actual land use, vegetation cover and inclination were added. In the entire study area 1039 sites were affected by soil erosion with 2435 single manifestations of soil erosion. 482 sites were found with one gully each, 57 sites with erosion rills with a total of 416, 392 sites with one mass movement each, 85 sites with sinkholes with a total of 1122, and 23 sites with one tunnel each. Rendzic Leptosols over Oligocene limestone are strongly affected by sinkholes and tunnels in regions with inclinations of less than 5'. This phenomenon is explained by karstic and pseudokarstic formation. Superficial erosion forms are mainly found on rendzic Leptosols over shale sandstone and on eutric or peli-eutric Vertisols on Andesit in areas with inclinations between 5 and 300. The application of classification trees allowed to successfully predict the occurrence of sinkholes and tunnels (degree of agreement between prediction and observation: very good to excellent). Even in areas with scarce data-bases this could allow for easy identification of high-risk areas. Predictive success of the occurrence of the different forms of superficial soil losses, however, is low. Superficial erosion seems to be mainly caused by more specific pedological factors. Nevertheless, automated induction of classification trees can be a valuable tool for preliminary data analysis and hypothesis generation in areas with lack of local expertise and can guide erosion risk mapping and soil conservation planning.

AB  - The badger (Meles metes) is an important wildlife host for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), and is a reservoir of infection to cattle. Reliable indicators of badger abundance at large spatial scales are important for informing epidemiological investigation. Thus, we aimed to estimate badger social group abundance from a large-scale dataset to provide useful information for the management of bTB in the Republic of Ireland (ROI). Robust estimates of species abundance require planned systematic surveying. This is often unfeasible at large spatial scales, resulting in inadequate (biased) data collection. We employed species distributional modelling (SDM) using 7724 badger main-sett (burrow) locations across the ROI at a I ha scale. This dataset was potentially biased as surveying was directed towards areas with cattle bTB-breakdowns. In order to manage sampling bias, we developed a model where the environment was sampled using pseudoabsences geographically constrained to the potential survey area only (constrained model), in addition to a model where all of the ROI was sampled (non-constrained model). Models predictive performance was assessed using internal (splitting the national-scale dataset) and external validation on independent datasets; the latter included 278 main setts from a local-scale unbiased intensive survey (755 km(2)). Finally, the relationship between predicted probability and observed abundance at local-scale was used to infer number of social-groups at the national level. The geographically constrained model showed moderate discriminatory power, but good calibration in both the internal and external validations. The non-constrained model resulted in higher discrimination but poorer calibration in the internal validation, indicating a limitation for national-scale predictions. Interestingly, there was a strong cubic relationship between predicted probability-classes and observed sett density in the local-area (R-2 = 0.85 and 0.96; for the non-constrained and the constrained models, respectively). At the national-scale, the preferred model predicted a total of 19,200 (95% Confidence Interval: 12,200-27,900) social groups. Our analyses demonstrated that under a critical perspective large-scale potentially biased datasets can be used to estimate variations in species abundance. The abundance predictions are in keeping with recent independent estimations of the badger population, and will be a valuable index of species abundance for epidemiology (e.g. risk mapping), species management (e.g. informing vaccine strategies) and conservation planning (e.g. assessing population viability).

AB  - There is an increasing demand for sea cucumbers, for human consumption, mainly from Asian markets and, as a consequence, NE-Atlantic species are now new targets for exploitation and exportation. Holothuria mammata is one of the most valuable species in Europe. However, the lack of historical economic interest in this species in most European countries has also led to a lack of studies concerning biological and ecological aspects on wild populations and this is a major issue for stock management. This study aims to determine the temporal and spatial patterns of distribution of H. mammata, considering its abundance and demographic structure in a NE-Atlantic area, SW Portugal, as a function of environmental conditions. For that, a population from a marine protected area was followed for 1 year at 1.5-month intervals. Throughout the coastal area, six sites were selected and at each sampling campaign three random transects per site and substrate (rock and sand) in which all H. mammata individuals were counted and measured. For each site and survey several environmental parameters of interest, from the water column, the sediment and substrate cover, were also measured. Generalized Linear Models were used to model the spatial and temporal distribution of the species according to environmental conditions, to determine the species' habitat preferences. The distribution models indicate that abiotic and biotic parameters of the water column are not the main drivers shaping the distribution of H. mammata. The species has a patchy distribution, and its habitat preferences depend on environmental stability, the presence of shelter and habitat complexity, which is more important for smaller, more vulnerable, individuals, while bigger size classes tend to venture more into less stable environments in an opportunistic fashion. The knowledge of these population traits is determinant to develop stock management measures, which are now urgent to prevent the depletion of commercial sea cucumber populations in the NE-Atlantic. Sustainable fisheries policies should be developed and start by considering to delimit fishing areas and periods, considering the species spatial and temporal distribution patterns.

AB  - Biodiversity loss from climate and land use change is a global occurrence, but is of particular concern in more prominent biodiverse and sensitive areas such as the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. This region harbors two species of geographically separated brown bear (Ursus arctos) - the Tibetan (U. a. pruinosus) and Himalayan brown bear (U. a. isabellinus). Both serve as important umbrella species, providing many ecological benefits to their surrounding ecosystems. However, how these two species from the same taxonomic group but with distinct geographical ranges, will respond to climate and land use change is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to predict the potential impacts of future climate and land use change on the distribution and dispersal paths of Tibetan and Himalayan brown bears in the HKH region. We applied MaxEnt modeling to predict the distribution of the two bear species both currently and for the year 2070, using three General Circulation Models and three scenarios of climate and land use change. We then identified potential dispersal paths using Circuit Theory. Results showed that both species would be negatively affected by the climate and land use change expected in the 2070s. In all three climate scenarios, their distribution areas would both shrink and shift to higher altitudes. Throughout the HKH region, Tibetan and Himalayan brown bears were predicted to lose over 34% and 32% of currently inhabited area under the most severe climate scenario, respectively. In addition, results showed that the density of dispersal paths for Tibetan brown bear would decrease while dispersal resistance would increase, and that dispersal paths for Himalayan brown bears would shift to higher latitudes. To protect these species, the cur-rently suitable distribution areas and dispersal paths should be considered as priority protected areas. Our find-ings provide a scientific basis for allocating protected areas in the HKH region that are effective under the context of global climate change, and for establishing transboundary cooperation in the HKH region.

AB  - Forest-woodland-savannah mosaics are a common feature in the East African landscape. For the conservation of the woody species that occur in such landscapes, the species patterns and the factors that maintain it need to be understood. We studied the woody species distribution in a forest-woodland-savannah mosaic in Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda. The existing vegetation gradients were analyzed using data from a total of 591 plots of 400 or 500 m(2) each. Remotely sensed data was used to explore current vegetation cover and the gradients there in for the whole area. A clear species gradient exists in the study area ranging from forest, where there is least disturbance, to wooded grassland, where frequent fire disturbance occurs. Most species are not limited to a specific part of the gradient although many show a maximum abundance at some point along the gradient. Fire and accessibility to the protected area were closely related to variation in species composition along the ordination axis with species like Cynometra alexandri and Uvariopsis congensis occurring at one end of the gradient and Combretum guenzi and Lonchocarpus laxiflorus at the other. The vegetation cover classes identified in the area differed in diversity, density and, especially, basal area. All vegetation cover classes, except open woodland, had indicator species. Diospyros abyssinica, Uvariopsis congensis, Holoptelea grandis and all Celtis species were the indicator species for the forest class, Terminalia velutina and Albizia grandbracteata for closed woodland, Grewia mollis and Combretum mole for very open woodland and Lonchocarpus laxiflorus, Grewia bicolor and Combretum guenzi for the wooded grassland class. Eleven of the species occurred in all cover classes and most of the species that occurred in more than one vegetation cover class showed peak abundance in a specific cover class. Species composition in the study area changes gradually from forest to savannah. Along the gradient, the cover classes are distinguishable in terms of species composition and vegetation structure. These classes are, however, interrelated in species composition. For conservation of the full range of the species within this East African landscape, the mosaic has to be managed as an integrated whole. Burning should be varied over the area with the forest not being burnt at all and the wooded grassland burnt regularly. The different vegetation types that occur between these two extremes should be maintained using a varied fire regime.

AB  - Tropical forests are facing constant degradation and destruction as a result of multiple threats, mostly from land use, and increasingly from climate change. Understanding the effects of these threats, and the role of Protected Areas in buffering their impacts, is becoming an essential task to prevent the loss of species. In this study, we used the woolly monkey, a keystone species with seed dispersal functions, as a surrogate to assess the future conservation potential of the Protected Areas in Colombia, a megadiverse country where important tropical forests remain. We modelled the ecological niche of the woolly monkey using an ensemble forecasting approach to assess potential distribution changes resulting from climate change and deforestation. Distribution changes in 2050 were estimated for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), three Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and one deforestation projection. Additionally, we evaluated the current and future suitable area for the species located within Protected Areas. For the year 2016, we estimated a potential distribution area for the woolly monkey of 413,533 km2 after accounting for deforestation. The future synergistic effect of climate change and deforestation could cause a reduction of up to-13 % in the species potential distribution in Colombia, mainly in the Andean-Amazonian foothills and the Amazon region. The distribution area lost due to climate change was exceeded by losses due to deforestation in all scenarios, where up to 65,356 km(2) could be lost as a result of forest clearance. The current Protected Area system will not be able to mitigate the impacts of climate and land-use changes, since-26 % of the woolly monkey's range is currently located within National Parks and Indigenous Reserves. This range could decrease by-18 % in the most drastic future scenario. Based on these results, we emphasize the need of an integrated approach of land-use planning that encompasses the creation, expansion and connectivity of Protected Areas, along with the strengthening of law enforcement capacity and restoration efforts to halt increasing deforestation. The effective implementation of these strategies is necessary to assist species to track their suitable climatic conditions, especially through the Andean-Amazonian foothills, and will contribute to the conservation of tropical biodiversity.

AB  - Global climate change and disturbances from human activities lead to habitat loss and changes in habitat quality, resulting in a reduction in biodiversity. The continental coastline of China distributes some cities with highly developed economies and coastal wetlands with rich biodiversity, and both economic development and biodiversity conservation are important topics. In order to clarify the spatial distribution of bird biodiversity in coastal areas, based on the MaxEnt model and GIS spatial analysis, the distribution data of 488 species of birds and 15 environmental variables were used to simulate the suitable distribution areas of birds, and to analyze the spatial distribution and hotspots of bird biodiversity in coastal areas. The main findings of this study are as follows. (1) A total of 488 species in 249 genera of 21 orders and 81 families of birds were involved in the modeling of coastal areas. The main environmental factors affecting the potential distribution of birds in general are: land use, monthly mean diurnal temperature range, and precipitation of the driest month. (2) High value areas of bird richness are distributed in different locations in the four sea areas: In the Bohai Rim region, they are mainly distributed in the Liaohe Estuary Wetland in Liaoning Province, the vicinity of the Yongdingxin River and Haihe River in Tianjin, the eastern part of Tianjin, and the Yellow River and Yellow River Delta Wetland in Shandong Province; In the coastal area of the Yellow Sea, they are primarily found in Kunyu Mountain National Nature Reserve, Laoshan Provincial Nature Reserve in Shandong Province, and Yancheng Wetland Rare Birds National Nature Reserve in Jiangsu Province; In the coastal areas of the East China Sea, they are mainly found at the mouth of the Yangtze River, at the national nature reserve of Dongtan birds on Chongming Island, along the southeastern coast of Zhejiang Province, near the Min River and along the coast of Quanzhou in Fujian Province; In the coastal areas of the South China Sea, they are mainly distributed in the Pearl River Delta wetlands of Guangdong Province, the southeastern coastal areas of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the Shiwanda Mountain National Nature Reserve in Guangxi Province. (3) The spatial trends in the distribution of hotspots of birds of national priority protection in coastal areas are generally consistent, but more concentrated than the distribution of all birds. (4) After the high-value areas of bird richness were superimposed with protected areas, it was found that the intersecting area accounted for a small proportion of the protected area, and many areas near the inland had low bird richness. Finally, the findings provide references for bird biodiversity conservation and planning in coastal areas.

AB  - Background: The Andes-Amazon basin of Peru and Bolivia is one of the most data-poor, biologically rich, and rapidly changing areas of the world. Conservation scientists agree that this area hosts extremely high endemism, perhaps the highest in the world, yet we know little about the geographic distributions of these species and ecosystems within country boundaries. To address this need, we have developed conservation data on endemic biodiversity (similar to 800 species of birds, mammals, amphibians, and plants) and terrestrial ecological systems (similar to 90; groups of vegetation communities resulting from the action of ecological processes, substrates, and/or environmental gradients) with which we conduct a fine scale conservation prioritization across the Amazon watershed of Peru and Bolivia. We modelled the geographic distributions of 435 endemic plants and all 347 endemic vertebrate species, from existing museum and herbaria specimens at a regional conservation practitioner's scale (1: 250,000-1: 1,000,000), based on the best available tools and geographic data. We mapped ecological systems, endemic species concentrations, and irreplaceable areas with respect to national level protected areas.
   Results: We found that sizes of endemic species distributions ranged widely (< 20 km(2) to > 200,000 km(2)) across the study area. Bird and mammal endemic species richness was greatest within a narrow 2500-3000 m elevation band along the length of the Andes Mountains. Endemic amphibian richness was highest at 1000-1500 m elevation and concentrated in the southern half of the study area. Geographical distribution of plant endemism was highly taxon-dependent. Irreplaceable areas, defined as locations with the highest number of species with narrow ranges, overlapped slightly with areas of high endemism, yet generally exhibited unique patterns across the study area by species group. We found that many endemic species and ecological systems are lacking national-level protection; a third of endemic species have distributions completely outside of national protected areas. Protected areas cover only 20% of areas of high endemism and 20% of irreplaceable areas. Almost 40% of the 91 ecological systems are in serious need of protection (= < 2% of their ranges protected).
   Conclusions: We identify for the first time, areas of high endemic species concentrations and high irreplaceability that have only been roughly indicated in the past at the continental scale. We conclude that new complementary protected areas are needed to safeguard these endemics and ecosystems. An expansion in protected areas will be challenged by geographically isolated micro-endemics, varied endemic patterns among taxa, increasing deforestation, resource extraction, and changes in climate. Relying on pre-existing collections, publically accessible datasets and tools, this working framework is exportable to other regions plagued by incomplete conservation data.

AB  - Many conservation actions are justified on the basis of managing biodiversity. Biodiversity, in terms of species richness, is largely the product of rare species. This is problematic because the intensity of sampling needed to characterize communities and patterns of rarity or to justify the use of surrogates has biased sampling in favor of space over time. However, environmental fluctuations interacting with community dynamics lead to temporal variations in where and when species occur, potentially affecting conservation planning by generating uncertainty about results of species distribution modeling (including range determinations), selection of surrogates for biodiversity, and the proportion of biodiversity composed of rare species. To have confidence in the evidence base for conservation actions, one must consider whether temporal replication is necessary to produce broad inferences. Using approximately 20 years of macrofaunal data from tidal flats in 2 harbors, we explored variation in the identity of rare, common, restricted range, and widespread species over time and space. Over time, rare taxa were more likely to increase in abundance or occurrence than to remain rare or disappear and to exhibit temporal patterns in their occurrence. Space-time congruency in ranges (i.e., spatially widespread taxa were also temporally widespread) was observed only where samples were collected across an environmental gradient. Fifteen percent of the taxa in both harbors changed over time from having spatially restricted ranges to having widespread ranges. Our findings suggest that rare species can provide stability against environmental change, because the majority of species were not random transients, but that selection of biodiversity surrogates requires temporal validation. Rarity needs to be considered both spatially and temporally, as species that occur randomly over time are likely to play a different role in ecosystem functioning than those exhibiting temporal structure (e.g., seasonality). Moreover, temporal structure offers the opportunity to place management and conservation activities within windows of maximum opportunity.
   El Papel del Tiempo y la Identidad de las Especies en los Patrones Espaciales de Riqueza de Especies y la Conservacion Muchas acciones de conservacion estan justificadas con base en el manejo de la biodiversidad. La biodiversidad, en terminos de la riqueza de especies, generalmente es producto de especies raras. Esto es problematico porque la intensidad del muestreo necesitado para caracterizar a las comunidades y los patrones de rareza o para justificar el uso de sustitutos tiene un muestreo sesgado a favor del espacio sobre el tiempo. Sin embargo, las fluctuaciones ambientales que interactuan con las dinamicas de las comunidades llevan a variaciones temporales en donde y cuando ocurren las especies, lo que afecta potencialmente a la planeacion de la conservacion al generar incertidumbre sobre los resultados del modelado de distribucion de especies (incluyendo las determinaciones de extension), seleccion de sustitutos para la biodiversidad y la proporcion de biodiversidad compuesta por especies raras. Para tener confianza en la base de evidencias para las acciones de conservacion, uno debe considerar si la replicacion temporal es necesaria para producir inferencias generalizadas. Utilizamos aproximadamente 20 anos de datos de macrofauna de los llanos de marea de dos puertos para explorar la variacion en la identidad de especies raras, comunes, de extension restringida y dispersadas a lo largo del tiempo y el espacio. A lo largo del tiempo, los taxones raros tuvieron mayor probabilidad de incrementar en abundancia u ocurrencia que de permanecer como raros o desaparecer y una mayor probabilidad de exhibir patrones temporales en su ocurrencia. Se observo congruencia espacio-tiempo en las extensiones (es decir, los taxones dispersados espacialmente tambien estuvieron dispersados temporalmente) solo cuando las muestras fueron colectadas a lo largo de un gradiente ambiental. El 15 % de los taxones en ambos puertos cambio con el tiempo de tener extensiones restringidas espacialmente a tener extensiones dispersadas. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que las especies raras pueden proporcionar estabilidad frente al cambio ambiental, ya que la mayoria de las especies no fueron errantes al azar, pero que la seleccion de sustitutos para la biodiversidad requiere validacion temporal. La rareza necesita ser considerada tanto espacial como temporalmente, ya que las especies que ocurren con el tiempo tienen probabilidad de tener un papel diferente en la funcion del ecosistema que aquellos que exhiben una estructura temporal (por ejemplo, estacionalidad). Ademas, la estructura temporal ofrece la oportunidad de colocar a las actividades de manejo y de conservacion dentro de las ventanas de maxima oportunidad. Resumen

AB  - Geographic range size is often conceptualized as a fixed attribute of a species and treated as such for the purposes of quantification of extinction risk; species occupying smaller geographic ranges are assumed to have a higher risk of extinction, all else being equal. However many species are mobile, and their movements range from relatively predictable to-and-fro migrations to complex irregular movements shown by nomadic species. These movements can lead to substantial temporary expansion and contraction of geographic ranges, potentially to levels which may pose an extinction risk. By linking occurrence data with environmental conditions at the time of observations of nomadic species, we modeled the dynamic distributions of 43 arid-zone nomadic bird species across the Australian continent for each month over 11 years and calculated minimum range size and extent of fluctuation in geographic range size from these models. There was enormous variability in predicted spatial distribution over time; 10 species varied in estimated geographic range size by more than an order of magnitude, and 2 species varied by >2 orders of magnitude. During times of poor environmental conditions, several species not currently classified as globally threatened contracted their ranges to very small areas, despite their normally large geographic range size. This finding raises questions about the adequacy of conventional assessments of extinction risk based on static geographic range size (e.g., IUCN Red Listing). Climate change is predicted to affect the pattern of resource fluctuations across much of the southern hemisphere, where nomadism is the dominant form of animal movement, so it is critical we begin to understand the consequences of this for accurate threat assessment of nomadic species. Our approach provides a tool for discovering spatial dynamics in highly mobile species and can be used to unlock valuable information for improved extinction risk assessment and conservation planning.
   Tamano de Extension Geografica y Evaluacion de Riesgo de Extincion en Especies Nomadas El tamano de extension geografica se conceptualiza frecuentemente como un atributo fijo de las especies y se trata como tal para los propositos de cuantificacion de riesgo de extincion; se asume que las especies que ocupan extensiones geograficas mas pequenas tienen un riesgo de extincion mas alto, cuando todo lo demas es igual. Sin embargo, muchas especies son moviles y sus movimientos varian desde migraciones de ida y vuelta relativamente predecibles hasta movimientos irregulares complejos, como los que muestran las especies nomadas. Estos movimientos pueden llevar a expansiones sustanciales temporales y a una reduccion de las extensiones geograficas, todo esto con el potencial de llegar a niveles que pueden presentar un riesgo de extincion. Al enlazar los datos de presencia con las condiciones ambientales al momento de la observacion de las especies nomadas pudimos modelar las distribuciones dinamicas de 43 especies de aves de zonas aridas a lo largo de la isla de Australia durante cada mes a lo largo de once anos y calculamos el tamano de extension minima y el alcance de las fluctuaciones en el tamano de extension geografica a partir de estos modelos. Hubo una enorme variabilidad en la distribucion espacial pronosticada a lo largo del tiempo: diez especies variaron en el tamano de extension geografica por mas de una orden de magnitud y dos especies variaron por mas de dos ordenes de magnitud. Durante situaciones de condiciones ambientales pobres, varias especies que actualmente no se encuentran clasificadas como amenazadas a nivel global redujeron sus extensiones a areas muy pequenas, esto a pesar de su gran tamano de extension geografica normal. Este hallazgo genera preguntas sobre lo idoneo de las evaluaciones convencionales del riesgo de extincion con base en el tamano estatico de extension geografica (p. ej.: la Lista Roja de la UICN). Se pronostica que el cambio climatico afectara los patrones de las fluctuaciones de recursos en casi todo el hemisferio sur, donde el nomadismo es la forma dominante de movimiento de animales, asi que es critico que comencemos a entender las consecuencias de esto para tener una evaluacion certera del riesgo de extincion de especies nomadas. Nuestra estrategia proporciona una herramienta para descubrir las dinamicas espaciales de especies con movilidad alta y puede usarse para liberar informacion valiosa para una mejor evaluacion de riesgo de extincion y planeacion de la conservacion.
